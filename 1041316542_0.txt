[0:23:44] breakpointt_: maps are constant time lookups
[0:23:48] gd_nh_r: use c++
[0:23:50] LtCol_Carter: I feel like time optimisation shouldn't be a huge worry
[0:23:59] LordDynom: An array with pairs if you cannot optimize access patterns
[0:24:07] danielmoralestv: yeah some kind of tree would work for million iterations
[0:24:09] Cyberwire69: can you multithread it?
[0:24:13] philipkatis: 50 elements are not so many, so an array should be fine.
[0:24:15] RomeroCesar: can i type now?
[0:24:17] LtCol_Carter: I guess in the future it would be nicer
[0:24:41] ForgottenTime: Can you iterate from the top and bottom of the dictionary at the same time? It would double the speed
[0:24:42] Korta__: Iteration won't be an issue big
[0:24:50] ToneBacas: yes
[0:24:56] ToneBacas: depends on the type of access you want to do
[0:25:02] Rangetuur: linked list could work i think
[0:25:02] FingerGames: future waffle problems KEKW
[0:25:05] QuesoBad0nga: prob the best solution would be to combine data structures
[0:25:06] LtCol_Carter: https://wiki.python.org/moin/TimeComplexity
[0:25:11] AtchTwoOh: this is laughable parallel workload, don't worry about it
[0:25:14] n8level: you can time it and compare
[0:25:19] gd_nh_r: per second?
[0:25:22] TheBeavsterM: Test both and see
[0:25:26] ToneBacas: arrays are faster, but since this is python you might not reap the performance of arrays
[0:25:33] Winner5001: you alsohave to think about cpu cache, and locality
[0:25:41] RomeroCesar: but those runs are independent so it's an embarasingly parallel problem, so you don't need to worry about that iteration time of a single run that much
[0:25:44] LtCol_Carter: List and Dictionary for iteration seem to only be O(n)

[0:26:53] Cyberwire69: using GPU should snap thru millions in no time
[0:27:05] gd_nh_r: I'd think a few millions per second should be fine. Python is not performant in general. people use c++ extentions to do high performance computations.
[0:27:06] RomeroCesar: how do you define a single bet?
[0:27:07] LtCol_Carter: I don't think Python is the right language to use if you want to parallelise so no point complicating it

[0:28:42] ToneBacas: so it's match <var_name> : case <value>:
[0:28:45] mindfreak_90: @Giantwaffle hey. did u stream with fitz or am i remembering it badly?
[0:28:50] ToneBacas: yeah looks similar
[0:28:54] hokage8900: Could use a hasmap/dictionary where the keys are ints instead, which are faster to compare, so searching is faster, OR, make a structure that contains several dictionaries, where the keys are  player names, and the value is their bet in that current field
[0:29:14] 4729_zex: switch case?
[0:29:29] LtCol_Carter: What's the advantage of pattern matching in Python?
[0:29:34] Keebler6: Why wouldn’t python have switch statements
[0:29:41] Chronoes: switch case is outdated, pattern matching is the better version
[0:29:43] nxusr: @ltcol_carter more concise code
[0:29:52] LtCol_Carter: Ah fair, that's what I was assuming
[0:29:57] ToneBacas: i'm sure this doesn't work quite the same as a switch on other languages, but you can make it have a similar behavior for your purposes
[0:29:59] Chronoes: Switch cases were decided against by the main developer of Python
[0:30:11] YoungExec: Happy anniversary!
[0:30:14] 4729_zex: it depends on what you are programming
[0:30:15] philipkatis: It's the opposite
[0:30:16] Tabakhase: "faster" does not matter in 99.9% of the cases
[0:30:19] HistericalLive: @loco__ Thanks for the gifted sub!
[0:30:23] ToneBacas: depends on the compiler, depends on the language

[0:30:32] Sayiber: Gratz on the 8 years <#
[0:30:32] its__fil: a switch is not equivalent to a bunch of if-else, it should be better for a large number of conditions
[0:30:33] Keebler6: Depends on compiler
[0:30:36] Yemtron: optimization isn't always the biggest concern, :)
[0:30:46] RomeroCesar: by do you mean by "programming efficiency"
[0:30:53] LtCol_Carter: Python is slowwwwwwwww
[0:30:55] Pekter: compilers and shortcircuits at low level is what is at
[0:30:56] philipkatis: It's really slow.
[0:31:02] AtchTwoOh: will we be watching the stuff made here x lockpickinglawyer video together live?
[0:31:05] BurnToBurn: it many depends on the number of statements. more statements case is more effective
[0:31:11] Kevincav: Most style guides tell you to always use of statements
[0:31:12] realkingphilippe: Imagine programming in python and not go
[0:31:13] HistericalLive: Lazy programmers are the best programmers
[0:31:15] peetur_: I failed a technical test after passing all test cases but not writing the most optimised code for the submission.
[0:31:17] omar_i_: true SeemsGood
[0:31:21] Syrun3: PepLaugh lazy programmers
[0:31:23] hokage8900: make squiggly red line go away
[0:31:25] 4729_zex: short cuts are very bad though
[0:31:30] RomeroCesar: it was literally designed to be easy to learn and use, so yeah performance wasn't a priority when designing python
[0:31:31] Keebler6: C++ for the win
[0:31:34] its__fil: The culture around programming has become to use the first available thing you find rather than write sane code yourself
[0:31:34] ZyianDev: if you're doing python, 100% you don't care about optimizing memory
[0:31:40] ToneBacas: not enough memory? buy more RAM, right? -- lazy programmer
[0:31:44] Yemtron: if you are reading through any decently sized codebase, making something more readable tends to be of huge concern lol
[0:31:47] 4729_zex: there are lots of detail can be fucked up by using shortcuts
[0:31:49] Spirevipp: tell that to yandere dev KEKW
[0:31:51] AtchTwoOh: mostly, the compilers are amazing rn
[0:31:57] Otige: Happy 8  years Waffle
[0:32:01] Kevincav: I’m offended that you called me lazy, I might do something about it later, maybe next week or never… yeah I’m lazy
[0:32:03] mohshiin: joomFACE
[0:32:04] omar_i_: Ctrl C then Ctrl V
[0:32:12] Pekter: it depends on the sector and abstraction level of the code
[0:32:19] BoooFN: where do computers go when they get old? cirBox
[0:32:23] mohshiin: i cannot go back to sleep
[0:32:28] mohshiin: i have slept for 11 hours
[0:32:32] mohshiin: i will take it
[0:32:34] mohshiin: and run
[0:32:35] Pekter: but yeah, in general, the tendency its about devs time > performance
[0:32:46] RomeroCesar: so back to your data structure question: you want to iterate over all bets after a roll and pay al the players correct?
[0:32:55] ToneBacas: look at what Jonathan Blow is working. He's developing his own programming language called Jai, and it's nuts how fast it can compile code
[0:33:03] philipkatis: ^
[0:33:19] TheNeonian: In my opinion the laziness in only an issue in web development, where some websites are getting unecesserally slow
[0:33:20] KutuKoala: VS Code is free and better than pycharm i think
[0:33:28] gd_nh_r: old coding took too much time. Now's the time for fast prototyping. That's why interpreted languages like python and Js have such huge communities
[0:33:30] ZyianDev: It's already running
[0:33:31] 8ennie: What is Waffel programming?
[0:33:35] Chronoes: KEKW
[0:33:39] aur1so: KEKW
[0:33:53] skokpo: you can set up deployment from webstorm @Giantwaffle
[0:33:53] realkingphilippe: Vim is free and better than <insert generic name here>
[0:33:54] LordDynom: That's why you use Emacs, and have 1 for everything PepLaugh
[0:33:56] Tabakhase: its just html... just doubleclick the fucking file LULW
[0:34:09] shengdeluo: GoogleU Law YEP
[0:34:13] Flobu_: GoogleU ?
[0:34:26] xgalaxy: Use emacs then you won’t need an OS
[0:34:28] gd_nh_r: the only good thing about pycharm is that it allows remote interpreter for developing in vagrant / docker
[0:34:43] UltraScientism: the first statement is 100% correct, and then it goes downhill KEKW
[0:34:45] Greatking45: law graduate?? Since when lol
[0:34:48] KutuKoala: which server it is ? node.js ?

[1:22:26] LegoCoin: % cost will go up more becuase of profits. However homes wil go up morgage will not go up? Debt value goes down and easier to pay off in inflation.

[1:25:04] RodriCraft93: @QuesoBad0nga  dude wtf, im from Monteviideo
[1:25:05] Macari_: entry level you have to work for free in an internship. its so bs
[1:25:08] RomeroCesar: $50k is quite low for a software dev job in the US actually
[1:25:09] mephisto__ttv: entry level with 3 years of experience? thats normal
[1:25:11] sankhazo: jesus I make like 20k and consider myself living comfortably, living in USA is expensive

[1:25:46] Robohornet: @Nepli Depends on the city really. 20min gets you outside of most midwestern cities, not so much for the really large cities
[1:25:48] wontruefree: I thought about moving to Austin 4 years ago but moved closer to family instead. Kind of feel like I missed the boat
[1:25:50] Nexhunter: well you can spend some time doing OSS contributions and it accounts towards it if they are major projects @Giantwaffle
[1:25:51] bxttholebanger: Its an entry level position and we want minimum 2 years experience and we are will paying 13.25 an hour. :)
[1:25:51] slayerman_x: they just say entry level because they want to pay less for really a semi-experienced person.

[1:25:55] kisudawisu: "experience" in software is interesting becuase i feel like projects and things that youve done solo could count for that
[1:25:56] whittlz: Degree is scam in programmer world :(

[1:26:32] Acealmighty16: 8 years is a long time
[1:26:32] NlCKOLAI: Galacticraft as a throwback for 8 years celebration?

[1:28:25] Nepli: @Robohornet yeah, now that makes sense, I own an apartment in a suburb where I'm from and it's around 100k, a small but fairly normal apartment
[1:28:31] wontruefree: Feels like electron has taken over the GUI wars these days
[1:28:37] RomeroCesar: I think electron is the way to go

[1:30:08] whittlz: I'd say for you case, learning QT would not be worth learning
[1:30:12] Dspangs: @thecoopj same lol!

[1:32:08] RomeroCesar: well very few people make native GUIs anymore, so most people use web
[1:32:14] Chronoes: why would you do millons of simulations on a website? You'll be doing it in the background process
[1:32:14] OneLickAway: gpu acceleration is a thing
[1:32:19] ZyianDev: yes, but Waffle I think you're concerning yourself with optimizing way too much
[1:32:20] Pekter: falsh is deprecated
[1:32:20] Nexhunter: also you can just do offloading
[1:32:30] MasterKraft: @Giantwaffle congrats on 8 years, not sure when i started watching but its been a while
[1:32:31] TheVeeker: @Pekter Flask
[1:32:36] even__odds: Native GUI are dead. It’s all web now
[1:32:46] randyf69: Program it as a shader in Unity.
[1:32:46] Nexhunter: yea
[1:32:46] Pekter: yep
[1:32:47] ZyianDev: yes
[1:32:47] Nexhunter: pretty much
[1:32:48] Chronoes: For the most part
[1:32:49] Kroggie: theres a backend and a frontend so use what is best suited for your needs on either end
[1:32:53] RomeroCesar: that's a better way to think about it
[1:32:59] Nexhunter: so like you can build an electron app that is your desktop UI and communicates through bindings to a C program that can run your code @Giantwaffle
[1:33:04] Tabakhase: yes, but also absolutely not LUL
[1:33:04] Itachi_Siller: @MasterKraft Sep. 2013
[1:33:04] dompa93: yes
[1:33:05] Apparentthreat: yes
[1:33:06] Chronoes: @Giantwaffle VSCode uses Electron, which is basically a web browser
[1:33:07] TheNeonian: For sure
[1:33:08] Pekter: yes
[1:33:09] poiple_: yes\
[1:33:13] Apparentthreat: A lot of enterprise software is like that
[1:33:13] Nexhunter: it is all about bindings
[1:33:16] DaGMC: yeah once you've used HTML and stuff, GUI feels kinda boilerplate
[1:33:19] Apparentthreat: at least from what I've seen
[1:33:20] MadTechnoGamer: I was here for your 21st birthday. Glad to see you are still streaming @Giantwaffle
[1:33:21] TheVeeker: Should have learned JS Kappa
[1:33:24] MasterKraft: @Itachi_Siller really?  ha ha, time flies
[1:33:25] Askjong: yes, because native gui's often break after a update
[1:33:27] Nexhunter: Electron is javascfript yes
[1:33:28] FoxxyDingo: it also depends on what part of the industry you are going into, I work for a steel industry and to interface with the machines, we build our gui;s through c#, some of them are javascript but never python since its too slow for the outputs
[1:33:28] Chronoes: that's what Electron is
[1:33:31] ZyianDev: Yes Electron is javascript
[1:33:35] Ushahin1: Web is easiest way to get cross-platform support
[1:33:35] n8level: web front end, disgusting but portable
[1:33:40] Tabakhase: js only ever generates something else - html in this case
[1:33:41] Nexhunter: but you use bindings to communicate to lower level languages
[1:33:42] Pekter: Kappa
[1:33:49] Sacratoy: You'll never make a native gui in python
[1:33:49] Myekos: if you build a program you have to distribute it.  If you build a web utility, everyone can get to it
[1:33:55] nxusr: yeah electron is basically a web page pretending to be a native app
[1:34:01] Itachi_Siller: @MasterKraft right, yea thats atleast when you started following
[1:34:02] dpkoz: if you want to do web stuff you should learn javascript
[1:34:03] Nexhunter: like python has bindings to C level   of code
[1:34:05] RomeroCesar: so discord and vs code and slack are popular examples of electron apps
[1:34:05] CocoScruff: i don't understand why everyone hates JS - i love JS LUL but that's what i first learned to program in
[1:34:07] OneLickAway: all roads lead back to java
[1:34:14] Nexhunter: javascript through node has the same capability of bindings to low level languages
[1:34:19] MadTechnoGamer: MadTechnoGamer subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months, currently on a 1 month streak! 
[1:34:24] RomeroCesar: definitely not tkitner
[1:34:29] Nexhunter: also a lot of game UIs are written in html/css/js timmacLAUGH
[1:34:31] Ebonmourn: want lots of people to use it and easy to access... then yah you should be making it a web app of some sort
[1:34:39] n8level: if you're just graphing, matplotlib is fine but its not super responsive
[1:34:39] QwyIl: Time to learn about websockets :D
[1:34:44] Chronoes: @CocoScruff I don't hate it but vanilla JS is pretty bad

[1:34:52] Chronoes: GUI is also front-end development KEKW
[1:34:53] Macari_: outsource

[1:35:57] killerpaul: problem with that is the client only has $200
[1:36:06] kinggollum: HeyGuys
[1:36:13] Nexhunter: well yes you should be moving to kotlin for android and swift for ios
[1:36:18] FoxxyDingo: eh, kotlin, java, c++, c#
[1:36:21] wooodiii: yes <3
[1:36:26] Apparentthreat: @Giantwaffle just get into cybersecurity. minimal programming Kappa
[1:36:31] Dazakii: the "new way" changes every 12 months though
[1:36:35] JordyOnTheForge: dont you need to make second end chest?
[1:36:35] Chronoes: C++ isn't going anywhere anytime soon
[1:36:37] Ebonmourn: Yah with python if you need a simple gui that tkinter is good enough for.. if your making something more complex then that.. then why the hell are you making a gui in python @Giantwaffle
[1:36:37] Nexhunter: if you're doing games and that you do need c++ and that KEKW
[1:36:48] fafuja: c++ is not going to die man
[1:36:49] Sacratoy: Something is always becoming old and there's always new stuff
[1:36:50] Pekter: carefull with that, hype dies rly fast in this sector
[1:36:50] keittehvan: massive SOAP WSDL services are the bomb!
[1:36:54] JohnBohnn: c++ is here for the foreseeable future for sure
[1:36:54] RomeroCesar: you're oversimplifying it quite a bit :)
[1:36:59] Nexhunter: @Giantwaffle for phone games
[1:37:04] arcticae: python is not a newer c++. dunno if you meant to imply that
[1:37:05] poiple_: @keittehvan monkaS
[1:37:12] winnerab: python is realy meant for scripting, not games, applications and stuff
[1:37:12] oberetta: each diff tools for diff purposes
[1:37:14] Nexhunter: @keittehvan go to hell KEKW
[1:37:17] FoxxyDingo: if you want, you can learn the xamarin framework. pretty powerful for mobile development
[1:37:22] PinkNynxz: @Giantwaffle did u see unreal engine 5 preview?
[1:37:24] JacobSolo: You can just JS to build anything nowadays. Desktop native apps (electron/tauri), ios / android apps (react native), and web apps
[1:37:24] Nexhunter: @keittehvan SOAP and WSDL was actual stupidity timmacLAUGH
[1:37:26] sogerr: c# is for indie/small games, big games that needs optimizations are done with c++
[1:37:26] Pekter: python just had 30th anyversary KEKW
[1:37:27] wooodiii: java == kotlin (just more convinient)
[1:37:32] DynamixBoon: if it was me, I'd use python to create restful services, then whatever for ui
[1:37:34] Sacratoy: I can only recommend learning C#
[1:37:34] keittehvan: @Nexhunter ikr
[1:37:44] SmartDoll: @Nexhunter many phone games still use unity with c#
[1:37:44] Nexhunter: yea like swift is objective c but just modernized @wooodiii
[1:37:52] Nexhunter: @SmartDoll do they have export bindings for that
[1:37:55] nxusr: @giantwaffle with all this career talk, sent you a dm about programmes for breaking into the industry :)
[1:37:57] dyedquartz: I don't want to meme, but what about rust? (but then again, most people would say "but what about <their language of preference>")
[1:37:59] nxusr: on discord
[1:37:59] dpkoz: @Nexhunter we still use old school asp .asmx files at my work :D
[1:38:01] Nexhunter: shit that good for devs KEKW @SmartDoll
[1:38:08] arcticae: kotlin, rust, nodejs
[1:38:12] Nexhunter: fuck rust yo
[1:38:13] BeastboySAW: Holy God.  Just watched a 30 sec pre roll commercial from Tampax. Does Twitch not know who watches this stuff?
[1:38:15] espi: a python is just a thicc snake
[1:38:22] Nexhunter: and fuck python devs using rust part of the wheel building process
[1:38:22] Pekter: rust is opping off
[1:38:28] SmartDoll: @Nexhunter they use il2cpp from unity
[1:38:41] kkisame2: @Giantwaffle did you know that Sudan actually has more pyramids than Egypt
[1:38:44] RomeroCesar: @BeastboySAW lmao twitch turbo to get rid of all ads
[1:38:45] oberetta: meanwhile there is big money in COBOL...everyone who knows it is retiring
[1:38:58] Sacratoy: There's still big money in Java
[1:39:08] Pekter: who likes manteniece LUL
[1:39:09] wooodiii: @Nexhunter exactly
[1:39:10] Apparentthreat: As someone w/ a CS degree, talking about these languages and libraries but not knowing how to use them makes me feel like an imposter but then I realize I'm in cybersecurity and it just doesn't matter YEP
[1:39:11] Nexhunter: fucking COBOL is rich ass mofos working for the government
[1:39:17] fafuja: want to learn what will be necessary in the future? I would recommend learning FPGAs
[1:39:29] JBourden: artisan code KEKW
[1:39:31] fafuja: FPGAs / RISC-v
[1:39:33] agefraakra: !followage
[1:39:33] Moobot: To get how long you have followed, just click your name in chat on PC.
[1:39:36] dpkoz: banks and govt institutions and other real old big companies use COBOL still
[1:39:37] whittlz: Pilots too right?
[1:39:39] Nexhunter: no one wants to learn mainframe architectural designs either but mainframes are not going away
[1:39:47] JacobSolo: fintech so much COBOL
[1:39:50] RadioactiveDJ: RadioactiveDJ subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 34 months! 
[1:39:53] DaGMC: COBOL are usually systems from the last millenia
[1:39:57] artykQBR: I work with cobol and I'm not rich LUL
[1:40:00] wooodiii: good old fintech systems
[1:40:06] Nexhunter: @rtykQBR you should negotiate better KEKW

[1:40:24] agefraakra: when did you start streaming
[1:40:25] oberetta: yeah, COBOL in massive bank systems.  but no one wants to spend billions ripping them out so need to pay upkeep
[1:40:28] SmartDoll: many banks actually use cobol
[1:40:33] BeastboySAW: I know FORTRAN and COBOL.  Job?
[1:40:40] BoooFN: klinkBlush no thank you, mr waffle

[1:40:55] MyNameIsTobii: Just du some upgraded magmatic engines with an ender tank and pump.
[1:40:59] gunnieh: not cheaper in the long run no, but now
[1:41:09] rabarberslafs: It's probably not cheaper, but if you mention "Downtime" Then a lot of suits becomes rather uncomfortable.
[1:41:09] RomeroCesar: it's not cheaper nor better, they're just dumb people making bad decisions and being afraid of the future
[1:41:12] wooodiii: cheaper in short/mid term
[1:41:14] Pekter: meanwhile in HFT, they use the shiny tech LUL
[1:41:14] Sacratoy: It's safer to maintain it.
[1:41:20] Macari_: the us dollar has been crashing for centuries now tho

[1:41:33] FoxxyDingo: its old people running an industry they dont understand
[1:41:40] oberetta: its cheaper long run too...wait for truly transformational tech that will eventually replace
[1:41:52] espi: @J13Jonas a week? a month?
[1:42:00] oberetta: cheaper to naturally transition than billions on direct replacement
[1:42:03] Pekter: a year Kappa

[1:43:12] Tapeman83: just wait until you start working with fluids
[1:43:19] BONBONNIE13: I'm REALLY hoping Starbase doesn't suck. Star Shitizen, No Man's Buy, and Cyberbunk2077 thought me not to get my hopes up, even if I think "how could they ever fuck this up?"
[1:43:21] fafuja: I think so yeah
[1:43:30] ByakurenHoujuu: The new terraforming change for Valheim is ass LUL

[1:44:00] ravi981: one ´building update is coming, but don´t know when @Giantwaffle
[1:44:01] nxusr: @BONBONNIE13 the names had me laughing
[1:44:06] Chronoes: @LordDynom right, but it had colossal hype that never delivered
[1:44:08] kyanpeppaa: the game pretty rough from the footage that was shared from some testers, hope some stuff happenin until then
[1:44:10] gartoks: In contrast to Cyberpunk Starbase has been playable for months in alpha

[1:44:40] RodriCraft93: about 1 month of clearing water
[1:44:44] BONBONNIE13: Yes, I've tried No Man's Sky recently. It's better than when it was released, but I find it weird that their "best" update was base-building, in a game where you have to constantly go to different planets. @BlainL
[1:44:49] luke_exp: luke_exp subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 5 months!

[3:10:37] Holy_Frakula: The base design is lookin pretty cool mah dude
[3:10:48] shengdeluo: do you think a subnautica type modpack in Minecraft would be pog? @giantwaffle
[3:11:37] Venxuri: there is a skyblock but in water
[3:11:48] xfrozev2: seaopolis
[3:11:50] W84M3: guess it already exists xD
[3:11:52] kyanpeppaa: yee thats called seaopolis, but dont buy modules but make em
[3:11:52] BrokenBlade15: Oceans outlast tried to do that but its meh
[3:12:05] BrokenBlade15: Cool pack but the water part is lack luster

[3:12:05] TheIrishGuy: in a sub and had to craft repairs to resurface
[3:12:09] officialhunterx: are you watching with audio on
[3:12:10] JordyOnTheForge: rustic waters did that
[3:12:20] jay7tx: @Giantwaffle check out Rustic waters
[3:12:20] botten401: botten401 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 21 months! 
[3:12:22] shengdeluo: that'd be pretty cool
[3:12:27] Skykkuno: That is seapolis mod pack
[3:12:33] AsHackDM: AsHackDM subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 31 months, currently on a 31 month streak! Nice
[3:12:39] jay7tx: seapolis and rustic waters are the closest
[3:12:42] BruisedCranium56: ya Rustic waters did that
[3:12:47] n8level: @Skykkuno well, you start at the surface
[3:12:55] NodBabe: @Giantwaffle I've never played Subnautica. Is it worth $19.99?
[3:12:56] Aaaea: How would you breathe
[3:13:03] ItsOnMax: and ruins would be cool. Like "old bases other people tried"  Fictional of course
[3:13:13] shengdeluo: this modpack seems way cooler tho, i love the automation hustle
[3:13:38] Chyromyr: Seaopolis is just skyblock but more annoying. There's very little reason to explore past the early game.
[3:14:11] madseed15: KEKW
[3:14:25] BaTu016: pepeLaugh
[3:14:29] W84M3: go to overworld and search for chests
[3:14:32] BaTu016: he doesnt know widePepeLaugh
[3:14:32] diverse114: you can find the cores in chest as loot
[3:14:39] shengdeluo: 4 omnidollars KEKW
[3:14:39] W84M3: there are drill cores spread in the city
[3:14:53] sneakyHoovy: PepLaugh
[3:14:55] AsHackDM: @Giantwaffle  what mod did you used on dyson program to copy paste ?
[3:14:56] madseed15: finally some chest hunting
[3:15:01] kyanpeppaa: can be purchased with coins too if you dont want to do chest
[3:15:14] madseed15: PogChamp
[3:15:21] W84M3: there's actually one very close to the cake road in this seed :D
[3:15:26] AsHackDM: PogChamp
[3:15:29] Tabakhase: DSP update reads PogChamp indeed
[3:15:36] shengdeluo: getting some new tools would be cool, having 4+ hammers in inventory is just a waste of space at this point
[3:15:39] killerpaul: he's already stated that he doesn't want to use the lost cities chests
[3:15:51] shengdeluo: and a waste of resources
[3:16:04] JustPepeDontBeMad: Gauntlet Duelist and Witch category gonna be stacked. Some categories wont be as "hard" to do well in (ie top 100s) but still monkaS
[3:16:18] masztufa: steam gem?
[3:16:20] madseed15: more hammer
[3:16:38] shengdeluo: @killerpaul yeah, but the item description itself says there are only 2 ways, omnidollars or looking for it in the lost cities. so i guess that's not cheating per se
[3:16:45] MeatAlphq: Waffle What's your favorite alcohol
[3:17:01] JustPepeDontBeMad: As SC noob i'll be happy if i survive to maps
[3:17:08] DatoPotatoDato: do u plan on hosting a minecraft server in 1.17 or 1.18?
[3:17:40] shengdeluo: Aaron earned an iron urn
[3:17:41] Hyodo_P: Have you checked "Ender Hook"? It's like an infinite ender pearl with no damage. Perfect for moving.
[3:18:04] The_Holas: he said it Kappa
[3:18:16] JustPepeDontBeMad: Kitava with 70% inc AOE slams and explosions, Merveil having bigger tornados... we gonna die alot
[3:18:49] DatoPotatoDato: whats create?
[3:18:55] Doomwyte: SRS necro and just run like a chicken with your head cut off

[4:06:37] Xxatlas5xx: I would say a good calculation for it would be the arms race. Take all of the nuclear weapons produced by the US and USSR at the time and scale that to the payloads it can manage. Obviously rough, but thats definitely a good example of mass rocket production
[4:06:47] DaGMC: have you heard about the inflatable space modules

[4:13:51] DaGMC: yes use snake case
[4:13:51] AtchTwoOh: look at the google style guides
[4:13:53] ruccoa: python uses snake_case
[4:13:57] Akiron_rafa: YEP snakecase
[4:13:58] Tabakhase: 🐍 > 🐪 KEKW
[4:13:58] nxusr: snake_case unless it's a class name, in which case you use CamelCase
[4:14:00] dogma802: So there's snake case and camel case; which style you use is entirely dependent on the company you work at
[4:14:00] DatoPotatoDato: i mean u can but in python i typically use function_name
[4:14:05] krakkus_nl: your supposed to do what works for you!
[4:14:05] Chronoes: Classes are TitleCase
[4:14:08] Apparentthreat: it doesn't matter. it's "best practice" no?
[4:14:09] Akiron_rafa: only classes uses cammel case
[4:14:14] DaGMC: for functions, methods and properties
[4:14:18] b0ltz12: that is personal preference to some degree, I think you can change those settings in your preferences
[4:14:28] blackholebums: blackholebums subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 28 months, currently on a 20 month streak! hi dad pog

[4:14:40] Flobu_: normally i use PascalCase
[4:14:50] nxusr: yes
[4:15:00] Chronoes: snake_case, like your function anmes
[4:15:02] Chronoes: names*
[4:15:02] kheeler: It's like tabs vs spaces ... use whatever you want.
[4:15:04] Akiron_rafa: yeah thats snake case
[4:15:08] n8level: best coding practices - follow the standards
[4:15:10] AtchTwoOh: it depends on the style guide you choose, the main one for python is Google's one (https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html)
[4:15:11] Kuroiorb: !permit @braaedy
[4:15:11] Moobot: @braaedy will not get timed out for the next 3m (@Kuroiorb)
[4:15:13] IamWambo_: it doesnt really matter just preference
[4:15:17] braaedy: @Giantwaffle Here's the official style guide: https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/
[4:15:19] b0ltz12: @Giantwaffle that can be changed in settings I think.
[4:15:20] dogma802: The IDE probably tries to enforce style; there might be an IDE setting somewhere; I normally just use a text edidtor
[4:15:22] macdrai: @Apparentthreat yeah but your manager is using linter to score your code qualify, so you better follow the best practices if you want a juicy pay rise
[4:15:24] Akiron_rafa: only classes name uses Camel Cases
[4:15:27] Tabakhase: "fine" is relative...
[4:15:28] nxusr: no, I would use snake_case everywhere except class names
[4:15:33] Chronoes: everything besides classes are snake_case. Classes are TitleCase. but it's mostly a standard, not requirement
[4:15:36] MasterKraft: I know in visual studio you can customize those warnings
[4:15:38] Aaaea: Fix line 27 it's saying rollotal
[4:15:43] Ajut: depends how your linter works

[4:15:55] DaGMC: never mix them

[4:16:28] F31ixG01d3n: you can change styling guide rules to suit your preferences
[4:16:36] AsHackDM: blank is good
[4:16:39] Apparentthreat: fuck up tab spacing in yaml and you're gonna have a bad time
[4:16:39] Akiron_rafa: just use black, he will format it
[4:16:41] tioberto: there is one of these to Java as well, Java Code Convention lol
[4:16:52] Mrfla14: Why if you save a def with capitals as a string would bug when you use that def in a class or as function. Something wrong maybe with that word that wakes up in runtime
[4:16:53] F31ixG01d3n: yellow is warning, red is non compilable
[4:17:01] DatoPotatoDato: KEKW
[4:17:02] DaGMC: for readability
[4:17:04] Chronoes: it helps readability
[4:17:06] ZyianDev: spacing in braces is nice
[4:17:09] braaedy: That's C++ single line constructor style
[4:17:25] AsHackDM: yep easy to find
[4:17:39] ZyianDev: Go also has similar stylings, there's a built in tool to format for you

[4:17:58] n8level: I cant read this, where are my glasses SeriousSloth
[4:18:18] dogma802: Only use all uppercase for constants
[4:18:19] tioberto: generally yeah
[4:18:21] Chronoes: constants are all caps usually yes
[4:18:29] DatoPotatoDato: yeah all upper case is normally constants
[4:18:39] Wasabi76: const is traditionally CAPS in all languages
[4:18:46] AsHackDM: this is do not touch
[4:18:47] tioberto: you can use those for constants as well, when name is a bit longer
[4:19:05] Mrfla14: Thats a personal choice
[4:19:07] tioberto: if you do it, yhou deserve to DIE
[4:19:08] ZyianDev: even in JS you don't do that
[4:19:09] Chronoes: no, JS devs don't do that KEKW
[4:19:11] camelJon: Thats java not js
[4:19:16] Akiron_rafa: wo does that WutFace
[4:19:17] DaGMC: No one would do this in JS
[4:19:19] PureSpider: neither JS nor java do that, wtf
[4:19:23] K3ll06s: what is the sudden js hate FeelsOffendedMan
[4:19:23] DatoPotatoDato: KEKW
[4:19:24] MasterKraft: you would know, been programming for months now Kappa
[4:19:26] tioberto: KEKW
[4:19:26] Chronoes: thanks I guess
[4:19:30] Mrfla14: What if my personal choice would be replace all strings into integers with my paper sheet
[4:19:35] Tabakhase: its stops being a "personal choice" is other people have to suffer from you doing it sumW
[4:19:37] PureSpider: never used JS, talking shit about it bamKEK
[4:19:41] BobPatience: just use a proper font cohhSip

[4:19:54] Anguppi: n
[4:19:54] n8level: n
[4:19:55] dogma802: I only use i for loop indexes
[4:19:57] AsHackDM: i use a
[4:19:57] 0x000000: a b o x i j k
[4:19:58] m3lm4n: look at this guy, barely dipped his toes in programming already elitist as shit
[4:19:59] DrHax_: What Do You Mean? Capitalizing Every Word In English Is Fine KEKW rooSuffer
[4:20:00] DaGMC: i for index or 2 dimensional x,y
[4:20:01] tioberto: w for whatever
[4:20:02] tioberto: LOL
[4:20:04] DatoPotatoDato: i remember learning JS for my first language i was so happy moving to python right after
[4:20:05] ZestyJellies: x or n
[4:20:07] ruccoa: i,j,k,u,v,x,w,y,z
[4:20:07] Wasabi76: i is a for loop :O
[4:20:10] Ajut: i, j, m , n
[4:20:11] dylan0806: X
[4:20:12] Apparentthreat: temp1, temp2, temp3 pepeLaugh
[4:20:13] q__o: for x in whatever:...
[4:20:15] Ajut: mathematics stuff at least
[4:20:17] Apparentthreat: they're never temp
[4:20:18] Akiron_rafa: if you intend to work with someone ele, its not a matherof personal preference
[4:20:23] JustPepeDontBeMad: integer is i, s for string, n for looping and x for others
[4:20:24] kommendorfindus: I will always loop from kek to topkek
[4:20:25] DatoPotatoDato: i for iterrable and n or x for anything else
[4:20:29] DaGMC: this are generics
[4:20:31] dylan0806: I,j,x,y,z
[4:20:33] n8level: @Apparentthreat NotLikeThis
[4:20:38] Chronoes: it's for the optional typing
[4:20:38] tuxwonder7: I prefer using item, obj, etc. Single letter variables are harder to follow in denser code
[4:20:43] Tabakhase: things of things 5Head
[4:20:45] K3ll06s: TypeScript wants to have a word Kappa
[4:20:48] DaGMC: or kinda generics
[4:20:54] ZyianDev: Making your own types is very common in strictly typed languages
[4:21:07] SeeAGamer: Yes
[4:21:07] Wasabi76: struct ?
[4:21:18] SeeAGamer: It's soft, 3.10 can force.
[4:21:24] PureSpider: generics, so neat lewSmile
[4:21:31] Akiron_rafa: YEP python 3.X
[4:21:38] SeeAGamer: Before 3.10, it was for linting and IDEs to provide hints.
[4:21:47] mechoriet: ctrl+alt+L EZ
[4:21:48] DatoPotatoDato: u can declare a list with a specific datatype in python?
[4:21:52] DaGMC: I like the typization of python, it so nice
[4:22:12] DaGMC: much better than before
[4:22:27] LaroStar007: Hey Waffle! What is your coding setup? (Software, ...)
[4:22:35] DaGMC: @DatoPotatoGames yes
[4:22:41] mechoriet: KEKW never
[4:22:47] JustPepeDontBeMad: "code should be written in a way that if any other developer read it they could understand it" my code: print"fuck1", print"fuck2",...
[4:22:55] fralys: What a wonderfull beard Mr Waffle
[4:23:10] shengdeluo: that was for a faulty crafting recipe @giantwaffle
[4:23:11] DatoPotatoDato: @DaGMC never knew that tbh thanks
[4:23:14] Wasabi76: learn C and leave that python to the script kids
[4:23:15] kingLordsy: yes KEKW
[4:23:15] tuxwonder7: Most of the time, yes
[4:23:15] Apparentthreat: @Giantwaffle click that LAN option
[4:23:16] SeeAGamer: Yes, especially on large logs.
[4:23:16] TraxiRage: Console.log('afsdashfasklh')
[4:23:16] IveBeenWandering: print "1"
[4:23:18] TraxiRage: Exactly.
[4:23:19] Tabakhase: dont put console commands... learn breakpoints and stepping waffleAngry
[4:23:23] DatoPotatoDato: yep KEKW
[4:23:23] Tes2K: the "aaaa"
[4:23:24] camelJon: "I got to here!"
[4:23:25] Chronoes: If I'm frustrated with an unknown issue, I just type "wtf"
[4:23:26] b0ltz12: ye
[4:23:29] 0x000000: debugging with print KEKW
[4:23:29] LtCol_Carter: I always end up with "fuck"
[4:23:33] Akiron_rafa: I prefer not to use print if possible
[4:23:33] tuxwonder7: Yep KEKW
[4:23:34] DatoPotatoDato: print("please work")
[4:23:34] Gelil: No, put in what you are monitoring and what you have in the variable
[4:23:35] LaroStar007: @Giantwaffle What is your coding setup? (Software, ...)
[4:23:35] PureSpider: i usually print the var i care about...
[4:23:38] DaGMC: @DatoPotatoGames It was added in the recent 3.X releases
[4:23:39] drTNT_: My test word is normally just "yeet"
[4:23:40] LtCol_Carter: Single
[4:23:42] TraxiRage: Depends on the language
[4:23:42] Pain_cuit: ' ' ftw
[4:23:45] PureSpider: depends, they do different things
[4:23:45] Chronoes: language-dependent, but usually single
[4:23:46] AtchTwoOh: single for char's, double for strings
[4:23:47] Apparentthreat: have fun using JSON dummy
[4:23:48] Droth_: print('DEVS ARE SHIT')
[4:23:50] kingLordsy: " " is string ' ' is character
[4:23:51] TraxiRage: C# = "", Typescript = ''
[4:23:52] Mordenak: Depends on the language and what you're doing with the string.
[4:23:53] F31ixG01d3n: cuss into console LUL
[4:23:53] Gelil: ``` ```
[4:23:54] Chronoes: It sure does
[4:23:56] Tabakhase: def not 100% wrong
[4:24:01] ruccoa: i mix and match because I am stupid
[4:24:02] PureSpider: in java, '' is for a char, "" is for a string
[4:24:03] funnyflywheel: in rust, you have to use double quotes
[4:24:04] TraxiRage: In C# the '' is character
[4:24:08] Seidee101: ' " " '
[4:24:09] Minelmonia: I usually do (#### I am here ####)
[4:24:10] IamWambo_: "This is the right way '
[4:24:10] ZOZE55: in JS you have to use both
[4:24:12] ZyianDev: In Go, single quotes is a character, double quotes are strings
[4:24:13] topgunnerccl: waffleH
[4:24:14] PeterZ_97: C# "", php what i want
[4:24:16] dompa93: " " string, ' ' for char
[4:24:18] Chronoes: for example, 'a' is a single char, "a" is a string of chars
[4:24:24] braaedy: No
[4:24:24] LtCol_Carter: No
[4:24:25] Chronoes: in C
[4:24:26] PureSpider: ZyianAzen same in java
[4:24:31] DatoPotatoDato: in python i used to use '' but after learning C# it forced me to go back to using "" because theyre different
[4:24:36] PureSpider: in java as well
[4:24:36] Wasabi76: `javascript ${variable} is eaiser`
[4:24:38] DaGMC: In C/Java
[4:24:40] MJagged: MJagged subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 22 months! 
[4:24:45] Gh0st1979: In C++ "" is for strings, ' ' for characters. So '    ' is really weird for a string to me
[4:24:53] PureSpider: ' ' is for single chars in many languages
[4:24:58] gartoks: 'a' is for single chars in C#
[4:25:03] DatoPotatoDato: '' is for a char datatype
[4:25:05] braaedy: @Giantwaffle HAve you ever used pdb? The debugger.
[4:25:06] TraxiRage: I gotta love how half of chat are programmers
[4:25:06] Gelil: "\'\n'\Hi, \"\(waffle.name)\"\n"
[4:25:07] PureSpider: bamKEK
[4:25:08] DaGMC: but not in python or JS

[4:25:39] Moobot: You can find Waffle's Youtube channel here - https://youtube.com/giantwaffle
[4:25:40] infucio: can I just take a moment to appreciate Waffle learning to code.
[4:25:42] ewerd21: you should learn assembly I just finished my computer architecture class
[4:25:43] Wasabi76: you are going to have to unlearn a lot of things from pyhton
[4:25:48] Ghost0447: @Giantwaffle finally started my trust section for my starship print! how is yours doing?
[4:25:48] BleedKappa: fake programmers though. @Giantwaffle They're a bunch of 3heads
[4:25:51] DrHax_: welp, as a non-programming pleb: peepoLeave
[4:25:53] TraxiRage: @ewerd21 Why would I want to hate myself?
[4:25:53] zippedfreak: !modpack
[4:25:53] Moobot: Waffle is playing Omnifactory. Check out the mod list at curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/omnifactory

[4:25:58] Apparentthreat: Gonna get me that nice referral bonus my company has YEP
[4:26:07] auzu_: after how youre gonna use us for free labor in starbase Kappa
[4:26:10] TheIrishGuy: @Giantwaffle  When do you think youll give up TWITCH
[4:26:14] DatoPotatoDato: thats honestly true
[4:26:18] Akiron_rafa: just make a good portfolio, and its not that hard to get one YEP
[4:26:20] RodriCraft93: you can hire chat as your testers :)
[4:26:20] m3lm4n: I was programming for 10 years now, thinking about doing something else :P we should switch kek
[4:26:21] Gh0st1979: you don't reinvent the wheel KEKW @Giantwaffle
[4:26:22] forsc1: you need to know what to copy though KEKW
[4:26:29] Tabakhase: stack is dead KEKW
[4:26:32] Chyromyr: On the one hand, you don't learn much that way. On the other, don't re-invent the wheel.
[4:26:36] braaedy: Just do it in discord
[4:26:36] LordMurv: Class system monkaS
[4:26:38] Gelil: "0" YEP
[4:26:39] LtCol_Carter: What if you only read Stack?
[4:26:41] AsHackDM: KEKW chat
[4:26:43] Tabakhase: i only have a serverfault score PauseChamp
[4:26:45] Tawmcruize1994: moon2HUH
[4:26:48] kheeler: Fake devs are generally easy to spot in PR reviews
[4:26:50] DaGMC: I stopped helping on stackoverflow years ago
[4:26:55] SeeAGamer: I manager Python coders, I don't post to Stackoverflow.
[4:26:57] Minelmonia: If StackOverflow does down, productivity would go down 80% globally
[4:27:02] JustPepeDontBeMad: We all fucked dudes MONKERS
[4:27:03] Wasabi76: how old is your github account bruh?
[4:27:04] Mordenak: pull request
[4:27:06] braaedy: Pull request
[4:27:10] PureSpider: PR is a pull request
[4:27:11] forsc1: pull request
[4:27:13] punkgeek: Pull request
[4:27:16] DaGMC: yeah cound PRs
[4:27:19] PureSpider: aka "merge request" on any proper platform YEP
[4:27:29] officialzip: pull request
[4:27:30] DrHax_: "way too many" okay KEKW
[4:27:40] ZyianDev: yes
[4:27:42] Apparentthreat: yeah
[4:27:43] Mordenak: Yep
[4:27:44] b0ltz12: ye
[4:27:45] 0x000000: yes
[4:27:45] tuxwonder7: Yes
[4:27:45] Tabakhase: asking for it
[4:27:46] TraxiRage: You have to pull if you want to push it
[4:27:48] PureSpider: github calls it pulls, so thats what it is
[4:27:50] Mordenak: They are pulling your changes
[4:27:50] Apparentthreat: pulling into main
[4:27:53] JustPepeDontBeMad: @Giantwaffle have you seen the game Going Medival? release tommorrow, looks like a medival rimworld
[4:27:56] punkgeek: Pull request is a commit with a bunch of changes. it's usually reviewed before being approved/merged
[4:27:57] Gelil: Might wanna learn git then Waffle, you will have a hard time until you do
[4:27:58] SeeAGamer: You are requesting the maintainer of the code to PULL your changes.
[4:27:58] LtCol_Carter: Push is your own, Pull it a request
[4:27:59] ZyianDev: You're asking for the upstream to pull your changes
[4:27:59] q__o: @Giantwaffle you request them to pull your shiit
[4:28:00] Chronoes: pull request (to main)
[4:28:00] DaGMC: My PRs were backuped into the Ice Archives LUL
[4:28:02] b0ltz12: but your requesting it to be reviewed such that if accepted it can be merged
[4:28:05] PureSpider: you're requesting them to pull it
[4:28:07] Tabakhase: its technically a merge-request
[4:28:18] Apparentthreat: you can pull into another branch too, yeah?
[4:28:19] braaedy: It's called a pull request because it IS a pull. A lot of people don't understand that git is distributed system.
[4:28:19] Wasabi76: just learn git... stop whatever else ya doing and spend few hours, is really easy honestly
[4:28:21] PureSpider: "merge request" is the right wording
[4:28:22] ZyianDev: you have a fork of the repo
[4:28:25] TheIrishGuy: yes a repository isnt final
[4:28:28] forsc1: i am going through a merge conflict right now KEKW
[4:28:29] camelJon: No, you create a copy of the repo and make changes on your fork.
[4:28:30] forsc1: in VIM
[4:28:37] punkgeek: You push your own branch, pull request is to pull the changes from your feature/change branch into a working branch
[4:28:39] PureSpider: forsc1 bamSick
[4:28:47] PureSpider: what punkgeek said
[4:28:52] SeeAGamer: If you are the maintainer, you can PUSH your code directly. However, as a maintainer, I want others to request me to PULL their changes into my Repo.
[4:28:56] Gelil: Depends on the type of repo that is being run. If you are running "git-flow", a PR is a change to the mainline branch.
[4:29:01] DaGMC: Usually you create an issue, create a fork of that project, create a fix and create a pull request with your changes
[4:29:02] Wasabi76: it's not, learn git
[4:29:09] braaedy: A fork is a repository in its own right. People just think of the original repository as the true repo
[4:29:16] Tabakhase: dont get hangup on pull/push there... got nothing todo with whats happening in the end rly
[4:29:23] Gelil: If you are running "trunk", a PR is a completed feature / capability / etc. ..
[4:29:35] TheIrishGuy: but its bad programming
[4:29:44] matdru: they can but they really shouldnt ( bad practise )
[4:29:50] forsc1: yes but you generally have multiple branch
[4:30:08] forsc1: yes, if it is live though
[4:30:11] tuxwonder7: ^
[4:30:11] braaedy: If it's being put out to people, yes it matters
[4:30:16] braaedy: Stability is important
[4:30:16] ZyianDev: it's good to have it somewhere else
[4:30:17] Wasabi76: yes it does
[4:30:19] DatoPotatoDato: have you ever watched techwithtim before?
[4:30:20] tuxwonder7: If you intend to make it public for employer's to see, yes
[4:30:20] Gelil: Yes, imagine having a different idea sets running at the same time
[4:30:23] matdru: you never know when people will join
[4:30:26] PureSpider: anyone wanna explain git flow to waffle? YEP
[4:30:32] Gelil: NOP
[4:30:33] Wasabi76: don't make that rookie mistake, learn git
[4:30:34] TheIrishGuy: yes and no like ig you push something that messing everyything and its can show you Git skills and Branchs and Version Control
[4:30:40] forsc1: learn github workflow
[4:30:40] PureSpider: yes
[4:30:41] ZyianDev: yes
[4:30:42] forsc1: yes
[4:30:42] braaedy: Ye
[4:30:42] m3lm4n: yup
[4:30:43] Mordenak: Yes
[4:30:44] Chronoes: that's what CI is usually for
[4:30:44] DaGMC: yes
[4:30:45] matdru: yes
[4:30:45] forsc1: git actions
[4:30:47] PureSpider: github actions
[4:30:48] Gelil: Yes, Github Actions
[4:30:48] matdru: CI
[4:30:48] camelJon: github has hooks you can use
[4:30:52] Tabakhase: github pages even hosts that for free
[4:30:54] JustPepeDontBeMad: YEP
[4:30:54] macdrai: yeah, called github actions
[4:30:54] tuxwonder7: Jenkins, github actions, etc
[4:30:57] Wasabi76: deploy?
[4:30:59] Tabakhase: but youc an deploy to anything rly
[4:31:02] PureSpider: gitlab ci, github actions, bitbucket pipelines - they all have it
[4:31:04] matdru: netlify with 3 clicks
[4:31:07] Apparentthreat: "duh"
[4:31:07] JustPepeDontBeMad: @Giantwaffle you can use github pages
[4:31:08] ZyianDev: Would you like an example?
[4:31:11] LtCol_Carter: It's the deploy phase of CI
[4:31:15] Yohan460: argh no links :angry fist:
[4:31:16] Mike190Twitch: rods FeelsGoodMan
[4:31:18] Minelmonia: I would create a Jenkins pipeline for CI/CD
[4:31:19] PureSpider: yea heroku, netlify and vercel all have it built in as well
[4:31:20] TraxiRage: If you think of something, someone has already done it years ago
[4:31:20] punkgeek: Any CI platform will let you set up triggers for that
[4:31:23] DaGMC: GitLab is the best, with GitLab Pages
[4:31:24] TraxiRage: That's a basic principle of programming
[4:31:28] LtCol_Carter: Gitlab CI is nice
[4:31:29] Wasabi76: so many options to deploy code nowadays, first learn git
[4:31:46] m3lm4n: the best thing about programming is if you have a question starting with "can you ..." the answet is always yes :P just depends on time you want to spend
[4:32:09] DaGMC: I've done many workshops/courses on GitLab CI/CD
[4:32:11] Sanduckchan: congratz on your 8 years :)
[4:32:30] PureSpider: DaGMC i love gitlab ci, so nice - and github basically copied it exactly bamKEK
[4:32:34] xfrozev2: Why didnt u make the numasmatic dynamo @Giantwaffle
[4:32:43] MonteKuchen: why not
[4:32:45] MonteKuchen: make it 20
[4:32:46] LaroStar007: sheesh
[4:32:47] SeeAGamer: Ah, still a  kid.. Kappa

[4:32:55] KamiSkript: i'm 38 so what?
[4:33:00] TheCairon: @Mike190Twitch me too bro
[4:33:02] DaGMC: @PureSpider never tried github actions, but from what I've seen, I'd agree
[4:33:35] MyNameIsTobii: So, do the Magmatic Dynamo with an enderpump and endertank, its also in the quest.

[4:37:13] Gotizie: Tomorrow 5:30 MST
[4:37:18] MegaCosa: JadedOnyx19  windows movie maker
[4:37:32] WGG25: you really don't need all that much power gen going, i had 12 steam dynos total (4:8), if you leave the diamond one running for a bit, you can easily quickstart the rest (at most 10 diamonds required imo)
[4:37:35] PureSpider: JadedOnyx19 davinci resolve
[4:37:37] Gotizie: Leafs vs Habs game 7
[4:37:37] Lord_arcon: Toronto is playing today @Giantwaffle

[4:39:02] herro_monkey: god i hope they do one
[4:39:02] Tabakhase: no wipe = wipe guaranteed KEKW
[4:39:08] Mike190Twitch: copium KEKW
[4:39:10] Wetware: I'm in Toronto. I'm hoping Leafs can pull it together, but won't be surprised if they don't.
[4:39:12] JadedOnyx19: Thanks everyone appreciate the help !
[4:39:14] DatoPotatoDato: COPIUM
[4:39:19] DaGMC: its strange that klean is playing EFT again
[4:39:41] sam1390: @Wetware same
[4:39:59] siwdo: they literally gave us a wipe on christmas eve last year with a days notice KEKW so we could literally never know
[4:40:00] DaGMC: me too
[4:40:03] kennycraig: same
[4:40:08] pipin420420: same
[4:40:09] brew182: I want to want to play EFT
[4:40:12] JadedOnyx19: its why i dont play rn
[4:40:13] ThatOnneGuy: why is it strange that klean is playing eft?
[4:40:17] Equandor: if there is going to be a wipe we will probably see Pestily taking a small vacation just before it
[4:40:50] DaGMC: wipe is this thursday Kappa
[4:41:20] siwdo: I like wipe events they unlock all your traders and make things cheap to fuck around with
[4:41:37] Equandor: he usually does like 72h stream on wipe
[4:41:43] kennycraig: and it hurts even more knowing i spent 150 euros (plus tax) for the most expensive edition
[4:41:43] Moobot: Support Waffle by using his Epic creator code: Giantwaffle
[4:42:05] kennycraig: tax included i mean
[4:42:07] WGG25: i think you'll hit the limit of the cables with that many dynamos @Giantwaffle
[4:42:19] n8level: wipes should be built into the game, like when world wealth reaches a certain point there is a reset/wipe of some sort
[4:42:25] SilentService12: nikita has talked about having two chars where one never wipes and one is a seasonal wipe
[4:42:38] WGG25: ah alright
[4:42:40] SilentService12: yes exactly
[4:42:48] ForeverChris: happy 8 years
[4:42:48] pipin420420: yes
[4:42:49] DaGMC: @ThatOnneGuy he had a video stating that he wasnt happy with the state of the game some time ago, would have expected him to see him back once a wipe changes alot
[4:42:50] SilentService12: yes
[4:42:55] stu_ttv: @SilentService12 where is that being said?
[4:42:58] siwdo: I just want a scav that doesn’t have a cool down lol
[4:43:06] pipin420420: after season you can
[4:43:09] stu_ttv: I play daily eft and never heard about it
[4:43:09] SilentService12: @stu_ttv latest podcast with klean
[4:43:15] stu_ttv: ah maybe
[4:43:21] DaGMC: yes, klean
[4:43:29] Gotizie: Kind of like Diablo seasons more or less
[4:43:30] staccatone: This wipe the economy was fucked anyway
[4:43:33] Chronoes: the economy is already pretty bad
[4:43:41] TheIrishGuy: have a paid Inventory so you get 100$ you have to pay the scav 50$ to get the items
[4:43:50] ThatOnneGuy: DaGMC ah, gotcha. I haven't been keeping up with that stuff a whole lot. I've noticed a lot of streamers that don't like the state of a game tend to go back to it every now and then though
[4:43:51] n8level: I just want a free to play scav, or a mobile app with loot economy 'manufacturing'
[4:43:58] stu_ttv: bitcoin is down not to 200 mil now
[4:44:02] Senthyrel: palyers: scavving into some maps is impossible! also players: remove scav CD
[4:44:21] staccatone: I sold like 20 bitcoins at 860k each
[4:44:53] DaGMC: tetriz broken
[4:44:53] BaTu016: gpus were 2m as well
[4:45:05] siwdo: it took them way too long to fix the btc economy problem KEKW
[4:45:29] Senthyrel: seen a good idea to make bitcoin like turnips in animal crossing. random price point per day set by the devs custom range
[4:45:32] stu_ttv: the problem is that you can go with no armor and no gun into interchange and get the GPUs put them into the pouch and then extract or use the gpu to bitcoin and that ruin the others gameplay
[4:45:36] Mike190Twitch: Sounds horrible
[4:45:42] siwdo: tarkov is fun though, just wish I had the motivation and skill to play antonnWoo
[4:45:47] AsHackDM: If everyone has the same thing no one has upperhand
[4:46:09] TheIrishGuy: isnt LightHouse coming first ?
[4:46:09] SilentService12: lighthouse first
[4:46:12] SilentService12: then streets
[4:46:13] staccatone: There's a map in between, Lighthouse
[4:46:14] stu_ttv: @Giantwaffle before streets I think lighthouse will come
[4:46:14] JacobSolo: iirc there will be lighthouse before streets
[4:46:49] Liquighost: not really
[4:46:54] MonteKuchen: you could use the conduit probe for copying the settings
[4:46:58] DaGMC: 6 ppl
[4:47:00] siwdo: honestly we’ll be lucky to see streets midyear next year LUL
[4:47:03] BaTu016: its like a timmy map pepeLaugh
[4:47:07] Liquighost: theres lots of pistol bois that will be doing quests
[4:47:18] stu_ttv: labs cards should not be that expensive
[4:47:23] ThatOnneGuy: @Giantwaffle did you watch the latest lockpickinglawyer vid? It's a colab with Stuff Made Here
[4:47:36] staccatone: They will probably show streets tonight with dlss
[4:47:40] DaGMC: I love factory bot games
[4:47:44] ThatOnneGuy: I'll take that as a no
[4:48:01] stu_ttv: scav gang with viewers PogChamp \
[4:48:13] JadedOnyx19: I just want EFT would run better, i have a 3080 and a 5600x and i still stutter
[4:48:20] JadedOnyx19: wish*
[4:48:22] JacobSolo: BSG tweeted about an Nvidia event today, some sorta reveal?
[4:48:43] staccatone: They need Unity 19.3
[4:48:56] siwdo: @jadedonyx19 it’s more cpu heavy than anything I believe
[4:48:57] staccatone: Streets tease
[4:49:32] JadedOnyx19: @siwdo Yah its annoying, 5600x should be fine for it but i am playing at 1440p
[4:49:51] SilentService12: they want to but there is still too many issues to be on the latest unity
[4:49:51] staccatone: Not yet, after this patch and before .12
[4:49:51] Moobot: Come join the Waffle House discord https://discord.gg/G5FeeveP3c and chat with the community! Remember to link your Twitch account in the Settings (gear) > Connections for subscriber channels.
[4:50:15] DaGMC: @JadedOnyx19 what kind of storage do you have?
[4:50:20] siwdo: @jadedonyx19 hmm, weird I have a 5600x as well but play on 1080 and have no problems
[4:50:32] SilentService12: 20 devs trying to work on a game and make their own engine KEKW
[4:50:35] BaTu016: have u guys seen the new unity youtube video
[4:50:52] BaTu016: finally pepeSmoke
[4:50:59] JadedOnyx19: i have evo 970, and its probably not bad im just picky af and like my 144 1440p lol
[4:51:02] dawidtree312: what is tarkov?
[4:51:05] AsHackDM: I like cold house
[4:51:08] staccatone: Unity 19.3 has the High Definition Rendering Pipeline that they need
[4:51:18] cederic96: 20°C?
[4:51:25] Rolling_Panda_art: When you leave the PNW .. you loose your resilience to cold.
[4:51:26] AsHackDM: 22 c is fine
[4:51:46] The_Newspaper: It has been 23c outside today, and its killing me
[4:51:47] Tawmcruize1994: hes cold natured moon2S
[4:51:54] The_Newspaper: too hot
[4:51:57] siwdo: @jadedonyx19 I feel it lol just make sure tarkov is on your main storage and not an external or anything
[4:52:01] JadedOnyx19: hot days i love 21-22c
[4:52:01] nxusr: 22c is too warm D:
[4:52:03] The_Holas: too hot
[4:52:07] cederic96: 19°C os standard here
[4:52:15] Mike190Twitch: thats 71 in freedom units KKona
[4:52:16] Vidzargs: 18-19C is perfect
[4:52:17] Paskenarion: 17 is nice
[4:52:23] sam1390: 18 in the sun is the best

[4:52:44] NordESA: MONKERS
[4:52:47] Tawmcruize1994: its the south
[4:52:50] DaGMC: climate change
[4:52:52] Tawmcruize1994: and summer
[4:52:53] shengdeluo: same weather in eastern Europe...
[4:52:59] bwofreedom2: At least its not tornadoes
[4:53:00] JadedOnyx19: @siwdo its been a little while since i played so it could be way better for all i know atm, i know interchange was always a hit on the FPS
[4:53:23] Copper007head: Yep, we have humidity too, but Sweet Tea helps in TX LUL
[4:53:24] AsHackDM: I can live with 20c but im more comfortable on 22c btw my house doesnt have any AC or climate control system i got just windows
[4:53:28] Mike190Twitch: Going on my 2nd year in Tennessee, al i have to worry about is Tornado season (which ive only worried one time since 2020)
[4:53:34] AceBlizzardz: I'm tired of all this rain here
[4:53:40] Cyraxina: @Giantwaffle u thinking of playing again gta 5 rp ? like in SOE ?
[4:53:45] JadedOnyx19: @AsHackDM got that manual cooling KEKW
[4:54:00] Mike190Twitch: I had insurance and i was covered, i got 3 week hotel stay on their dime, but im in an apartment
[4:54:00] siwdo: @jadedonyx19 that’s true my frames used to be shitty on reserve as well I
[4:54:02] xalorous: no on the tornado insurance, it's not really a thing
[4:54:19] tortler: Hi Waffle!
[4:54:28] MADodds: MicroClover > grass
[4:54:32] xalorous: we're in mid-spring, the south gets a lot of rain and that means frequent thunderstorms
[4:54:35] DrHax_: replacing grass with rocks? DansGame
[4:54:47] AsHackDM: Grass is good dont covert you will miss grass
[4:54:47] xalorous: I grew up in the south
[4:54:49] Mike190Twitch: That being said, my old apartment got Beat the hell up and was in construction for 13 months
[4:54:50] kuhllen: synthetic turf?
[4:54:59] xalorous: barely notice thunderstorms unless I'm driving
[4:55:11] tortler: I ate rocks when i was little
[4:55:13] JadedOnyx19: @Giantwaffle Have you thought about doing a Greenhouse before?
[4:55:13] HoytZephyr: Done a lot in hotter climes tbh
[4:55:14] Tabakhase: grow some rocks YEP
[4:55:16] Mike190Twitch: Mind you, only the windows were shattered, and the roof had a few holes in it after the EF3(4?) Tornado we had
[4:55:21] DrHax_: I'm too much of a bee friend to like rock gardens rooSip
[4:55:36] Mike190Twitch: Yes it was EF3 I experienced
[4:55:37] Tawmcruize1994: same*
[4:55:40] The_Newspaper: What about bark?
[4:55:45] Dune_Shadow: 12.50 -.-
[4:55:53] JadedOnyx19: would be nice to have a little lean-to for a green house, wish i wasnt in an apt
[4:55:58] AsHackDM: #herbs YEP
[4:56:03] xalorous: use pallet wood?
[4:56:06] algriany18: !giveaway
[4:56:11] JadedOnyx19: Pog
[4:56:13] Dune_Shadow: I hope lumber goes down soon
[4:56:16] JadedOnyx19: OMG
[4:56:17] Mike190Twitch: can barely see it *squint*
[4:56:18] Dune_Shadow: it's stupid right now
[4:56:19] algriany18: !raffle
[4:56:31] Tawmcruize1994: moon2D
[4:56:33] shengdeluo: god damn
[4:56:34] 1killersquirrel: Texas wood = cactus?
[4:56:42] RatDadSwe: darkHey
[4:56:51] MegaCosa: Practice throwing dice...
[4:57:48] shavinglove: Practice?
[4:57:51] swiftreaper4: is he like pro dice roller
[4:57:51] Moobot: You can find Waffle's Youtube channel here - https://youtube.com/giantwaffle
[4:58:14] Mike190Twitch: KEKW
[4:58:19] BaronVg: I can do that lmao
[4:58:35] The_Newspaper: People believe they can control the wind LULW im not surprised
[4:58:44] Toxers: You can just right click the augment on the dymamos
[4:58:45] BaronVg: Lol wtf if you give me 2 dices I can  70% of the times what I want
[4:59:07] shavinglove: Its not that hrd
[4:59:39] Mike190Twitch: Use Artificial Intelligence? LUL
[5:00:06] BaronVg: Ok maybe mathematically, but after some time you learn the way it bounces unless you change the dice everytime
[5:00:19] EzMoNeY_13: all i know is that tails never fails
[5:00:56] xalorous: that's monte carlo simulation, you can do that on a little cluster.  Can be pi's or nuc's or cloud vm's
[5:01:21] The_Holas: remain cool EZ
[5:01:31] PureSpider: you would lol
[5:01:37] PureSpider: thats like THE use case for it
[5:01:37] xalorous: repetitve calculations ?  yeah, it's what they're for.
[5:01:46] PureSpider: QMC?
[5:02:11] PureSpider: yes
[5:02:17] DoubleOughtNot: Thank you@
[5:02:29] PureSpider: it's "bayesian"
[5:02:29] Codidley: bayesian
[5:02:43] PureSpider: monte carlo is just to simulate outcomes to figure out probabilities
[5:02:51] Codidley: yah MCMC is bayesian
[5:03:24] Toxers: Round Robin?
[5:03:26] PureSpider: monte carlo doesnt have to be bayesian
[5:03:26] DopeManis: you know about the conduit probe? :D
[5:03:28] Nerudeus: the question is how may variables of the dice throw you can control,  or need to get the smae reslut, ich you can bolt the maschine to the desk,precise mechanism, humility ,draf ...... 100 thinks later the sure you get the same ;)
[5:03:59] Codidley: ok doesn't have to be - but is generally applied to bayesian models yah?
[5:04:07] PureSpider: monte carlo is basically used when a system of probabilities is too complex to describe with variables, or if you otherwise want to simulate instead of calculate it
[5:04:21] PureSpider: Codidley yes
[5:04:34] Gotizie: break it and replace it
[5:05:08] PureSpider: monte carlo is famously used for photorealistic renderers
[5:05:13] xalorous: q=mcmc+raspberry+pi+cluster
[5:05:14] PureSpider: or, quasi monte carlo
[5:05:47] xalorous: they also use a similar method to calculate tournament odds for texas hold-em

[5:09:51] DoubleOughtNot: In probability theory, MC can also be used to estimate intractable integrals to validate results about expected outcomes. That was the last frantic moments of my PHd. Took over the half the computer lab running simulations to compare the error rates of various methods.

[5:14:08] Chronoes: why not just use VSCode instead of sublime?
[5:14:19] Tabakhase: its a evaluation copy PepoThink
[5:14:23] Chronoes: VScode is also a text editor
[5:14:26] ZyianDev: vscode is a text editor
[5:14:28] DatoPotatoDato: wait sublime is a IDE? I thought it was a note pad KEKW
[5:14:31] Soul_Synergy: just use vim KEKW

[5:14:50] 1killersquirrel: Hey hey hey, be careful, I can be dangerous
[5:14:52] Gotizie: notepad ++ is ok as well
[5:14:57] Chronoes: I mean, no, sublime also has plugins for programming. I used to use it years ago
[5:14:58] ThatOnneGuy: wait you don't use tnt to kill squirrels?
[5:15:02] TheWonderLlama: A squirrel? Not all the squirrels?
[5:15:07] Jayouz: I dislike squirrels enough that a cannon seems appropriate :D
[5:15:10] macdrai: notepad++ has dark mode
[5:15:12] ZyianDev: nono, vscode with extensions is the same as vanilla sublime, you start adding extensions to sublime and boom same thing
[5:15:12] dylan0806: Why not notepad++?
[5:15:19] xalorous: use vs code if you want hte extensions
[5:15:20] DaGMC: you want to build a battle ship
[5:15:24] xalorous: and gitlab integration
[5:15:26] DaGMC: want us
[5:15:36] ewerd21: just use google search bar
[5:15:44] n8level: the name is clearly different SeriousSloth
[5:15:54] madseed15: how did u know shit have differnent flavor
[5:15:57] mechoriet: just use all the editors 4Head

[5:16:29] LittleWoglug: light mode life, dark mode gives me headache
[5:16:29] Myekos: look, I'm old school, when I want to make edits to a file I start a new one and enter every character perfectly with 'copy con'
[5:16:31] Soul_Synergy: There is a movie that is the next couple chapters of the Light novel
[5:16:31] diverse114: BibleThump
[5:16:31] Chronoes: I used to use Sublime, then I switched to Atom, now I'm on VSCode. They're all text editors in the end, with different extensions and plugins
[5:16:32] Klorell: LUL
[5:17:12] xalorous: vim plus tmux is very powerful, but you have to study it, vs code just works, on any platform
[5:17:15] Wetware: How far off is auto-crafting in this pack?
[5:17:17] Xerexos_: I like atom haven't tried vscode yet
[5:17:17] macdrai: vim masterrace
[5:17:35] Tabakhase: my editors are sorted by launchtime LUL
[5:17:43] DaGMC: I've used XEmacs, Eclipse, IntelliJ and then VScode
[5:17:53] Jayouz: Wait... I thought you were pro-elitism?
[5:17:56] Wetware: Editor Gatekeeping LUL
[5:18:02] DatoPotatoDato: LULW
[5:18:09] Soul_Synergy: It's still important to know how to code without autocomplete. Most coding interviews require that
[5:18:11] Xerexos_: I mean I use notepad when I'm being lazy
[5:18:13] Glacial_Indifference: We have been having VI vs EMACS religious wars for decades now.
[5:18:17] Speedkill3r: I only use vim for git
[5:18:25] DrHax_: honestly if youre not programming on stone tablets youre a fucking idiot KEKW
[5:18:31] Chronoes: Omg Eclipse, what a mess. I remember programming Python in it and my simple-ass script caused its parser to eat up memory until it crashed, every time
[5:18:35] kheeler: DOS edlin FTW
[5:18:50] Myekos: kheeler 'copy con'
[5:18:56] xalorous: In the linux system administration world you have to be able to function with (pick one: vi(m)|emacs|nano), because not all the machines have a gui...
[5:18:58] DaGMC: @Giantwaffle there are also browser based editors and IDEs, no need for additional applications
[5:19:02] ZyianDev: not anymore
[5:19:07] madseed15: java eclipse?
[5:19:12] dystav: It's standard at my company :(
[5:19:16] kinglouisxvii: I use vim but like vscode as well
[5:19:17] ragrella: the java devs at my work would hate you for saying that
[5:19:22] Glacial_Indifference: Aspect still forces me to use eclipse. Can't work in their CX language without it anymore. :(
[5:19:24] Chronoes: KEKW
[5:19:27] madseed15: KEKW
[5:19:27] Xerexos_: KEKW
[5:19:29] Soul_Synergy: KEWK
[5:19:29] Munschmann: VS-Code is my goto for all script-languages (python/javascript). Almost everything else is Jetbrains
[5:19:30] Soul_Synergy: KEKW
[5:19:32] Tabakhase: NODDERS
[5:19:33] mechoriet: @Gooora NotLikeThis eclipse is a mess
[5:19:44] dystav: I am currently leaving, yes :D
[5:19:49] kheeler: I do iOS dev so Xcode is all there is really.
[5:19:53] Sanduckchan: we're using net beans no worries Kappa
[5:20:14] Soul_Synergy: The company needs to own the license for the IDE
[5:20:15] Chronoes: Probably some sort of customized build configs etc
[5:20:17] tuxwonder7: Sometimes based on the license, yes
[5:20:20] dasmako: usually discounts on license purchasing
[5:20:20] Glacial_Indifference: It's vendor lock-in rather than the company, in our case.
[5:20:20] MasterKraft: easy to talk about code when everyone has teh same tools
[5:20:21] Chronoes: and license too yes
[5:20:22] Klorell: eclipse isn't that bad
[5:20:23] Xerexos_: I mean iOS is only xcode so your screwed there
[5:20:24] homer8253: If they use Eclipse, maybe they had developed custom addons to it that were specific to their workload?
[5:20:28] ZyianDev: You can
[5:20:30] Greedyro: no
[5:20:31] KnickKen: i have to have pants on, thats also not performance enhancing
[5:20:31] camelJon: Not on the dev machines
[5:20:33] Munschmann: Nope
[5:20:33] tuxwonder7: No
[5:20:47] ZyianDev: Jetbrains allows personal licenses on Professional work
[5:20:58] camelJon: If enough ask they will get a license for it
[5:21:04] GrahamPrix: Hey Giantwaffle and chat
[5:21:12] n8level: to think some software companies don't have casual notepad++ Fridays etalCheese

[5:22:05] Tabakhase: Jetbrains you can also keep using forever after 1y paid NODDERS - and there renewal price drops massively too, even if you change products... - buy 2 years of "just one ide" - then upgrade to allProductsPack for 50% 5Head
[5:22:23] Marcopach: can we get some hate on white visual studio users DansGame
[5:22:24] Myekos: I expect my interns to read my mind and input things for me

[5:24:14] Drizzt02: how does that actually test knowledge? KEKW
[5:24:16] Bobberle: What the heck. Are there more test like this in the University over there in USA?
[5:24:31] dylan0806: Yup fun he :(
[5:24:32] Munschmann: You should have been the prof
[5:24:34] Munschmann: :D
[5:24:42] madseed15: nope KEKW

[5:24:53] Pickile: yup
[5:24:53] Munschmann: Yes
[5:24:57] coolmun_: yeahhh
[5:25:01] DatoPotatoDato: yes
[5:25:02] Kybaush: Most of my stuff is written and then uploaded as image/pdf
[5:25:05] LordDynom: yes
[5:25:05] Liquighost: is this a custom map?
[5:25:08] madseed15: yeh
[5:25:09] Chronoes: I did it in 2016
[5:25:09] ZyianDev: yes
[5:25:17] dylan0806: Still the same here
[5:25:17] Munschmann: Written Java-Classes in 2016
[5:25:24] coolmun_: yep its pretty annoying
[5:25:26] hiiamnielse: 2018 written c# test
[5:25:34] TheBobertTv: a lot of my programming tests are online via the ide or in a google doc(but then my CS tests were during covid)
[5:25:36] Chronoes: some classes were with computer but also gad written tests
[5:25:36] Mike190Twitch: I dont think i ever did writing code tests for college around 09-2012
[5:25:36] Brucey_Bit: if you split the bits by 4 then you have bytes which are somewhat easier lol (computer engineering student, they're still written lol)
[5:25:38] zombietaint: my college had you create jars/dlls that had to compile and the teacher had a program that tested them
[5:25:41] madseed15: im glad SQL is a short language LUWL
[5:25:41] Munschmann: Still using overhead-projectors in germany :D
[5:25:43] madseed15: LULW
[5:25:44] tonigmaa: yes binary test by hand and also write a program on paper for test...
[5:26:24] madseed15: Ah i survived the exam but not my arm
[5:26:34] Bobberle: @Munschmann well overhead-projectors are like absolute normal?
[5:26:38] gtluszcz: My profesor just threw the exams on the desk. Those that fell of - failed
[5:26:47] DatoPotatoDato: how can ppl even test program on paper like wouldnt testing it be a important part of writing a program?
[5:26:48] 1killersquirrel: I did my programming in high-school in the early 2000s on paper and the teacher was writing on the blackboard LUL
[5:27:00] schwebels428: wait, didn't you used to have a sky base that looked similar to this before?
[5:27:08] Chronoes: the worst part is that when you realize you made a mistake, you might as well start over because overwriting text is terrible
[5:27:16] SyriiAdvent: I took assembly classes. Never again pls
[5:27:21] tonigmaa: i can't imagine how the teachers debugging it
[5:27:33] BlazeAndDaze: Assembly is so much fun :)
[5:27:34] RatsmahisboringZzz: just got my ass kicked on my calc 4 test, glad to relax to some waffle mc. Digging the beard bro

[5:28:14] Drazer_: LUL
[5:28:15] Hoofery: shes just jealous
[5:28:18] Brucey_Bit: a sorting algorithm in java takes like 5 lines, but 20 lines in assembly
[5:28:28] Drazer_: you could chisel that beard
[5:28:40] dax573: machines can auto output
[5:29:15] ewerd21: assembly has imul and idiv
[5:29:28] ewerd21: modulus in assembly is hard
