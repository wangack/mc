[0:30:27] MrRedVII: the British
[0:30:33] zsigmons1: Because English is three language in a trench coat pretending to be one

[0:32:39] grimaussiewitch: I think the villagers will have a cool down or something
[0:32:39] Wyharn_Guardian: Probably will stop some of the loop trading with glass
[0:32:42] charlotte489: This is the perfect study break
[0:33:02] doxisontwitchnow: I think that might already be implemented? I don't think it's linked to the other villager updates that are hid behind the tab.
[0:33:07] AnthonyYTG: its a design adapted from impulses design i believe. Its fairly reliable and if it breaks only one circuit breaks instead of a large amount of the system
[0:33:08] Starrrdust8: the name a warden is a lot closer then last time I saw it
[0:33:24] grimaussiewitch: it should be an option that you can change in your setting

[0:34:37] mattie321: can we lock up a Mule called DHL in prison for lossing my HC collectors cards?
[0:34:44] napstein: Keep remembering that impulse pretty much invented reliable item filters
[0:34:47] Wyharn_Guardian: @blueguineapig78 I wouldn't mind mending being removed.  Its almost necessary to get for the trouble it takes to enchant gear.
[0:34:49] voidthebear: oh gosh when Dog Armor comes out
[0:34:50] datguccipoochie: i mostly use villagers early game so usually they become less of a liability later

[0:38:03] Doperanks: I always take the time to create a storage system with an Impulse-style item filter, for hundreds of chests. Takes a while, but just chugging everything in a chest and have it auto-sorted is soooo nice
[0:38:04] datguccipoochie: it’s always things jumping derpily or things spinning around in place
[0:38:07] dashmax1214: Green Terracotta exist somewhere

[0:39:27] datguccipoochie: security is so dumb sometimes
[0:39:29] doxisontwitchnow: DHL is notoriously bad here in the State, but they are also cheap so a lot of businesses use them.
[0:39:33] cursed_hyacinth: I once had a Stardew Guidebook that got stuck in America because they somehow couldn't deliver it to Australia, so they incinerated it. The company i bought it from was so lovely and sent another one
[0:39:33] napstein: It's a jumper... what's threatening about it?
[0:39:37] AnthonyYTG: confidence is key!!
[0:39:40] Wyharn_Guardian: Are you going to talk to Tango for Warden naming tips?  Or learn as you go?

[0:42:57] Kriddius_: The first 50-100 days are the most dangerous. After that you die to stupidity, complacency or something crazy
[0:43:12] RohanaDArilin: I feel slightly peeved at this bot. I AM a french fry! I didn't chose to be one, though. tssk.

[1:10:32] Helplesstacotv: So that he doesn't die first?
[1:10:37] toastboi22: just watched someone put a firecracker in a snowman. it was mind blowing
[1:10:40] pastel_cottontail: @ch4r_g4mes she’s on Twitter and tumblr! tag her in either of those and she’ll probably see it
[1:10:42] RofoRex: dead coral blocks are chef kiss
[1:10:44] Newrad1990: Tuff has shared "greenish" tones
[1:10:46] itsthenars: @ch4r_g4mes probably tumblr and tagging her i assume... or twitter

[1:11:09] UrgezGaming: Can't wait for the tuff bricks
[1:11:13] Nightbot:  Don't become a french fry, be a good potato, remember to follow the stream!
[1:11:19] datguccipoochie: i recently discovered that i really like the gradient with all the stages of aging copper when combined with like a sandstone/birch color
[1:11:27] daredevil2300: French fries. num num
[1:11:36] puppy555jjj33: Cheer100  cleaning a chest monster  rn of me and my base mates its taken the 3 of us 4 hours and we still have 15 double chest left lmao

[1:12:00] chinook_a: im so excited for the tuff and copper!
[1:12:00] UrgezGaming: And tie in deepslate well
[1:12:03] Zairon: I will marry the new copper blocks LUL
[1:12:04] Asterionm: the tuff variants are going to be amazing, cos mining out iron veins are dual purpose then
[1:12:10] Jonas1431: Tuff just has that roughness that you sometimes need in gradients
[1:12:12] Goscalyon: yeah probably around june/july I suppose?
[1:12:12] Nightbot:  Follow Pearl in all the places: https://www.youtube.com/pearlescentmoon  https://twitter.com/PearlescentMoon https://www.instagram.com/pearlescentmoo/
[1:12:15] ch4r_g4mes: how long are you planning on streaming?
[1:12:26] datguccipoochie: i'm mostly excited for utocrafting
[1:12:30] datguccipoochie: autocrafting
[1:12:32] RohanaDArilin: tuff is that wonderful a bit warmer greyish brown color. love it. I'm impatient for the tuff building blocks
[1:12:35] puppylover128: pearlieHeart
[1:12:36] Goscalyon: yup
[1:12:45] stormageddon07: Name a donkey: Mumbo’s Company Car
[1:12:46] Helplesstacotv: by the way Pearl how does it feel battling scar in the finale in secret life?
[1:12:54] Goscalyon: sometimes its crazy how time flies
[1:13:00] BertPotato: It's practically next year already
[1:13:05] UrgezGaming: It only gets faster...
[1:13:13] Goscalyon: I hit the big 30 last month :L
[1:13:17] daredevil2300: I love the feeling/energy of the beginning of the year. holding on to the energy is what evades me.
[1:13:22] lilydeboef: its so weird to think ill be alive for 2 decades next year
[1:13:30] haggleslag: if scar was a warden you would've won that fight, you're the warden whisperer
[1:13:34] swirlycarl: Scar was a menace in Secret Life he deseved that win
[1:13:36] BertPotato: Get used to it Pearl, time moves even more swiftly
[1:13:39] sapphicwhimsy: about to be 27 in a few weeks so i know what ya mean pearl
[1:13:40] Helplesstacotv: I would of expected you and scar to die at the same time in the finale
[1:13:41] doxisontwitchnow: oh hush you're young.
[1:13:42] RohanaDArilin: @lilydeboef gosh, you're so young ^^
[1:13:43] gamingnscience: Time to start thinking about Xmas presents or it will creep up on you very surprisingly
[1:13:51] goatgoatgamings: scar really deserved that win in@secret life
[1:13:56] datguccipoochie: i suddenly went from beeing a teenager to being 20, like i dont even understand where the time went
[1:13:57] chinook_a: secret life was scars villain arc
[1:13:58] terkk18: what kind of twists would you like to see in the next life series
[1:14:09] Arcturus125: You were talking about sorting systems earlier. The only one i have found to be reliable and never breaks is Tango's design. But it doesnt work with shulkers, and you always have to leave 1 item in the slot. so you can't just grab and go.
[1:14:14] doxisontwitchnow: @chinook_a and he deserved it, as a treat.
[1:14:16] UrgezGaming: Be 40 this year still feel and act 20 lol 😂 it's all in the mind
[1:14:19] RohanaDArilin: i'm more than halfway through...
[1:14:19] Zenithgear: is this 1.20.4 wit the new block types ?
[1:14:20] snowystar122: im nearly 23 and doing a phd, and most of my parents/grandparents had kids at my age - its difficult XD
[1:14:28] bookworm2692: i loved secret life
[1:14:31] tildalovesthedoctor: secret life was my favourite life series so far
[1:14:34] coffetimeandshill: SL was great love the change
[1:14:36] Doperanks: I love the life series, all of them!
[1:14:38] cursed_hyacinth: I loved it
[1:14:39] Goscalyon: I was hoping we would see more task related stuff near the end (with red lives)
[1:14:41] tildalovesthedoctor: the tasks were the best part
[1:14:41] chinook_a: @doxisontwitchnow he was a true winner pearlieHeart
[1:14:45] GCxLife: idk, I enjoyed it a ton
[1:14:48] nulano: Secret life was my second favourite season after double life
[1:14:51] haggleslag: aquatic life, you need water to breathe pokuHEHE
[1:14:54] char_lvxxs: Omg, I feel so young rn, I'm 16
[1:14:54] magicclemons: watching secret life got me back into playing Minecraft and watching Minecraft content again
[1:15:00] chinook_a: the trapdoor party was my fave LUL
[1:15:02] itsthenars: secret life was great imo everyone got "prompts" and it was very silly
[1:15:06] divathranir1504: I really enjoyed it as well
[1:15:09] muccyy: i still miss the mounders tbh
[1:15:10] RattyZee: The secret tasks were a fantastic source of shenanigans.
[1:15:12] doxisontwitchnow: Yes that! I liked it creating different interactions
[1:15:13] GaspsHiChat: mounders is my favourite alliance of the life series. constantly thinking about you saying "i've failed my mounders again"
[1:15:15] keshkup: @snowystar122 PhD at 23??? I just started Uni
[1:15:15] terkk18: I it definitely encouraged viewers to go and watch other perspectives
[1:15:16] AetherVHX: i love secret life cuz every POV is interesting
[1:15:17] RohanaDArilin: @char_lvxxs My son just turned 17 ^^ i could be your mom :D
[1:15:18] Nightbot:  Be respectful - No spamming - No advertising - English only
[1:15:19] antalia_lotus: yes
[1:15:20] lilydeboef: @char_lvxxs ikr its such a diverse age group on these streams
[1:15:21] djts_stuff: BOOGIE APOCALYPSE
[1:15:22] RohanaDArilin: that's how old i am
[1:15:23] tildalovesthedoctor: @itsthenars exactly its like prompts in improv scenes
[1:15:27] benja_cbsnb2r: Exactly!
[1:15:28] emotional0127: pearlieRaid
[1:15:31] daredevil2300: I’ve always been an old soul. now I have the years to match my soul 🥲🤣
[1:15:34] MermicornQueen: Secret Life was honestly the best one so far, the tasks gave it a really great dynamic
[1:15:37] datguccipoochie: it was chatic and fun
[1:15:44] PurpleEyes_14: I feel to young to be here rn
[1:15:47] kristianos777: Hello
[1:15:48] Goscalyon: the first life series I saw was you and bigb being nosy neighbours
[1:15:54] swirlycarl: I think Secret life is my favorite because of how funny and enjoyable it was. My favorite was originally Last life because of all thye chaos but Secret life had The Chaos and the comedy that i love
[1:15:57] datguccipoochie: chaotic* my typing is bad
[1:15:59] char_lvxxs: @lilydeboef Yeah. it's so fascinating how wide the audience can be
[1:16:00] snowystar122: @keshkup haahaha just started dont worry! XD
[1:16:01] xWildSlicerx: There was a lot of interpretation avenues.. and naturally, the greater community took to policing it.
[1:16:03] antalia_lotus: but my fav will forever be doubel life pearlieHugs pearlieHeart
[1:16:06] TurtleCase: i enjoyed it a lot but it was harder to have time to watch so many povs to see what was going on
[1:16:10] castlebeki: was it a group decision to make longer episodes or did it just end up like that ?
[1:16:10] emotional0127: HAVING A GOOD DAY?
[1:16:13] pastel_cottontail: a lot of unhappy campers
[1:16:17] snowystar122: @snowystar122 good luck for your uni degree though :D
[1:16:19] RattyZee: That's a good point. You'd see someone doing weird mysterious stuff in someone else's video, and you'd have to go watch their video to find out what the task was.
[1:16:20] muccyy: its probably my favourite series
[1:16:21] GaspsHiChat: potential unpopular opinion but session seven was amazing and hilarious. i have so many angst ideas bc of it
[1:16:28] doxisontwitchnow: I am still ashamed on behalf of fandom over what folks did to Gem. It was awful.
[1:16:28] gamingnscience: „this episode I am finally going to do this important thing.“ secret keeper:“ lol, no!“
[1:16:45] lunar_eclipse132: Ellooo
[1:16:48] djts_stuff: You being Impulse butler was one of my fav
[1:16:50] datguccipoochie: i tend to ignore how the rest of the audience interacts/responds to the series and just enjoy it for myself, its better for my brain
[1:16:53] Bloopino: secret life was interesting, but 100% was way too chaotic and def felt like an experimental phase xD
[1:16:54] TurtleCase: @doxisontwitchnow so truee
[1:16:58] UrgezGaming: If you don't have that it's just people hiding and farming lol
[1:16:59] chinook_a: @doxisontwitchnow i dont follow the drama, what did they do to Gem? pearlieSad
[1:17:00] Newrad1990: The notion if the pass/fail existing led to trouble
[1:17:02] tildalovesthedoctor: i hadnt even seen that i loved this season and so has everyone ive seen, shows the different perseptions of viewer vs creator
[1:17:05] lilydeboef: then you built a ‘tower’
[1:17:08] terkk18: MOUNDERS 4 LIFE!!!
[1:17:11] kattituude: woo! I'm earlier to the stream today!
[1:17:14] gamernurse911: Hello PearlescentMoon and chat. What a beautiful day it is!
[1:17:14] comzic_cosmo: Hearing Pearl yell after the Mounders died killed me
[1:17:18] daredevil2300: mounders by far best base ever
[1:17:22] Doperanks: the no life regeneration is harsh though...
[1:17:23] frostyfly31122: the pay off for the house was the gathering in ur house, one of the best moments of the series imo
[1:17:24] datguccipoochie: LOL when you made the tower and realized what it looked similar to
[1:17:24] 0wren: @terkk18 !!!!
[1:17:28] noaheagles87: which life season was your favourite?
[1:17:30] UrgezGaming: It was a great way to add interaction
[1:17:37] GaspsHiChat: @comzic_cosmo when she said "i've failed my mounders again" i broke 😭
[1:17:40] stormageddon07: Joel’s version of the mounders song
[1:17:41] PurpleEyes_14: pearlieHype
[1:17:41] Goscalyon: yeah I watched pretty much all perspectives each episode
[1:17:43] Goscalyon: it was a lot of fun
[1:17:45] itsthenars: something that the audience seemed to forget is that there was no consequence for NOT doing your regular secrets. if someone really wasnt okay with a secret they didn't have to do it
[1:17:47] djts_stuff: Scar being Pearl's hypeman was fun
[1:17:47] cra66ycat: Hi!
[1:17:51] Doperanks: @Goscalyon same
[1:17:56] noelle_brooke: Man I just tried to pick a favorite life series. It's so hard! I really like them all
[1:18:00] comzic_cosmo: @gaspshichat I have not been the same since
[1:18:01] antalia_lotus: @gaspshichat dont remind me pearliePepe pearlieSad
[1:18:05] doxisontwitchnow: @chinook_a basically, she did something to piss of a sect of fandom and they harrassed her a lot.
[1:18:05] datguccipoochie: @stormageddon07 "no more pounding!"
[1:18:06] char_lvxxs: I've just started watching Joel's secret life, I've just finished Scott's
[1:18:11] jaunesmith09: I loved the tasks but sometimes the awkwardness of them made me cringe pearlieLuL
[1:18:20] pastel_cottontail: any thoughts on the watcher-adjacent hints in secret life? i.e. the secret keeper and off-brand EVO symbol?
[1:18:28] stany_d: @itsthenars the consequence is the opportunity cost of not getting the reward
[1:18:29] chinook_a: @doxisontwitchnow man..
[1:18:30] bookworm2692: you going along with joel backseat gaming you was hilarious
[1:18:30] xWildSlicerx: I feel like you had a few hypeman moment
[1:18:34] keshkup: @daredevil2300 Truly. The way it came to be, all the creativity bursting in these walls
[1:18:36] gamernurse911: The snow here is wonderfully beautiful.
[1:18:37] revaar61: It was fun to see some people's Among Us experience coming into play and faking non-task weird stuff to throw the yellow names off
[1:18:39] daredevil2300: G being the ultimate soldier “almost”
[1:18:47] Asterionm: bdubs: yeet dab poggers
[1:18:51] datguccipoochie: @stany_d wow fancy economic term
[1:18:53] gamernurse911: Just hope all drive safe cause ppl are idiots
[1:18:54] UrgezGaming: Good way to get diamonds with out mining all session
[1:18:54] Doperanks: It was the only way to regain hearts when you were not on red
[1:19:04] peregrine55: I personally enjoyed watching people have fun being as weird as they wanted
[1:19:04] terkk18: would really like to see the boogie man return next season.
[1:19:04] pastel_cottontail: imagine if gem didn’t go through with the boogie curse task lol. or scar passed up on any of his “villainous” tasks.
[1:19:06] blueguineapig78: oooh pretty
[1:19:11] goatgoatgamings: I love the name of your tools
[1:19:12] muccyy: love iit
[1:19:14] Cameron9108: I personally like both
[1:19:14] 0wren: agree
[1:19:15] itsthenars: yeah im glad there wasn't a direct consequence. having the option to just miss out on a boon was a REALLY good idea
[1:19:15] chinook_a: that looks way better!
[1:19:18] stormageddon07: Did you miss my name request?
[1:19:18] datguccipoochie: i feel like you need a border between that and the wood
[1:19:27] Zenithgear: hey pearl have u seen the new block types for tuff and are u excited to use them ?
[1:19:29] divathranir1504: Agree
[1:19:32] antalia_lotus: yes i saw a animatig for the hype man loved it and ther was a lot of pearl merch scare had pearlieLOL
[1:19:40] datguccipoochie: like polished basalt works in my mind to border that
[1:19:42] RattyZee: Ooh, mixing dead coral and cobble looks nice
[1:19:50] gamingnscience: who was in charge of managing the secret distribution so all the members were unspoiled?
[1:19:51] char_lvxxs: My fav secret life pov was probably either scars or bdubs
[1:19:52] gamernurse911: How is thr weather in everyone's areas?
[1:19:55] itsthenars: tibbys design for scar is my favorite so far
[1:20:10] GaspsHiChat: @gamernurse911 very cold which is unusual for the area i'm in
[1:20:17] doxisontwitchnow: @itsthenars Tibby's Scar is so great.
[1:20:34] miracleasl: Pearl do you have any advices when it comes to moving house? It has been such a stressful week moving everything out
[1:20:38] gamernurse911: @gaspshichat we just got 6 inches snow mid US
[1:20:49] Doperanks: It was soo great to see Jimmy's perspective when he didn't die first :D
[1:20:50] Nordic_Nio: A bat called Melbourne
[1:20:57] UrgezGaming: I'd love to see some more mix up's with groups next run, see pearl with skizz and tango lol
[1:20:59] muccyy: u were my fav secret life pov
[1:21:00] Goscalyon: oof choosing a fav pov is difficult, theres so many good ones
[1:21:05] pastel_cottontail: @gamingnscience there are a couple non-player admins that seem to manage that stuff
[1:21:14] noaheagles87: skizz's pov was my favorite because I really like the music he added in
[1:21:19] char_lvxxs: Idk, my fav abt bdubs is just that he's one of my favs and My fav abt scars is that it was the first full series of his that I've watched and I loved his whole villian tasks
[1:21:20] datguccipoochie: i think my favorite thing about the life series, and more just the interactions between everyone, is when the adult humor kicks in
[1:21:20] Cameron9108: I am currently sick and normally when I'm sick I watch someone's twitch, I opened twitch and 8:40 am and saw your name I am glad I decided to watch you, you made me smile
[1:21:20] sapphicwhimsy: i really enjoyed watching pearl and gems POV in secret life a lot
[1:21:31] chinook_a: oop-
[1:21:32] 0wren: pearliePearlShocked
[1:21:36] preparedman: Oh no
[1:21:38] garnettgemm: rip minecraft
[1:21:42] puppy555jjj33: oh yeah sodium is doingt that alot right jow

[1:21:49] ChiefBeef27: i think it's the more culling mod
[1:21:49] datguccipoochie: like one of my favorite things is when the family friendy lyoutubers make adult jokes
[1:21:51] UrgezGaming: Should team with skizz next run!
[1:21:54] datguccipoochie: oooof rip game
[1:21:55] muichiro_t0kito1: hii

[1:22:11] MermicornQueen: @datguccipoochie yes I would love a 'after dark' adult stream where they're allowed to be more adult with the humour
[1:22:14] gamernurse911: This snow is perfect for throwing at ppl like mincrafts deep snow
[1:22:16] PrincesssJoJo: Sounds like its pretty *salty* ;)
[1:22:17] daredevil2300: are we drinking tea?
[1:22:20] datguccipoochie: @MermicornQueen YES that

[1:22:53] coffetimeandshill: pland for HC10 you mean ;)
[1:22:54] djts_stuff: I enjoyed and was stressed watching Cleo's POV during the boogey apocalypse. So happy to watch theirs first cause It felt like a real zombie apocalypse movies. Which Ironic since she is a zombie
[1:22:56] pastel_cottontail: another boon for watching multiple POVs is seeing what certain people cut out vs leave in
[1:22:57] antalia_lotus: pearlieWoo
[1:23:11] GaspsHiChat: @djts_stuff omg yes i almost fainted while watching cleo's pov for the apocalypse 😭
[1:23:13] lilydeboef: @sapphicwhimsy that tower is my roman empire
[1:23:17] datguccipoochie: i love it, like they're all so good at appealing to both younger and older audiences at the same time!
[1:23:19] antalia_lotus: ohh no pearlieDed
[1:23:33] itsthenars: i just saw a limlife clip about bdubs mentioning scar having a lot of old socks in his room and i just about lost my mind it was so out of pocket funny
[1:23:34] ale_7231: those dogs are ruff?
[1:23:36] GaspsHiChat: the mounders tower was beautiful and i will stand by it
[1:23:36] chinook_a: we need a seperate dog island somewhere

[1:24:45] linnnaen: Inyourendo

[1:24:46] wd_zee: wd_zee subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 6 months! Wait, how is it 6 months already. Thank you Pearl for being around when times are tough times, thank you for being my motivation to get out of bed in the morning

[1:24:58] sapphicwhimsy: joels tower wasnt much better lol
[1:25:02] JustMadeNinjas: Bdubs used to be a lot less pg before hermitcraft

[1:25:15] lilydeboef: “why this shape and this colour scheme pearl?!?!”
[1:25:28] Nightbot:  Be respectful - No spamming - No advertising - English only

[1:49:55] keshkup: Home workouts ftw
[1:49:57] Sparcles5: lol same I'd never go to a gym pearlieLOL
[1:50:06] ThatHairyGuyOG: Gyms are a pretty positive place in my experience
[1:50:06] tildalovesthedoctor: i have never gone to the gym and i dont plan on it
[1:50:06] lilydeboef: yeah but youre nocturnal so if you go to a 24/7 one there will be like 2 people there tops. i go at 3 in the morning to avoid judgement
[1:50:08] mcarchitecture: I feel that, lol
[1:50:12] datguccipoochie: gyms scare me, so many people and judging eyes
[1:50:20] daredevil2300: I just joined a gym that is in groups of threes and they keep you busy. too busy for judging what I’m saying haha.
[1:50:33] greer08: you gotta watch out for the eshays in some aussie ones
[1:50:37] frostyfly31122: same, too self conscious to go to a gym.
[1:50:37] Exirel: Every gym is different, so no universal experience. I'm not really into sport, and went to the gym only recently, and all I got was support, help, and welcome!
[1:50:37] beardguy1233: after abit of going you get addicted sorta thing
[1:50:41] ohgeezkai: Depends where you go I guess. I do feel like that a bit here in the UK.
[1:50:49] lags611: every gym person went through the nooby phase ;) you gotta learn to not care and just go and learn. or look up online how to do exercises or ask someone
[1:50:49] tildalovesthedoctor: ive heard of all female gyms, a safer enviroment for some people so i think id be less scared to go to them
[1:50:58] cyberjay112: I've been that guy, and can say confidently no one looks at you with disdain, they look with nostalgia of being the exact same person when they started
[1:50:58] mahan0140: What's your favorite car
[1:51:12] itsthenars: if you have trapdoors, you can access the chests from the walkway, too.
[1:51:19] reko132_: Hello
[1:51:31] TheMysticCrafter: i don't go to gym because i feel so anxious so i really understand what you mean. but it helps a bit if it's any group training like pilates
[1:51:38] datguccipoochie: well i wish it was easy for me to understand that
[1:51:46] bitposhpub: Poke, we can submit nominations for the Streamer Awards! #13 "BEST MINECRAFT STREAMER"
[1:51:49] Exirel: Yes, social media are mostly wrong.

[1:52:07] clacomis66: hi pearl
[1:52:33] datguccipoochie: social media kinda just ruins mental health tbh
[1:52:38] tildalovesthedoctor: social media is generally one persons experience, that people take as fact for everyone
[1:52:40] gamernurse911: TearGlove
[1:52:46] paperbird76: Never had any problems in the gym here. Everyones just doing their own thing..

[1:53:19] mahan0140: What's your favorite car
[1:53:21] lilydeboef: look, judgement is a thing that is unfortunately very common in this society, however social media over exaggerates everything into making everyone believe its worse than it is
[1:53:26] alexyap0223: pearlieLOL
[1:53:30] gamernurse911: @datguccipoochie for sure
[1:53:40] allmozdergel: Red district?
[1:53:40] tildalovesthedoctor: that just made me realise that we need green wood in minecraft, a nice forest green or sage green
[1:53:45] giannnovich: Gotta go, couldn't stay for too long, got a piano lesson to attend, have a good stream!
[1:53:47] pancake_lover_333: do you have different districts thoughout the whole village?
[1:53:50] Cameron9108: What's your favourite building you made in this world and why?
[1:53:55] kzenmatthias: I don't go to the gym cause I'm a lazy bum
[1:53:59] antalia_lotus: @datguccipoochie  so does school
[1:53:59] datguccipoochie: @tildalovesthedoctor yes exactly i wish it was easier for my brain to actually comprehend this
[1:54:03] revaar61: there's unstripped bamboo
[1:54:06] itsthenars: jungle wood has some green
[1:54:06] lags611: if people judge you at the gym or anywhere else it usually says more about them than about you
[1:54:11] preparedman: I'd love more blue
[1:54:12] Blue_Hamster11: @antalia_lotus Yeah
[1:54:13] Goscalyon: I wish for red/orange leave blocks
[1:54:14] Syysmyrskytuuli: Pastels in general would be nice
[1:54:18] Karnasas: how about just mossy wood?
[1:54:21] scotchramune: I NEED more blues
[1:54:24] RofoRex: wouldn't mind some royal blues
[1:54:30] tildalovesthedoctor: @Karnasas oooh yes thisd be so good
[1:54:32] Virtua1Prodigy: I'm not afraid of being judged, I'm just not a people person and like to do things solo. So I went and got my own home gym equipment.
[1:54:33] terkk18: I wish they would add dying wood in the game
[1:54:34] datguccipoochie: you DARE insult cherry wood? >:( /j
[1:54:36] averieyup: What time is it there?
[1:54:41] Blue_Hamster11: @karnasas YES

[1:54:41] Nightbot: January 11th 2024, 1:29:34 am AEDT GMT+11:00
[1:54:46] autum_mist_101: Cherry wood is good for cottage core. Not good for towers.
[1:54:48] tildalovesthedoctor: does it not go with crimson wood? i did that and it was fine i think
[1:54:50] Syysmyrskytuuli: There's just so few pastels in Minecraft
[1:55:02] sionnach46: The pink blocks really clash with each other.
[1:55:07] dashmax1214: I wish Blue Stone existed in Minecraft
[1:55:15] strawberryshortkayy: I wish it was more of a rosy pink
[1:55:16] terkk18: give sunflowers a purpose, make sunflower oil from them and the you can craft wood stain with oil and dye.
[1:55:21] GaspsHiChat: i remember when jungle wood was considered the "pink" wood but that might've just heen me lol
[1:55:22] Nightbot:  Be respectful - No spamming - No advertising - English only
[1:55:28] tildalovesthedoctor: imo crimson is pinkish purple so i guess thats the difference
[1:55:31] woagopossum: stripped cherry wood especially doesnt match anything, frustrates me
[1:55:32] averieyup: Zombie cleos live
[1:55:36] tildalovesthedoctor: crimson wood **
[1:55:38] keshkup: Light blue is pretty much replaced by cyan in Minecraft and I'm salty about that
[1:55:41] strawberryshortkayy: @gaspshichat I used it as a substitute for pink wood too lol!
[1:55:41] datguccipoochie: ye i wouldnt put red by pink for pretty much anything
[1:55:44] Taco4Sniper: Taco4Sniper subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 47 months, currently on a 47 month streak! <3 <3 <3 <3 <3 <3 <3 <3 <3 <3 <3 <3
[1:55:48] bookworm2692: @GaspsHiChat i remember that!!
[1:55:55] BertPotato: Cherry wood is too pink for me, real cherry wood just has a hint of pink through to a deep reddish-brown
[1:56:03] revaar61: magrove is a nice deep pink
[1:56:11] itsthenars: have you seen that minecraft geologist Gneiss? he does nice color theory videos
[1:56:11] gamernurse911: The color wheel helps alot when finding complimenting colors
[1:56:14] Taco4Sniper: IM STILL IN AUS WHAT
[1:56:14] RofoRex: I saw an interesting video on colour theory in minecraft and what hues and shades were missing from the spectrum
[1:56:15] pastel_cottontail: there’s pink glazed terracotta but it’s so busy it’s hard to build with unless you’re specifically making a patterned floor or something
[1:56:17] Nightbot:  Reminder to be kind in chat!
[1:56:19] tyry95: Shades of Hugh sounds like a bad romance novel
[1:56:20] lilydeboef: you need colours which compliment each other, like the colour wheel, you need opposite colours in similar hues, if you have a pastel blue with a neon orange its not gonna look good
[1:56:28] Taco4Sniper: I live in Perth bro
[1:56:31] Taco4Sniper: hahahahahahahahaha
[1:56:49] Taco4Sniper: But yes we got back like midnight monday
[1:56:54] bookworm2692: "victoria = australia" - pearl 2k24
[1:57:00] lags611: I saw this video where someone found all the “color voids” that are missing in Minecraft. we need more variety of colors!
[1:57:05] sleepygirl124: hi
[1:57:05] gamernurse911: I'd live to travel someday.

[1:57:36] pancake_lover_333: i thought tasmania was the only other country in aus
[1:57:38] datguccipoochie: australia sounds like an interesting place to go to
[1:57:46] datguccipoochie: @gamernurse911 hi glaf, i'm dad!
[1:57:49] gamernurse911: Except the spiders
[1:58:00] Goscalyon: yeah modded is usually so many added at once though
[1:58:02] Karnasas: Im already overwhelmed
[1:58:04] UrgezGaming: Backpacks should be vanilla
[1:58:13] gamernurse911: Spiders would run me out

[1:58:18] sugeyyyyyyyy: spiders and snakes are the only thigns keeping me from moving there to live lmao
[1:58:18] Minerva_246: Child is in the sniffer petting zoo!
[1:58:32] pastel_cottontail: builders and non-builders will have different opinions on that lol
[1:58:32] lilydeboef: i think we just need more lighter colours rather than bolds, we have a lot of neutral tones and bolder colours
[1:58:44] gamernurse911: @sugeyyyyyyyy same
[1:58:57] Lenare: Morning Pearl!
[1:59:04] Karnasas: compared to modded? Virtually no vanilla if Im honest. Im almost 100% modded these days
[1:59:06] blueguineapig78: @lilydeboef This is why I love terracotta. Muted colours with a wee bit of texture.
[1:59:15] datguccipoochie: yea its nice that they're added kinda gradually, it gives us time to understand what it looks nice with, how it looks with other things and how to use it
[1:59:23] gamernurse911: But I'd LOVE TO visit
[1:59:28] mulanv44: Hi everyone pearlieHeart hope you're doing well!

[2:00:47] gamernurse911: I'll play MC with you
[2:00:48] Cameron9108: I wish Minecraft would add the ability to dye woods and bring in a white wood or something for that
[2:00:56] the_almighty_chikin: ‘Ello
[2:01:07] gamernurse911: Well ther eus a whitish wood
[2:01:16] UrgezGaming: A simple backpack would change alot

[2:01:36] gamernurse911: Can't type today
[2:01:40] serrmardan: morning!
[2:01:40] sionnach46: @gamernurse911 Which one?
[2:01:46] tildalovesthedoctor: wait theres a white wood? i cant think of it
[2:01:49] woagopossum: odd to be up this early but its fun to finally catch a stream live i always have to watch vods
[2:01:54] Esstyy: I'd like to pick up Minecraft again just to see all the new vanilla things, I just don't have the energy to get through all the early game and grind for the umpteenth time.
[2:01:56] lilydeboef: theyve had it in modded for years
[2:02:20] sparkysure: Fanny packs lol
[2:02:22] Minerva_246: Or could you hold it like a shulker too but access it without placing it?
[2:02:24] magicclemons: maybe you could hold it in the other hand?
[2:02:27] kennediem: Maybe loose your off hand?
[2:02:27] datguccipoochie: nah knowing mojang they won't add it at all :despair:
[2:02:37] jasminebea1: Cheer100 Hello, i’m Jazz. this is my first time dropping by one of your streams i’ve been watching you since hermit 9 started, i found u through gem. I love finding aussie content creators, love from Perth
[2:02:42] Syysmyrskytuuli: White wood would be really nice
[2:02:44] waarisdetaart: a purse... xD
[2:02:48] pastel_cottontail: it’s a purse then
[2:02:50] tildalovesthedoctor: we need something we can keep in the inventory and take stuff out without placing down
[2:02:52] gamernurse911: Birxh is close when building worth dark woods
[2:02:53] xWildSlicerx: I would love to see Willow wood added into mInecraft. A nice green wood would be sick
[2:02:53] Bloopino: a lil clutch :V
[2:02:56] kzenmatthias: Offhandbag
[2:02:57] wesbatesart: Messenger bag in the off hand
[2:02:57] lilydeboef: birch is more of a yellow hue in planks and stripped
[2:03:03] bookworm2692: when i started minecraft there were only four wood types... now theres like ten, its crazy
[2:03:06] kattituude: TBF Sausage is not normal
[2:03:12] Karnasas: Its definitely a harsh change from having all these different mod packs that you get used to using and relying on. Weird how  having less things to deal with is more stressfull in some ways
[2:03:15] Esstyy: Axe in your offhand to strip while placing helps
[2:03:17] pinksox_: sausage is just cracked
[2:03:18] lilydeboef: bring the donkey over and see how it goes
[2:03:19] barnrazor: No white wood, but there are a lot of white textures in game
[2:03:19] datguccipoochie: he has mythical powers
[2:03:20] UrgezGaming: Expand on the bundles mod used for the tcg decks
[2:03:23] itsthenars: sausage is goated with the sauce mans on another level
[2:03:23] voidthebear: I am still lurkiong
[2:03:24] daredevil2300: backpack in off hand = a pack with wheels
[2:03:25] tildalovesthedoctor: @xWildSlicerx yeah i would just worry that theyd make it too bright
[2:03:29] antalia_lotus: crazy pearliePalm
[2:03:30] sionnach46: There are so many different coloured blocks I want in Minecraft.
[2:03:34] UrgezGaming: They are too small
[2:03:40] ohgeezkai: I always kinda wished they added extra slots beside the armour for stuff like spy glasses & backpacks...
[2:03:40] lilydeboef: maybe the essence of sausage donkey will help you build
[2:03:42] Mathlete34: They should expand inventory just because of the expanded number of blocks
[2:03:42] magicclemons: maybe he has building fairies?
[2:03:45] datguccipoochie: no yeah bundles were a complete flop of an idea
[2:03:50] scotchramune: ngl I hate them
[2:03:51] sparkysure: Purses would be funny
[2:03:53] kennediem: I think it was GREAT for early game!
[2:03:56] pastel_cottontail: I’ve heard the vault hunters ppl struggle to readjust to vanilla lol. keep pressing heal keys that don’t do anything for example
[2:03:58] Sparcles5: completely forgot bundles exist lol StinkyCheese Never use them
[2:04:01] kzenmatthias: The toolbox in create is very nice
[2:04:05] itsthenars: a bundle -> backpack -> shulker progression would be so good
[2:04:06] BertPotato: Yep, I want to be able to search the bundle in the same way I can search a real bag of items
[2:04:07] UrgezGaming: Can also only hold 1 unstackable
[2:04:08] xWildSlicerx: @tildalovesthedoctor Yeah. But its easy enough to add your own texture. I would end up changing it if it wasn't good enough.
[2:04:09] mulanv44: Yeah I feel like bundles could easily be more like a backpack
[2:04:10] Syysmyrskytuuli: I think they're pretty much intended for early game
[2:04:12] doxisontwitchnow: yeah, early game exploring they are great, but yeah retrieving was a nightmare
[2:04:24] gamernurse911: Pearl, need to thank you  for helping me feel less depressed. You're an Angel
[2:04:31] Goscalyon: yeah inventory fills up with 5 min
[2:04:33] GaspsHiChat: i feel like minecraft needs an inventory or end update
[2:04:33] pinksox_: bundles work well with my play style, i usually put my most used items on top
[2:04:33] UrgezGaming: But they only hold 1 unstackable item
[2:04:33] BertPotato: I do think the requirement of rabbit skin is excessive, leather should be fine
[2:04:34] tildalovesthedoctor: yeah and some flowers that sorta thing
[2:04:35] xWildSlicerx: Really dislike bundles. Period. They work too oddly imo
[2:04:36] Mathlete34: I love the chest boat for early game....epic
[2:04:44] SmilinVikingMC: As a vanilla console Bedrock player giving Java a shot, everything feels modded!
[2:04:45] antalia_lotus: yes
[2:04:50] Goscalyon: something like a seed bag or something
[2:04:52] daredevil2300: yup
[2:05:01] datguccipoochie: imagine, fill a backpack with bundles, fill a shulker with backpacks, and fill a chest with those shulkers
[2:05:15] BertPotato: yep, you get laden with things
[2:05:15] waarisdetaart: but you need habbit hide to craft it, which is hard to come by imo
[2:05:18] datguccipoochie: its like an exponentially large russian doll
[2:05:18] Nightbot:  Be respectful - No spamming - No advertising - English only
[2:05:19] UrgezGaming: We use them for or tcg pack too lol tested things lol they are handy for early caving
[2:05:20] Yuuta_Boner: hi pearl
[2:05:21] tildalovesthedoctor: random village loot
[2:05:22] gamernurse911: You've really helped me get out of me head this last year
[2:05:26] KiroDaChurro: Bundles would be super helpful for that one stick left over after crafting a pickaxe and sword
[2:05:29] pinksox_: pixlriffs changed my mind on bundles
[2:05:30] Silvery_13: I use my bundle as a wallet, more or less.  I put a clock and compass in first - things that you will never take out - and then like diamonds and emeralds.  Still frees up a few slots.  Small help but does help.
[2:05:34] Yuuta_Boner: i love ur yt vids
[2:05:37] Syysmyrskytuuli: I thought it was bc it didn't work in Bedrock
[2:05:37] HervideR0: shulkers should be accessible from inventory in vanilla, then it is a late(r) game thing.
[2:05:49] Yuuta_Boner: this is my 1st week ysing twitch tho
[2:05:55] datguccipoochie: no they exist without datapacks now, you just have to enable them as an "experimental feature" upon making the world
[2:05:56] tildalovesthedoctor: bundles would be so good for the first exploration finding a home base
[2:05:58] BertPotato: He likes them generally and thinks the rabbit fur requirement isn't hard to get
[2:06:04] itsthenars: a "mouse over>scroll wheel to select" mechanic would work perfectly for bundles and intuitive for players
[2:06:15] Nightbot: Remember to check out the Frequently Asked Questions (#faq) channel on discord!
[2:06:15] kennediem: I think a good vanilla way to add backpacks would be to only allow 1-2 backpacks in your inventory at a time. Otherwise they become shulkers. Plus who carries more than one backpack irl. They also shouldn't be allowed in shulkers.
[2:06:23] Minerva_246: AUSSIE AUSSIE AUSSIE
[2:06:27] gamernurse911: If AUS needed nurses I'd move
[2:06:29] Shenko: I use my bundle for function blocks, Ender Chest, Clock, Stonecutter, etc. Really good for keeping all of the function blocks at the ready! pearlieFingerGuns
[2:06:34] xxthemythicalegendxx: Aussie love
[2:06:35] sionnach46: 2 years?!
[2:06:39] lilydeboef: im a committed vic aussie
[2:06:45] colorfulchew: colorfulchew subscribed at Tier 3. They've subscribed for 47 months, currently on a 47 month streak! Aussie Aussie Aussie
[2:06:45] pinksox_: i cant remember specifically what pix said that persuaded me, it was more that he constantly found uses for them
[2:06:46] jasminebea1: jasminebea1 subscribed at Tier 1. 
[2:06:49] Yuuta_Boner: Cant wait for hermitcraft 10 gosh
[2:06:49] UrgezGaming: It's when building that extra slots come in very handy
[2:06:57] xx_imcutefoxx: Hi it my first time in your stream
[2:07:02] xxthemythicalegendxx: nsw Aussie here
[2:07:03] joliemaya: Hello this is my first time seeing your stream:)
[2:07:05] jasminebea1: it doesn’t feel like 2 years
[2:07:07] BertPotato: It's not always easy to find rabbits depending on your spawn location and if you're in a  large biome world it becomes hard
[2:07:12] DylanP31: I could carry 4 backpacks easy
[2:07:15] Nightbot:  Don't be a dry potato, remember to stay hydrated!
[2:07:19] UrgezGaming: Rebuilding scarland rn and would loooove like 20 more hot bar slots
[2:07:23] Goscalyon: yup
[2:07:27] KiroDaChurro: I would honestly love even just 9 extra inventory slots
[2:07:33] gooniekatie: nesting shucker boxes?
[2:07:40] camilla_rep: inventory sorter would be nice
[2:07:44] datguccipoochie: i imagine bundles would be super cool if they could hold a lot of items - like 1024 items - but they could only be one item kind
[2:07:47] pinksox_: my biggest use tor bundles is hold my ender chest, gold apples, and crafting table +plus additional stuff
[2:07:52] Sparcles5: the inventory situation is ridiculous
[2:07:53] waarisdetaart: what's your opinion on them adding more rows in the inventory?
[2:07:53] diarrhea_lad: increasing stack size would be nice
[2:08:02] Cameron9108: G%
[2:08:04] Karnasas: a little item wheel would be nice that displays different item blocks of the same material type
[2:08:06] tyry95: paxel was nice to discover in modded
[2:08:07] BertPotato: I think it's a combination of solutions, increased stack size would help, bundles for the odd items + something that lets you remotely access a storage might be useful
[2:08:11] UrgezGaming: Just expand invorty slots to match a double chest??
[2:08:12] Nightbot:  Join the discord: https://discord.gg/pearlescentmoon
[2:08:16] magicclemons: it would be cool if late game you could earn more inventory space with maybe quests or certain advancements maybe?
[2:08:16] sapphicwhimsy: hypnotizing to watch you place and strip those logs holy moly
[2:08:16] Cameron9108: 63% on the warden
[2:08:19] kitty_jaifei: whats ur fav smp you have been in
[2:08:27] frostyfly31122: def would like them to add a toolbelt to free up the hotbar slots
[2:08:29] Esstyy: I've had the idea of having allay resupply your stacks from nearby inventories. Makes them a bit more useful as well
[2:08:31] glitchered: itemswapper exists. still limited room.
[2:08:33] ml_jynxx: Cheer100  Morning PearlescentMoon hi chat
[2:08:45] colorfulchew: I always enjoyed games that have void backpacks that just stack literally every item you collect, but it doesn't quite fit Minecraft
[2:08:50] clacomis66: PopNemo
[2:08:51] camilla_rep: 64 also seems like a weird number for a stack, why not 100?
[2:09:08] UrgezGaming: That's true larger stacks would help a bit
[2:09:11] pancake_lover_333: they should get like a rare item that’s like a shulker but in your inventory
[2:09:26] datguccipoochie: @camilla_rep its 2^6 power tho!
[2:09:30] Bloopino: larger stack size?
[2:09:38] BertPotato: I think they mean an expanding inventory space
[2:09:38] jasminebea1: pearlieHype
[2:09:41] Karnasas: whelp
[2:09:45] ml_jynxx: Cheer100  I'm good thanks, how's the hardcore going?
[2:09:48] wesbatesart: The problem is an inventory update can't be sold as a plushy
[2:09:48] kitty_jaifei: pearl whats ur fav smp you have been in pearlieHeart
[2:09:53] Exirel: A scroll wheel is super annoying on keyboard/mouse.
[2:09:55] jasminebea1: pearlieHype pearlieHype pearlieHype pearlieHype pearlieHype pearlieHype
[2:09:56] UrgezGaming: Larger stacks would help with building cause yoy often need many of the same item
[2:09:56] datguccipoochie: i'd absolutely love if bundles were just large at the expense of only holding one kind of item
[2:09:58] colorfulchew: Like, if you picked up dirt it'd just go into your backpack and stacks infinitely. You'd have a whole lot of dirt in Minecraft tho
[2:09:58] ItsFineSlugline: @camilla_rep It's a power of 2, which seems fitting for a programmer to choose. LUL
[2:10:01] sapphicwhimsy: a toolbelt to put all your tools in would be cool
[2:10:01] Exirel: It's great for controller tho.
[2:10:02] egerou: something more like stardew: auto put into chest button!!!
[2:10:03] xWildSlicerx: I'm not sure the different ui for cycling through items is the right call for vanilla.
[2:10:05] bookworm2692: xisuma made a mod with the scroll wheel thing...
[2:10:07] tfm1ndostries: In my favourite game, it’s not solved with limited slots but with weigh
[2:10:07] mikeblogowski: mikeblogowski subscribed with Prime. 
[2:10:08] terkk18: maybe bring something into the game that allows for larger stacks of items
[2:10:20] Exirel: tbh just "auto sort inventory" would be a huge QoL improvement
[2:10:22] Nightbot:  Reminder to be kind in chat!
[2:10:26] strawberryshortkayy: like how stardewvalley stacks up to 999
[2:10:29] magicclemons: an auto organise would be nice like stardew
[2:10:45] Neamow: there's a mod for that
[2:10:46] datguccipoochie: the void bag/vault in terraria is just a genius way to fix inventory space
[2:10:46] colorfulchew: Oh I've seen it done, you just have a scrolling list of every item in the game and a search box so you can find them easily
[2:10:48] blueguineapig78: MouseWheelie
[2:10:49] waarisdetaart: only if you can customize the way it orders things lol
[2:10:51] BertPotato: @wesbatesart Nor could bundles, nor auto-crafters, nor any of the other blocks.
[2:10:54] littylatin: maybe use composters to split up the spruce and oak!
[2:11:01] xWildSlicerx: @Neamow We're talking vanilla. Meaning, not aided by mods.
[2:11:03] sionnach46: @Exirel I would love that so much.
[2:11:05] gooniekatie: stacks beyond 64?
[2:11:15] Nightbot:  Don't become a french fry, be a good potato, remember to follow the stream!
[2:11:31] mikeblogowski: FIrst time sending my prime sub to a MC creator and not fortnite haha. Love your vibes in the Life Series so swung by to check a stream!
[2:11:34] colorfulchew: If you think about it, it's a lot cheaper for the game to store one stack of every item in the game than a bunch of chests of small stacks of each item :D
[2:11:37] TheRainbowSatan: TheRainbowSatan subscribed with Prime. 
[2:11:38] itsthenars: vanilla servers kill me cause i cant use polymorph or inventory sort or mouse tweaks, i just suffer
[2:11:38] tildalovesthedoctor: we need the buttons that quark has for inventory sorting
[2:11:39] Exirel: One of the issue with anything around inventory, is that at some point, how much of a survival game vs a creative game do you want?
[2:11:39] littylatin: maybe use composters to split up the spruce and oak!
[2:11:43] kitty_jaifei: whats ur fav smp you have been in btw love your streams
[2:11:49] Esstyy: Netherite armour could have a property that would make you stronger, allowing you to carry larger stacks.
[2:11:50] datguccipoochie: also i must go to school now, have a nice stream and y'all have a good day!
[2:11:59] UrgezGaming: Season 10 hermit craft gonna be fun. Early game is alot different with the villager changes and templates
[2:12:04] kezren_: pearlieHype pearlieHype
[2:12:10] BertPotato: I think one of the problems with "The inventory problem" is that there's not one problem, there are many people with different problems
[2:12:10] Sparcles5: oh nooooo!
[2:12:14] Nightbot:  Follow Pearl in all the places: https://www.youtube.com/pearlescentmoon  https://twitter.com/PearlescentMoon https://www.instagram.com/pearlescentmoo/
[2:12:14] Sparcles5: the painnn
[2:12:14] zilchiss: Pallet item, held in offhand, can open and close to get access to more inventory. Enchant for more inventory or increased stacks
[2:12:15] Neamow: pearliePalm
[2:12:15] Cameron9108: NOOOO
[2:12:17] littylatin: maybe use composters to split up the spruce and oak!
[2:12:18] blueguineapig78: Stacks beyond 64 only helps for large builds.
[2:12:18] antalia_lotus: pearlieSad pearliePepe
[2:12:19] Goscalyon: even :S
[2:12:24] pastel_cottontail: pearliePepe
[2:12:30] m1p000: fragme21Waggle fragme21Waggle fragme21Waggle fragme21Waggle fragme21Waggle fragme21Waggle fragme21Waggle
[2:12:30] colorfulchew: Yeah, it makes a lot of systems in Minecraft redundant- but I do enjoy it lol
[2:12:33] xWildSlicerx: Something that is nice from a mod is Sophisticated Backpacks. Where you can upgrade the stack size. So if we had a way to increase stacksize of each slot in our inventory... that could be nice
[2:12:39] m1p000: PizzaTime PizzaTime PizzaTime PizzaTime PizzaTime PizzaTime PizzaTime
[2:12:40] wesbatesart: @bertpotato I disagree. Those could be tangible items sold with minecraft toy sets
[2:12:44] bookworm2692: it would be the size of zedaphs hall of all...
[2:12:45] strawberryshortkayy: no more chest monsters
[2:12:47] woagopossum: i do think more inventory management actions for sorting, though i think it would make sense if some items could stack up to higher than 64, i mean there are already random items that only stack to 16
[2:12:49] JustMadeNinjas: Stack of 999 would be great
[2:12:52] Exirel: Hey, it's room to add decoration! :D
[2:12:53] ZyxFB: Hey everyone, hope you're doing good :)
[2:12:53] xxthemythicalegendxx: can anyone relate to having a full inventory and looking for something to chuck out to pick up something else only to realise when you get back that you had two items that could have stacked in the first place
[2:12:57] littylatin: maybe use composters to split up the spruce and oak!
[2:12:57] sapphicwhimsy: even if not infinite, stacks of 999 would help imo
[2:13:16] pastel_cottontail: at least we’re still doing the same building!
[2:13:16] bollnas99: Hello!
[2:13:40] Neamow: @sapphicwhimsy my words, so many people think it would break the game, but they're just blocks; Terraria made literally that same change and the world didn't fall apart
[2:13:44] UrgezGaming: Pipes and filters mods are great for inventory and would make a nice vanilla add. Reduce redstone lag from massive sorters
[2:13:47] Minerva_246: Instead of stacking in 16/64 it would be awesome if items even stacked to 100, it's that tad bit higher but makes a huge difference!
[2:13:57] bluubuns: Hey, pretty storage means you’ll want to use it more!
[2:14:16] datguccipoochie: ehhh i like things stacking to powers of two in minecraft
[2:14:28] waarisdetaart: @datguccipoochie same lol
[2:14:32] tildalovesthedoctor: @datguccipoochie exactly its so good
[2:14:34] BertPotato: Stack sizes of 1024 it is then
[2:14:38] pastel_cottontail: 16 stacks are generally for throwable items right
[2:14:39] Neamow: @BertPotato +1
[2:14:45] datguccipoochie: 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256...
[2:14:45] wesbatesart: 2 4 6 6 16 32 64 etc
[2:14:52] BertPotato: 1,2,4,8,16,32,64, they double each time (x2)
[2:14:53] tildalovesthedoctor: 256 maybe would be a nice stacking number
[2:14:57] wesbatesart: Oops not 6

[2:15:24] diarrhea_lad: If they were to ever increase stack size, I think 256 would be most likely

[2:15:32] preparedman: Sneeze all you like pearlieHeart
[2:15:33] datguccipoochie: ok i actually need to go to school or i'll be late lol, have a nice one!
[2:15:38] PrincesssJoJo: I sneeze twice a day, no matter what. always.
[2:15:38] bookworm2692: theyre called powers of two bc theyre all of the form "2 to the power of [number]" aka only factors are 2
[2:15:40] Bloopino: i never sneeze... unless i'm streaming i dunno why >:V
[2:15:40] pastel_cottontail: Tango’s Cough meets his greatest enemy: Pearl’s Sneeze!
[2:15:50] xxthemythicalegendxx: @datguccipoochie same, it always is even when stacked to a power of 2, it just looks clean to me
[2:15:53] Sparcles5: oooh that sounds so pretty!
[2:16:00] wesbatesart: @pastel_cottontail haha
[2:16:01] pastel_cottontail: @bloopino you’re allergic to streaming obviously
[2:16:05] sionnach46: Stream allergy?
[2:16:07] lilydeboef: i swear you have the softest sneeze ever my sneezes sound like my granddad
[2:16:12] smollbeans72: shinnWaving
[2:16:16] autum_mist_101: Allergic to chat
[2:16:17] frostyfly31122: sounds like the desk might need a little dusting gluThink
[2:16:18] ebzarug: what i can see mojang doing is introducing enchantments for shulkerboxes, for example autoreplenishing/autostoring items from/into shulkers in your inventory or in a certain radius around you
[2:16:24] Virtua1Prodigy: I like the idea of just making "on-person storage" infinite and accessible just like playing in creative where you can just search for the item you want. The downside to keeping it all on hand though and not using permanent storage rooms would be that you lose everything when you die.
[2:16:26] UrgezGaming: Lol remaking decked out 1 rightnow with updated decked out 2 systems. Totally naming a ravanger pearls sneeze!!!!
[2:16:35] diarrhea_lad: oooh that looks nice
[2:16:37] pastel_cottontail: I know someone who ALWAYS sneezes in 3s it’s so weird
[2:16:37] waarisdetaart: oooo love that
[2:16:45] pastel_cottontail: like three in a row
[2:16:45] wesbatesart: Increasing the stack size wouldn't feel "minecrafty" 64 is a staple of the game
[2:16:48] cupofjasmtea: that looks so pretty!
[2:16:52] GaspsHiChat: i either don't sneeze or i sneeze fifteen times in thirty minutes
[2:16:52] preparedman: I do that
[2:16:52] BertPotato: Stack size + sorting/search + ways of expanding shulker's storage capacity through crafting/enchantment perhaps
[2:16:53] Neamow: I do sneeze in threes too
[2:17:08] maxibon98: nice street
[2:17:10] pastel_cottontail: I’m always a 2-sneezer
[2:17:20] ilikepancakes44: hi
[2:17:21] PrincesssJoJo: My sneezes are random timing but I call it my Daily Sneeze Quota
[2:17:24] pastel_cottontail: it’s coming along so well!!
[2:17:32] waarisdetaart: love the perspective when looking upwards!
[2:17:32] lilydeboef: i always sneeze at work, without fail i sneeze so much there
[2:17:35] Sparcles5: can't wait to see how it turns out!
[2:17:37] diarrhea_lad: I think my sneeze record is 7. My ribs hurt after that.
[2:17:38] sapphicwhimsy: no they dont
[2:17:44] the_mmx: LUL
[2:17:46] sionnach46: No. They are dead.
[2:17:48] UrgezGaming: I like the grave stone mod, shows death indicator and don't explode your kit all over the place
[2:17:48] pastel_cottontail: I mean. they are dead. so.
[2:17:58] wesbatesart: Undead don't age apparently
[2:18:10] waarisdetaart: thats so annoying
[2:18:13] Exirel: Oooooh this is so annoying!
[2:18:21] GaspsHiChat: agh all this sneeze talk is making me need to sneeze lmaooo
[2:18:24] celinabena: UNdead
[2:18:25] desokit_: thats so true! I hate those sneezes
[2:18:25] sionnach46: Undead and unaging.
[2:18:30] pastel_cottontail: I always want to say something when people cough but there’s not a social script like “bless you” for sneezes
[2:18:33] alexyap0223: pearlieLOL
[2:18:36] AstroR0b: the worst thing is sneezing when driving
[2:18:36] ZyxFB: I feel like there's some relief when you sneeze so I like it
[2:18:42] UrgezGaming: Will they starve out eventually???
[2:18:42] drogonsfire: Forever young
[2:18:42] daredevil2300: I will one up you. it only bugs me when in the restroom. 😜🤣
[2:18:51] diarrhea_lad: Can you imagine what would happen if a zombie died again of old age
[2:18:52] gwynnypooo: I’m an overthinker sneezer. I feel it coming and overthink it and then it goes away and I don’t sneeze. it’s awful lol 😆
[2:18:53] BertPotato: On the bright side, they don't need to buy increasingly larger clothes for their kids
[2:18:54] Starlight_N7: hi pearl. hi chat starli234LOVE
[2:19:01] magicclemons: i think the worst sneeze is when you have a sore throat
[2:19:02] sionnach46: @pastel_cottontail Just say "Stop". /j
[2:19:19] AtulKart: In bedrock I think baby zombie grow up..
[2:19:22] PeridotLion: Hey chat, how long have we been in this hardcore world??
[2:19:47] lilydeboef: @pastel_cottontail i tell people bless you no matter what, cough, sneeze, hiccup, anything
[2:19:51] woagopossum: @PeridotLion over 1000 days
[2:19:53] detsub: This archway reminds me of a street in a small town on the greek island Lesvos.
[2:20:04] UrgezGaming: Be jokes to be able to breed the hoslte mobs lol 😂
[2:20:05] GaspsHiChat: @peridotlion around 1060 days
[2:20:12] Cameron9108: @peridotlion ever since today because I'm sick
[2:20:17] UrgezGaming: Feed a creeper tnt to breed em lmfao 😂
[2:20:19] itsthenars: @pastel_cottontail "correct" is a funny one
[2:20:51] camilla_rep: i ran a minecard hopper system under my sniffers to catch all their drops, it was great
[2:20:56] bossdogone: jdykes2 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 28 months! good morning
[2:21:06] PeridotLion: Thanks chat!
[2:21:10] pastel_cottontail: thanks for the suggestions for cough responses chat! I usually go with “you okay?/you good?” lol
[2:21:19] sapphicwhimsy: gotta strip him
[2:21:52] miracleasl: Pearl just seems like the most huggable person with the way she talks pearlieHeart
[2:21:58] waarisdetaart: they eat humans not zombies
[2:22:02] UrgezGaming: Lol scar would open a creeper sanctuary
[2:22:02] wesbatesart: That's disturbing but it seems correct
[2:22:03] preparedman: I'd say player heads
[2:22:03] lilydeboef: zombie cannibalism
[2:22:07] pastel_cottontail: they put together a new baby zombie with bits of rotten flesh, Cleo style
[2:22:10] xWildSlicerx: Breed Zombie by feeding them YOU.
[2:22:13] picella8: Hihi! sorry was lurking until now! what we working on? :)
[2:22:26] wesbatesart: @urgezgaming true. And charge hermits to see it
[2:22:27] itsthenars: i would think any raw meat but rotten flesh works
[2:22:34] magicclemons: i would breed them with a player head
[2:22:38] Asterionm: ofc moon loves you straight away
[2:22:39] Exirel: That's so cute! :D
[2:22:47] waarisdetaart: @xWildSlicerx Die by being attacked by 2 zombies and they'll breed... xD
[2:22:57] UrgezGaming: Lol his sales pitch "only a small chance a of death"
[2:22:58] tyler_j_kovalskas: Breeding zAmBiEs would require villager brains.. oh wait, those don't exist... That's why you can't breed them... marrie20ROFL1 carlcraftsFacePalm carlcraftsFacePalm carlcraftsFacePalm carlcraftsLaugh carlcraftsLaugh carlcraftsLaugh carlcraftsLUL
[2:23:06] sapphicwhimsy: YESSSS the shiny coven stays winning
[2:23:23] castlebeki: it's so great eclipse is green and which is blue (moon) and yellow (sun)
[2:23:27] wesbatesart: How to breed hostile mobs is an amusing thought experiment
[2:23:31] greegypt: Pride111 have you mined the block at (0, 0, 0) in this world, and if not (and it's not in a cave) would it be redeemable?
[2:23:39] alexyap0223: pearlieExcited
[2:23:40] waarisdetaart: that sounds so cool
[2:23:43] arizonrose: meat golem...
[2:23:43] kattituude: That would be super cool
[2:23:46] Neamow: Enderman-Creeper hybrid, teleports to you and explodes
[2:23:53] UrgezGaming: They shouldn't have had the blue breedable
[2:23:54] preparedman: Makes me think of the fossil Pokémon in sword and shield
[2:23:57] picella8: I procrastinate by organising so making a new storage system sounds fun!
[2:24:12] UrgezGaming: Once your server has one the rarity is gone
[2:24:29] itsthenars: like pink sheeps in the wild...
[2:24:40] visionszd: Agreed, and breeding them is a huge chore that's no fun whatsoever
[2:24:41] pastel_cottontail: like the archeological disk!
[2:24:45] UrgezGaming: One that evolves
[2:24:46] pastel_cottontail: RELIC that’s it
[2:24:47] DetectiveInspectorMe: Netherite golem
[2:24:49] spootyhead25: "meat: gollums
[2:24:54] tyler_j_kovalskas: Doodie golems??? carlcraftsFacePalm carlcraftsFacePalm carlcraftsFacePalm carlcraftsLaugh carlcraftsLUL
[2:24:54] Agent_josh: like the wither...?
[2:25:06] duzloo: Still haven't found the relic disk, so there's that :D
[2:25:12] pancake_lover_333: that’s like the trims
[2:25:17] Agent_josh: the wither is an unbreedable creature with rare hard to get parts
[2:25:18] magicclemons: what about a robot that could maybe do a few commands?
[2:25:21] Sparcles5: that would be an interesting concept
[2:25:23] bluubuns: Like shiny pokemon but in Minecraft
[2:25:26] UrgezGaming: Yep, more gems makes sense
[2:25:29] alexyap0223: pearlieWink
[2:25:32] rainyallay: agreeeeeeed
[2:25:34] marty0metz: A dozen raw emeralds ore blocks misska51Excited
[2:25:35] Sparcles5: yeahh if their items were way better too!
[2:25:36] Kawaiitron_: pearlieWave
[2:25:37] blueguineapig78: The sherds are limited and require exploration. But they aren't as attractive as something like the blue axolotl was.
[2:25:42] UrgezGaming: No way to farm them
[2:25:44] gooniekatie: pearlieHeart
[2:25:47] aerynw: maybe they could make like a good copper golem type of thing and finding the parts would be rare drops within copper nodes
[2:25:52] Sparcles5: pearlieLOL
[2:25:55] Esstyy: Sell crops to wandering traders to make rubies. And then we're halfway to Stardew Valley :p
[2:25:56] pastel_cottontail: wonder what the ruby ore texture would look like vs redstone ore. probably darker?
[2:25:57] tyler_j_kovalskas: Maybe wandering lead salesmen could take lapis as a currency? carlcraftsLUL carlcraftsFacePalm
[2:26:00] Kawaiitron_: Free leads are exciting, are they not?
[2:26:02] Exirel: You can't farm diamond so far.
[2:26:08] Neamow: this is exactly my problem with the wandering trader, they only sell junk - Terraria's wantering trader sells interesting and unique cosmetics and decorations
[2:26:10] antalia_lotus: yes pearlieWow
[2:26:16] xxthemythicalegendxx: mojang needs to hire Pearl
[2:26:19] slammanfish: wandering traders should give better enchantments like efficiency 6, sharp 6, etc
[2:26:19] woagopossum: the problem is that theres not really anything hard to find in the game
[2:26:19] Stormi_Stik: i wish wandering traders did return trades
[2:26:23] Minerva_246: And making it you can't trade for rubies with regular villagers
[2:26:25] UrgezGaming: Doc bore farms em
[2:26:27] sapphicwhimsy: you can farm diamond tools and armor with villagers though
[2:26:28] Nightbot:  Be respectful - No spamming - No advertising - English only
[2:26:29] drogonsfire: Wandering Traders could give end game stuff like Elytras and Shulkers
[2:26:37] alexyap0223: pearlieLOL
[2:26:40] Exirel: Well they are mostly useless once you have villagers (weaponsmith, armorsmoth, toolsmith, etc.)
[2:26:44] diarrhea_lad: "oh boy. Orange dye"
[2:26:50] UrgezGaming: Docs bore farmed em so well he used em as just blocks lol
[2:26:51] seibaby: Wandering traders are boring in vanilla survival but nearly essential in skyblock
[2:26:54] sami_spoon: I didn't know leads could be crafted for so long and I thought it was super weird that you had to attack a passive mob to get them HypeLUL
[2:26:54] Agent_josh: technically you dont need diamonds, since you can trade for diamond armor and tools
[2:27:00] antalia_lotus: yes
[2:27:05] explodingmayhem949: Hello, how is everyone?
[2:27:07] Sparcles5: it would be amazing!
[2:27:11] wesbatesart: It's hard to balance rarity when you have casual players that play a few hours a week and players the play several hours a day
[2:27:12] Kawaiitron_: @drogonsfire That sounds a bit too OP. Maybe they could sell maps to end cities instead? That way, you still have to get to the End.
[2:27:13] kira_plays_ff: if you’ve ever watched docm then you know you can farm diamonds LUL
[2:27:14] itsthenars: not only are wandering traders boring, theyre annoying in a lot of cases
[2:27:17] Stormi_Stik: imagine wandering piglin trader
[2:27:17] Exirel: Talking about enchantement... what about the beta feature of villager rebalance?
[2:27:23] Nightbot: Remember to check out the Frequently Asked Questions (#faq) channel on discord!
[2:27:38] waarisdetaart: the trial key right
[2:27:41] waarisdetaart: is new
[2:27:44] Cameron9108: Maybe also get the ability to dye emeralds red to make them look like Ruby's and get a 5% chance of it working
[2:27:44] DetectiveInspectorMe: there's the trial keys
[2:27:46] pastel_cottontail: throwback to s8 when scar was killed by a wandering reader llama
[2:27:48] UrgezGaming: He scales with a group too
[2:27:48] spidr001: they've added netherite to the nether, i think next they need to add some rare ore to the end. i think the danger of mining in the end would make it pretty satisfying to get
[2:27:51] Stormi_Stik: the trial key has no use yet
[2:28:00] seibaby: There are a lot of meh vanilla mechanics that become really useful in weird challenge runs (desert worlds, skyblock) or speedruns
[2:28:00] antalia_lotus: you can get dimonds from the trial
[2:28:00] keshkup: They stole it from Tango I'm pretty sure ahahah
[2:28:04] castlebeki: i wish wandering traders would sell spawn eggs, that way superflats would have more variety of mobs too.
[2:28:06] Agent_josh: what we NEED is an end update
[2:28:17] Agent_josh: there are a collective like 5 end blocks and 2 end mobs like wth
[2:28:21] Nightbot:  Reminder to be kind in chat!
[2:28:21] bluubuns: If only we had a nice Warden drop
[2:28:21] Stormi_Stik: @spidr001 yea like making it only spawn on the bottom y levels of end islands
[2:28:23] wesbatesart: A new boss mob would be cool
[2:28:23] gooniekatie: @joshtheagentpig Yes!
[2:28:23] woagopossum: i think those chambers are mostly going to be free oxidized copper
[2:28:29] Exirel: The Warden isn't really a "boss", as you are not supposed to fight it.
[2:28:35] UrgezGaming: Just need a a room of witches lol 😂 boss fight level stress
[2:28:36] blueguineapig78: silence or roaring
[2:28:39] GaspsHiChat: warden isn't a boss iirc. you're not meant to try and fight/kill it
[2:28:43] alexyap0223: pearlieRaid
[2:28:43] Kawaiitron_: Petition to make Mojang work with the creator of BetterEnd, that mod is a must-have for me.
[2:28:55] itsthenars: warden isnt really a boss, just a really tough mob - we really need a Proper Boss...
[2:28:59] UrgezGaming: Room of witches much harder lol
[2:29:06] sionnach46: The elder guardians are also kinda bosses.
[2:29:07] marty0metz: misska51VOID did anyone else find a dead reptile just now?
[2:29:13] desokit_: ooo yeah some ost/boss music would add a lot
[2:29:14] waarisdetaart: you can also spawn multiple withers right?
[2:29:17] hummus_yummus: I just joined!
[2:29:17] Nightbot:  Don't be a dry potato, remember to stay hydrated!
[2:29:18] Agent_josh: i dont get how the elder guardian is a boss like-
[2:29:19] Stormi_Stik: if they are going to add a new realm then bring back the aether
[2:29:28] wesbatesart: @urgezgaming witch boss sounds cool
[2:29:30] seibaby: I'm going to wager that the trial keys are just loot tokens
[2:29:37] Poghorn2: Well... If you're hardcore enough you spawn more than one wither aswell!
[2:29:48] UrgezGaming: I love the way you summon the wither, that's a cool boss mechanic
[2:29:50] wesbatesart: @joshtheagentpig yea. Their like a mini boss
[2:29:55] Kawaiitron_: @poghorn2 Or when you just want to see the world burn in creative. pearlieLOL
[2:29:56] bluubuns: End update would be so cool, more weird plants and stuff
[2:30:00] crysthemist: could the key go to that portal thing in ancient cities? that would be cool
[2:30:03] wesbatesart: *they're
[2:30:04] BuzzCube_: h e l o
[2:30:05] sami_spoon: the generation confuses me, they say it's procedurally generated but so far it looks like a set structure under ground. curious how the final product will look
[2:30:10] pastel_cottontail: @urgezgaming is has that collecting parts aspect Pearl wants more of!
[2:30:12] Agent_josh: @crysthemist wait genius
[2:30:13] Sparcles5: exactly
[2:30:15] sionnach46: The wither fight is better in Bedrock.
[2:30:18] Kawaiitron_: I once spawned hundreds of bees and they killed the Wither.
[2:30:27] Kawaiitron_: In Bedrock.
[2:30:28] Sparcles5: yesss that's still a mystery!
[2:30:30] revaar61: $5 says the unique loot would be an armor trim
[2:30:32] 0wren: i love ancient city lore
[2:30:34] waarisdetaart: something that makes Deepslate insta mine-able.... one can dream
[2:30:34] 19_meg_91: a key should "open" something
[2:30:38] AstroR0b: what if the key unlocks the deep dark frame in the middle of the city
[2:30:39] cars2ondvd_: Elden ring is such a beautiful example of how to make a good boss fight, it would be awesome if minecraft had more bosses
[2:30:41] mulanv44: Could the key go to level 5 of decked out?
[2:30:45] UrgezGaming: Should have to find somthing in "the four corners of the world" to assemble to fight a final boss
[2:30:53] mustavariz: Hello Pearl!
[2:31:18] Nightbot:  Don't become a french fry, be a good potato, remember to follow the stream!
[2:31:28] tibblaye_the_fallimento: id love to see some items that changes the model of tools and weapons
[2:31:31] UrgezGaming: Probs a chest with loot spawned based on the number of players like every other game
[2:31:36] keshkup: Bosses in Twilight Forest feel so Vanilla core, and they're pretty huge. Seeing something like that in the base game would be so cool
[2:31:57] bluubuns: Tool trims? haha
[2:31:58] UrgezGaming: Wish trims worked on tools and weapons
[2:32:00] rainyallay: minecraft lore is so cool but i make up so many ideas of my own i forget what is actually in game lol
[2:32:04] seibaby: I'm happy about getting actual keys in the game (without resource packs) because using tripwire hooks for keys like in DO1 is jank pearlieLOL
[2:32:09] itsthenars: model changes for tools would be so nice actually
[2:32:17] Nightbot:  Join the discord: https://discord.gg/pearlescentmoon
[2:32:23] Sparcles5: yesss deepslate is so painful now
[2:32:24] crysthemist: I would love armor trims things but for tools and weapons. I feel that’s a nobrainer
[2:32:26] diarrhea_lad: It's a crime that glass isn't insta-mine
[2:32:41] slammanfish: beacons should be upgradeable with netherite imo
[2:32:44] UrgezGaming: It's the new norm, things in games take long cause it's longer game play lol
[2:32:46] the_mmx: You can instamine deepslate with moss
[2:32:49] bluubuns: Elytra trims pearlieSad
[2:32:52] ohgeezkai: Netherite should let you tobe honest.
[2:32:57] KatieTwinkle: The Breeze could drop Efficiency 6 books.
[2:33:08] desokit_: why did they have to make a block that's so good to build with so annoying to get-
[2:33:10] sapphicwhimsy: for the flex
[2:33:11] Virtua1Prodigy: An "Ultimate" beacon that prevents mob spawns would be great for the home base.
[2:33:12] seibaby: Why no copper beacon :/
[2:33:15] autum_mist_101: Should let you insta-mine glass as well.
[2:33:15] Nightbot:  Follow Pearl in all the places: https://www.youtube.com/pearlescentmoon  https://twitter.com/PearlescentMoon https://www.instagram.com/pearlescentmoo/
[2:33:18] sionnach46: I do wish there was a way to hide armor as well. So you can still show off your skin.
[2:33:23] Sparcles5: exactly pearlieLOL what's the point of mining it so slowly at endgame
[2:33:26] jenny_b14: it’s a flex I suppose
[2:33:54] crysthemist: on the server I play on, we have a plug-in where if you have an efficiency V netherite pick and a haste 2 beacon, you can insta one deepslate
[2:33:57] Kawaiitron_: Random, but my kitten Parrot is currently calm for once and laying on me. pearlieOlive
[2:34:02] AJayFeenix: The resources does not change the beakon strength right?
[2:34:05] revaar61: beacon effects being determined by what base they have would be a huge change
[2:34:11] woagopossum: i wish they could lean into more random tool, armour and bonuses to make collectging them more interestinfg and exciting but i think some problems come up with inequality in servers
[2:34:38] Sparcles5: yeah makes sense
[2:34:39] UrgezGaming: Pvp is why inventory will never get a boost tbh
[2:34:42] 0wren: pvp servers could just disable that
[2:34:52] DetectiveInspectorMe: maybe have a setting to always show armour?
[2:34:54] crysthemist: imo a netherite pick should be able to insta mine deepslate. the incentive for netherite is there and it makes sense
[2:34:55] kofithekofin: Am back woohoo
[2:35:04] KhenbiKenobi: make it so invisibility potions work on armor, but make the option toggleable so can turn off for PvP servers.
[2:35:17] thedarkeagle587: hi
[2:35:19] Nightbot:  Be respectful - No spamming - No advertising - English only
[2:35:25] sionnach46: I never play pvp in Minecraft.
[2:35:28] UrgezGaming: Should just be an option to play one way or another in main menu
[2:35:41] autum_mist_101: PvE?
[2:35:48] sapphicwhimsy: imo its funny since mojang doesnt even have official servers to play on for PVP
[2:35:53] UrgezGaming: Player vs environment
[2:36:12] diarrhea_lad: But then I feel like if it's changed for everyone it's back to a level playing field
[2:36:29] UrgezGaming: I like minecraft cause pvp isant the focus of the Devs
[2:36:29] majora_16: Hello
[2:36:54] alexyap0223: pearlieWoo
[2:36:55] Flip128_: what do you think 1.21 will be about?
[2:37:00] Goscalyon: yeess
[2:37:01] sionnach46: Yes!
[2:37:05] artleuartsm: please
[2:37:06] GaspsHiChat: different wood type beds would be so fun too
[2:37:06] spidr001: i think the problem with improving minecraft is something that benefits one group hinders another, like explorers would love super rare blocks but then it would be annoying for builders i think
[2:37:08] Kanavitas: colour coded chests!
[2:37:10] blueguineapig78: OOOOH yes please!
[2:37:13] rainyallay: omg PLEASEEEE
[2:37:13] cupofjasmtea: yeah like we have with boats!
[2:37:14] rainyallay: P
[2:37:16] itsthenars: i have never played minecraft pvp so everything about that is alien to me
[2:37:20] Goscalyon: vertical slabs :S
[2:37:21] saleo37: And beds and crafting tables
[2:37:21] cheor33: cheor33 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 21 months! 
[2:37:26] sionnach46: I would love that for other things like ladders too.
[2:37:29] Cameron9108: Yess different chests are needed
[2:37:32] tibblaye_the_fallimento: i want to see qol updates that respect the players time and doesnt make needless grinds
[2:37:33] rainyallay: iNK CHESTSSSSSS i would die of happiness
[2:37:38] diarrhea_lad: I'm excited to try the auto-crafter out
[2:37:40] pastel_cottontail: how about making the fletching table actually do something lol
[2:37:40] seibaby: I keep meaning to get into QoL inventory clienside mods, like I'm already full on using minihud, tweakeroo, litematica, etc. So why not inv mods..
[2:37:41] kofithekofin: Oo like stardew custom coloured chests
[2:37:43] visionszd: Chests would be much more useful than different colored boats
[2:37:44] Spiritwolf1730: Hola amigas...   🖐🖐🏿🖐🖐🏿🖐🖐🏿
[2:37:46] anqmix: i need to get as good as building as u ohh myy gooddd xD
[2:37:51] autum_mist_101: Carpet on stairs!
[2:38:09] UrgezGaming: Even just slab/wall/stairs for each block type already in the game could change alot
[2:38:13] alexyap0223: pearlieLOL
[2:38:18] spidr001: carpet update where you can actually use them like carpets and put things on top of them
[2:38:18] pastel_cottontail: for ice boat racing obviously
[2:38:20] ohgeezkai: If they add verticle slabs then they should call them panels.
[2:38:24] woagopossum: i have enjoyed the updates but sometime i feel like the only thing i can say about them is that they don't make the game worse, i mean i like their ideas but they dont do much for me and dont really effect much of the main game in a meaningful way
[2:38:26] pastel_cottontail: the bamboo boat is very cool tho
[2:38:26] Lissert271: honestly concrete slabs and stairs would also be nice
[2:38:30] kofithekofin: Yes carpet on stairs @autum_mist_101
[2:38:33] LilleSpinat: right now you can make one chest with different wood types
[2:38:34] nymroot: different color barrel would be nice too
[2:38:36] diarrhea_lad: One of the mods I tried had upgradeable chests. Like upgrade it with iron, diamond, etc and it can just hold more
[2:38:42] UrgezGaming: Need a sniffer saddle
[2:38:43] mustavariz: Bamboos aerodynamics
[2:38:44] itsthenars: crafting tables in other wood types... smithing tables in other resource colors... looms in other colors...
[2:38:44] GaspsHiChat: i wish two people could ride a minecart or horse bc that'd be fun
[2:38:47] LiveLaughGnome: chests should at the very least should change color based on wood imo
[2:38:56] castlebeki: chests never had a wood like texture while boats where very obviously oak
[2:39:03] slammanfish: mojang need to stop adding singular things with singular uses and focus on connecting all the systems and adding more depth to gameplay. right now there is no real interesting tasks that requires you to do x before y
[2:39:15] UrgezGaming: Imagine bdubz riding sniffer around... Lmfao 😂
[2:39:35] spidr001: cherry wood chests would change my life
[2:39:36] Spiritwolf1730: Hola amiga...   🖐🖐🏿🖐🖐🏿🖐🖐🏿
[2:39:40] pastel_cottontail: would that also change the black trim on chests? would cherry chests have silver or white trim?
[2:39:41] Goscalyon: @slammanfish I think thats also to make sure all content is approachable enough I suppose
[2:39:45] QueenLyrae: id like dyeable chests instead of different wood type chests
[2:39:47] itsthenars: @urgezgaming moss man riding a moss mount...
[2:39:59] little_birblet: Hello Pearl, hello chat!
[2:40:00] GrathXVI: my go-to in modded is dark oak chests, the nice dark brown with a gold latch
[2:40:02] UrgezGaming: Exactly lol
[2:40:05] pastel_cottontail: riding ravagers and riding sniffers would be so fun
[2:40:07] wesbatesart: What would chests look like made of different wood types
[2:40:08] greegypt: if it exists, may you please name it "greegypt?" (if not, no need to refund but I'd love for you to pick whatever block is speaking to you at the moment) pearliePearlLove
[2:40:12] alexyap0223: pearlieYes
[2:40:12] rainyallay: bamboo chests would have so much potential for a really cool graphic
[2:40:17] deyloop: Concrete stairs, but they are smooth slopes
[2:40:18] ausmac_: i wish you could place sand like you can with snow layers
[2:40:18] Zerofever: id love to have dirt slabs FeelsBadMan
[2:40:18] itsthenars: sand and gravel layers would be nice
[2:40:20] waarisdetaart: didnt they show something a while ago that had layered sand? or am i misremembering
[2:40:21] Nightbot:  Reminder to be kind in chat!
[2:40:21] mary_6_2: Vertical slabs
[2:40:25] mustavariz: Two different slabs in one block would be fun
[2:40:28] sionnach46: Slab dirt that could be made in to slab paths would be so nice for villages.
[2:40:31] eorilia_music: More glass flexibility would be nice
[2:40:32] KhenbiKenobi: slabs and stairs of concrete and terracotta would be fab
[2:40:32] utsalad: why limit chests to wood… stone chests? copper? gold? diamond? chests

[2:40:33] woagopossum: i once played with a mod where you could stack moss carpet like snow and i really wihs that was vanilla
[2:40:35] Goscalyon: I said it before but i would love red/orange leaves
[2:40:41] artleuartsm: Makes it more fun collecting all wood types
[2:40:49] 0wren: @Goscalyon YEEES
[2:40:54] saleo37: Minecraft concrete blocks look like lego bricks. They definitely could change that texture.
[2:40:56] AunluWasHere: hello!:D saw you went live when i was at work but im happy you’re still playing :0
[2:40:58] LilleSpinat: more wall types, like prismarine bricks and smooth sandstone
[2:41:00] RohanaDArilin: slabs of dirt and sand and podzol and such sound good. and stairs and slabs of concrete. I'm on team scar, those are missing.
[2:41:00] visionszd: Gnembon accidentally showed a screenshot with sand layers
[2:41:02] waarisdetaart: oh that might be it
[2:41:05] sapphicwhimsy: i was so excited for archelogy but it ended up being pretty boring
[2:41:13] kofithekofin: pearlieHey pearlieHey pearlieHey
[2:41:16] Nightbot:  Don't become a french fry, be a good potato, remember to follow the stream!
[2:41:21] seibaby: If we can't get sand layers can we at least get yellow snow? Kappa
[2:41:31] greegypt: i redeemed the thing but i forgot to restate what block it was -_- is that ok
[2:41:37] Esstyy: Sand layers are interesting. Sand storms in deserts which leave behind layers like snow in cold biomes.
[2:41:38] UrgezGaming: Saddles should go on any mob lmfao be a funny add
[2:41:45] Spiritwolf1730: pearlieHeart pearlieHeart pearlieHeart pearlieHeart pearlieHeart pearlieHeart

[2:42:45] drogonsfire: I haven't been able to find one on my world

[2:43:54] Kawaiitron_: I typically only spot powdered snow because there won’t be snow layers on top.
[2:43:55] GaspsHiChat: wait powdered snow has a different texture to regular snow ???? i have bad eyes so i never noticed omg
[2:43:57] secret_agent4706: @jaspercoz Goodnight!
[2:44:01] sionnach46: Goodnight Jasper.
[2:44:02] UrgezGaming: Your ruby idea could be found in sus gravel/sand
[2:44:03] jc_crafty00: thos is why O have a texture pack that puts a boarder around it cause its hard for me to tell
[2:44:05] visionszd: @pastel_cottontail That's probably by design, to make it a challenge navigating mountains
[2:44:08] mischieflmanaged: @waarisdetaart good luck!! cya! pearlieHeart
[2:44:11] Aresd57: Phantoms in boats?

[2:44:47] NovaSummoner: HypeDisguise
[2:44:47] castlebeki: brushes are not very intuitive, it's a shame, i wish we would get a "broken item" with a description "try using a brush" when breaking a sus sand/gravel
[2:44:48] saleo37: *rearrangin
[2:44:50] Goscalyon: @Aresd57 how else should they cross the ocean Kappa
[2:45:01] PirateLee03: if there were rare pieces to something you could craft (like the frankenstein creature idea), one of them could be really expensive from a wandering trader
[2:45:07] alexyap0223: pearlieLOL
[2:45:13] UrgezGaming: I'm saving lol
[2:45:14] jhaXous: do you think they will ever implement the functionality they did with the cheese block in last year's april fools? where you can take (eat) a quarter of a block which can essentially give the player a vertical slab.
[2:45:16] pastel_cottontail: @visionszd oh it definitely is! but it was a struggle when my friend and I spawned in a snowy forest and couldn’t figure out how to get out without freezing to death
[2:45:19] Nightbot:  Be respectful - No spamming - No advertising - English only
[2:45:27] Goscalyon: its funny they look like they are rowing in the boats LUL

[2:45:39] UrgezGaming: Saving points for a horse with no name lmfao 😂
[2:45:41] keshkup: I don't like how useless Sniffers are. These cute goofballs need more purpose in life than finding pretty(debatable) flowers
[2:45:51] pastel_cottontail: speaking of food I’m with gem on pumpkin pies can be eaten in slices like cakes
[2:45:58] ausmac_: the cheese was just endstone that you could eat
[2:45:58] jhaXous: yep, the cheese block is a full block
[2:46:01] diarrhea_lad: I would 1000% build with cheese
[2:46:08] sionnach46: Another thing is I would like a different design for the inventory etc. Instead of the greyish white one.
[2:46:16] Nightbot: Remember to check out the Frequently Asked Questions (#faq) channel on discord!
[2:46:21] castlebeki: @keshkup sorry but their existence is enough for me <3
[2:46:21] itsthenars: the cheese looked like pale white endstone so it wasnt that bad
[2:46:23] rainyallay: i want something that complements purpur more, i like the block but i feel like it just doesnt match the game's color palette
[2:46:26] pastel_cottontail: end stone looks like cheese to me
[2:46:29] pancake_lover_333: what cheese are you eating pearl?
[2:46:29] UrgezGaming: Swiss cheese

[2:47:18] ohgeezkai: @tecnoisgod What is your favourite?
[2:47:19] UrgezGaming: So flavored plastic
[2:47:21] pastel_cottontail: hot take but mozzarella >>> parmesan
[2:47:22] Neamow: "generic cheese from the store" ah, plastic pearlieLOL
[2:47:25] tildalovesthedoctor: im allergic to dairy so no cheese for me
[2:47:29] RohanaDArilin: you need a french cheese delivery once in a while ^^
[2:47:32] sionnach46: Ender dragon, wither etc.

[2:47:43] RohanaDArilin: i do'nt ever eat "generic" cheese, that doesn't exist here.
[2:47:48] Monado_Oshawott: charged creepers?
[2:48:03] VoxKeys: I didn't get the notification you were live and i can't stay up, trying to fix my sleep schedule pearlieSad pearlieSad

[2:48:06] jamalthygreat: Hi : 😊
[2:48:12] UrgezGaming: Have you changed a vex to a ally yet?
[2:48:14] seibaby: Generic cheese is like gouda imo
[2:48:21] diarrhea_lad: any brown mooshrooms?
[2:48:23] mischieflmanaged: @pastel_cottontail ooh okay i generally agree, but there is some delicious expensive tasty parmesan
[2:48:35] sarasven: can we redeem a Stray?
[2:48:35] ohgeezkai: @tecnoisgod I've had baby bells, they are quite nice. I remember when I was young I thought the red was edible though...
[2:48:40] saleo37: Would one more sniffer be okay?
[2:48:43] itsthenars: surprised you dont have a one eyed willie

[2:50:17] Goscalyon: oof
[2:50:19] Exirel: All you need is powder snow and transform a skelly with it.
[2:50:27] Goscalyon: nether might be fast enough, but still a long distance probably
[2:50:28] Nizmat: convert with powdered snow ClappyHype
[2:50:30] Exirel: Like you would transform a zombie into a drawn with water.
[2:50:32] Kawaiitron_: Tired, woke up at 2:30 AM. Managed to get back to sleep, at least.
[2:50:34] pancake_lover_333: skelly in powdered snow
[2:50:35] AtulKart: wouldn't lightning rod work if you don't have a trident for lightning
[2:50:39] McCloudy7: how about a pet pillager? one with a broken crossbow?
[2:50:43] Goscalyon: that too XD
[2:50:50] castlebeki: Is it not possible to make strays with powdered snow?
[2:50:51] hummus_yummus: what is a one-eyed willie?

[2:50:53] Goscalyon: porcupine pearl
[2:50:55] seibaby: You could give a skelly a sword
[2:51:00] bluubuns: That would take an entire stream haha
[2:51:13] itsthenars: yeah you can make a stray im pretty sure... same with drowned
[2:51:15] UrgezGaming: Also a 1 in 1024 chance from a brown mooshroom to be born from 2 reds
[2:51:20] diarrhea_lad: Now I gotta think about what I would redeem when I get enough points. Maybe a Strider.
[2:51:27] kofithekofin: Bub a good name for a zombie
[2:51:29] Nizmat: wouldn't take an entire stream if it kills you PrideLaugh
[2:51:32] pastel_cottontail: but you can’t make a husk from a zombie iirc
[2:51:38] affabilities: could I redeem for a baby zombie?
[2:51:42] cloudninemeeple: Put a skellie in powdered snow

[2:52:32] greegypt: like how zombies turn into drowned underwater, skellys turn into strays in snow
[2:52:36] pastel_cottontail: we’ll need to experiment
[2:52:37] Nizmat: keep them in powdered snow for a little bit and they turn, I made a farm last time I played ClappyHype
[2:52:42] jellym00n: oh i didn't know that
[2:52:47] UrgezGaming: Got a zoglin yet????
[2:52:54] 0wren: horse jumpscare
[2:52:58] ohgeezkai: If only you could dry out a zombie...
[2:52:59] mischieflmanaged: can it only be overworld mobs?
[2:53:07] Exirel: From the Wiki: When a skeleton is kept inside powder snow for 7 seconds, it begins shaking. After another 15 seconds it becomes a stray.
[2:53:10] jenny_b14: did you see my redeem?
[2:53:16] Nizmat: cool for farming slow arrows
[2:53:17] Lissert271: if you drown a husk it turns into a normal zombie which is very funny to me xD
[2:53:26] castlebeki: but how would the drying out of zombie work ?
[2:53:37] sionnach46: Heatwave update.
[2:53:40] seibaby: You should be able to give zombies fire res and let them dry out in the sun until they turn into husks xD
[2:53:41] UrgezGaming: Most players learn about zoglins by accident lol
[2:53:49] Lissert271: @castlebeki maybe magma block?
[2:53:50] pastel_cottontail: @castlebeki cover with falling sand

[2:54:46] MargusGoon: A few minutes of time in the Nether should toast a zombie nicely
[2:54:48] castlebeki: oh falling sand is good, makes me think of zedaph and another hermit trying to make a husk
[2:55:04] kofithekofin: Hello @alyssaries pearlieHey pearlieHeart
[2:55:12] UrgezGaming: I'm 6 weeks into building decked out 1 remake almost done. But I don't have a chat to keep me occupied lol

[2:58:50] UrgezGaming: Where's the redstone?? Lol
[2:58:56] tildalovesthedoctor: you could wait and see how much you have left that you need stored
[2:59:06] woagopossum: upstairs all for extra sand
[2:59:12] saleo37: What about two different colored halfslabs in one block, mohjang? :))
[2:59:18] kofithekofin: If I had a bank card I would be subbing
[2:59:28] tildalovesthedoctor: @woagopossum or yes for excess or random stuff
[2:59:36] UrgezGaming: Which lost redstone box?
[2:59:51] pastel_cottontail: fun fact tango eventually found it in a floor barrel next to his ender chest, where he presumably meant to put it lol
[2:59:56] MusicFreeGaming: I suggest putting the roof on top of the building
[2:59:58] UrgezGaming: 1 2 or 3 think he found 1 lol
[2:59:58] seibaby: "I got a thing against 1 wide staircases" she says, as she makes the staircase 0.8125 wide
[2:59:58] itsthenars: could have the upstairs be an area for "prizes" or "trophies"... stuff that you wanna keep in item frames or something
[3:00:06] bluubuns: I always wondered why people don’t usually use slabs for floor/ceiling instead of planks
[3:00:09] saandpiper8: good morning!

[3:06:16] GaspsHiChat: i only have 3.4k
[3:06:16] greegypt: everyone gets 50 channel points minimum every 5 minutes, so 15K points total are given out, so every ONE minute at the very least 11,680 are given out (way more with sub multipliers, watchstreak, etc)
[3:06:17] Samodiva_: 164k here
[3:06:24] 19_meg_91: 60.1K after my redemption

[3:06:33] chinook_a: i like collecting the channel points, but the warden challenge is SO worth splurging on
[3:06:36] augustasman: 101 k here
[3:06:38] seibaby: @DetectiveInspectorMe Fair point. But he did build a proper warden container before messing it up :)

[3:18:37] paisleyrose: you could totally name a warden

[3:20:42] seibaby: Definitely test it
[3:20:43] MargusGoon: Or just agro it with a note block or piston noise machine. Tag it while it's distracted

[3:26:09] chinook_a: @miracleasl pearlieAngry
[3:26:14] ClassyCashier: You should check out what the warden farm was on the s9 world. I know tango had a trick where the warden spawned, he named tagged it, and it went through a portal before it could attack.

[3:27:03] haggleslag: how many hearts do you lose in full netherite?
[3:27:12] xWildSlicerx: His anger has a start up timer it seems. So you can certainly speed away to start it.
[3:27:13] looorenam: omg he can sniff though creative mode
[3:27:13] castlebeki: @ClassyCashier and since you are close to it, it doesnt do the shriek
[3:27:14] disa_a_: Hi!

[3:27:50] ClassyCashier: When does a naturally spawned warden go back under ground? Is it after it deaggros?
[3:27:52] xWildSlicerx: Resistance 2 and Regen beacon might be a good idea for sure.
