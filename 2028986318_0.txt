[1:25:54] paigeplaysmusic: not the soup
[1:26:27] jippyb: its ok. soup half full mentality
[1:26:53] laineybug8815: felt
[1:26:58] cupidscozy: its okay i spilled most of my drink earlier Sadge
[1:26:59] paigeplaysmusic: so no matter win or lose do we keep the football for 12 rounds?
[1:27:48] jippyb: @cupidscozy rip
[1:28:09] arrianna_t: yea only 12 rounds and then if they happen to tie 12-12 after both teams had it, they start to alternate
[1:28:19] paigeplaysmusic: ok
[1:28:37] paigeplaysmusic: and there's no way to get it back?
[1:28:49] arrianna_t: NoNo
[1:28:55] arrianna_t: only in overtime
[1:28:59] ethosperla: yes so each half is 12 rounds (one half you have the football, one half you dont) but it can get cut short cause first team to 13 wins all
[1:29:19] paigeplaysmusic: ok that makes sense thanks guys
