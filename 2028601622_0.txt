[1:06:47] lovely_beez: ally linkzzeyHii
[1:06:50] silllgoose: would you ever do an end build out on the end islands?
[1:06:51] Amandroid: @allymayblack linkzzeyHugx linkzzeyHii
[1:06:56] Wickednush: An overworld perimeter would take much longer; would not suggest
[1:07:05] Normalguy2424: KEKBye overworld perimeter wish

[1:07:40] allymayblack: just watching twitch and coloring linkzzeyGig

[1:08:12] Wickednush: You can already see the God of Celebrations from the outer islands can't you?
[1:08:17] silllgoose: it would be cool to make a build linked to each end portal, going to the outer end islands
[1:08:33] forest_queen36: @amandroid your so right

[1:09:44] Wryfrost: I've got an idea for a combination 72k ice farm, overworld gold farm, and villager trading hall project
[1:09:49] silllgoose: netherac, stone, and what?
[1:09:50] MotownMiki: good today Linkzzey, thank you. And you? keeping warm?
[1:10:06] Normalguy2424: 1 million totems popped one day PeepiTeef

[1:11:48] Amandroid: PepeHands he needs the numbers to keep getting bigger
[1:11:50] forest_queen36: @amandroid thank you linkzzeyHeart
[1:11:54] CrabbyKronos: even Mojang didnt expect this kind of world thats why theres max stats
[1:12:05] b0redm4n: Sadly it isn't cool for statistics but me personally showing you've surpassed expected limitations is enough to be #1 to me
[1:12:45] Amandroid: linkzzeyNod that makes sense
[1:12:47] silllgoose: what time of year do you expect to hit 50,000 days?
[1:12:52] b0redm4n: Ahhh it's like a border on the freedom?

[1:41:16] HavokTracks: I can concur that YT streaming sucks still. Depending on you audience there a switch might only be financially better.
[1:41:25] Roundaround: if you really did want to consider it, there's the platform Ludwig + a few others made that unifies all the emotes, channel points, etc on both platforms...but then EVERYONE has to install the browser extensions

[2:36:56] Ryothhh: Slow work but im not complaining Gladge
[2:36:57] Amandroid: @iLikeToGetRekt linkzzeyGig Link is the same way - all his builds have interiors and lore linkzzeyBlush
[2:37:31] CanadianJumlin: Interiors are fun, but time consuming for sure
[2:37:47] bradydied: would it be a bad idea to build my trading hall under my guardian farm? like do you think that would interfere with the rates?
[2:37:55] lovely_beez: i agree linkzzeyNod
[2:38:10] Amandroid: @bradydied linkzzeyGig you might get a lot of lag with that, I'd think
[2:38:16] CanadianJumlin: 100% I made a 7-11 in my community server and it was really fun to do the interior, and it makes it feel very genuine
[2:38:40] iLikeToGetRekt: Love to hear it lol, I always say interiors separate a good builder from a great builder
[2:38:51] bradydied: @Amandroid lag from the guardians?

[2:39:25] Amandroid: @bradydied guardians and villagers in the same place seems like a risky thing to do to me linkzzeyNod
[2:39:27] moiira_cst: I usually start with the interior and Then I do the exterior so I don't have to squeeze in an interior
[2:39:36] Amandroid: @cluelessisalive linkzzeyHii
[2:39:56] bradydied: @Amandroid i use a portal based guardian farm, so when they spawn they are instantly teleported, so lag isnt really an issue ive noticed so far
[2:40:33] lovely_beez: linkzzeyGig
[2:40:33] Sleepzalot: @bradydied how many villagers is it?
[2:40:44] Brixxii: YEPP and now anvils fall
[2:40:47] Amandroid: @bradydied oh so they don't come back through another portal, then? linkzzeyGig I was thinking of a guardian farm like link's, where they go into the nether, and then come back out
[2:40:51] lovely_beez: brixxii linkzzeyGig
[2:40:55] Amandroid: @Brixxii linkzzeyGig

[6:57:17] COATstar: snakes are vulnerable while they're full, but they just spend the time digesting hiding somewhere where they're safer from predators, so they're more than willing to eat a lot since it's the same amount of hiding afterwards anyway
