[1:32:37] Techniker32: So it could destroy earth, bc. it is neither directly nor thru inaction harming humans?
[1:32:39] Larklen: Then you get into a process where AI starts classifying some people as "humans" and others at not MONKERS
[1:32:39] thebubbajones1: We currently have Tesla’s plowing into bikers and taking off on their own so, probably not possible
[1:32:40] RingSong: yeah that's also the thing, they're not intrinsic laws. They were programmed in.

[1:41:49] ValueTown: i'm not talking about the steps. sometimes when you are looking up how to make stuff. it's hard to find the one you actually want

[1:43:19] ValueTown: there is a minor way you can cheese a cleanroom with an elevator. it gets around the loss of opening the door, but this is nomifactory so maybe it's not that mean anyway

[2:32:58] slimjimforevigt: you dont know how energy drinks work then?
[2:33:00] MechaDom: I'm drinking a very large amount of coffee and still sleepy
[2:33:04] Face_32: an apple gives you more energy than multiple energy drinks will @Giantwaffle

[2:43:01] kingasasin177: I asked some people and they said not to macerate all of my ores immediately because it's not worth while quite yet but I'm doing it for the ores I need desperately because the rush for the machines spent almost all of my iron, tin, and copper which was a lot originally.
[2:43:05] Makaheehee: @itsIffy I remember how hopeful he was at the beginning. Kappa
[2:43:23] itsIffy: abandoning FeelsBadMan

[2:49:29] daemonaedryn: theres a command to share gp
[2:49:31] daemonaedryn: watermill
[2:49:32] TelRehiad: water mills
[2:49:35] Orin_The_Sly: People are Ok with Cosmetic MTX! Lets Abuse that!!
[2:49:44] blizzardmagic: cant you just have a room for watermills
[2:49:44] Face_32: spends 3 hours crafting rings, doesnt fly with said rings @Giantwaffle
[2:49:44] dennis3833: fire aint bad
[2:49:44] babyaddalyn: you can share gridpower with /xu_powershare
[2:49:47] daemonaedryn: do \xu and press tab
[2:49:52] Rongoel: There is a layout you can do for water mills that is super efficient
[2:49:55] AlphaWarrior987: Dragon Mill will give like 500
[2:49:59] DaddyDiddy: yeah /xu powershare allows you to share grid power
[2:50:02] elegantoelephanto: why not use glitch armor?
[2:50:27] frainsbreeze: because waffle is lazy to do the glitch trials
[2:50:30] 0x4273: But you’re so close to the end of the pack Kappa
[2:50:49] daemonaedryn: Up to like 15
[2:50:56] lukasalbert: water mills go hard too
[2:51:01] bubblebrainer: you get 16 from 1 watermill
[2:51:05] DaddyDiddy: kill the ender dragon and use the dragon mill @Giantwaffle
[2:51:17] TelRehiad: also your watermill setups upstairs is not setup right
[2:51:21] lukasalbert: deminishing retunrs tho so you need more
[2:51:22] Orin_The_Sly: 4 with water running between them should do it
[2:51:25] Etwas77: just make 10 KappaHD
[2:51:31] DemonicHell3: Waffle how am I supposed to know what day it is when your stream title doesn't say it's Friday??
[2:51:31] daemonaedryn: flowing water on all 4 sides
[2:51:32] bubblebrainer: if water hits from 4 sides you get 16
[2:51:41] Rongoel: May i share a link for a good layout?
[2:51:46] Sui_Ume: you need 8, for pati as well
[2:51:47] DonMerkuzio: wdym with "we can't" you are finished with this modpack tomorrow KappaHD
[2:52:00] daedmissica0: no
[2:52:02] daemonaedryn: That's not as efficient
[2:52:03] Winstonrocks: Pati hasn’t set it up efficiently
[2:52:03] officialhunterx: you need 128 if your both flying
[2:52:04] lukasalbert: you can get more out of them
[2:52:07] Orin_The_Sly: There is a better way but I cant explain it via text
[2:52:09] Seerion: that's not the best way to do it
[2:52:11] Lephrim: the efficiency decreases i think
[2:52:15] ninopanda: there is plenty of space above ground
[2:52:17] LethalBro: Wait,, shouldn't you put the source in a corner for peak effeciency?
[2:52:20] lukasalbert: there is a pattern that has higher efficiency
[2:52:22] simoncs: Are we on the moon yet?
[2:52:23] daemonaedryn: Having all 4 sides be flowing water, not source, is best
[2:52:23] daedmissica0: you can hit all 4 with 4 blocks
[2:52:24] kane1941: look for a better design
[2:52:29] Surge43: look up a water mill patern
[2:52:33] daedmissica0: you get 16 power
[2:52:38] Venamah: KEKW
[2:52:38] ninopanda: that is soooo you
[2:52:39] YourLittlePuppy: KEKW

[2:52:55] blizzardmagic: the fuc* was that meme
[2:52:56] Orin_The_Sly: There is a better way my Dude, Last call LUL
[2:52:56] dennis3833: but beware, if u use GP somwhere else u may not be able to fly, cause its use somwhere else...
[2:53:25] kingasasin177: A suggestion someone made for me to do was to get the steam grinder and oven. Do you guys think that's a good idea early on?
[2:53:35] Etwas77: 7  more
[2:53:42] Turnpoint: omg what whas on that screen
[2:53:45] Yakobro: lava mill works too
[2:53:46] lukasalbert: do a lot more probably
[2:53:53] highlandermccloud: @giantwaffle just surrounding them with water u don't think is the optimal set up
[2:54:02] Winstonrocks: Every side needs a flowing water block to maximise them
[2:54:07] Smithii: 32 each
[2:54:12] Rongoel: 69 nice
[2:54:13] Jeramu: nice
[2:54:14] Lars_Keizer: nice
[2:54:15] lukasalbert: you can hace 4 flowing blocks next to the water mill

[2:54:48] Yakobro: actual COPIUM
[2:54:49] nxusr: and building stuff on ceilings isn’t gonna suck any more
[2:54:51] grid_space: runescape level 50
[2:54:53] jezusnuts: more like 12% Kappa
[2:54:53] DaddyDiddy: halfway through the pack is creative tank
[2:54:57] lazyhot: made my first LV machine today it is such an awsome leap XD
[2:55:11] Koeckie: 4/9 I think
[2:55:35] Dagmoo: @grid_space yeah this is more accurate for "half way"
[2:55:57] IvanMix: you can make a 4x4 diagonally you can produce way more gp
[2:55:57] Moobot: You can find Waffle's Youtube channel here - https://youtube.com/giantwaffle
[2:56:07] Jaded_Parrot: Does the angel ring work across dimensions?

[2:56:16] TheWonderLlama: Angel ring finished! Call it a day Kappa
[2:56:16] frainsbreeze: what you did dropped the efficiency on the water mill
[2:56:21] DonMerkuzio: day 12
[2:56:35] TelRehiad: not magic btw
[2:56:37] mrdoctorcheese: That's like how boomers describe 'the cloud'
[2:56:38] The_Holas: you need to have it chunk loaded btw
[2:56:44] Face_32: oh nice so you can fly and explore too
[2:56:48] Makaheehee: @frainsbreeze Thats a future Waffle problem. Kappa
[2:56:57] Mikamura: Who made the buildings above?
[2:56:58] lukasalbert: chunk loaded or you crash when leaving the dimension yeah
[2:56:59] sp4wn999: lets make some chrome
[2:56:59] Makaheehee: PresentWaffle doesnt care about Future Waffle typically. Kappa

[5:02:13] vordican: radon you can't hold. radium you can hold and is a bad idea
[5:02:14] Baske_T: they totally don't do radon testnig in houses
[5:02:16] TelRehiad: real radon is also radioactive
[5:02:26] bar10dr: Radon is radioactive, 1 out of 15 US homes have too much of it. You should measure it.
[5:02:27] Sui_Ume: thats radon

[5:02:30] VikashPindoria: 5 head

[5:03:33] Mose_0: uranium in soil naturally breaks down into radon gas and can get to fairly high levels in your home if you don't have a radon fan in your crawlspace
[5:03:58] Bulltank: 10 eyes total i think for 2 consoles
[5:04:06] Bulltank: with the cards

[5:05:14] vordican: you do have a crawl space... whats below yoru floor
[5:05:18] ChromaCym: But I got the sellers to pay for mitigation KEKW
[5:05:20] raironzera: why crawlspaces are needed?
[5:05:24] bar10dr: @Sloppy_D It is in the US as well. 1  out of every 15 houses has a higher level than recomended, people just don't know about it.
[5:05:24] end3avor_: slab foundation @vordican
[5:05:25] Grav1s: Yup when I bought and sold my house I had to have it tested for Radon in the basement
