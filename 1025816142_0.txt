[0:11:04] SnoLys: or more money, since people that couldnt sub before, now can
[0:11:12] Tabakhase: smuggling in subs waffleSpy
[0:11:14] Kaomie: You have to pay at some point so they know where you are VPN is irrelevant
[0:11:20] Serkenk: something tells me twitch doesn't know either yet
[0:11:39] paslitron: for the first 3 months
[0:11:49] Edgar_twich2: Ok
[0:11:49] SanfordMicheal: @giantwaffle did you see that Twitter might have a paid service in the future
[0:11:52] MakerOfThingys: I read that as they cover any loses for 3 months at 100%
[0:11:53] wompfox: What if November happens lol
[0:11:53] existentialism123: that's very confusing in their wording from twitch
[0:11:54] mechoriet: @Giantwaffle i think country could be lock on account creation maybe to avoid vpn chinanicans
[0:11:57] Kaomie: LOL
[0:11:58] MakerOfThingys: Question is what is baseline?
[0:12:01] Edgar_twich2: ????

[0:12:28] Warcraftking: @Giantwaffle have you seen F1 McLaren Monaco livery?
[0:12:29] MakerOfThingys: Just don't stream DSP :P
[0:12:39] ch0pster: Shouldn't it be capped based on Work laws? like 40h max?
[0:12:50] Pekter: wait whatas happening? tldr?
[0:12:51] Kaomie: Basically streaming becoming a real job with performance interest
[0:13:11] Kaomie: insensive?
[0:13:11] lefakx: Can you post a link on this post? I`ve missed starting of the stream
[0:13:15] ba_nanananananana: it's amazon, the bottom 10% gets fired

[0:14:03] Kaomie: I mean it makes sense really
[0:14:14] TarMonA: What the game of the day??
[0:14:15] Scojan: If a sub in Turkey costs 1$ does twitch still pay out creators their typical cut?
[0:14:18] CorSPACE: twitch doesnt run many ads in turkey
[0:14:19] Narcotical: Narcotical subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 35 months, currently on a 35 month streak! Have my 6 dollar sub anyway
[0:14:27] daemonaedryn: So theyre trying to make it the countries equivalent of $5 everywhere?
[0:14:29] dr_Griff: Might be better for small streamers. Maybe someone getting a 80% discount will sub to 5 people for cheaper than 1 person for more.
[0:14:37] Alamose: Are people going to just make an account under a VPN in a cheaper country, then just mass gift from that?
[0:14:39] mechoriet: but the pricing is probbly locked when account created or something to mitigate the vpn abuse maybe
[0:14:43] CorSPACE: i would think it depends on your money source
[0:14:48] CorSPACE: and not vpn
[0:14:49] Bleu_Forge: "if"
[0:14:51] OhWhale: i dont sub to be subbed but i can see some people doing that
[0:14:57] Kaomie: It's your wallet that matters not where you are connecting from
[0:14:58] paslitron: i think they can know your country from your credit card number
[0:14:58] Bleu_Forge: it's more of a when than an if imo KEKW
[0:15:01] Scojan: I think in the end this will hurt content creators more than help
[0:15:01] schwebels428: @Giantwaffle  any plans to do a vanilla minecraft megabuild, except instead of a huge building, you do many medium ish buildings in like a city layout?
[0:15:05] Riddixdan: doubt it
[0:15:06] mechoriet: that would be a "good" way to mitigate vpn stuff
[0:15:08] rollen123: 100% people are gone abuse it
[0:15:10] Pekter: so streamer migratting to more expensive countries to have more? Kappa
[0:15:10] Kaomie: If your card / paypal is based in a country
[0:15:11] WGG25: twitch probably tracks where you watch from, and they won't let you pay less even if you use a vpn 🤷
[0:15:16] Edgar_twich2: What I Hate people can just copy smaller twich streamers and make more money
[0:15:21] Kamipulu: Kamipulu subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 48 months! This is not a VPN sub

[0:15:35] N4RCO5: They already shadowban you if you use a vpn, they should know if you use one
[0:15:38] CorSPACE: @schwebels428 he is going to have a community server when 1.17 comes out, soooo yes?
[0:15:43] ピッザダディ: Q3
[0:15:51] Fish_Swimming: It cost me £5 wich is $7
[0:15:51] schwebels428: @CorSPACE  kinda lol
[0:15:52] SmoothBlizzard: what is the tldr for that/
[0:15:54] BurnedAether: "A viewer’s subscription price will be based on where they live and have set up their Twitch payment method" so who really knows

[0:16:16] s_DeXTeR_s: what is going on ?
[0:16:21] pixelninja88: your computer room looks cozy
[0:16:22] Pekter: just put the origin currency like YT?
[0:16:23] Scojan: RIP Subathons if they adjust gift subs
[0:16:26] usernameNull: if baseline is rolling 12 month average, November will push you under 85% if you average 8 hours 22 days a month and 18 hrs/day in nov
[0:16:28] katelelele: Does this mean that twitch prime can be cheaper too?
[0:16:36] s_DeXTeR_s: Some Streamers didnt recive prime sub money @Giantwaffle

[0:17:14] aur1so: KEKW
[0:17:18] Riddixdan: KEKW
[0:17:20] paslitron: so for turkey, to earn the same amount before this, creators need to have 4x amount of sub they had before @Giantwaffle
[0:17:20] PurpleKow: Pepega 💳
[0:17:26] Kaomie: Way to get partnered
[0:17:27] Originalfudge: didnt bahroo gift himself like 30k subs
[0:17:38] Narcotical: So if you have a contract where you get 3 dollar and twitch gets 2 for isntance, you basically give yourself 50 cent per sub? KEKW
[0:17:41] silv: that was december
[0:17:43] SimonScholar: it reads like baseline is the income
[0:17:47] mechoriet: @Giantwaffle remember the prime bug thing in the beginning of twitch prime subs
[0:17:57] Pekter: thats when business department gets a call from the CEO.. LUL
[0:17:58] OhWhale: well cant wait for my yearly trip down to mexico to sub to my favorite streamers KEKW

[0:18:31] Pekter: so who wanst in PAX won subs? ninja?
[0:18:42] TarMonA: @Giantwaffle  these year back in February  amazon was selling 100 USD twitch card for 75 dollar. you could print money using that twitch card and bit these year
[0:18:43] Kaomie: lolz
[0:18:53] Abbiethecat: @Giantwaffle just wanted to say a big TY to you mister waffle for helping get through my mental health. been playing PO3 an watching you vods as i play. its been a big help mentality
[0:19:09] Goofycatcher: waffleLove @Abbiethecat
[0:19:16] Scojan: So is Twitch eating the cost of a 5$ sub or is the creator when it comes to subs from smaller countries? @Giantwaffle
[0:19:18] Kaomie: MiNeCrAfT
[0:19:20] Abbiethecat: :)
[0:19:22] Rangetuur: have you considered playing a 1.16 modpack?
[0:19:25] TarMonA: no DSP??
[0:19:27] 101101101: !modpack
[0:19:28] Moobot: Waffle finished his Compact Claustrophobia play-through on May 4th! He had roughly 3 days of in-game time 😮. He will play another modpack after a Dyson Sphere Program run.

[0:19:42] CallMeCornelius: it's actually crazy how the "twitch prime sub" spiel's have stayed the same as well
[0:19:43] exo_pho3nix: E2E is pretty similar to PO3
[0:19:44] Zurpax: enigmatica 2 expert EZ
[0:19:44] SimonScholar: Scojan for the first 3 months Twitch will. After that the creator will, but Twitch are saying lower prices = more subs = more revenue
[0:19:56] Kaomie: I thought Darkosto was updating one Sky mod right now
[0:19:57] gartoks: Can we do a pure magic modpack? Haven't had that yet
[0:19:58] Abbiethecat: @Goofycatcher  <3

[0:20:17] Solitude411: skyopolis is very fun
[0:20:36] CorSPACE: i would play 1.12 before going to newer versions, cause i cant imagine myself going back to 1.12 after playing post 1.12 packs
[0:20:36] Scojan: They should give the creator the ability to turn off reduced pricing for subs
[0:20:43] SmoothBlizzard: are you going to play biomutnatn?
[0:21:01] rakooh: so.. some countries are better viewers
[0:21:13] usernameNull: can you not see where your subscribers are?
[0:21:17] Kaomie: Time to move to North Korea
[0:21:21] mechoriet: yeah HasanAbi is probbly gonna hit hard too lots of turkey's viewers there
[0:21:31] SimonScholar: Only time will tell if this will make more people sub
[0:21:34] xtherapie: and it will small streamers
[0:21:37] CallMeCornelius: would that hurt the chances of getting affiliate as well because they'll be trying to crunch the additional top ups hard
[0:21:41] d_e_c_i_p_h_e_r: turkish streamers with just turkish viewers they gonna lose like 1/5th?
[0:21:41] Pekter: rip Spanish streamers.. most of its viewers are from South America
[0:21:50] dr_Griff: Twitch is ultimately trying to make money... I'm guessing their research says more people will sub.
[0:21:50] SmoothBlizzard: i think hasan will be fine LUL
[0:22:01] Tabakhase: hell prob make 20k subs that day Kappa
[0:22:08] Zurpax: ye more ppl be willing to sub if its a reasonable price

[0:22:23] MrDocth: 5€ yeah
[0:22:27] SimonScholar: In the UK a lot of it comes from tax, we pay 20% on digital subs
[0:22:30] mechoriet: € 4.99 in netherlands
[0:22:30] Archelonde: $9 AUD to sub here
[0:22:32] SimonScholar: that won't change

[0:23:12] MushuTushu: My state (MD) taxes subscriptions now aswell
[0:23:15] Archelonde: instead of 6.50
[0:23:18] SimonScholar: I am worried that they say the "vast majority" of countries outside the US will reduce in cost... I wonder if some will increase also
[0:23:19] Vistor1001: Coins in mobile are 6.99 euro
[0:23:21] SirAlexFrost: Dont even need to sub from a PC, just desktop view a browser on mobile LUL
[0:23:24] Scojan: They should really give creators the ability to turn local subscription pricing off. I doubt they will
[0:23:28] lCLipZ: in Australia the price is crazy high
[0:23:28] SmoothBlizzard: SO YOU MAKE MORE MONEY IF WE SUB FROM PHONES?
[0:23:30] DaGMC: DaGMC subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 4 months!

[2:53:20] Ender410: Re-read the tip

[2:53:21] daemonaedryn: Button 4 and 5 usually fuck up minecraft controls for me
[2:53:21] Nexhunter: there is two presses so you can attach to two points at same time
[2:53:37] Tabakhase: is this terraria?
[2:53:43] Ender410: nice!

[2:53:58] Nexhunter: it the NFL sky cam KEKW
[2:54:03] Tabakhase: thats hella neat...

[2:57:02] Wingy_: Its just 2 plates and a stick like a sword
[2:57:24] kyanpeppaa: hammer on top i think
[2:57:26] rabarberslafs: It's a miss in JEI, any file material should work.

[3:00:02] boogerbomb01: cheaper subs?
[3:00:03] JBourden: doesnt seem like itll be that big of a deal
[3:00:03] bananaramamahammock: Cheaper subs?
[3:00:04] daemonaedryn: Could be good, could be bad, depends on how effective it is.
[3:00:06] CurlySC: is it still 50/50 then ?
[3:00:08] Degenerate: forgecrafts version of vein mine would still mine it all even if its split like that

[3:00:17] Mythrillo: sub numbers? yes. profit? no

[3:00:27] CrimsonEnraged: PauseChamp
[3:00:28] VanDomand: I would like to see a function were streamers can choose the price. Like maximum and minimum and something in between
[3:00:31] tris790: can't they ban you for this ?
[3:00:33] ZyianDev: it's not exactly discounted, but it's localized
[3:00:33] DrHax_: mexico and turkey for now, right?
[3:00:34] Tabakhase: lira
[3:00:37] heulyum: 9.90 try 1.2$

[3:00:43] Tabakhase: turkish lira specf.
[3:00:43] masternaranja: lets goo mexico gang
[3:00:45] Dylo321: 1.2$ KEKW
[3:00:51] RainDoc: there's people who uses VPN to buy Turkish Netflix and stuff so imagine with twitch LUL
[3:00:52] CrimsonEnraged: From 40Lira's to 10 Lira, so that's huge PauseChamp
[3:00:55] Bulva: nice cheap sub for me :D
[3:00:56] bugsplatter23: most importantly a turkish streamer will paid for primes based on $1.20 instead of $5
[3:00:57] 8R00KS: vpn subs might be crazy
[3:00:57] forgivelol: about 2$
[3:00:59] rarelybegaming: as long as it's not exploited it's fair for them as they have a lower income
[3:01:00] scoobyrich: So less for the streamer?
[3:01:01] mephisto__ttv: Lira
[3:01:02] boogerbomb01: Everyone is a Mexican now
[3:01:04] legacy2529: thats good imo
[3:01:05] phold0: so do you only get a portion of the $1.20 or the full amount?
[3:01:07] Koeckie: nice
[3:01:12] DKFrits: buenos dias i guess
[3:01:20] MrAppl3: will it be following the exchange rates?
[3:01:21] Lcw_123: an here in Australia it's $9.99 for a sub
[3:01:24] TheSparMan: i wonder if they have thought VPN into their calculations
[3:01:26] Ostejohn: time to get nord vpn xD
[3:01:26] TheBeavsterM: I mean some games are already priced like that and I don't think it's common for people to VPN for cheaper games
[3:01:26] Robbiie_: Wish I could get that, my local currency is at freaking 5 dollars
[3:01:30] HobbesPC: HobbesPC subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 3 months! 
[3:01:36] Nexhunter: yea no reason to fuck over the actual people in those regions
[3:01:44] M3rKLiNs: $6.99 CA here
[3:01:50] CrimsonEnraged: @Nexhunter EY peepoRage
[3:01:51] PyromooseTV: @Giantwaffle is that because thier currency is failing?
[3:01:55] Slymph: Yeah let me just abuse the system, i wanna support the streamer but imma buy it as cheap as possible KEKW
[3:01:57] WoofWoofDude: I don't buy subs cause they are useless for me. I buy turbo to support twitch and would donate money instead of buying a sub if i really wanna give money to the streamer but i don't since i'm still paying debt :)
[3:01:58] Nicolas2701: I mean you probably need a foreign currency card to use that discount
[3:02:00] Duvenel: don't do what blizzard did and 'raise' prices lol
[3:02:09] scoobyrich: Needs to be relative
[3:02:15] Shantrix: Canada is not on the list btw
[3:02:24] Larklen: VPN probably wouldnt even work unless you are using gift cards or some shit, since your CC/PayPal is tied to your real address KEKW
[3:02:33] FatRat_: Itll probably bring in more money to streamers since people can sub for cheaper in many places
[3:02:39] Pumpk1nheaD_: I hate paying 5 dollars as our Russian rouble conversion rate is trash, its like average monthly pay outside moscow is 270 bucks-ish and having to pay 5 dollars can make you starve
[3:02:40] Lcw_123: it works out that AUD to USD its like 7-8usd for a sub from Australia
[3:02:43] lmarc0s: i can pay two meals with the price of a sub here
[3:02:44] TimmyVRC: YEP
[3:02:44] Sacratoy: I've used Twitch in the US and Brazil, and Twitch seems pretty good at figuring out where I am
[3:02:47] Sacratoy: even with VPN
[3:02:49] mitsuki_11: with steam as an example you have to have a card local to that country to set your store's country for the discounted rate
[3:02:49] 8R00KS: people love attention so yes but oh well
[3:02:50] Sacratoy: IDK how it does it
[3:02:50] Nexhunter: actually yea how do you VPN it if they tie it to your CC address KEKW
[3:02:50] legacy2529: people wont bother
[3:02:50] WGG25: yes
[3:02:50] aeadon: that's a lot of hoops to jump through to save a couple bucks
[3:02:52] That0neGeye: Are streamers in those countries getting a bigger cut from the higher cost?
[3:02:53] ElitexKnight7: People will just buy Twitch gift cards if they really wanna be like that
[3:02:53] Nexhunter: or what paypal outputs KEKW
[3:02:57] OhWhale: i sub to support my favorite content creators
[3:03:01] killerbourne: sub cost me like 799 in canada
[3:03:02] dogma802: It feels like a lot work to VPN it for the sake of buying emojis at a cheaper price
[3:03:09] Tabakhase: why sub at all then...
[3:03:17] M3rKLiNs: $5 is spagetti sauce n noodles ez
[3:03:19] bugsplatter23: this was a result of a meeting within twitch discussing the cost of primes toward their marketing budget.  This was an alternative to getting rid of primes, i'm sure of it
[3:03:20] WoofWoofDude: i don't cook cause i hate it.. can't do it with 5$
[3:03:24] P7777137: would you be able to vpn around it? they will be able to see where you live by your card
[3:03:27] AsHackDM: YEP
[3:03:27] RainDoc: @larklen people are actually using VPNs to buy Netflix accounts for cheap and stuff
[3:03:29] dogma802: Setting up a VPN is easy but most people sub to just support the creator
[3:03:30] xxDeepThoughtxx: My thoughts are is it going to hurt small streamers?  You will need more subs to stay even.
[3:03:30] AsHackDM: im from Turkey
[3:03:31] danilul9: skåø

[3:03:40] Sacratoy: in Brazil a sub is super expensive
[3:03:40] Baw0: SKÅÅÅÅÅÅÅÅÅÅÅL
[3:03:41] ItsOnMax: Didn't valve do that in Europe and the european goverment said "hey you can't do that" Because you are accessible from all of Europe the price should be the same.
[3:03:41] QuesoBad0nga: Uruguay
[3:03:46] madsao98: DENMARK

[3:03:54] Wetware: What the heck is happening to bitcoin?
[3:03:55] Freaknick1: You gotta rebrand yourself El Waffle
[3:03:59] Tabakhase: @xxDeepThoughtxx but now normal people and not just oilers can sub - so who knows LUL
[3:03:59] Bulva: I am from istanbul as well
[3:04:00] Moyer46290: Why would a vpn matter when a cc has some sort or area code or billing address attached to it
[3:04:07] SSP15_: Switzerland
[3:04:07] bmoneysmafia: giant you already done with subnatica?

[3:04:16] RainDoc: 20pm here señor
[3:04:18] Larklen: @RainDoc yeah but Netflix could stop it, they don't. Its a matter of whether or not Twitch cares to try and block it.
[3:04:18] Jerod5_: scanner
[3:04:19] Nexhunter: @ItsOnMax if you accept euros yes your price should be standard across the full market for the euro
[3:04:22] Trever007: @Giantwaffle I am watching from Mars right now :D honest ;)
[3:04:26] daemonaedryn: Start from 4pm to 12pm in UK

[3:39:28] DecoyOcelot: this pack is an automation challenge. mostly around building a base that uses AE without it killing your TPS
[3:39:28] Etwas77: whats the theme of this modpack?
[3:39:31] BeardSyndicate: ohhhh, a non skyblock modpack. nice!

[3:40:23] DemonicHell3: are the dev / dank nulls?
[3:40:24] WoofWoofDude: how can they be used in gaming ?
[3:40:28] SmokyMtnRed: @DecoyOcelot The community update helped with TPS, but yes it is still a concern
[3:40:29] RodriCraft93: is that wall hacks???
[3:40:31] GuyDefeaten: items
[3:40:32] aeadon: NFT KEKW
[3:40:35] Battokage: nft is scam

[3:40:48] Purecrew: I sold all my ADA near the peak think I got lucky lol
[3:40:55] Kohta_Sama: that seems pointless LUL just use ingame systems
[3:40:56] Azafure: Isn't riot gonna do something withh NFT in their new game?
[3:40:56] WoofWoofDude: the lattency on that would need to be nanoseconds
[3:41:02] Tabakhase: dont need a blockchain for a excel table KEKW
[3:41:03] subfin: you dont need a blockchange for that, just signing
[3:41:04] DecoyOcelot: @SmokyMtnRed yeah for sure. im playing on Dev and its a lot better there too
[3:41:11] manute154: that beard....epic!

[3:41:21] WoofWoofDude: btc latency is 10-15 min..
[3:41:28] WoofWoofDude: They can,t use that xD
[3:41:38] Tabakhase: what means they also mine it, so they can 51% attack themslef and make it all pointless again KEKW
[3:41:45] CorSPACE: still love the minecraft crypto based on people mining idea
[3:41:48] ZyianDev: but the game itself would have to be decentralized, otherwise the game server is the one source of truth, the block chain wouldn't make sense there
[3:41:50] Narkly: you need a blockchain if you want to do it without trusting one person
[3:41:56] WoofWoofDude: Yeah maybe it's possible
[3:41:58] Zozamex: because games dont have server issues already
[3:41:58] Kohta_Sama: that honestly seems like pandering to the NFT crowd tbh LUL
[3:42:04] DtDragon417: !pack
[3:42:04] Moobot: Waffle is playing Omnifactory.
[3:42:05] RodriCraft93: what is the name of that new crypto that was gonna be earned inside a game?

[3:42:17] BIFF72OL: BIFF72OL subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 45 months! 
[3:42:19] silentdojo: There are already online Card Games that use blockchain for each card
[3:42:19] Tabakhase: you 51% attack yourself
[3:42:23] SmokyMtnRed: @DecoyOcelot I have had a long-term world that I am thinking about moving ore processing to the void world.
[3:42:30] Demonwareltd: I'm still holding out for EnderCoins
[3:42:31] realCulprit: There are other uses for NFTs, there is a crypto that produces an NFT that can utilized as a vault for storing LP from staked crypo across multiple pools for ex

[3:42:56] realCulprit: lot of people just thing entertainment with NFT but there are way more application, something that can't be forged/
[3:42:56] ZyianDev: I mean if they use a small cluster of machines to secure it, I guess I can see that application
[3:42:58] Snuffolo: poe FeelsBadMan

[3:44:41] BlainL: how many ids you wanna save?
[3:44:41] rpo_Mave: That is wha they do in Diablo 2
[3:44:43] Kohta_Sama: F
[3:44:43] Sanduckchan: F
[3:44:45] ZyianDev: a hash seeded by item type?

[3:44:47] TappingT: F
[3:44:49] Soul_Synergy: F

[3:45:01] icesmoka: thank you mod team
[3:45:02] dogma802: How is duping normally fixed
[3:45:04] Shoderra: It seem incredibly straining for currencies for example
[3:45:15] d3fontour: @Giantwaffle thats the porpuse of that an item is unique to you, u can sell it
[3:45:23] tor_geir: wait, thats illegal
[3:45:25] lilyildiz: make every item a nft 5Head
[3:45:27] s_DeXTeR_s: Cheater
[3:45:30] coolcake2: idk sounds like way too much computing resources for that
[3:45:37] TappingT: @premalone001 mainly pc but rn you can play it on mobile or any tablet
[3:45:43] BrocketMann: HACKERMANS Found the diamonds
[3:45:44] realCulprit: if you don't have an NFT on the list of tokens that can access the stream, you can't watch it anymore monkaHmm
[3:45:44] Moobot: Support Waffle by using his Epic creator code: Giantwaffle
[3:45:51] Azafure: That scanning effect looks sick
[3:45:52] winnerab: @marqueezus by slowing down interactions, so you can't do two things at once hence duping the item
[3:46:00] premalonetv: Then u need a log for each individual item being generated from a loot table lol
[3:46:04] Wetware: That's like a Spelunker potion in Terraria!
[3:46:26] Tabakhase: precisely what csgo does 5Head
[3:46:30] coolcake2: @Giantwaffle ppl gonna be item laundering
[3:46:32] d3fontour: you cant dupe a blockchain item..
[3:46:50] Shoderra: You might be able to do it with valuable items, all items sound like a pipedream
[3:46:59] winnerab: duping is why only 1 person can typicly open a container in games
[3:47:08] d3fontour: so you can't @Giantwaffle
[3:47:10] SmokyMtnRed: @DecoyOcelot is the DEV version in their Discord? I have overlooked that one.
[3:47:13] GuyDefeaten: you can also dupe blockchain blocks
[3:47:13] BlainL: you could only save ids that are in the stash/inventar of the character
[3:47:15] Schyllion: that hammer might be my favourite minecraft mod
[3:47:25] realCulprit: there would be no "hiccup" style dupes, because of server latency. None that are real anyways, just visual maybe
[3:47:25] eikonotora: @giantwaffle you need that gravel
[3:47:32] The_Bantjes: @Giantwaffle take the gravel for the conduit
[3:47:40] DecoyOcelot: @SmokyMtnRed yeah, they have a guide on how to get on Dev. Its got loads of updates they are putting in 1.3
[3:48:04] SmokyMtnRed: @DecoyOcelot Thank you. I feel a restart LUL
[3:48:42] ssidii: you just need to track every possible item in the game, so you would need to make them finite amount
[3:48:44] Jabald_: EZ and Clap
[3:48:49] Shackky: tanonzJosh
[3:48:55] DecoyOcelot: @SmokyMtnRed Its a safe update for most stuff I think? Worth a test, just take a backup
[3:49:10] Mitsuninja: shift right click w empty hand on the drawer
[3:49:46] hypnoshroom333: hi waffle and chat ! just came and o boy i see hard modpack

[3:50:45] Leona_Carries_Me: FTB infinity evolved
[3:50:45] DecoyOcelot: GT:NH KEKW
[3:50:46] Mitsuninja: Direwolf
[3:50:50] Azafure: Direwolf20 is a solid pack if u just wanna fuck around with what ever
[3:50:57] rektumtv: direwolf is probably good because yt
[3:50:58] hypnoshroom333: @Endeavourz hmm you need tell more
[3:51:04] RussianRainbowTV: just start on Tekkit 1.2.5 EZ
[3:51:05] Masteve: @Giantwaffle I just ordered a MK3S+ after seeing the quality of your prints : )
[3:51:09] rektumtv: questing packs help aswell
[3:51:09] Venxuri: Anything that is popular, so it has a very nice playthrough that you can follow along
[3:51:10] iMelon: FTB Academy was too easy. I got some friends who were new to modded to try it--I dont think they actually enjoyed it
[3:51:14] daen0144isback: i miss the tekkit/unleashed days
[3:51:19] DemonicHell3: mc eternal isn't bad
[3:51:25] Tabakhase: Pyramid is nice and "beatable"
[3:51:26] SmokyMtnRed: Enigmatica 2 I think for an introduction to tech with the questbook he did
[3:51:30] DuckyBert: i liked stoneblock 2 as a beginner
[3:51:30] Bobberle: !modpack
[3:51:31] Moobot: Waffle is playing Omnifactory.
[3:51:37] Leona_Carries_Me: mc eternal is more magic based. he wants tech @DemonicHell3
[3:51:43] aeadon: nah, you need something with quests. maybe PO2 Titan or something
[3:51:44] BadStuart: i think the one you just played before is good Waffle, it makes you focus on the pack itself
[3:51:45] hypnoshroom333: true enigmatica 2 is fun but not expert
[3:51:47] Endeavourz: Thanks for suggestions!
[3:51:54] WGG25: do something without quests and modified recipes if you want to learn
[3:52:04] TheGodFish: How's the SN model going?
[3:52:06] weightmaker: did you finish the compaction modpack?
[3:52:08] key50: Has this modpack fixed it's fluid crafting mechanics? That's what turned me off of it when it first came out
[3:52:26] ssidii: chat and waffle, what do you think of a finite amount of e.g. exotic gear in mmos. So you if you had one, you would need to defend it and play the game actively.
[3:52:41] hypnoshroom333: KEKW finishing this page will take some really much time
[3:52:41] Jabald_: pepeSmoke
[3:52:50] daemonaedryn: Pets maybe?
[3:52:59] onefiestymango: onefiestymango subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 12 months! 
[3:53:07] BeardSyndicate: i think im going to try enigmatica 2 soon. also need a good tech pack for nubs
[3:53:08] daemonaedryn: Also maybe a home
[3:53:34] aeadon: we could call it grand marshal or high warlord monkaHmm
[3:53:39] Tabakhase: sooooo much cheating ... cant do such things
[3:53:42] hypnoshroom333: @key50 no im pissed off because that i did also stopped playing it but i tried it 1 more time and i beat it
[3:53:43] daemonaedryn: Best defender gets a castle to protect YEP
[3:53:49] IceBlueFire: Ashes of Creation is doing it where you can only have like 5 flying mounts (per month) on the entire server
[3:53:49] Moobot: Come join the Waffle House discord https://discord.gg/G5FeeveP3c and chat with the community! Remember to link your Twitch account in the Settings (gear) > Connections for subscriber channels.
[3:53:50] ssidii: pressure from other players

[3:55:46] realbobmaster: Walk around on the surface and scan. You’ll easily find some
[3:56:16] SpitfireTK: Sigh one of these days he will play it ..
[3:56:20] hypnoshroom333: @Giantwaffle just to let you know buying ores are really good way to get it in early game
[3:56:26] aeadon: i think you can get a module for the scanner to find specific ores
[3:56:37] RedDiablos: stripCozy
[3:56:39] Nilau: I would recommend making an ore wall, later on you can get a scanner upgrade for specfic blocks. With the ore wall you can just pick the ore you want and then go on the hunt
[3:56:42] hypnoshroom333: @Giantwaffle you dont even need be saving coins
[3:56:43] zedvawn: gregtech is based on IC2 right?
[3:56:46] MUHFUGGIN: you just made me yawn mr. streamer
[3:56:48] Dune_Shadow: did I miss the rocket launch?
[3:56:52] DecoyOcelot: you can make an upgrade for the scanner to target a particular ore, so you can buy one and scan for it after that
[3:57:01] M1k3D3l7a: I got my new bike today, Waffle PogChamp
[3:57:02] Dune_Shadow: Sadge

[3:57:57] Fnack: didn't the quest book say you can get new cake every hour?
[3:57:57] littlehugh: you craft it with coins
[3:58:07] Memi02: Waffle the quest is on a 1 hour repeatable, so you can collect another one :)
[3:58:14] DecoyOcelot: most ores are super cheep
[3:58:24] dcirusc30: you can buy 90% of the ores

[4:00:47] CoolReal: Actually Iron is 50% faster, copper is twice as fast
[4:00:50] itsKev73: anyone else start the mining part of their base by excavating a huge square pit?
[4:00:52] Leona_Carries_Me: you should make more iron furnaces in the new base lol. seems smeliting is your bottleneck
[4:01:05] JBourden: would be cool if there were drone logistics
[4:01:15] Valentin_PV: waffle have you tried Valheim? I think you'd love it as a survival game fan
[4:01:20] them4yor: @Giantwaffle I think you should roam through the city.. Hella loot in the buildings :)

[4:01:57] Valentin_PV: There's already so much content in it though
[4:01:58] dogma802: Have you already beaten the game? Isn't there like a fuckton of bosses?
[4:02:18] Valentin_PV: you can play it now then wait for version 1.0
[4:02:39] SpitfireTK: @gizzardd_ LOL Get good man, its easy solo, beat it in 1 week
[4:02:48] DecoyOcelot: @SmokyMtnRed mostly quality of life stuff, like filtering out full interfaces and searching by ingredients. also some minor TPS increases for large systems
[4:02:55] UsayHi: I'm 4h late pepoSad
[4:02:56] LikeAKnife: If you're gonna play Valhiem once, play it in a more complete state
[4:02:57] Valentin_PV: but what makes the enxt pudate special?
[4:02:58] Ender410: @marqueezus There is 5 bosses. I have almost 200 hours in it and still have 1 boss left. But we've spent a lot of time building
[4:03:00] TheUnrealOculus: Bruh did you see all the lightning in Austin in the past hour
[4:03:03] xfrozev2: There's a rubber tree on the sand left to the bridge go get it @Giantwaffle
[4:03:04] SmokyMtnRed: @DecoyOcelot Thank you
[4:03:04] JBourden: the valheim devs messed up, they had so much momentum with those 5m sales and the development looks stagnant 3.5 months later
[4:03:29] JBourden: LUL
[4:03:30] Tabakhase: its ded KEKW
[4:03:31] Valentin_PV: no they didn't, dev takes time
[4:03:33] danilul9: KEKW
[4:03:38] paulpkpk: Fall guys LULW
[4:03:53] parsow: The first three bosses were really cool, but the rest of the game was a walkover
[4:03:54] Nilau: Amogus widePepeLaugh
[4:03:59] M1k3D3l7a: What about Cyberpunk?
[4:04:07] PhoenixOperat1ve: Zombies ResidentSleeper
[4:04:07] 0ddR: amen brother!
[4:04:13] MisterInTheGame: Was Fall Guys not successful then?
[4:04:13] Valentin_PV: I was talking about valheim in response to that comment, not fall guys @Giantwaffle
[4:04:25] maj0rpayne: kino was quality.. ascension also
[4:04:30] SpitfireTK: @marqueezus How.. i beat the game with 90 hours solo
[4:04:31] Archelonde: zombies doesnt give them all the money
[4:04:37] Dracos555: what is the best beginner tech mod pack to start with?
[4:04:52] 101101101: use wand
[4:04:52] itsKev73: kind of waiting for more dyson sphere updates too before playing more
[4:04:56] aundros: Someone's still salty KEKW
[4:05:02] Tabakhase: 60 months today, but i dont like the blue & blue badge... NotLikeThis5000 - guess ill have to fix that to blue&red waffleLove
[4:05:04] Valentin_PV: yeah but the reason the game did this well is because they take their time making a quality product. If they start churning out content now it will not be as good and everyone will be dissapointed
[4:05:09] Tabakhase: bits badge tier notification =)
[4:05:14] JBourden: KEKW
[4:05:15] TimmyVRC: KEKW

[4:05:23] xfrozev2: There's a rubber tree on the sand left to the bridge go get it @Giantwaffle
[4:05:24] dogma802: I feel like the devs just didn't know what to do with zombies since their primary focus was just the high paced fps game + esport stuff
[4:05:24] itzSimondr98: pepeLaugh
[4:05:30] Valentin_PV: just because they have huge sales doesn't mean they should work non stop and start rushing things
[4:05:37] JBourden: EZ fixed

[5:49:35] Diehl_: its like 'Deal' lmao
[5:49:49] Shaggy_Lives: i have cousins last name Diehl .. they pronounce it "deal"
[5:49:55] ThatOnneGuy: DaemonSzyman idk I try not to check too often. I looked yesterday and it was like $2.16, looked today and it was sub $2
[5:49:56] Sopiili: I kinda lost intrest in that spider anime cuz of timeline is weird and the VA is kinda annoying LUL
[5:50:16] Yomaice: @giantwaffle the way you mine is offending me
[5:50:21] daemonaedryn: @ThatOnneGuy Atleast its no longer a 1.2 stable coin :)
[5:50:22] WoofWoofDude: @StOrMy1100 lost 70% at some point.. don't do like me, i sold and now i wanna cry cause i would have done like 250x.
[5:50:32] Joshuapetch: @ThatOnneGuy i worked out what i could have had if i didn't sell at 1.33.. If i sold at the high i would have had an exra 2k Sadge
[5:50:33] ThatOnneGuy: Watching your portfolio when you have no intention on day trading is stressful for no reason
[5:50:39] Archelonde: she carries that show hard
[5:50:40] Sopiili: Well I can tolerate her, but the timeline bro, its so confusing
[5:50:55] Unkn0wn_Nam3: is there dev null or dank nulls in the pack ?
[5:51:05] ThatOnneGuy: Joshuapetch peepoSad
[5:51:05] cubfan74: Hey waffle what ever happened to bacon donut
[5:51:12] leipesalty: havent been here in a long time.... what the? whats on ur fac3? :p
[5:51:20] StOrMy1100: @WoofWoofDude Sorry to hear that. Would probably still be smarter to sell some of my portfolio. Profit is profit
[5:51:26] Chronoes: I think the exact opposite, I would've dropped the anime without the human part
[5:51:29] AlphaWarrior987: The story is also a 15 year time difference tho
[5:51:29] Joshuapetch: @ThatOnneGuy I just gotta keep telling myself that gains are gains and to be happy with what i got
[5:51:40] FalleNM3rC: @Giantwaffle have you tried to make a dev null?
[5:51:41] ThatOnneGuy: Joshuapetch NODDERS
[5:51:43] Tapeman83: The human part is super-important to the story, you can’t drop it
[5:51:44] DrHax_: what anime (I assume) are we talking about?
[5:51:49] Sopiili: I agree with the human par, but that whats makes it so confusing, when the timelines of the humans and kumo are mixed
[5:51:54] Tabakhase: i kinda love, and hate that ore-distribution PepoThink
[5:51:59] daemonaedryn: @Joshuapetch my gains on ADA were like £40 pepeLaugh
[5:52:08] DecoyOcelot: nope
[5:52:12] DecoyOcelot: its never enough
[5:52:17] KnightNave: nope
[5:52:20] daemonaedryn: For the hour atleast
[5:52:23] Sopiili: DrHax_ reincarnated as a spider
[5:52:27] dennixfailalot: moar
[5:52:29] ThatOnneGuy: I thought about selling my ADA at $2.40 because a drop was imminent... but I just don't want too LUL
[5:52:29] WoofWoofDude: @StOrMy1100 If you think you can predict the bottom sure.. i can't, im better off buying more and lowering my avg/unit
[5:52:38] Joshuapetch: @DaemonSzyman KEKW
[5:52:43] DrHax_: oh, havent seen that one yet, thanks @Sopiili
[5:52:43] SaayaTheGamerTeaTime: hello
[5:52:55] ThatOnneGuy: I am staking NODDERS
[5:52:55] Harknis: Im doing my part!
[5:52:59] CoolReal: Buy and wait
[5:52:59] Goodmangammering: Your probably good for like an hour if your making steady progress
[5:52:59] ausHenry: what ep are you on the human part does get better after ep10
[5:53:01] BrocketMann: Staking is PogChamp
[5:53:05] DrunkOrNah: 6% back is a great return on a normal year.
[5:53:09] MrPooter: When starting mod packs, whats the best way to learn the mods? Modpacks are so huge haha
[5:53:09] moonman7890: what does stake it mean
[5:53:21] ThatOnneGuy: Staking is basically interest
[5:53:22] moonman7890: @Giantwaffle what does stake it mean
[5:53:28] WoofWoofDude: @moonman7890 don't touch it
[5:53:39] StOrMy1100: @WoofWoofDude I'm not selling tho. I meant I shouldve sold a bit because lots of coins of mine were ATH. My average is so low that even when I buy now my average goes up
[5:53:41] Onred: You lose like 3 epochs
[5:53:42] Tapeman83: Play an easier pack and learn them first, then move up to harder packs @mrpooter
[5:53:49] EddieAcefire: but greeding with day trading for more ada seems logical Kappa
[5:53:58] Diehl_: taking it to the sand casino
[5:54:02] ThatOnneGuy: Plus by selling you have to pay taxes
[5:54:08] ThatOnneGuy: like... y sell
[5:54:09] WoofWoofDude: @StOrMy1100 Yeah idk what i would do in that situation xD
[5:54:12] thomasausen: obsidian furnance next ?
[5:54:22] MrPooter: @Tapeman83 True, recently played MCEternal, but I pretty much followed a playthrough and learned a lot
[5:54:25] listikuss: Hi guys, hi Waffle! :) How's the progress? @Giantwaffle
[5:54:40] RamseyRinehaus: also Daddy Musk doesnt tweet about it every other day
[5:54:52] WoofWoofDude: @StOrMy1100 If you think it can go up.. i guess you buy more when it dips ?
[5:54:54] EddieAcefire: staking is ethical chat
[5:54:58] Exerion09: Diamond>obsidian  imo
[5:54:59] daemonaedryn: So are you thinking of continuing this pack tomorrow or giving the other one a go? @Giantwaffle
[5:55:03] Tabakhase: get some lava for a cobblegen too LUL
[5:55:04] squashplant: dogefather is life tho
[5:55:07] ThatOnneGuy: I just don't have the attention span to day trade. I've also dealt with a stressful amount of taxes as a cab driver, that shit is for the birds. Make it as simple as possible.
[5:55:12] Sanduckchan: for what reason does this grasblock and the cake get consumed btw?
[5:55:12] Moobot: Support Waffle by using his Epic creator code: Giantwaffle
[5:55:18] StOrMy1100: @WoofWoofDude I should probably look into some altcoins, but I just don't have the time for it currently
[5:55:19] IvanGodlike: waffle you are building an infinite water source rn, why make another one
[5:55:27] leipesalty: about doge, love it. my 150 turned into 5k euro
[5:55:43] StOrMy1100: @WoofWoofDude Yeah bought some extra BTC and BNT, but not much else
[5:55:46] danilul9: KEKW
[5:55:49] Wetware: Waffle is a Hydro Hommie
[5:55:52] WoofWoofDude: @StOrMy1100 it's going to bring your avg up tho.. but overall i guess you still win if you sell higher then the max you paid at some point
[5:56:03] StOrMy1100: @WoofWoofDude Indeed
[5:56:41] Shaggy_Lives: watched Russell Brand starting a deep dive into learning how crypto currency works .. pretty entertaining
[5:56:59] Tylerbuell16: whats going on waffle!
[5:57:04] IvanGodlike: if he needs buckets its instant anyway i believe and if he has machines they are probably slow from the start anyway
[5:57:06] Tabakhase: lava widepeepoSad
[5:57:09] daemonaedryn: So are you thinking of continuing this pack tomorrow or giving the other one a go? @Giantwaffle
[5:57:27] Sanduckchan: btw for what reason does the grassblock and the cake get consumed whats the point?
[5:57:39] TarMonA: magnet backpack KEKW
[5:57:44] M1ke_RL: what platform do you use to look at crypto charts? @Giantwaffle
[5:58:23] thepolaroidbear: No 1.16 packs that looked good?
[5:58:25] EddieAcefire: I miss dyson sphere already PepeHands
[5:58:30] Gbusrt: have you payed a 1.16 pack ?
[5:58:38] RamseyRinehaus: feels like lower-tech PO3
[5:58:45] daemonaedryn: Nice, definately looks like an interesting pack but not one that I'd personally enjoy
[5:59:09] LuciferSpirt: NODDERS
[5:59:20] Harrierfalcon: that white ship tho
[5:59:26] daemonaedryn: Considering the amount of singularities you need, I seriously hope the automation is good LUL
[5:59:26] Exerion09: Yes extreme automation focused without the annoyance
[5:59:30] Tapeman83: This pack is really good IMO
[5:59:37] MrPooter: Was thinking of getting into a game that has automation, management? Kinda like minecrat modded. Any suggestions?
[5:59:40] ro6ch: are you having a good day?
[5:59:59] daemonaedryn: Factorio, Satisfactory, Dyson Sphere Program
[6:00:02] Mr_Perril: LOOL
