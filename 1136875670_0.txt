[0:27:25] HyperGenics: I make 300k+. Medical consultation FTW. Money makes life worth living. If I get a chance to make more, I will. Money buys happiness.
[0:27:26] magyx__: @kypudo true

[0:27:38] jojardo: It is better to cry on silk sheets
[0:27:39] Rarma_: What if I meant you had no career after that payday/contract?
[0:27:40] Larklen: KEKW
[0:27:40] Paffell: base amount of enough money definitely equals happiness
[0:27:43] ba_nanananananana: the study about money and happiness started looking at people who already had high income and compared them to people with even higher income.
[0:27:44] V4Veuce: truth
[0:27:48] amoosedontgomoo: Millionaires cry too bro, they just do it in a mansion
[0:27:50] Damikiller37: People thinking streamers will last out till they are at the ordinary retirement age. Of course they are banking while they can.
[0:27:52] XiaoBaiMalz: Sad Rich bastard <-
[0:27:53] lightsout4378: The balance is time. If you can make a ton of money and still have time to do the things you love, thats good

[0:27:53] LVL97Magikarp: rather cry in a lambo than a public bus lol

[0:28:00] Rarma_: Sad rich people just do coke lmao
[0:28:01] Nexhunter: no amount of money will fix my anxiety but not having to worry about where i am living or paying my bills would make life better NODDERS

[0:28:37] Neptar: better to cry in a mansion than in a public toilet
[0:28:37] ba_nanananananana: So, a study that never compared the happiness of rich and poor people, but instead looked at "rich and richer"... is used to tell poor people money isn't making you happy LUL

[0:33:03] Neptar: why thursday?
[0:33:05] AO_KINGZEUS2424: says 1 run then a 8 hr stream happens
[0:33:05] ChalkLicker: How far have you gotten before?
[0:33:07] Hazno: @AO_KINGZEUS2424 what kind of benefits? if you could earn more money than the benefits are worth, then going for the money is a no-brainer imo
[0:33:07] Moobot: You can find Waffle's Youtube channel here - https://youtube.com/giantwaffle
[0:33:09] Cagelight: beating this game is only the start, most of the content in this game is secret content

[0:34:34] Scojan: Did you decide if you're going to checkout that cargo game today @Giantwaffle
[0:34:47] Larklen: @Ycrems yup, right now its any sub but in future it may change to Tier 2 and up subs
[0:34:49] shlazzer: noita in 3d would be a CPU killer

[0:35:46] shlazzer: is the wand good or are the spells good
[0:36:02] Hazno: @AO_KINGZEUS2424 yeah, but again, if you would earn way more than those benefits are worth, you could just pay for those benefits yourself and have money to spare
[0:36:13] Kingeraser: burn it :)
[0:36:14] shlazzer: shoot the lantern

[0:47:24] daemonaedryn: The real question is what does it mean to beat the game KEKW
[0:47:28] Chronoes: @Tabakhase apparently multi-month subs and gifted subs cannot upgrade
[0:47:29] QuestionableSpaceCat: Chat is gonna backseat anyways
[0:47:34] Bombdog1244: I THINK
[0:47:36] Duckaerobics: COPIUM
[0:47:38] Cagelight: is getting the bad ending *really* beating the game though?
[0:47:45] Wibit: enemy knowledge is all you're missing
[0:47:45] osakey: He doesn't know pvpSK
[0:47:49] SynecFD: You could have, but still unlikely
[0:47:55] sigtrap: Yes, I guess you have the basic knowledge (including the worst NMY's)
[0:48:02] Birdy_Cloud: there's certain interactions for spells u'll never learn on  ur own , i'd say it's fine to look at that after u beat it urself
[0:48:02] Daemonaux: @Giantwaffle no matter how many immunities or hp you have you can still be polymorphed and 1 shot
[0:48:09] Tabakhase: @Chronoes @hookssecondacnt waffleHmm gifted i think can -- multimonth im not sure tbh, may be true...
[0:48:13] Pee_aRe: chat be backseating anything... lol even if you're just chatting 🤣
[0:48:22] SynecFD: Not because of the wand build, but you never faced the boss and have no idea what he does
[0:48:25] hookssecondacnt: @Tabakhase yeah multi month you cant - its a know issue
[0:48:30] bm01: chat backseats cooking streams
[0:48:44] daemonaedryn: @bm01 true KEKW
[0:48:46] MaxPainAlchmst: A 33 orb run could take 15+ hours and that is just one way to beat Noita @Giantwaffle
[0:48:48] Larklen: KEKW
[0:49:09] RodriCraft93: you sure it wasnt the bubbles in air
[0:49:11] Mapleton: @bm01 if we can't taste it we can at least whine about it
