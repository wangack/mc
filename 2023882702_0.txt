[1:08:48] connr_6: i forget, is this series the baked bean fort?
[1:09:05] AerosArcana: yes
[1:09:06] scion3968: yeah it is
[1:09:10] ArtyBat: I think you have your answer
[1:09:21] AerosArcana: LUL
[1:09:25] scion3968: this format of video is crazy comfy
[1:09:26] ArtyBat: I don't think they have the can yet
[1:09:41] idkwtct123: And so I dig sometimes for some coal and some stone And I think to myself, I'm all alone And then I, I saw a cute little piggy
[1:10:00] AerosArcana: nah i think they're still deciding on materials to build it at this point
[1:10:09] scion3968: i'm surprised it's not commonplace nowadays, given how much emphasis is put on consistent uploads
[1:10:18] ArtyBat: also sphax is nostalgic
[1:10:30] idkwtct123: And so I fed you some wheat and you followed me All the way back to the factory And then I screamed at the top of my lungs "Best friends from now on!"
[1:10:37] scion3968: sphax with the obligatory 50% of textures being defaults
[1:10:58] ArtyBat: well with mods...
[1:11:16] idkwtct123: And I say Hey-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah, hey-yeah-yeah I said, "Hey! Best friends from now on!" And I say Hey-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah, hey-yeah-yeah I said, "Hey! Let's get this cookin' on!"
[1:11:28] AerosArcana: this was before Soartex became more popular and more supported
[1:11:32] ArtyBat: are you just copy-pasting XD
[1:11:50] scion3968: @ArtyBat yeah, but it's like carbon dating - you know what era something is in based off of how scuffed the tps are :p
[1:12:05] ArtyBat: hahaha
[1:12:23] idkwtct123: yes

[1:13:05] AerosArcana: was this when they still called them texture packs? before they became "resource packs"?
[1:13:16] scion3968: waaaay before
[1:13:30] idkwtct123: And he fried! Oh, my God, did I fry? I fried all the pork It's a taste infusion And he grills! Oh my God, did I grill? It was such a thrill Myah! Pass the barbecue sauce
[1:13:44] idkwtct123: And I say Hey-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah, hey-yeah-yeah I said, "Hey! My best friend has now gone!" And I say Don't cry for me (Hey-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah, hey-yeah-yeah) Just keep me inside (I said hey!) Inside of your big dwarf belly (Hey-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah, hey-yeah) Hey-yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah Eating friends is so wrong
[1:13:46] scion3968: they will always be texture packs in my heart
[1:13:47] AerosArcana: my memory isn't that good
[1:14:20] scion3968: yeah it defo is because the items are still numeric ids rather than string ids, pretty sure it was 2015-2017 they started being resource packs
[1:14:25] AerosArcana: yeah i think i rarely call them 'resource packs' when talking about them tbh
[1:15:00] thewebsucks: true texture packs
[1:15:06] scion3968: back in the days where if your mods loaded in the wrong order you'd brick your save
[1:15:52] AerosArcana: can you remember if you crashed out in single player it would corrupt the entire save?
[1:16:04] AerosArcana: that was a pain in the neck
[1:16:16] scion3968: tbh, i never played modded singleplayer haha
[1:16:31] scion3968: that was always some sketchy server operators problem lol
[1:16:36] AerosArcana: i had the problem with unmodded too
[1:16:57] ArtyBat: give honeydew 64 46
[1:17:33] ArtyBat: or is it the other way around?
[1:17:40] scion3968: 46 64 pretty sure
[1:17:51] AerosArcana: if it crashed to desktop, you'd have to find a fresh NBT data save to replace the corrupted one
[1:17:56] ArtyBat: yeah id then amount
[1:18:18] connr_6: minecraft version 1.6.4 my goodness...
[1:18:30] scion3968: feelsoldman
[1:18:39] AerosArcana: 1.7.10 is still my favourite
[1:19:06] scion3968: jarvis bring me back to beta 1.2
[1:19:07] ArtyBat: foreshadowing
[1:19:37] ArtyBat: I started in alpha I think 1.11
[1:19:44] ArtyBat: compasses were the new thing

[1:20:15] scion3968: i remember watching kiershar videos and going "wow i really want to make a tnt cannon"
[1:20:22] AerosArcana: i can't remember the version i started playing i just know my favourite for modded minecraft experience
[1:20:27] ArtyBat: haha
[1:20:55] ArtyBat: I discovered YOGS when the 1.8 beta got leaked and they tried it
[1:21:09] ArtyBat: strongholds, mineshaft, endies, giant mushrooms...
[1:21:28] scion3968: i started in the adventure island days pretty sure
[1:21:41] scion3968: that crazy transition to shadow of israphel and the beginning of the yogscast cinematic universe
[1:21:54] ArtyBat: yeah it was weird
[1:22:20] scion3968: before you had toomanyitems as well, you needed a separate tool to open your save to edit your inventory
[1:22:21] AerosArcana: i loved watching them play adventure maps, Toxic Hospital and the Noxcrew one still burnt in my memory
[1:22:25] scion3968: pretty sure tmi was beta 1.7?
