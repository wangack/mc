[3:08:10] Goat_Locker: The reason for the salty snacks in the bar is the salt make you more thirsty, so you order more.
[3:08:11] ClawTheBeastt: just talking and they design you one after a convo

[3:12:44] Gingerosis: didnt you used to dress up for pizza friday? @Giantwaffle
[3:12:50] bictage: hot is temperature, spicy is spicy
[3:12:53] Kuroiorb: well there's tons of curry out there! jamaican, indian, japanese, thai
[3:13:01] ShuroCae: spices add depth
[3:13:02] deathfurr: curry?
[3:13:06] Guidebird: my dad watches you
[3:13:14] noobyscope69: SeemsGood
[3:13:16] Mr_Neffer: we are making homemade detroit style pizza tonight cant wait
[3:13:18] Reloadinko: maybe some spices are harder to digest when you arent used to them
[3:13:19] Allmostdone: but your stomach cant taste things
[3:13:19] Stukya: So many sensation's when eating indian food. Its the best
[3:13:22] Parzzs: @Giantwaffle Have you tried Filipino food?
[3:13:24] Lars_Keizer: Sichuan food Kreygasm
[3:13:26] tony2o1: @Giantwaffle you should check out Enoteca Maria / Nonnas of the World from new york now that is in my opinion creative. They hire different grandmothers from different ethnicity and they cook for the day, they rotate daily. so grandmas make that extra money and get something to do and you get that real grandma cooking
[3:13:33] Kuroiorb: maybe I should get jamaican food tonight
[3:13:45] Butt_on_Masher: I'm too much of a light weight for Jamaican spice, scotch bonnet fucks me up
[3:13:48] Gingerosis: i know mala from food wars :)
[3:13:50] Lars_Keizer: Oh it took me a long time to get used to it as well haha
[3:13:52] IKOLIBAI: Turkish food is the best
[3:13:54] McBreezie: Sounds like cocaine.
[3:13:56] xDeadBringerx: @msfWEBdude I told my omekase chef I can't have shellfish(allergy). While the rest of the 11 people there got fresh shrimp sushi I was getting an amazing o-toro sashimi
[3:14:03] jimmynoskills: how are you flying @Giantwaffle ?
[3:14:03] nxusr: IIRC mala literally means numb & spicy (la = spicy)
[3:14:08] Guidebird: My father watches you
[3:14:11] clumsykoala: idk people like mapu toffu
[3:14:13] Raphgeibuh: honestly i cant eat spicy hot food cuz i really dont taste anything other all the pain there is in my mouth
[3:14:18] Kuroiorb: I have a gallon bag full of scotch bonnets in my freezer LUL @Butt_on_Masher
[3:14:19] hopesbtw: @McBreezie cocaine feels better then sichuan pepper LULW
[3:14:27] andthrax: thats the best part of spice
[3:14:40] bictage: why don't you just do it?
[3:14:49] kiffar: yep!
[3:14:51] Aldiron: I've had bartenders where I told them to make me something but I said I don't like Gin. and he goes "Let me make you something with gin in it and i guarantee you'll love it". He was right.
[3:14:56] tiredcanadiandad: like fatty tuna...over and over
[3:14:56] haitham506: yep

[3:15:20] ShuroCae: a giant waffle lounge? sign me up
[3:15:27] Chyromyr: I used to be like that with pizza, always order hawaii. Now I consciously order something new as long as I don't dislike any of the ingredients.
[3:15:29] Dagmoo: my favorite restaurants i try everything on the menu slowly NODDERS
[3:15:30] Guidebird: My father watches you
[3:15:31] vZxch_: Good old chicken tenders and fries
[3:15:46] MallowGameShow: Hey trying different sushi is fun and all but nothing beats that one you love
[3:15:46] msfWEBdude: @xdeadbringerx yeah our guy knows we loves his baked mussels so he always works that into the flavor arc
[3:15:46] Kuroiorb: we got it 👍 @Guidebird
[3:15:48] September2030: no u have the bit on the other side of the kingdom
[3:15:49] Evol_Eno: meow
[3:15:53] Butt_on_Masher: I enjoy spicy food but at some point it just ruins the meal , goes from tastes good to no taste and just pain
[3:16:03] AquaSkully: why not take one day out of the week to be a day for trying something new and keep something in the house as a back-up plan

[3:21:20] mahajimbo: what is time
[3:21:23] Lars_Keizer: 4-5 people is more than enough for Japan. You want to visit the smaller restaurants a lot to be fair, and with more than 5 you'll have a very hard time finding seating
[3:21:29] OMICRON: cooksuXpeeka i see my name cooksuXyeeee

[3:22:58] elf_machine: @That0neGeye Probably the same? I feel like some US people forget covid exists outside of the US. It wasn't an election year where I live.
[3:23:04] powgang: yes
[3:23:05] OMICRON: cooksuXyesss
[3:23:07] RPGFiends: sounds right

[3:24:15] Moobot: You can find Waffle's Youtube channel here - https://youtube.com/giantwaffle
[3:24:16] JackVaine: RetroGaijin has a huuuge effort every year to extend his visa. He has a registered business there tho
[3:24:17] Lord_arcon: If you are there as a tourist they will love you, if you come to work and live oh boy @Giantwaffle
[3:24:21] Denethor: KEKW ?
[3:24:24] Myekos: bonus
[3:24:25] daemonaedryn: Oh nah they can fuck off

[3:24:53] MetalBBA: and people think tips are dumb
[3:24:57] biscy_311: aging population they need it KEKW
[3:24:58] Bulva: its not about racism, most foreigners are not respect to their neighbors so they dont want them in their apartment @Giantwaffle
[3:24:59] IamWambo_: What happens if you dont do it
[3:24:59] general_jim_bot: so what you are saying is become a landlord in japan to make some real money
[3:25:00] Cmdr_Void: that sounds like extortion with extra steps
[3:25:01] Lars_Keizer: It's outlawed, but it does exist. Officially it cannot be NOT a deposit
[3:25:18] Beautyfades: I think i need to own real estate in japan then lol
[3:25:18] Kuroiorb: less racism and more xenophobia, but still @Bulva
[3:25:20] Lord_arcon: thats just a weird culture thing @Giantwaffle probably has something to do with something from the samurai period or whatnot
[3:25:25] HeyAFrozenZebra: In order to get Japanese citizenship you have to renounce all other nationalities
[3:25:31] Myekos: it's literally foreign
[3:25:36] JareBear: sounds like it would be terrible to move often

[4:26:30] itsIffy: you don't deal with floats, just use bigdecimal :)
[4:26:31] McBreezie: Exchange rates w/ currency.
[4:26:35] Zimmygee: thats why you use integers for currency.. even 1 is 1 cent
[4:26:41] xDeadBringerx: With currency you ALWAYS do integer math or big decimal
[4:26:42] Kaomie: Hu did Betty Wight just die?
[4:26:42] Kyostm: i just save everything as cents
[4:26:42] Hunter_Boone: are you saying that because of your subathon application?

[4:27:45] GFQPR1882: https://clips.twitch.tv/BlindingSassyKittenDerp
[4:27:54] Experior: Considering that you cast to int and float, I believe it will have differences internally, almost for sure
[4:28:03] MrJockson: so uh Betty White died my man. just got a push notification on it
[4:28:05] HippyDelight: Did a coding project and my prof marked me down 33% for rounding currency to two decimals. Stupidest shit ever

[4:29:42] brotatowin: can aperson die in 2 different years? 2021/2022 by time zone
[4:29:47] Zalhat: A MIXTURE of the flu and coronavirus, dubbed Flurona, has been detected in Israel. great start of the year
[4:29:50] jalalrafiyev: @Seldric_1 I hope you can make it too KEKW

[4:32:38] HippyDelight: I’d take a billion keywords over a billion imports at the top of your code
[4:32:38] DatoPotatoDato: @Viper_Electric imo thats the ideal way to learn programming but admittedly not as easy, but w that route u will at least know how everything works beyond your code which will prevent you from writing obvious inefficient code
[4:32:42] st3x_: your gate is to wide
[4:32:49] Alcky26: isnt the gate to wide?
[4:32:54] Kaomie: Oh No
[4:32:57] Seldricc: the gate IS too wide
[4:32:57] Alcky26: yeah @st3x_  KEKW
[4:33:02] Pixe1punk: yeah it's wider than the other one
[4:33:05] sprockettes: its because the slate and stairs are at different layers. thats why it feels wrong but its right
[4:33:08] DatoPotatoDato: the gate is widepeepoHappy
[4:33:17] CtrlAltDavelete: @CakeYay python is very popular in cybersecurity world. you also should learn system administration for linux or windows and and powershell / shell scripting
[4:33:22] xDeadBringerx: I'm a firm believer that anyone getting taught Python today should learn about the Type Annotations(typings) straight away.
[4:33:24] Vestitude: we all too widepeepoHappy

[4:36:01] HippyDelight: Lookin good
[4:36:02] AnesthesiaFC: dont know if you meant to, but only put 6 slabs on one side and 7 on the other
[4:36:03] HotRayne: Isn't still wider?
[4:36:04] Kuroiorb: not much, node is pretty easy to pick up @CakeYay
[4:36:06] itsIffy: @DatoPotatoGames hard to say - you need to be comfortable with a few things like handling collections, and basic programming paradigms
[4:36:07] imeasytokill: the corners of the inlays are fucked though
[4:36:14] Kaomie: Missing a slab NotLikeThis
[4:36:15] Kuroiorb: oh woops wrong person
[4:36:22] CakeYay: @Kuroiorb Node?
[4:36:27] I3ailey: slab top right yeah
[4:36:28] Kuroiorb: not much, node is pretty easy to pick up @DatoPotatoGames
[4:36:34] SousSage: Just have one of the henchmen clean it up
[4:36:39] imeasytokill: you have a normal brick on the corners of the stairs instead of a black one
[4:36:40] Hunter_Boone: you need a slab on the top right
[4:36:41] CtrlAltDavelete: @DatoPotatoGames I would learn node while learning javascript. node isnt a framework. its for back-end virtual environments to setup and deploy web apps.
[4:36:43] AmitKings: can you do sideways stairs?
[4:36:51] Kuroiorb: I @ the wrong person, my b @CakeYay

[6:13:04] Lars_Keizer: @KraveWasTaken Coffins are expensive, but land-leasing a grave is as well. It's not uncommon for graves to be cleared after the minimum (often 10 or 15 years) because the lease is too high
[6:13:05] NarwhalArgy: @Giantwaffle Even gravestones are expensive as well

[7:44:18] Hunter1701: occiHmm So vrc is at 24.6k players atm what will it get to by later tonight
[7:44:23] celadriel23: 12gb is a shitload for an MC server, especially one with no mods
[7:44:29] Apparentthreat: how many vcpu did you get ?
[7:44:35] Mr_Perril: Its a Athlon Thunderbird 1Ghz single core
[7:44:35] brightcandle: Its 5600x 6 cores @3.7Ghz if its an OVH-game1
[7:44:45] Miestro: it's a real server not virtualized Apparentthreat

[7:46:14] rpo_Mave: lorik
[7:46:20] Apparentthreat: Miestro it's negligible on good infrastructure. there's a reason people are moving away from on-prem infrastructure to cloud / virtualized
