[0:48:54] PeterThePooh: Are you going for 1370?
[0:48:56] Sportman4Life: If you run out of his field for a few seconds, the build up debuff will reset to 0
[0:49:30] babyaddalyn: good morning/afternoon/evening
[0:49:46] Venxuri: more than 3
[0:49:50] Venxuri: because mats from your bard
[0:49:54] Astrophysics288: i failed 5 hones to +14 and my friend one tapped 3 hones to +15
[0:49:57] Xeroxbeta: guardian stone crystals are only 16 gold
[0:50:20] Xeroxbeta: you also dont have wind cut which is the best skill for getting stacks
[0:50:48] xcr_: great honor leapstone is at 200g on euc
[0:50:48] Dumpified: thats assuming the boss stays in it
[0:50:51] Xeroxbeta: 5 stacks with a 18 second cd vs 5 stacks for a 10 second cd
[0:50:59] celadriel23: cruel is 40

[0:52:38] Tengokuuu: Waffle luck widepeepoSad
[0:52:59] Paraduex: when a streamer goes on Vacation it throws off my entire schedule KEKW

[0:53:03] Moobot: You can find Waffle's Youtube channel here - https://youtube.com/giantwaffle
[0:53:06] Theodarius: pirate coins?
[0:53:14] Miracleshot: boss rush gives leapstones
[0:53:18] Astrophysics288: make sure the % add up to 100 tho, so you dont get stuck with a 96% artisan energy for example
[0:53:25] sogerr: gems too
[0:53:26] imTymp: gems and leaps
[0:53:29] Nexhunter: yea cube and boss are bad for mats
[0:53:30] Tengokuuu: Gems and leaps, that's it
[0:53:34] Nexhunter: that aren't leapstones or juicers
[0:53:34] heydreammm: your alt?
[0:53:36] Tengokuuu: Cube is % mats
[0:53:41] sam1390: hot 1340 last night, I guess I get my alts up to t3 now
[0:53:43] Nexhunter: infinite chaos dwjftSuffer
[0:53:45] Theodarius: chaos dungeon doing infinite chaos
[0:53:47] Xeroxbeta: but the leapstones that you get from boss rush you can sell to get stones
[0:54:06] Venxuri: do chaos on bard, drop gear, buy from merchant ship
[0:54:13] xcr_: that's alot of farming my friend
[0:54:15] Nexhunter: COPIUM cheap COPIUM
[0:54:21] DitchWoctor: whats the guardian stone price in US?
[0:54:22] Theodarius: they go higher in price each time u buy them
[0:54:33] xcr_: ^
[0:54:41] Almanes: You have potion that gives you energy for chaos (it will be depleted in few days so use it while you can)
[0:54:49] Astrophysics288: 800 for 240 blue crystals?
[0:55:18] CiVR: I’m now convinced GameStop waited for me to sell my LRC to announce
[0:55:25] Theodarius: man its wild that people get stuck getting the full set for t3
[0:55:30] RangerTroops: PotFriend PotFriend PotFriend
[0:55:50] A_Tin_Rat: @CiVR never sell
[0:56:26] heydreammm: you can buy out the ship merch on your bard once its 1302
[0:56:27] Astrophysics288: destruction stones
[0:56:43] Theodarius: he means 800 guardian stones for 240 blue crystals in mari shop
[0:57:08] Astrophysics288: @Theodarius yeah, my bad! bit sleepy :D
[0:57:09] Jimbobs8: got the harp lol
[0:57:10] Dumpified: i get anywhere from 2 - 6 scam calls a day
[0:57:11] Quickillll: You got the Harp
[0:57:28] imTymp: if you put ur number on the do not call list and u get called by the company technically you can sue
[0:57:42] Theodarius: not worth it at all
[0:57:46] warmwalrus: not worth
[0:57:49] VinnyOG: technically the do not call list is just another list to get your number from
[0:57:50] Tengokuuu: None
[0:57:51] Tengokuuu: LUL
[0:57:52] daemonaedryn: Less content
[0:57:55] Xeroxbeta: if you are on the do not call list then you can take them to court over it, which would just be reaching out to a lawyer and asking if they want free and easy money
[0:57:55] Dumpified: e peen
[0:57:56] Triz08: whatever makes you happy
[0:57:58] Kostas117: not worth with the reset being tomorrow
[0:57:58] VengeanceUM: @imTymp yea but sometimes they are calling from a diff country scamming ppl lol
[0:58:00] Nyuviix: You get an extra argos, thats it
[0:58:04] kurblet: you need two weeks of abyss to get enough gear to get 1385
[0:58:07] keeneye204: bragging rights
[0:58:19] warmwalrus: if youre on the edge, just take one more week no biggy
[0:58:30] VengeanceUM: 1 swipe turns into 2, then 2 to 20 and 20 to 200 and 200 to bankruptcy
[0:58:43] AmidAiz: swiped like 30 to get to tire 3 on an alt
[0:58:53] kurblet: you need two weeks of argos+abyss
[0:59:02] keeneye204: just think its a free game whats couple hundred bucks to support it, lol
[0:59:03] warmwalrus: yea, but most ppl start out with abyss + argos and upgrade from there
[0:59:12] Theodarius: depends if u are able to do multiple phases. if u are only doing p1 and p2, it might take a bit
[0:59:15] Celnoc: I had mats to push 1370 (with average luck) yesterday but no time to play LA yesterday and today so I'm waiting reset before I'm pushing
[0:59:23] DeadlyBrother: oreha hard gives you a set as well
[0:59:48] Nyuviix: YEP
[0:59:52] kurblet: Its best to just get as many legendary as possible and then go for the full set later
[1:00:02] ldvemonl: i did 2 and 2 for both first bonus set ^^
[1:00:11] sam1390: If i run both Oreha at 1340, do I get enough for a full legendary set or do I have to run it multiple weeks?
[1:00:20] Nyuviix: Make sure you reroll your weapon a bit too, so you can get somewhat good quality on it since you will use it untill 1445
[1:00:20] kurblet: I did weapon from argos + 1 gear, then 2 gear from abyss
[1:00:24] Venxuri: i doesnt matter, whatever yoiu do you get 5 peices
[1:00:40] ChillyFierce: mc after?
[1:00:41] DitchWoctor: @Giantwaffle you can craft tons of jewels instead of crafting abyssal set and they sell for a lot
[1:01:06] DeadlyBrother: @sam1390 you don't get legenderay set at 1340
[1:01:06] Moobot: Come join the Waffle House Discord! <# https://discord.gg/fhGFtMuzdS
[1:01:09] TheNamlit: @sam1390 I got all armor pieces from 2 and will get the weapon after reset so 2 weeks
[1:01:19] KittenMitton: the abyss set sucks anyways, the bonus is useless
[1:01:44] TCaillet: Hello!
[1:01:52] babyaddalyn: next boss is 25th
[1:01:56] kurblet: Sorry yeah its 3 from abyss, then 1 + wep from argos
[1:02:00] DeadlyBrother: its not useless for some classes
[1:02:04] Kenji_QQ: the hard abyss set isn't bad, just the normal abyss
[1:02:08] celadriel23: it depends
[1:02:12] LordDusk: tomorrow is chaos gate
[1:02:13] sam1390: @TheNamlit so purple sunset from regular, yellow chosen from hard? is the purple sunset worth it over the chaos purple set?
[1:02:31] HKRage: who else is excited to be disappointed by today's announcement? Copium
[1:02:33] kurblet: the purple set sucks
[1:02:49] RodriCraft93: @Giantwaffle do you still Hodl LRC ?
[1:02:53] Venxuri: you get 3 pieces from hard abyss and 2 pieces from argos
[1:02:58] warmwalrus: the purple set looks good at least on sorc KEKW
[1:03:04] Nyuviix: You need legendary gear regardless so you can upgrade to 1385/1400
[1:03:08] rykk3r1: I crafted the wrong argos pieces for my bard after my first clear this week Sadge
[1:03:31] Xeroxbeta: @rykk3r1 you can recraft
[1:03:35] Nilau: Happy wednesday everyone waffleH
[1:03:42] TheNamlit: @sam1390 I guess waffle answered that already :D
[1:03:47] rykk3r1: you get argos blood back?
[1:03:53] warmwalrus: costs 250g per
[1:03:53] Xeroxbeta: yeah
[1:03:53] rykk3r1: i thought it didn't work for argos stuff
[1:03:53] Artoosa: gold it costs gold
[1:03:55] Theodarius: it cost gold with argo gear
[1:03:57] Venxuri: argos costs 250g
[1:03:58] imTymp: yes
[1:03:59] imTymp: you can
[1:04:13] rykk3r1: oh alright then
[1:04:13] imTymp: i saw scarra do it on stream today
[1:04:43] notyufo: Wassup dude
[1:04:58] HKRage: I have so many arkesia coins I just dont do the races anymore
[1:05:06] warmwalrus: always KEKW
[1:05:09] Dumpified: since forever
[1:05:11] celadriel23: cant you gear transfer to get it?
[1:05:19] Theodarius: +3 i think
[1:05:24] Nyuviix: need +3
[1:05:26] Shadowl0: +3 for 1310
[1:05:35] Tengokuuu: Get alt to 1325, that's the best place to park imo
[1:05:47] Borlaq: What do you spend time doing in game? I remember you saying you had like 600 hours in Lost Ark yesterday, but you are only roster 68? ^^
[1:05:49] celadriel23: not enough leapstones
[1:05:52] Xev_00: KEKW
[1:05:52] warmwalrus: widePepeLaugh
[1:05:54] DeadlyBrother: go buy them at anguished isle
[1:05:57] nathrizen: this alt is eating up all your t3 mats
[1:06:00] warmwalrus: just do dailies tomorrow or anguished
[1:06:01] DeathCookiie: Eyyy finally hit 1100 on my main ktvHype
[1:06:02] Dumpified: swipe swip swipe swipe.
[1:06:07] celadriel23: yeah you get 50 more
[1:06:12] celadriel23: 50 per character on anguiqh
[1:06:15] Tengokuuu: Does Anguished Isle reset weekly?
[1:06:23] Nyuviix: You can do hm story dungeon for more shards/leapstones, for the one time rewards @Giantwaffle
[1:06:25] celadriel23: it does not reset
[1:06:31] warmwalrus: only for leapstones
[1:06:47] warmwalrus: save them for main
[1:06:53] celadriel23: anything on anguish that says "hold limit" is per character, anything that says roster limit is once
[1:06:54] warmwalrus: if youre pushing today
[1:07:01] DeadlyBrother: its def worth to get to 1310
[1:07:01] Nexhunter: oh my god i got pants as the skin drop for a gold room moboSADGE
[1:07:02] Tengokuuu: I always sell my unbound leapstones, convert to crystals, and buy from Mari's. You get a lot more out of it @Giantwaffle
[1:07:16] ldvemonl: u get guild one too
[1:07:17] SlyPoooper: ^
[1:07:31] Tengokuuu: Yeah idk why they don't LUL
[1:07:32] Kenji_QQ: everyone does do that
[1:07:33] kurblet: we do lol
[1:07:34] stevelkenevel: they exhausted their maris
[1:07:34] Hanyariel: Same Tengo
[1:07:42] SlyPoooper: most people do what tengo does LUL
[1:07:45] celadriel23: selling mats is barely worth it anymore
[1:07:45] Xeroxbeta: @Giantwaffle that is what most people are doing
[1:07:49] lennon7770: 10 leapstones in mari is 20 crystals
[1:07:49] Celnoc: I did that too
[1:07:51] DeadlyBrother: mari's shop for leapstones is good
[1:07:52] Aoewin: because its limited to rng and quantity, swiper just buy gold
[1:07:59] Xeroxbeta: Selling Leapstone is worth it
[1:08:00] warmwalrus: leapstones are still good
[1:08:09] warmwalrus: and shard bags
[1:08:12] Tengokuuu: Always sell leaps
[1:08:13] Nyuviix: Leapstones are crazy worth from maris
[1:08:13] stevelkenevel: make sure you do the good weeklies too: proving grounds x2 + boss rush if you can
[1:08:16] warmwalrus: adn enhancement stuff
[1:08:21] nathrizen: crystal crash , but also price of mats crash so they're crashing in sync
[1:08:23] Xeroxbeta: sell leapstones, convert gold to blue crystals and then buy leapstones
[1:08:29] celadriel23: greater leapstones are insane value on mari
[1:08:32] Tengokuuu: That's what I'm saying, you buy back leapstones only through Mari @Giantwaffle
[1:08:37] Tech: Tech subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 56 months, currently on a 56 month streak! WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO waffleHype waffleHype waffleHype waffleHype waffleHype waffleGun
[1:08:38] Microwave__Safe: anyone know what the power tracking script that waffle was using in space engineers is?
[1:08:45] Vickens: bots bots bots
[1:08:45] Tech: Being home has never felt so good
[1:08:46] warmwalrus: but you only get so many mari's leapstones PepeHands
[1:08:47] iTzMeMune: not too much value in mari's shop thasts why
[1:08:49] ThatOnneGuy: oh god who let tech back in
[1:08:51] HKRage: I think no one is exchanging orange crystals for gold, so its creating massive supply but no demand
[1:08:51] Xeroxbeta: they were artifically inflated for too long
[1:08:52] Kenji_QQ: all the whales are done swiping maybe
[1:08:53] ninopanda: @Tech hey bb ninopa1Love
[1:08:58] LFabri: LFabri subscribed with Prime. 
[1:08:58] Moobot: Thank you for subbing, LFabri! waffleHeart
[1:08:59] Xeroxbeta: just a massiave market correction
[1:09:02] DeadlyBrother: a lot of people are in t3, alts are reaching t3 as well.

[1:09:12] Moobot: You can sub to Waffle by clicking this neat link -> twitch.tv/giantwaffle/subscribe
[1:09:22] ThatOnneGuy: Oooof tech how bad is it
[1:09:24] Tengokuuu: I did the math the other night and Mari's is 3x cheaper after converting leaps to crystals and re-buying from there. It was something like 1.2k vs 3.6k iirc @Giantwaffle
[1:09:33] HKRage: Massive supply plus influx of bots making it to T3 is just deflating everything
[1:09:34] ninopanda: @Tech i hope you are good!
[1:09:46] Tech: Bent in my exhaust right at the manifold euiikSad So it's in the shop
[1:10:03] VengeanceUM: @Tech that sucks man
[1:10:13] Tech: Thank god it missed the Turbo KEKW
[1:10:14] ninopanda: holy shit if that is the only issue then you got lucky!!
[1:10:15] Aoewin: @Tengokuuu i did the same, and its true with the greater leapstone too obviously, and also all the juice mats (solar)
[1:10:19] imTymp: look dont jinx me my car has held out for so long no issues
[1:10:20] Tech: I would have died
[1:10:25] VengeanceUM: @Tech bet u wish u were Mechanic instead of Tech pepeLaugh just kidding.. glad ur okay
[1:10:27] warmwalrus: i haven't seen a single bot in T3
[1:10:33] A_Tin_Rat: just have someone hit you for insurance money
[1:10:44] HKRage: bots can just grind infinite chaos dungeon 24/7
[1:10:44] DeadlyBrother: there's not many in t3, dunno what the rumor is
[1:10:45] Nexhunter: cause humans play
[1:10:45] Tech: @Tech I could have fixed it! I just can't do any car work in my Apartment complex
[1:10:47] Nexhunter: then start botton
[1:10:49] Tech: It's against the lease
[1:11:00] Theodarius: so many hours in normal speed but not when u can use speed boost and farm 24/7
[1:11:01] imTymp: there was a  bot in one of my chaos dungeons
[1:11:02] tommyfod: presumably theyve had years on KR/RU to perfect their bots
[1:11:02] VengeanceUM: @Tech ahhh i freaking hate those rules...
[1:11:05] ThatOnneGuy: I was on the way to a couple house showings and my realtor called me panicking that his car was pissing oil, sent me pictures and it looks like a heavy bleed trail from tarkov
[1:11:06] Yogithebaer: your last honing to get into t3 should be a captcha KEKW
[1:11:19] MellowKoNeko: the bots are farming that one map in punika with alot of mobs
[1:11:21] Tech: It used to be fine, and then people had to go spilling oil everywhere waffleSad
[1:11:27] warmwalrus: PepegaChat
[1:11:31] HKRage: 2FA would cut bots by ALOT imo
[1:11:36] Venxuri: I've been bots collecting lifeskill stuff in tideshelf path
[1:11:38] nathrizen: bots use exclusively VPN IPs, they should just make captcha or something for those ips
[1:11:43] Xeroxbeta: it is good value
[1:11:44] celadriel23: sometimes there are more but its mostly 10
[1:11:45] MellowKoNeko: selling the tome items including the ones that cost like 300 a pop
[1:11:48] Xeroxbeta: buy them all
[1:11:52] celadriel23: 20 crystals is only 100 gold
[1:11:56] lennon7770: 20 crystals is like 100 gold KEKW
[1:11:58] Dumpified: KR has a pin system during login idk why we dont have it
[1:12:10] warmwalrus: there were bots that bypassed captchas during the graphics card bs widePepeLaugh
[1:12:12] lennon7770: so basically 10x
[1:12:16] lennon7770: vs AH
[1:13:09] HKRage: @Dumpified because in KR your gaming pin is linked to your ssn, we cant do that in USA/EU
[1:13:21] iTzMeMune: 1340
[1:13:22] rykk3r1: 1340 igre
[1:13:23] warmwalrus: yup 1325
[1:13:24] Xev_00: That's 1340
[1:13:25] rykk3r1: 1325 abyss
[1:13:28] Tengokuuu: 1325 is best bc it's the last upgrade before you lose 100% upgrades and you unlock Moon Chaos @Giantwaffle
[1:13:28] warmwalrus: 1325 abyss
[1:13:33] DeadlyBrother: @Dumpified not the pin he means. You set up a pin when you make a character
[1:13:35] Venxuri: can't remember exactly but 1310 wasn't a big jump in mats
[1:13:35] warmwalrus: then 1340 when you hit 1385 on main
[1:13:36] nathrizen: 1325->1340 is still kinda expensive
[1:13:43] HKRage: I would say get your main to 1385, get easier t3 honing research, then get alt to 1340
[1:13:45] Xev_00: Sit at 1325 until you get the honing increase at 1385 on your main
[1:13:56] Hanyariel: essentially you want to have your main get to 1385 and then get the stronghold honing buff for t3 and then push alts over 1325
[1:14:04] Xev_00: NODDERS
[1:14:08] warmwalrus: 10% woohoo
[1:14:13] Triz08: yeah im stopping at 1325 on my alts until then
[1:14:29] shiftyclips: I just got the T3 honing stuff unlocked today
[1:14:31] shiftyclips: So nice
[1:14:35] Venxuri: does the honing reduction apply to silver? 🤔
[1:14:36] notyufo: What class is you’re main
[1:14:39] Tengokuuu: pepeLaugh
[1:14:39] celadriel23: rohendel is 460
[1:14:40] deadgameenthusiast: ROHERON ASSEMBLE
[1:14:41] Xev_00: pepeLaugh
[1:14:48] Chyrion: yorn is 600
[1:14:50] Xev_00: Yorn is 600
[1:14:51] celadriel23: yorn is 600
[1:14:58] erer566: apparently you can just skip straight to yorn if you get 600 ilvl
[1:14:59] MellowKoNeko: yea
[1:14:59] DeadlyBrother: yes

[1:15:27] HKRage: just run Vern chaos for shards
[1:15:43] warmwalrus: think it's 3x for feiton
[1:15:54] Tengokuuu: I tried it, I don't think it's worth trying to push through the ilvl gap of a storyline to skip it. The shard gate really gets in your way bc you're not making as much from Chaos @Giantwaffle
[1:15:55] dadish: The honing BS made me quick and uninstall the game
[1:16:05] HKRage: T3 powerpass when new classes come out Copege

[1:16:44] HKRage: tbh i dont mind the honing, I came form playing OSRS for 10 years lmao
[1:16:45] stevelkenevel: feiton feels the worst, maps are ridiculously huge
[1:17:00] Triz08: whats an extra 30 min when im playing 16 hours a day anyways Kappa
[1:17:01] warmwalrus: feiton only takes like 2 hours if you peepoRun
[1:17:02] Xev_00: I'm doing my 4th Feiton right now moon2SUFFER
[1:17:05] celadriel23: feiton takes forever

[1:17:34] warmwalrus: feiton only felt forever bc of the cutscenes
[1:17:36] dadish: Is it time for One Piece?

[1:18:06] DeadlyBrother: What game has a better progression system tho?
[1:18:09] AmidAiz: atlest you don't lose the item :D
[1:18:16] Tengokuuu: The consensus is BDO is way worse across the board though, I hear
[1:18:52] the_lyp: having your stuff deleted when you fail, that's the real suffering
[1:18:55] itzSimondr98: Lost ark Pog

[1:23:56] ninopanda: i am tired as fuck!! got me some coffee and it isnt working
[1:24:12] NevaDaha: @ninopanda more ☕ then KEKW
[1:24:24] ninopanda: no its about time to open a monster lol
[1:24:32] Celnoc: you could transfer mats from main to alt if you decide not to push main today
[1:25:09] Tengokuuu: So I can do Aire's Oculus twice a week bc I have two characters 1325+?
[1:25:13] Tengokuuu: Or is it only once per roster?
[1:25:28] DeadlyBrother: ofc lol
[1:25:28] Moobot: Come join the Waffle House Discord! <# https://discord.gg/fhGFtMuzdS
[1:25:29] shiftyclips: Did you hit 1370 yet on main?
[1:25:31] Tengokuuu: I still don't understand how the lockouts for Abyss work, is it roster based?
[1:25:34] Nexhunter: technically yea if you got big dick 1400+
[1:25:39] warmwalrus: it is per character
[1:25:40] AIex_0: if your bard you just just need to look like your doing support things LUL
[1:25:46] MellowKoNeko: its a pretty easy pub
[1:25:54] warmwalrus: you have up to 6 characters that can get the rewards from the abyss per week
[1:26:21] HKRage: hopefully thats a red gunlancer LOL
[1:26:33] warmwalrus: 2 sorcs? EZ raid
[1:26:46] Tengokuuu: He's our new Gunlancer
[1:26:48] Tengokuuu: PauseChamp
[1:26:57] HKRage: Sheesh red gunlancer
[1:27:27] Dumpified: thats not red. thats blue gunlancer
[1:27:50] Xev_00: Casual 70 mph winds at my house right now monkaS
[1:27:52] DeadlyBrother: use ur d
[1:28:06] Tengokuuu: Saint and the KR community agree that Gunlancer is the best class and that they're invaluable for the higher tiered dungeons.
[1:28:11] Scojan: 70 mph winds are normal in the panhandle KEKW
[1:28:19] Tengokuuu: They have a taunt that work in end game dungeons
[1:28:31] Sportman4Life: Gunlancers have an ability that has as subtext for the amount of stagger: Highest LUL
[1:28:41] Scojan: I really wish they would make some more Underworld movies or a tv show
[1:30:04] rykk3r1: your E applies the same debuff as your Q btw
[1:30:08] Theodarius: u get first time bonus also
[1:30:09] warmwalrus: the yellow and brown color scheme KEKW
[1:30:10] Scojan: Its annoying how this boss sometimes gives you 1 soul and sometimes 2
[1:30:30] RevArsh: u did both guardian souls
[1:30:32] Sportman4Life: You alternate the debuffs forr more uptime
[1:30:34] rykk3r1: no, the skills u're using are fine, just don't doublestack them
[1:30:38] imTymp: u have 2 buffs 2 debuffs a after amount of time shield and an instant shield
[1:30:44] DeadlyBrother: @Scojan that's rest bonus
[1:30:45] Dumpified: the build youre running is the support build
[1:30:46] Celnoc: bought alar skin for sorc alt because didn't want to use the normal skin LUL
[1:30:49] Tengokuuu: More alts in T3 helps soooo much with gems. You start earning so much more
[1:30:58] Vickens: any tips before about getting first hero to t3?
[1:30:59] imTymp: d is buff F is shield
[1:31:00] rykk3r1: D is damage buff, F is reduction and shield after it expires
[1:31:07] imschiercke: minecraft later?
[1:31:08] Kenji_QQ: w shield, d damage buff
[1:31:14] MistaBleak: the spit
[1:31:18] Theodarius: her black spit
[1:31:20] Deepcast: there is no research going in the main guild @Giantwaffle
[1:31:21] Sportman4Life: You took his vomit which has a nasty debuff LUL
[1:31:59] warmwalrus: nah, he just has a weakpoint tail
[1:32:05] warmwalrus: but most ppl dont do the tail bc he runs away
[1:32:06] imTymp: yes
[1:32:12] MistaBleak: your R is ur weak point
[1:32:16] imTymp: soundholic is for ur stagger checks
[1:32:32] rykk3r1: got taunted by chadlancer
[1:32:45] imTymp: oh its good dps but if u know a stagger is coming save it
[1:33:02] imTymp: like in the abyss dungeon when u know stagger comes at specific points
[1:33:07] YOmamaDog: Do I buy some crystal or it gonna drop more chat lol
[1:33:09] Tengokuuu: You want to use it more than just for stagger checks, it's good for building your specialty meter and it's alright dps at current ilvl @Giantwaffle
[1:33:10] onetwofly: Chat what class is he playing ?
[1:33:12] Sportman4Life: Gunlancer with insane stagger
[1:33:24] Astrophysics288: @onetwofly bard
[1:33:30] HKRage: i think gunlancer is highest stagger atm
[1:33:30] Moobot: You can sub to Waffle by clicking this neat link -> twitch.tv/giantwaffle/subscribe
[1:33:34] Sportman4Life: They have the highest of all classes I think
[1:33:42] onetwofly: Ty @astrophysics288
[1:33:48] Allmostdone: I’m playing cleaning maid class Waffle playing the bard
[1:33:55] Sportman4Life: Could be
[1:34:00] HKRage: all gunlancer abilities stagger, and most are mid+
[1:34:02] warmwalrus: those two are one of the highests in total stagger
[1:34:09] London_Monarch: Cool LIVE: US Spacewalk going on right now.
[1:34:09] Dumpified: red gunlancer is the highest stagger. blue is good
[1:34:32] AIex_0: KEKW
[1:34:33] Xev_00: KEKW
[1:34:57] Warkless: Sadge
[1:35:26] Kaedonshi: Need a quick cast QOL for sure
[1:35:51] stevelkenevel: with my blue I have mid-high or high on 6 of my abilities
[1:36:02] warmwalrus: lai lai
[1:36:05] Kryllyk: Why not just allow you to harvest the soul optionally once the raid guardian is dead
[1:36:12] stevelkenevel: you can opt for my stagger on blue but nelassias is pretty nice to have
[1:36:18] Chronoes: double tap works as quick cast for me iirc
[1:36:25] Slaezin: got my eiberns wound today very happy
[1:36:50] sevn7th: Yo is there a command for the settings and mods used by waffle in space engineers?
[1:37:19] warmwalrus: oh btw i would be buying a lot of the t3 solars and such for your 1370 to 1380 push
[1:37:22] warmwalrus: in maris
[1:37:31] StOrMy1100: !se_mods
[1:37:31] Auradus: !gs
[1:37:32] Moobot: Go here for the mods Waffle is using in Space Engineers - pastebin.com/AiydjYdX
[1:37:44] Triz08: 1370 to 1380 is easy
[1:37:45] Kaedonshi: 1360-1370 was horrid for sure
[1:37:46] warmwalrus: but those are limited in maris so you should be stocking up
[1:37:56] nFteddy: Anyone have an active guild on Azena? Looking for a solid guild that does their dailies and research.

[1:39:46] ejje420: i want reaper sadge
[1:39:52] AIex_0: no roadmap for a couple weeks Sadge
[1:39:54] Xeroxbeta: that was my thought, it is so easy to solo content with deathblade and I didnt have to worry about getting things for different classes
[1:39:58] Kenji_QQ: they said "weeks" for roadmap
[1:40:09] Niklason: They posted that the road map will be available in a couple of weeks
[1:40:10] Scojan: I'm pumped for Artist
[1:40:12] Sp1nzaku: And you only need 1 set of gems
[1:40:13] Scojan: but I bet we get artist last
[1:40:18] HKRage: at this point, i dont think the roadmap even exist
[1:40:31] AIex_0: roxx said something yesterday? on the forums i heard
[1:40:43] chromosomeboy54: itll be next thursday as thats the last day of march

[1:40:56] nwgoku: question. so you are telling me if you have 4 lvl 50's of the same class you can just swap gear back and forth between them and do multiple of the same content?
[1:41:02] nwgoku: like destiny 1 days?
[1:41:04] HKRage: I know the roadmap isnt going to happen but their will definitely be riots on their forum tommorow
[1:41:28] Sp1nzaku: @nwgoku only gems
[1:41:33] Xev_00: Roadmap April 6th 12 hours before April content update Kappa

[1:42:57] NexX_____: i want the Reaper class
[1:43:01] Artoosa: i want reaper

[1:43:15] celadriel23: i have so many mats
[1:43:20] Triz08: running out of things to work on
[1:43:22] HKRage: I have a bad feeling we're not going to see any new classes until they do the class rebalance in KR
[1:43:23] Xev_00: Just give Lancemaster or Arcana and I can forgive just about everything else
[1:43:30] Kenji_QQ: "so, no exact timeframe right now since we aren’t locked, but the next couple of weeks seems realistic" is what they said about road map yesterday on the forum
[1:43:34] swoftayyy: surely Copium
[1:43:34] warmwalrus: thought they were reworking destroyer in korea
[1:43:49] Xev_00: T1/T2 alts are Smoge

[1:44:19] imTymp: what drops greater honor leapstones
[1:44:19] MistaBleak: should use the favorites list :P
[1:44:23] Scojan: I saw up enough mats to push new classes through t1 t2 because that grind sucks
[1:44:25] imTymp: I dont know how i keep getting so many greaters
[1:44:31] celadriel23: you have to be 1370 to get greater leapstones as a drop i think
[1:44:35] warmwalrus: i dont mind running punika
[1:45:02] warmwalrus: you get like 20 greater a day on a character and most of them are bound KEKW
[1:45:05] celadriel23: i disliked doing punika the second time
[1:45:11] imTymp: i know im at +13's and 1358 but keep getting a few every now and then
[1:45:16] TigerLuv: since we saw the screen scenes once, is there a way to it not to show them again?

[1:45:21] legene5: greater leapstone are 250g now in euc
[1:45:21] Scojan: Punika is great XP
[1:45:29] HKRage: punika aint bad to redo cause you know you're close to being done
[1:45:33] celadriel23: it is great exp, gets you from 52 to 53 almost
[1:45:43] nwgoku: there is an options setting to automatically skip cutscenes

[1:45:51] warmwalrus: eh there's stronghold training though
[1:45:56] HKRage: watch south vern be 1400 LOOOL
[1:46:05] warmwalrus: no way
[1:46:11] Slaezin: just chilling at 1340 atm
[1:46:14] swoftayyy: PepeLaugh
[1:46:20] HKRage: like see how they pushes night fox yoho to 1370, she was supposed to be 1355
[1:46:21] TigerLuv: yeah.... I was hoping to turn them off, bad connection, so I have to wait to get to the cut scene, and back out again LUL, Thank you
[1:46:22] holyprince: im at 1350ish
[1:46:33] Xeroxbeta: south vern is a QOL area because they saw this same shit in korea

[1:46:48] swoftayyy: its gonna be 1370 YEP
[1:46:55] Dagmoo: if your mentality isnt rushing through everything then the story quests are much less painful imo
[1:46:55] warmwalrus: imagine widePepeLaugh
[1:47:00] Wave_Jaeger: What problem? I joined stream late
[1:47:19] kurblet: if it was 1355 it wouldn't drop levendary stuff then you would only have argos
[1:47:26] Niklason: Maybe instead of nerfing it people have better gear when theyt can do it?
[1:47:47] Lucky_Juan: @Giantwaffle Im getting burnt out on this game, 1355 with 3 alts close to tier 3, i need some juice

[1:50:03] Tengokuuu: They've stopped being phones, they're just handheld computers now @Giantwaffle

[3:25:30] Apparentthreat: @Giantwaffle I think that's somewhat true about the boxes. Boxes get put in big tote bags and those are hauled into the vans
[3:25:30] TritonXXXG: it was a theft prevention issue
[3:25:30] Pointern: i worked at a phone company ops center and we where free to use phone and facebook and everything.. so that sounds weird

[3:26:20] MrArrig: I'm guessing a lot of those rules won't fly in the EU
[3:26:21] Apparentthreat: or just a watch with cellular service
[3:26:29] GavinR: A lot of lower skilled factory, warehouse, customer service etc jobs don't allow phones on you
[3:26:30] RodriCraft93: you think a center is bad? imagine a retail office (people literaly suicide)
[3:26:34] natsu130: soo your phone dont get covid

[3:26:59] raiju_soul: @natsu130 true
[3:27:01] subcrustal: yh sure, but it would be the heavy machinery not the phone
[3:27:01] Brutask: My work doesn't allow phones at manufacturing either, it's really distracting for some people.
[3:27:08] Myekos: @Zalhat limited options

[3:27:41] phantompenguin135: Also the box size deviation is mostly due to the limitation on available box sizes. They will upsize if there are no available boxes for the size they need
[3:27:42] The_Newspaper: Have you muted the comfy Minecraft tunes too?
[3:27:43] Fubko: @Giantwaffle Hi do you remember  name of KSP mod that you played. Python programing one

[6:11:00] ItzJord: also could end up getting a brick in a box lol
[6:11:02] Simbac_: On amazon i did see one for 1250 and its says "shipped by amazon, sold by amazon" would there still be a 3rd party selling that one?
[6:11:11] ItzJord: aka scammed lol
[6:11:22] BleedKappa: Why spend 3k on something useful like a gpu, when you can be a moron and buy an NFT
[6:11:29] Kandarjr: Pay to Pay more Nice scam
[6:11:30] mahoraz: its only up because of the war
[6:11:30] wonly: yeah i talked to a rep about it, they tried to sell hard on the program but if you only buy 1 item you might as well buy from scalper
[6:11:34] Sean11211: how you got ebuyer in the us

[6:13:41] DoubleOughtNot: That was for Founders Edition only
[6:13:42] Zalhat: like matt damon said "fortune favors the brave" Kappa
[6:13:43] Mick_: founders editions is 699
[6:13:43] whitepanda1975: is this going to be a full playthrough?
[6:13:47] xavier2119: msrp is $699
[6:13:50] AIex_0: it was only ever founders that was 699
[6:13:51] emerald1235: 1250? its fking 1459 here xD
[6:13:53] usernameNull: 3080s are going for 1250 at normal rate

[6:13:55] GunfightError: 3080 12GB Prob a little more priced
[6:13:56] Deltabetelgezy: graphic cards dont sell at msrp KEKW
[6:13:57] DoubleOughtNot: They are 1250 even on MicroCenter
[6:13:59] lettucegaybaconpotato: You are not going to find one for 699 lolol
[6:14:01] Crabbizao: If it says that it’s probably a drop shipper
[6:14:07] Babaganoosh24: the original msrp was 799 but not anymore
[6:14:08] Djheguy: It could be sold by amazon but its probably just stored in their warehouse
[6:14:09] SimonSez: Here in Norway 3080's dropped 40% the last few days
[6:14:10] PFangy: waffle what you think about BAT, Basic Attention Token?
[6:14:18] Kaley4D: isnt this all cause the chip shortage...?
[6:14:19] Belgarath81: 1250 directly from best buy
[6:14:24] Kaley4D: isnt that like the main cause?
[6:14:24] DoubleOughtNot: That's what's listed...
[6:14:25] lettucegaybaconpotato: Covid, crypto mining, buying a PC has been shit for the last 2 years
[6:14:26] shortly__: depends on if it is the 10gb or the 12gb version
[6:14:26] pandapolygon: here in germany they got cheaper almost msrp
[6:14:26] kaztrogaming: directly from mircocenter they are 1250
[6:14:29] T_Eggy: the fact that people are still buyin them probably means they won't ever go back down to 699...
[6:14:30] Myekos: they sell one at msrp, then the rest at hiked rates
[6:14:31] bcdmonkey: The year is 2043, you can now reliably buy a 3080ti for the original msrp. Meanwhile the new gen 10080 is selling for 4x msrp and only 3 are made a day.
[6:14:32] kaztrogaming: my 3080 was 1500
[6:14:33] Tickle_Me1: best buy is rip off
