[0:02:45] TabbyAbii: Who are we waiting for?
[0:03:06] Nightjar: I think voting is still broken at the moment, so I might just add some vods on for tonight
[0:03:33] supremef1sh: why was jingle jam so short this year
[0:03:53] aCrazyspaceman: think I just got played by a push notification
[0:03:58] Nightjar: It was the same length as last year, and was advertised as only two weeks for months in advance
[0:04:18] Buetix: i thought it was good like this
[0:04:22] Nightjar: It's better for the devs who donate keys, better for the streamers and office team, and raises the same amount for charity
[0:04:51] Nightjar: Also allows people time off for the holidays and, given the ongoing pandemic, lets them isolate before seeing family
[0:04:59] Akhawais: Kappa
[0:05:15] TabbyAbii: I think thatâ€™s fair enough
[0:05:32] Nightjar: Akh yogLove

[0:10:17] Nightjar: When will the database be updated next? Just thinking of when we can flood the votes with JJ compilations pcGiggle @Akhawais
[0:10:24] Nightjar: @bodega49 ask if it's live

[0:14:42] Nightjar: No worries
[0:15:09] crique: I've only got about 85hours played in this game because I pretty much lose as soon as I have to get in any serious conflict, which is a small problem
