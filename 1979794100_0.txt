[2:27:37] starlitesparkl3: you can bone meal grass to have a chance to spawn flowers, but you cannot bonemeal flowers to dupe them unless they are two block tall flowers
[2:27:51] darth_baggins: Imagine not giving Kirsty your hoodie. Classic Rythian!
[2:28:19] 3v1lc0w: benO

[2:29:56] willhelm211: Rythian struggling with big hands and things being too small
[2:30:08] RadicalLynx: nah, but you need to plant the berry, not a vine
[2:30:19] starlitesparkl3: oh briony got the left to bloom music
[2:30:27] RadicalLynx: oh, they grow down
[2:30:28] Alvpyrola: you need full solid block to plan berries under
[2:30:30] Faaafv: you can
[2:30:34] RadicalLynx: you plant them on the roof

[2:34:18] Komulama: Rythian doing Joe work
[2:34:28] Zara_Tenebris: This is like in shrek when Fiona sent Donkey looking for a flower

[2:36:31] Alvpyrola: I don't know if it works with campfires, but you *can* put glow vines under trapdoors that are placed on the lower bit of a block. They break if you open the trapdoor though
[2:36:37] Javsco: @Fares_4 I thought he was being sarcastic about this.

[2:39:25] Scholar_Namick: wait, its rightfully so to be angry that Corps are doing that, not rightfully so that they are doing it
[2:39:26] JQ_amp: i think they seem more evil because theyve historically portrayed the company as so wholesome and nice and happy

[2:40:38] Javsco: @kedamono1st That's just Sips.
[2:41:28] rorchach_test: hryPeepers
