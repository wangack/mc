[0:41:21] oohoo3: when you go through 20 chemistry recipes KEKW you need that history
[0:41:25] AsHackDM: its called isolation transformer
[0:41:33] BMYGRLFRND: that's basically a tranformer, yes
[0:41:48] CoolReal: About to get BOP
[0:41:49] BMYGRLFRND: if you do 1:1 it does that
[0:41:50] CoolReal: https://clips.twitch.tv/CooperativeWonderfulConsoleShadyLulu-ETFE5gAgLXVNOJLY
[0:41:51] sytar023: its a isolation transformer indeed
[0:41:53] Babyblasphemy: You can do trasformers with same amount of windings
[0:41:56] yukinaille: i just assume any high pitched buzzing is my tinnitus
[0:42:01] AsHackDM: no transformers can be same winding its called isolation transformer
[0:42:02] sytar023: it is
[0:42:04] sytar023: trust me
[0:42:06] Tabakhase: it isolates YEP
[0:42:11] GuardMoony: There's always some loss but it's pretty low
[0:42:21] yukinaille: LMFAO
[0:42:26] BMYGRLFRND: I should know about that, I studied it KEKW
[0:42:27] Cametes101: Isolator
[0:42:27] Amenophiz: @IrisuLuz easy to test if you must and unmute
[0:42:37] Amenophiz: mute and *
[0:42:39] Babyblasphemy: "This type of 1:1 transformer is classed as an isolation transformer as both the primary and secondary windings of the transformer have the same number of volts per turn."
[0:43:30] BMYGRLFRND: it just isolates the DC, because only the AC gets transferred to the secondary coil, so if you have 1:1 windings, it keeps the voltage
[0:43:42] kane1941: gonna need everything in millions

[2:11:37] wolfd91: L is usually the shortcut for the hover mode of the jetpack, but i'm not sure if it is a feature in the first tier jetpack
[2:11:42] TigerLuv: this base is looking very Temporary
[2:11:47] Face_32: when does your base start lagging? and your forced to rebuild it all in the void zone? @Giantwaffle

[2:15:03] kane1941: put one iron there
[2:15:06] kane1941: manually
[2:15:10] Mexzw: use a crafting card instead
[2:15:26] KAS_Sprmcy: Limited item filter from a buffer chest
[2:15:31] ns0z: Interfaces is much better for stuff like this imo.
[2:15:33] YmG_Reg: crafting card is better
[2:15:41] Mexzw: yea
[2:15:44] Koeckie: yes
[2:15:46] wolfd91: @ns0z indeed
[2:15:46] Mexzw: with redstone card
[2:15:48] aundros: Merry EU christmas everyone
[2:15:54] Narcotical: Yea, just tell it you walways want 1000 or something

[2:16:04] therickeman: emit
[2:16:04] Exerion09: In an interface

[2:16:26] Mazzelfassel: I think there is a mod in the pack that can autocraft to a certain level
[2:16:31] kane1941: you can put interface and output right into it, saving you a bus
[2:16:33] Exerion09: Tell an ME interface to keep stock and it'll autocraft
[2:16:34] Koeckie: crafting card in an interface, but you need a pattern for it so it can request the item
[2:16:36] ns0z: Use an interface to input items and level emitter on machine with redstone control
[2:16:36] jordan2185: Round robin is working though
[2:16:37] officialhunterx: whats the plan for today
[2:16:38] Mazzelfassel: Lazy AE2
[2:16:58] Koeckie: yes you can set a number in the interface
[2:17:01] Narcotical: Level emitter it
[2:17:02] ns0z: You can have an interface put items in without pattern
[2:17:02] TelRehiad: he wants a "keep in stock" vs dynamic request.
[2:17:05] kane1941: it would just export items constantly
[2:17:18] PistolPeteHogan: Ya a level emitter does exactly that.
[2:17:26] Narcotical: Keep in stock is level emitter
[2:17:32] TigerLuv: HahaPoint HahaNyandeer
[2:17:32] PistolPeteHogan: You tell it how many items to keep in stock and it does that
[2:17:51] Face_32: need like a requester with a buffer of 100
[2:17:53] CoolReal: BOP
[2:17:59] Mazzelfassel: There is as "ME Level Maintainer"
[2:17:59] Twin5un: YEP BOP

[2:19:03] kenshin2666: @IHaveShirts ( . Y . ) 👀
[2:19:05] TigerLuv: maybe it is me, but can't you put one of the crafting thingies on the floor you are working?
[2:19:17] ns0z: YEs
[2:19:21] Narcotical: Interface will work and is a lot faster
[2:19:21] n00rman_: using an interface with item conduits in much easier
[2:19:22] Twin5un: monkaHmm
[2:19:25] Koeckie: yes
[2:19:27] wolfd91: lol
[2:19:28] Koeckie: it is
[2:19:31] PeterZ_97: interface + ender io + drawer to set max quantity?
[2:19:32] ns0z: Interfaces is the superior solution for this
[2:19:38] wonly: dont you just use import and level emitter?
[2:19:41] Mexzw: think best thing is an import bus with crafting card and restone card.. with a level emitter
[2:19:50] AnesthesiaFC: nope hard out of that path lol
[2:20:08] Mazzelfassel: Ok just checked the Nomifactory page and the Lazy AE2 with the Level-Maintainer is an optional mod.

[2:29:03] TheSeabeast: have the interface provide the ingredients
[2:29:16] officialhunterx: seems like chat is telling you different setups
[2:29:18] TheSeabeast: yeeee
[2:29:21] LLA_YouDontKnow1: in the interface, if you tell it to keep certain amounts of the required items in stock
[2:29:24] wolfd91: YES
[2:29:26] kane1941: Chat he doesn not want to craft on demand. The idea was to always export constantly
[2:29:46] Koeckie: it depends, if you need the "raw" items anytime you have to do it that way, or every single item will be exported
[2:29:47] sepjoo: robot arm
[2:29:47] wolfd91: thank god xd
[2:29:51] weightmaker: put a robot arm as cover on the alloy smelter
[2:29:52] iTents: Wrench the interface to set the arrows
[2:29:53] kypudo: then export bus with level emiter
[2:29:55] sepjoo: will help ypu import
[2:30:01] n00rman_: use item conduits. this way you can automate like 4-5 alloy furnaces with one interface
[2:30:15] kyadum: lmao
[2:30:18] wolfd91: you dont
[2:30:18] TheSeabeast: no
[2:30:19] n00rman_: no pattern
[2:30:20] TelRehiad: you don't
[2:30:21] KICKKJ: no
[2:30:22] Yakobro: youi dont need it
[2:30:23] IAmJester: you can make the interface directional with a wrench, yea?
[2:30:23] sepjoo: u dont need pattern there
[2:30:23] wolfd91: yes
[2:30:25] brenner1265: I think you can wrench the interface to push items out
[2:30:29] wolfd91: thats for autocrafting
[2:30:30] thecodealive_original: pattern = craft on demand
[2:30:33] wonly: then export bus and capacity bus and put the ingredients in then level emitter on the red ingot when you get to the level you want
[2:30:37] ChoOyu: ChoOyu subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 40 months! waffleHeart
[2:30:41] wolfd91: no i do it aswell
[2:30:45] wolfd91: conduits
[2:30:47] wolfd91: yes
[2:30:52] wolfd91: you can import into the interface
[2:30:55] kane1941: switch that interface into a bus?
[2:30:57] officialhunterx: make you have a level emitter to stop importer
[2:31:01] n00rman_: you don't need import buses either this way. just import it into the interface
[2:31:01] Moobot: Come join the Waffle House Discord! <# https://discord.gg/fhGFtMuzdS
[2:31:05] 1axt1: Why don't you put a crafting terminal downstairs?
[2:31:10] daemonaedryn: Merry christmas eve everyone
[2:31:12] weightmaker: right clicking robot arms on GT machines gives it pull/push ability
[2:31:16] kane1941: you can stop the enderio cable
[2:31:19] Shoobinist: can stop the conduit
[2:31:26] wolfd91: you can stop the nmachine with a machine controller and emitter facein towards it
[2:31:47] Yakobro: @Giantwaffle you can also output the smelters to a drawer that's connected to a controller with storage bus to cap the output
[2:31:51] weightmaker: conduit will prob fill both slots with same item
[2:31:58] officialhunterx: you don't want to stop the interface or the conduit if you planning to automate multiple alloys
[2:32:12] madseed15: ur interface doesn't store recipe
[2:32:14] TheGeekPeek: Use the item limit conduit filter to put one stack of each item in the slots without double fill
[2:32:25] BlackNocturne: You inserted on green
[2:32:29] thecodealive_original: do you need to point it down?
[2:32:30] TheGeekPeek: item limit
[2:32:30] madseed15: enderio op
[2:32:34] TheSeabeast: limited item filter
[2:32:35] madseed15: the one with #
[2:32:48] TheGeekPeek: very very useful for alloy furnace, changed my life
[2:32:49] officialhunterx: it goes in the insert
[2:32:50] wolfd91: make a shit ton of those
[2:32:55] TheGeekPeek: I searched all over reddit. Insert
[2:33:00] LaroStar007: the bottom item conduit is disabled @Giantwaffle
[2:33:08] weightmaker: robot arm with item filter is much better
[2:33:10] TheGeekPeek: you put the stack and amount of each and it will play them per action
[2:33:21] iTents: @thecodealive_original Only if he wasn't using the item conduit. You shouldnt have to point the interface if your using an item conduit
[2:33:38] madseed15: maybe interface to a chest?
[2:33:43] officialhunterx: make sure the alloy smelter is facing down
[2:33:48] dax573: screwdriver the top
[2:33:53] NoisyPlays: is the item filter in blacklist or whitelist mode
[2:33:53] iTents: It is a real inventory
[2:33:55] TheGeekPeek: I use the same setup with no issues, so something is off
[2:33:57] LaroStar007: is the machine configured
[2:33:57] madseed15: @Giantwaffle u set the top to export
[2:34:11] n00rman_: this is the way. now make all the alloys this way
[2:34:31] iTents: Extraction would leave a buffer
[2:34:34] TheGeekPeek: in the future you can have the interface pull full stacks and just use the limited item filters
[2:34:38] LaroStar007: import
[2:34:39] TelRehiad: disable the extract from the interface
[2:34:52] wolfd91: stopping the cable does not seem like a good idea to me
[2:35:05] wolfd91: yes you can
[2:35:06] Moobot: New here? Welcome! You can usually catch Waffle Mon-Sat at ~1400 UTC. Feel free to hang out in chat before the stream and/or join the !discord. waffleEgg
[2:35:11] wolfd91: machine controller
[2:35:15] n00rman_: this is expandable sideways too
[2:35:21] kypudo: make the interface old more copper and redstone
[2:35:26] kyadum: lmao
[2:35:29] ImNotDonut_: looks good to me
[2:35:35] ImNotDonut_: I also have no idea what im looking at
[2:35:36] iTents: You can do several recipies with a single Interface also
[2:35:39] kane1941: its bottlenecking, increase the stacks a bit
[2:35:43] iTents: Just filter the input to each machine
[2:35:46] TelRehiad: you can do multiple recipies per interface too.
[2:35:58] officialhunterx: problem.is once one is full the other won't work
[2:36:06] wolfd91: are you gonna use a new interface for each automation?

[2:36:19] wolfd91: shiiish
[2:36:22] TelRehiad: as long as you have limited item filters in the cable. you would be fine
[2:36:29] madseed15: well interface is expensive no
[2:36:31] madseed15: ?
[2:36:41] zzzDai: Just automate making interfaces
[2:36:53] kane1941: increase stack size in item filter, it doesnt keep up
[2:36:56] n00rman_: having one import bus and export bus per machine would be more expensive
[2:36:57] TelRehiad: 1 interface cost < many import/export busses
[2:37:03] kyadum: lmao
[2:37:08] Face_32: what are plant balls
[2:37:13] jberk26: Should the copper/red stone be increased to 4-12 to keep it running smoothly?

[4:37:11] BBQ1: monkaHmm
[4:37:15] sprockettes: like a state capital
[4:37:16] Archelonde: just major cities
[4:37:18] Beufff: no different than state capital
[4:37:19] nxusr: Western Australia is a state
[4:37:20] zzzDai: State capitals?
[4:37:21] Aatesh: we have state capitols
[4:37:32] prairydog: duh
[4:37:41] kane1941: US have capitals of states?
[4:37:56] Tetsomina: They have states and territories in AU
[4:38:04] meanhattermeanderer: I know about 1 state of Australia. The state of intoxication
[4:38:11] Zyie: America has state capitals too
[4:38:49] Zyie: Yeah, American states are a bit different than "states" in other countries
[4:39:06] fapohogu: why would other countries not have state capitals?
[4:39:32] fapohogu: to my knowledge every state has to have a capital no?
[4:39:37] Sui_Ume: how would american states be different?
[4:40:08] Drazer_: because countries in europe are smaller than states LUL
[4:40:08] Caraceus: europe also has provincial capitals
[4:40:13] Fufcia: almost every country has provices and administrative cities in those provinces. we just dont call them capitals
[4:40:15] bugsplatter23: no man.. every nation on the planet has states/provincers
[4:40:16] BrotherMaynard: Canada has provincial capitals, bro
[4:40:16] Caraceus: w
[4:40:17] szabikkkka: Many counties have kinda capitals in my country
[4:40:18] Gkz_Suh: in what way US is different than canada?
[4:40:23] dylan0806: @giantwaffle Netherlands also has provinces
[4:40:25] sprockettes: canadas provincial capitals arent always the major city
[4:40:26] Staticsprite: The Netherlands has the same. We have provinces with each an own 'capital'
[4:40:27] Zyie: In most cases that I know of, even if other countries have states, they're not as separated as the US is, with it's own set of laws and such.
[4:40:27] mahoraz: but do you have enough capital to say that
[4:40:36] Skylance117: the thing is USA is a federation of states, dodnt knew that Australia was a federation
[4:40:39] kingasasin177: I know...
[4:40:40] prairydog: DC is kinda weird tbh
[4:40:41] Sui_Ume: but european countries are subdivided in regions as well, we just don't call them "states" as that is an english word
[4:40:44] maccabeus: monkaHmm I feel like we're splitting hairs on the definition of capitol
[4:40:44] kingasasin177: but due to video games
[4:40:47] weasel9999: don't worry, most canadians can't do that either KEKW
[4:40:50] decipherment: everything that is colonised by the English has a state capital?
[4:40:50] Gamernxc: LOL
[4:40:51] ForgottenTime: we know thqat in Canada
[4:40:53] Trip6FlipYoBic: Scripted history ftw
[4:40:56] samuraijac: they might now quebec and nova scotia
[4:41:00] ThatOnneGuy: When we say "I went to public school" it's supposed to be a quick and easy explanation for why we're fucking stupid
[4:41:01] Tetsomina: US public education pepega
[4:41:04] Techniker32: New Fundland is one isn't it?
[4:41:06] kingasasin177: I think on the spot I can usually name like 11 of the provinces of Canada

[4:41:24] traliok: From the outside perspective it seems like the US education system only cares about itself lol
[4:41:25] Techniker32: *Foundland
[4:41:29] sprockettes: 30 minute time zone
[4:41:33] Valhuun: learn more from youtube

[4:41:38] true_aaron: I’m a Newfie living in BC lmao
[4:41:41] Nitsuj311: weirdos
[4:41:42] wonly: does EU AUS and CA learn all of our state capitols?
[4:41:46] Double0steve0: Us schools are too busy grooming kids to teach history
[4:41:51] Gray__Mist: Government
[4:41:53] Fufcia: Poland has 16 voivodeships and each of them has "capital" called voivodship city
[4:41:55] decipherment: most of them are dictatorship @Giantwaffle
[4:41:57] Gray__Mist: @Double0steve0 WTF?
[4:41:58] BrotherMaynard: Newfies got their time zone as a requirement to join Canada
[4:41:59] Jayouz: Australia has weird time zones
[4:42:00] mahoraz: @fedeoeae they call them counties
[4:42:00] prairydog: Haha2020
[4:42:01] thatgoodhonk: I joined in and first word I heard was Newfie. What'd I miss?
[4:42:05] kingasasin177: Imagine saying the same latitude but 1/24th of the circumference of the earth is the same time
[4:42:05] toomzeta: China is on 1 timezone for the entire country lol
[4:42:07] fapohogu: yeah but it's not the difference in laws that makes states have capitals, to my knowledge ever country that is big enough to have states/provinces has a capital of some sort, in every country you have regionalized governments
[4:42:13] fishypooos: im thinking of splashing 20 euro on stationeers in the winter sale, i usually dont spend that much on games but i've but been wanting it for years
[4:42:14] kingasasin177: but just a few steps left and it's suddenly the next hour
[4:42:15] darnde: Because otherwise our sunrises and sunsets would be too early or too late :)
[4:42:19] xSparky911x: Just like they don't teach in US schools that Canada actually burnt down the Whitehouse wayyyy back lol
[4:42:21] meanhattermeanderer: the position of the sun?
[4:42:34] kingasasin177: @xSparky911x War of 1812 was never covered
[4:42:35] Nitsuj311: over my head
[4:42:40] fapohogu: you don't want the president dealing with the asphalt problem in your city lol
[4:42:43] kingasasin177: I learned about it but just passively
[4:42:48] meanhattermeanderer: and how quickly it moves across the sky?
[4:42:55] Tymelord14: That's fair, I wouldn't expect americans to learn our geography. But at least we only have 10+3 provinces+territories to remember vs your 50
[4:43:07] darnde: Also time zones had more to do with trains timings. And we had no trains that connected to the mainland
[4:43:18] Traverus98: are you sure you can insert and extract only from the top on inscribes I thought the sides mattered
[4:43:21] maccabeus: KEKW that's why you don't know
[4:43:23] Techniker32: @Tymelord14 Technically its more than 50...
[4:43:23] dtorp: kek
[4:43:23] decipherment: lol
[4:43:24] dtorp: why?
[4:43:29] Sui_Ume: @mahoraz no I mean germany has regions, called Bundesländer, which is the same as a state in the US, but they are not called states

[4:44:08] dylan0806: What were the searches for Nebraska?
[4:44:08] Supremagorious: I think where you grew up has influenced your perspective of US education in general. I would have failed 4th grade w/o knowing all 50 states and their capitals
[4:44:16] decipherment: KEKW
[4:44:17] dylan0806: Just asking for a friend
[4:44:19] bugsplatter23: those maps basically tell you all the furries are in canada
[4:44:20] Rocknsugar: KKona roll tide
[4:44:21] SirNickGaming: Colorado is goth
[4:44:22] maccabeus: @Supremagorious new england?
[4:44:34] toomzeta: 80% of the us states shapes are rectangles basically so it’s hard to tell from shape
[4:44:35] prairydog: HUH
[4:44:47] meanhattermeanderer: Alabama takes the "step" out of "step-sister"

[5:14:46] KAS_Sprmcy: DeadMrEd He onlu has 1 small crafter
[5:14:48] TheResinger: @DeadMrEd he wants them to auto stock, not craft on demand
[5:14:52] Yakobro: @DeadMrEd patterns means on-demand crafting, which is real slow and not great to use for general components, passive crafting is way better really
[5:15:00] phoss2k: what are the new two symbols next to the crafting terminal?
[5:15:35] TheResinger: @phoss2k fluid storage and the config terminal i think
