[3:23:25] Amandroid: that's not what she said
[3:23:27] Brixxii: Gladge I am team less taylor at this point
[3:23:29] atscovilllezzey: Special treatment
[3:23:30] lovely_beez: Shruge
[3:23:44] lovely_beez: didnt say that either diesofcringe
[3:23:48] lovely_beez: peepoLeave
[3:23:53] Amandroid: peepoConfused that's not what anyone was saying
[3:24:01] abbywil23: linkzzeyStare
[3:24:05] Brixxii: peepoEyeroll you are confused
[3:24:11] MILLINKY: the NFL is using her to try and push viewership. they are using her to try and get more money from ad revenue and such
[3:24:19] abbywil23: ^
[3:24:20] Brixxii: ^
[3:24:22] allymayblack: Gladge love that you are saying that, TS is a legend on her own YesYes
[3:24:24] jpjad3n: just found some powered snow finally, now I can finish my frog farm
[3:24:35] MILLINKY: 100% is
[3:24:36] MyMinyWorld: Unfortunately it totally is
[3:24:46] Brixxii: Gladge does it to herself though, cuz she can ask to not be shown. She chooses to be overexposed
[3:25:10] atscovilllezzey: Utilized
[3:25:14] YaBoyDerek_MC: !watchtime
[3:25:15] StreamElements: YaBoyDerek_MC has spent  8 days 13 hours watching linkzzey
[3:25:35] MyMinyWorld: She can't even watch her bf play in peace, I saw a story the other day abt some kid losing their mind trying to get up near the VIP booth to see her linkzzeyDed
[3:25:42] MILLINKY: it’s completely separate. Kelcey isn’t using her. the NFL franchise is. I don’t respect it, doesn’t make the game genuine. just about money and views
[3:25:45] Rozsy: if i had to sell albums id want to be on every channel out in public, a line should be drawn under private lives though
[3:26:13] Brixxii: NODDERS oh I agree but she is a billionaire she doesnt need the money anymore
[3:26:19] silver557_mecharex: The podzel texture is the same as the compost in the composter
[3:26:23] Des_troy_er: super early out of work how’s it been going
[3:26:31] Amandroid: @Des_troy_er linkzzeyHii
[3:26:35] Penny_Pink: linkzzeyHii linkzzeyHii
[3:26:35] Gamerdge: @Brixxii she can ask but the networks will do what they want especially if it will help their bottom line
[3:26:39] Brixxii: @Des_troy_er linkzzeyHii
[3:26:43] abbywil23: hi @des_troy_er linkzzeyHii
[3:26:59] Des_troy_er: hello guys linkzzeyHii
[3:27:02] MandaLin: @heyworld1 linkzzeyHii
[3:27:03] MILLINKY: it just shows that the game isn’t genuine
[3:27:18] Penny_Pink: how is everyone today
[3:27:32] MILLINKY: exactly
[3:27:41] Brixxii: linkzzeyPaws this isnt even the superbowl though, this is regular season and playoffs
[3:27:42] Des_troy_er: literally took care of one 11 top made $150 and got sent home
[3:27:44] Gamerdge: wait? how is kelce being scummy? he is one the best TEs in the history of football.
[3:27:44] MILLINKY: it’s a lot more that Taylor is there
[3:27:57] iRyzn: the NFL is an entertainment org, they do whatever they can to boost profits regardless of the integrity of the game and teams
[3:28:00] silver557_mecharex: I'm eating pizza right now in my room
[3:28:05] MILLINKY: @gamerdge it doesn’t, it’s the NFL
[3:28:19] banchies: lions or 49ers?
[3:28:20] lovely_beez: @Gamerdge YesYes just made playoff record
[3:28:22] JemmaGrl: @silver557_mecharex what's on your pizza?
[3:28:24] Penny_Pink: how are u today @linkzzey i#
[3:28:36] Gamerdge: @lovely_beez my point exactly
[3:28:39] lovely_beez: @banchies 49ers Prayge
[3:28:43] coolbob991: mr beats had an add last year in it
[3:28:58] Penny_Pink: Nice! I’m awsome, had some bad days but am back!
[3:29:09] Penny_Pink: period
[3:29:10] banchies: @coolbob991 no he was featured in one. he had an ad but it never ran
[3:29:11] silver557_mecharex: @jemmagrl it's just pepperoni 🙃
[3:29:23] Gamerdge: neither one of them are using one another. they were both insanely popular in their own field.
[3:29:28] JemmaGrl: Yo that Enderman needs to get to work. He's just standing around doin' nuthin'
[3:29:31] Rissa_Bell24: I’m back!
[3:29:42] billboein: 7mill for 30s ad nothing crazy taneeshaElf
[3:29:43] Penny_Pink: @rissa_bell24 wb
[3:29:45] JemmaGrl: @silver557_mecharex pepperoni is goooood. It's my go to.
[3:30:07] Penny_Pink: linkzzeyLov linkzzeyHype linkzzeyHeart
[3:30:07] Gamerdge: I have been here the whole time
[3:30:13] MyMinyWorld: Whatever the deal is, if I have to hear her version of Last Christmas one more time we're gonna have a problem HypeOhDeer
[3:30:28] Des_troy_er: he has a history of being scummy too though… his brother is the only reason he’s in the nfl and not working back home with no one knowing his name
[3:30:28] abbywil23: linkzzeyGig linkzzeyGig
[3:30:32] Gamerdge: that is not true at all
[3:30:34] iRyzn: the superbowl this year will probably reach 200 mil views, that 7mil is probably worth it
[3:30:43] dragonworrier66: we back from dinner Gladge LUBBERS
[3:30:54] Brixxii: @dragonworrier66 wb Scoots
[3:30:55] Amandroid: she's not performing - she's been in the stands watching the game - that's what people are talking about
[3:31:15] StreamElements: Can Link survive 100 days in RL Craft?? linkzzeyCan Check out his NEW video on YT!! linkzzeyPop https://youtu.be/DiLVt9Iemug
[3:31:21] silver557_mecharex: @jemmagrl same pepperoni is the best at any time
[3:31:25] dragonworrier66: @Amandroid its bc shes dating travis kelcie
[3:31:41] Brixxii: YesYes cuz you can ask to not be shown.
[3:31:50] dragonworrier66: yess
[3:31:52] raspberryylive: i would point my camera at you link
[3:32:01] dragonworrier66: YesYes
[3:32:02] allymayblack: no shot LUL
[3:32:03] Brixxii: NODDERS I am agreeing with that
[3:32:13] iRyzn: they do, but i think the thing that most people are annoyed with is that they show her 10+ times a game YesYes
[3:32:17] dragonworrier66: YesYes  󠀀
[3:32:17] Gamerdge: not true - case in point, brittany mahomes. she is nowhere as known or popular as TSwift but she is shown a lot on TV b/c she is married to the Chiefs QB
[3:32:30] billboein: rareLink KEKCAM 3KEKW taneeshaElf PopCorn
[3:32:36] MyMinyWorld: It's just annoying to people who want to watch the game I think is the bottom line Shruge I don't watch football so I don't really care but I can see how it would be irritating
[3:32:39] dragonworrier66: KC hater right here
[3:32:40] silver557_mecharex: YesYes  do what you wish...
[3:32:46] Des_troy_er: I think it’s different for the fact that she’s irrelevant as an actual long term chiefs fan where as most celebrities they show in the stands are long term supporters of their team
[3:33:00] Rissa_Bell24: I love how my brother was having a very similar conversation with my dad
[3:33:19] MILLINKY: cheer95 Taylor is a different kind of influencer who has been known to to alter whole economy’s with her tours. It’s more beneficial to the NFL than Taylor 100%. Taylor has more fans than the NFL combined. so that in itself generates more money than we can think of. but I’d rather see link a hard core legend
[3:33:23] silver557_mecharex: Anyone here watch anime?
[3:33:35] MILLINKY: @silver557_mecharex yeah
[3:33:59] breadboydjfb: can we make a bet
[3:33:59] Gamerdge: also, there is a big difference between showing The Rock on TV once b/c he is there versus showing TSwift 4-5 times a broadcast
[3:34:08] zestytreats: At the end of the day, the NFL is a business. She helps business.  Deal with it fans.
[3:34:09] silver557_mecharex: @millinky what's your favorite anime?
[3:34:12] Amandroid: @breadboydjfb NoNo we don't do predictions here
[3:34:13] MILLINKY: NFL is just America. Taylor is World wide
[3:34:15] Brixxii: NODDERS I would be annoyed having fans be shown more than the game.
[3:34:19] lovely_beez: YesYes probably, taylor is worldwide.
[3:34:21] Sn1p3rzXV: Definitely NOT more fans
[3:34:41] foxshockz: @lovely_beez Very true
[3:34:46] breadboydjfb: I’m not trying to do oredictions
[3:34:49] MILLINKY: just look at the followers she as vs what nfl has js
[3:34:50] r1LLEEEE: superbowl is only big in america, taylor is big in the hole world
[3:34:52] Gamerdge: @MILLINKY not true - the NFL has a huge fan base in europe
[3:34:54] breadboydjfb: I just want to make a friendly bet
[3:34:59] Amandroid: @breadboydjfb nope, sorry
[3:35:11] breadboydjfb: ok
[3:35:16] im_rubbleside: hi early morning
[3:35:16] dragonworrier66: she has like 12-13 grammys
[3:35:25] Gamerdge: @r1LLEEEE not true - the super bowl is broadcast live in 95 countries
[3:35:28] raspberryylive: uhh id say the nfl and taylor both have at least like 4 fans
[3:35:31] MILLINKY: @silver557_mecharex Naruto, boruto, attack on titan, and one piece
[3:35:34] Brixxii: KEKW I know nothing about the NFL, I only watch NHL
[3:35:36] MyMinyWorld: Nerdge according to the internet, 113.06 million viewers were tuned in for Super Bowl 57
[3:35:37] foxshockz: There are approximately 184M NFL fans
[3:35:45] MILLINKY: @silver557_mecharex attack on titan hands down the best
[3:35:50] Amandroid: @Brixxii blushPoint peepoCanada
[3:35:57] Sn1p3rzXV: Followers on social media does not dictate a persons popularity
[3:35:59] KilledCody: look taylor brings in more views, more money for the NFL, more fans, just wish they didnt profit off of a celebrities relationship
[3:35:59] silver557_mecharex: I say twitch is more popular though.. because it's got a mascot. for example glitch!
[3:36:04] dragonworrier66: over 100mill people watched the super bowl last year
[3:36:21] lovely_beez: @dragonworrier66 theyre projecting over 200m this year peepoWish
[3:36:26] abbywil23: cristianaMonkey <——- needs to be in a Super Bowl commercial
[3:36:29] MILLINKY: she has 279m followers on insta alone
[3:36:34] Amandroid: cristianaMonkey
[3:36:35] dragonworrier66: oh god beez
[3:36:40] abbywil23: cristianaMonkey
[3:37:03] lovely_beez: @dragonworrier66 i know linkzzeyGig
[3:37:08] raspberryylive: live veiwers versus insta followers which can be bots as well tho
[3:37:10] dragonworrier66: 500 mill is the highest
[3:37:12] MILLINKY: NFL only has 29M
[3:37:18] iRyzn: i dont even have 279 followers on instagram, let alone 279 mil PepeLaugh
[3:37:21] MILLINKY: sooooo
[3:37:22] MyMinyWorld: Ronaldo has the most followers
[3:37:23] Amandroid: @iRyzn linkzzeyGig
[3:37:47] Sn1p3rzXV: also a reminder is that not every nfl fan can watch the superbowl, im pretty sure it can only be watched on paramount, of course not everyone has that app, myself included
[3:37:59] dragonworrier66: 500m
[3:38:04] MyMinyWorld: Like 600mil apparently, Messi is after him with 500mil
[3:38:13] silver557_mecharex: DinoDance <--- he's pixelated because his name is nix
[3:38:25] Gamerdge: @Sn1p3rzXV not true - its on regular CBS

[3:38:54] dragonworrier66: viewership for the NFL is more than there social media following
[3:38:57] MyMinyWorld: @abbywil23 OMEGALUL I'll take your word for it
[3:39:04] Sn1p3rzXV: @Gamerdge not everyone owns cable, or cbs. I dont.
[3:39:07] abbywil23: @myminyworld KEKW
[3:39:40] Gamerdge: @Sn1p3rzXV CBS isn't cable; its regular over the air TV
[3:39:47] silver557_mecharex: TheIlluminati *illuminati music🎵*
[3:39:54] iRyzn: there are tiktok views with billions of views
[3:40:15] MILLINKY: cheer95 yeah cause real football is world wide. hence more fans. vs just maybe 2 continents, that was what I was trying to say. but yeah I’m not a big fan of big entertainment. that’s why I’m here for my entertainment linkzzeyAight
[3:40:29] MyMinyWorld: I do good to get 2 likes on my pictures these days ICANT
