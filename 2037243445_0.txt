[0:33:30] NerdMomOfBoys: It’s a shame that you don’t really have the time to play this pack on your own time. It’s fast paced and fun to run vaults. The mods are only to help store loot and to get resources for the crystals. Hands down it’s the best modpack ever created.
[0:33:31] zeus_o9o2: you need to spec in lucky hit for it to work
[0:33:37] lalorsa1: do you use lucky hit? if not, change the shields

[1:21:49] GhoulHunter811: loll
[1:22:05] Ktolos: Crit hits turn off the special abilities of the sword.  Using an ability like Nova / Fireball for an area of effect attack would help versus the tank and mobs they spawn.
[1:22:05] braed_man_walking: 4/5 red scrolls?
[1:22:17] WilliamComartin: you definitely need a better chest breaker
