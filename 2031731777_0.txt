[2:02:36] Fossabot: @itsMuter You just fished a Raw Cod! 🐟 (51%)
[2:02:37] itsMuter: BLEHHHH
[2:02:42] madsenvy: blehhh
[2:02:45] 0LLI1770: smite is by and large better for AA
[2:02:45] penguinsandstuff: BLEHHHH
[2:02:47] liquidfyre_: BLEHHHH
[2:02:51] nikitaprivet: blehhh
[2:02:55] buddy_3500: Any special reason?
[2:02:57] CurtisDN_: sharpness does not get you any additional oneshots, smite gets you like 5 and helps more on the wither, and is crucial for skulls
[2:03:00] audioSalix: in AA you have to kill a lot of drowned, wither skeletons, and the wither, so smite is just better
[2:03:00] Catpotatt: :b
[2:03:03] tlhuntr: wither skellies
[2:03:08] zurtleTiff: @buddy_3500 one shots skellies and drowned

[2:03:11] tlhuntr: is the biggest one
[2:03:13] PacManMVC: why not take 2 guys to the overworld and kill 1 while the other is converting

[2:03:56] shig_tv: good shit
[2:03:56] 0LLI1770: smite has oneshot potential on mobs you have to kill a LOT a lot of in AA. and then things like raids where sharpness might benefit you just end up spawn camping the mobs with tnt
[2:03:57] penguinsandstuff: Fishinge
[2:03:57] madsenvy: peepoFat
[2:03:59] PacManMVC: yes mads

[4:59:16] carnotrocity: I see peepoBlush
[4:59:41] kittykat2626: I used to view it as the most difficult achievement before I saw how rare lightening is lmao
[4:59:51] SmallFenFen: whats his pb ?
[4:59:51] kittykat2626: lightning fml can’t spell today

[5:00:13] carnotrocity: @kittykat2626 yea I just know lightning, biomes, cats, are the rare ones
[5:00:16] samm35_: saved
[5:00:22] carnotrocity: honestly I have no idea what the conduit thing is/does
[5:00:31] Destetra: cats is actually not that bad
[5:00:32] toastrl_: la piss
[5:00:32] siltsprite: catJAM
[5:00:32] AphidOut: it give water breathing
[5:00:35] SmallFenFen: did he speedrun other games too ?
[5:00:37] AphidOut: gives*
[5:00:38] carnotrocity: breeding** I mean
[5:00:39] couldntuseCBOSS: blue diamonds are so weird to see after so much hoplite
[5:00:40] CurtisDN_: it gives you conduit power, which is an effect for HDWGH
[5:00:47] 0LLI1770: he's speedrun pvz
[5:00:52] nicey_y: cat isnt rare but shells are
[5:00:56] M4RT1NCool22: water breathing and night vision IIRC
[5:01:00] CurtisDN_: water breathing is separate, as far as HDWGH goes, but conduit power gives you water breathing by default
[5:01:10] kittykat2626: wait pvz?!?! I loveeee pvz
[5:01:13] thegreatestnoob1: in the april fools snapshot  20w14infinite, theres a achievement that makes you travel 1 million dimensions. WHICH WOULD TAKE OVER A HUNDRED YEARS USING THE MATH
[5:01:13] AphidOut: oh yea right
[5:01:16] CurtisDN_: it also gives haste 1
[5:01:18] nprime06: Wow, I didnt know hoplite updated their terrain generation, it looks like vanilla now!
[5:01:35] SAMS300FOXES: feinberg con du it YEO
[5:01:42] CurtisDN_: but none of the 3 things conduit power gives count just because you have conduit power, you need to actually get them separately
[5:02:11] thegreatestnoob1: @CurtisDN_ yeah it only counts as conduit power
[5:02:13] carnotrocity: oh yea and the wither heads
[5:02:14] PacManMVC: back from dinner
[5:02:21] SmallFenFen: 30000 dpi on his mouse xD

[5:02:46] Moo_God41: yay
[5:02:48] xartrex5: yeah I’ved watched for months and still don’t know how he does it
[5:02:50] PacManMVC: everything in aa is "easy just time consuming"
[5:02:54] SmallFenFen: whats he looking for
[5:02:55] kittykat2626: but I don’t think he’s ever stopped a run because of wither head rates
[5:03:00] SmallFenFen: i cant even read the books

[5:03:16] AphidOut: wither skulls are luck not "time consuming"
[5:03:30] PacManMVC: rng dependent does not equal hard
[5:03:30] carnotrocity: what is the beehive achievement?
[5:03:33] Novamb: lightning is just time consuming because you'll get it eventually
[5:03:33] kittykat2626: im going to stop talking now sob
[5:03:34] carnotrocity: breeding bees?
[5:03:39] CurtisDN_: theres a bunch of bee related advancements
[5:03:43] thegreatestnoob1: bro thas this steram been gone for 5 hours?
[5:03:44] M4RT1NCool22: done with enchant pog
[5:04:00] SAMS300FOXES: peepoTalk
[5:04:00] CurtisDN_: you need to drink honey as well for a balanced diet
[5:04:06] AphidOut: @thegreatestnoob1 yes
[5:04:07] PacManMVC: @thegreatestnoob1 pretty normal yeah
[5:04:14] thegreatestnoob1: dude thats crazy
[5:04:26] AphidOut: it's his full time job so not really
[5:04:33] carnotrocity: what's the one where u slip from a honey block
[5:04:39] thegreatestnoob1: sticky situation
[5:04:40] PacManMVC: sticky situation
[5:04:45] carnotrocity: what is the achievement
[5:04:48] carnotrocity: like what does it do
[5:04:53] PacManMVC: wdym
[5:04:55] 0LLI1770: sticky situation
[5:04:56] CurtisDN_: oh you get stuck on a honey block while falling
[5:04:57] lion4202: it gives you brownie points
[5:04:59] PacManMVC: its break your fall in a honey block
[5:05:02] CurtisDN_: and that gives the advancement
[5:05:02] carnotrocity: ahhh
[5:05:05] carnotrocity: gotcha
[5:05:07] nicey_y: slide down a honey block carno
[5:05:17] PacManMVC: sticky is stupid because it only gets checked once per second like how biomes are checked
[5:05:24] heroblaze2: nm,.’/
[5:05:26] AphidOut: carno you answered your own question lol
[5:05:29] xartrex5: Fishinge
[5:05:30] CurtisDN_: oh is that why it only works sometimes
[5:05:33] PacManMVC: yeah
[5:05:33] CurtisDN_: i never knew why
[5:05:52] SAMS300FOXES: TAS AA run where they rod a TNT into a school of fish Kreygasm
[5:05:52] Fossabot: Kreygasm
[5:05:58] Erina64: you can get a horse to travel on for the last couple of biomes
[5:06:01] thegreatestnoob1: @PacManMVC never knew that
[5:06:05] Erina64: (need saddle)
[5:06:07] PacManMVC: horse
[5:06:08] carnotrocity: i'm learning today peepoBlush
[5:06:11] PacManMVC: when he has an elytra?
[5:06:15] CurtisDN_: 1.8 aa tech
[5:06:19] PacManMVC: why would you ever travel on a horse
[5:06:20] CurtisDN_: using the horse for midgame
[5:06:22] SAMS300FOXES: CatBop
[5:06:25] PacManMVC: oh in 1.8
[5:06:26] couldntuseCBOSS: sticky is also just a weird concept for an advancement
[5:06:27] byugoi_: why isnt every advancement checked once per second like sticky, or rather why does sticky need that lol
[5:06:29] Erina64: @PacManMVC if he runs out mrrobo4Squid
[5:06:32] AphidOut: that's funny
[5:06:44] thegreatestnoob1: @Erina64 he has a backup
[5:06:52] kittykat2626: dumb cat
[5:06:52] PacManMVC: @byugoi_ well for the obtain item advancements that wouldn't really make sense
[5:07:02] alex_belgium: nothing i love more that feinberg streaming late at night
[5:07:07] PacManMVC: if he ever fully runs out of elytra the run is just dead Erina64
[5:07:08] madsenvy: Happi
[5:07:10] samm35_: zombies :tf:
[5:07:11] PacManMVC: Happi
[5:07:28] PacManMVC: he's not about to get on a horse to play it out
[5:07:31] byugoi_: i guess like for great view from up here
[5:07:40] byugoi_: stuff like that
[5:07:42] muntintin: 🥕
[5:07:50] SAMS300FOXES: meow
[5:07:52] PacManMVC: yeah for some of those it makes sense to check less frequently
[5:07:57] epicpkb: meow god damn
[5:08:00] sleepyyalice: Cat
[5:08:02] CurtisDN_: i feel like the question you should be asking is why is there a 1 second rule for biomes and sticky situation
[5:08:03] byugoi_: but that one only needs to be checked when the player has levitation, so i guess i answered my own question
[5:08:04] SAMS300FOXES: meow Lightning0
[5:08:10] CurtisDN_: like those should just be instant like everything else
[5:08:27] PacManMVC: 4Shrug idk i don't make the game
[5:08:29] PacManMVC: yet
[5:08:33] byugoi_: i guess all the other ones dont need to be checked all the time though
[5:08:38] nicey_y: yet Clueless
[5:08:41] lion4202: growth mindset pac
[5:08:42] byugoi_: they are only checked under certain conditions
[5:08:44] PacManMVC: mark my words
[5:08:53] thegreatestnoob1: im watching this while im getting some mods
[5:08:57] CurtisDN_: biomes should just check when you transition between biomes, imo
[5:08:57] ItzzMatt84: @PacManMVC ill mark your mom
[5:09:01] PacManMVC: thanks matt
[5:09:03] penguinsandstuff: hows the run goin?
[5:09:04] Fossabot: @penguinsandstuff he wouldn't play the run if it's not decent pace - use the timer/tracker if you are still confused feinL
[5:09:07] CurtisDN_: if curtisdn_ made minecraft, thats how it would work
[5:09:08] M4RT1NCool22: instant mesa fuck yeah
[5:09:10] SAMS300FOXES: wait is this a run we haven't gotten mesa in yet? I can't remember anymore
[5:09:11] muntintin: i ate 4 slices of pizza should i eat another
[5:09:14] penguinsandstuff: @Fossabot I didnt ask you
[5:09:17] PacManMVC: if you're still hungry
[5:09:23] CurtisDN_: this run had mesa blind, thats why he went straight here

[5:53:43] Thekingofhotdogs: @byugoi_ I mean the TAS is currently bounded by the first appearance of Thunder or Phantoms (I forget which) so going into creative wouldn't help much. If I remember right they sit in a box for like 20 minutes

[5:54:41] kittykat2626: why does he put them in water, to line them up?
[5:54:50] CurtisDN_: he drops fish in
