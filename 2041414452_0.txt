[0:12:26] jeffbriant: Shirley

[0:12:52] soulsbloodsekiring: Minecraft   :D
[0:12:52] juampi999999990: i feel like it takes way more to poise break some bosses in this game over elden ring
[0:12:58] thewildrobocop: how long did it take you to beat the game on your first Elden ring play through?
[0:12:58] MachinoBot: 9 hours
[0:13:02] Adeathane: hello, is the up and coming startup website working today?
[0:13:16] Helianth3: yo gino, gl for today
[0:13:22] KnotUp: Blessed weapon FUG looks like if someone took one of those fluorescent light and welded a handle onto it
[0:13:46] ballerboogeyman: Will you ever play Lies of P?
[0:13:49] juampi999999990: what is the best strenght weapon in ds3?
[0:13:57] Adeathane: it looks like a popsickle
[0:14:07] Adeathane: that kinda melted and refroze
[0:14:35] Aevee: flashbang
[0:14:35] AtomicAziz: matches your greenscreen YEP
[0:14:38] idogecuh: lothric knight GS is my fav great sword
[0:14:42] shinytrashcan: Giant Slab of Rock, vaguely shaped like a blade: clearly a sword
[0:14:44] juampi999999990: dark infusion looks cool too
[0:14:45] ws2soriginal: DKS3 is the best
[0:14:52] Schuppenninja: He went shopping.
[0:15:03] 000bandit000: RGB concrete
[0:15:11] tenshin2002: the blessed sword should light up darkness more i feel
[0:15:17] juampi999999990: have you no hit this game more than elden ring?
[0:15:22] thewildrobocop: what is your favorite cover picture for any of the souls games?
[0:15:25] jeffbriant: dark damage is chefs kiss 🤌
[0:15:59] juampi999999990: elden ring has so many holy resistant bosses
[0:16:18] trompiesteopp: 7.5% of ar
[0:16:22] Schuppenninja: dark and chaos infusions create the highest scaling.
[0:16:25] AtomicAziz: and the HP regen
[0:16:27] DogsHeadCigarettes: Midir and Aldritch are the dark resist bosses right? Aldritch might be immune actually
[0:16:31] venomenonlive: also i believe it gives you HP regen
[0:16:37] Thenastyraven: Hello gino and chat, wait twitch is not dead today Pog surely it will stay that way Clueless
[0:16:51] AtomicAziz: And not sure if prevents skeleton to revive
[0:17:00] Steel_NK: Aldrich
[0:17:06] Aevee: midir being resistant to both fire and dark is rough
[0:17:07] idogecuh: gael too
[0:17:08] thewildrobocop: how far are you into the game
[0:17:08] MachinoBot: 9 hours
[0:17:21] Schuppenninja: Oh and the blessed infusion is the highest physical damage infusion for unoptimized weapons.
[0:17:27] jeffbriant: blastedd
[0:17:38] thewildrobocop: what is your favorite boss of all of the games
[0:17:47] TheCharCzar: machinoHi
[0:17:47] shinytrashcan: Doesn't EB have like 80% damage negation against  holy?
[0:18:00] Gum_is: that sword just screams casual :D
[0:18:02] jeffbriant: not even scared of your lightsaber dude
[0:18:06] DogsHeadCigarettes: I'm really hoping that the DLC bosses will be weaker to holy damage to balance it out a bit.
[0:18:24] idogecuh: radagon and malakith have 80% resistance
[0:18:30] KoenigOne: GIGACHAD
[0:18:32] Schuppenninja: Chadual
[0:18:33] jeffbriant: don't be silly, swords can't scream Happs
[0:18:34] Aevee: GIGAFUME
[0:18:46] jeffbriant: KEKPOINT
[0:18:46] KoenigOne: OMEGALUL
[0:18:51] Aevee: noob.
[0:18:52] jumpinjaq: girl*
[0:18:54] Schuppenninja: *casually* slain
[0:18:56] MachinoBot: BOW ONLY ALL BOSSES NEW VIDEO https://youtu.be/yAxAOGgV04g
[0:18:59] trompiesteopp: SeemsGood
[0:19:05] 000bandit000: Stunning everything in irithyll is very satisfying, such an annoying area on any other build but big strike
[0:19:07] idogecuh: surely the new no hit strait
[0:19:10] shinytrashcan: I think most casual is the standard sword+shield combo. not because it is bad, but it is so...obvious
[0:19:11] thewildrobocop: who is the hardest boss in ds3?
[0:19:13] la_loveiathan: Cheer100 Cheer100 Cheer100
[0:19:14] MachinoBot: la_loveiathan just cheered with 300, and has cheered a total of 300!
[0:19:21] tenshin2002: OMG the damage. I was nowhere near that in this area
[0:19:26] Schuppenninja: @thewildrobocop Depends, but usually Gael.
[0:19:30] Aevee: @thewildrobocop dogs
[0:19:30] puptime: moistCozy rbeeCozy howdyPls dviperSee leksiwCorgiHey
[0:19:42] thewildrobocop: who is the hardest boss in ds3?
[0:19:49] Aevee: dogs 󠀀
[0:19:50] KoenigOne: @Schuppenninja nah it's sister friede or Midir
[0:19:52] thewildrobocop: ok
[0:20:00] idogecuh: dogs are probably the hardest boss
[0:20:02] Trippyy_Kun: friede
[0:20:04] motoboy1803: What's up gino
[0:20:15] chadsworth0524: chadsworth0524 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 7 months! 
[0:20:16] crozier11: Love the stream and the youtube videos. Keep up the good work!
[0:20:29] KoenigOne: GoldPLZ
[0:20:34] iatemypet2: large sharts Kappa
[0:20:37] Schuppenninja: @Schuppenninja Friede can easily be killed with the right build (like using her own scythe) and Midir is extremely easy to handle once you know him.
[0:20:43] mintslice95: Are you going to make it blessed or go heavy w lightning blade on it?
[0:20:43] MachinoBot: YesYesYes
[0:20:43] idogecuh: I think a twinkling
[0:20:51] AtomicAziz: twinkling maybe

[0:21:12] MachinoBot: gorvblar Current Song: Jeremy Soule - Auriel's Ascension
[0:21:15] Aevee: always found this shortcut weird
[0:21:19] Semiter: this is the part I stopped playing DS3 years ago - those tall skull dancer guys ruin me.
[0:21:24] la_loveiathan: god i love the fugs
[0:21:27] KnotUp: Strength weapons are so fun for these casual playthroughs just tank some hits and one shot nerds
[0:21:33] Thenastyraven: This weapon is SO SATISFYING TO USE Kreygasm
[0:21:47] KoenigOne: @Schuppenninja that still doesn't make gael the hardest, I would say pontiff or the dancer are harder than Gael
[0:21:55] Rorke47: ds3 is full of bad circle backtracking like in lothric castle
[0:21:56] tenshin2002: I was very underleveled when I got here
[0:21:57] prschorn: prschorn subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 5 months! 
[0:22:06] thewildrobocop: when your build is at its peak how much damage do you think it would have for a charged r2
[0:22:08] Kazaguya: kappa train Pog
[0:22:14] vitorannn: would be fun to see you battling invaders in the casual playthroughs too bad it can't be
[0:22:22] maohayato: hi Gino, hi everyone
[0:22:23] iatemypet2: it's about the item behind the locked door teasing you, it's hidden behind the fake barrier
[0:22:23] Nararawr: oppai Heyge
[0:22:23] idogecuh: I wonder why this thing has a 40 dex requirement in ds2 when it has e scaling in dex
[0:22:23] MachinoBot: BinoculousTogether
[0:22:25] Schuppenninja: @Schuppenninja Once you know how to handle dancer she is also easy. Pontiff is a "can you parry" check.
[0:22:30] Kazaguya: hey gino
[0:22:36] jeffbriant: oppai Kazaguya WineTime2 POGCRAZY WineTime
[0:22:41] matt_aot: kaza, oppai, nara poggies

[0:22:51] Kazaguya: jeff nar matt oppai hi
[0:22:58] Nararawr: kaza hi
[0:22:58] jeffbriant: hi
[0:23:01] thewildrobocop: when your build is at its peak how much damage do you think it would have for a charged r2
[0:23:20] Aevee: this game would be funny if we had axe talisman
[0:23:20] motoboy1803: @kazaguya yo kazaguya
[0:23:23] Thenastyraven: Lightining blade on Lothric UGS is just disgusting tbh LUL
[0:23:28] la_loveiathan: shame that weapon arts stink in this games
[0:23:30] la_loveiathan: game*
[0:23:35] iatemypet2: so the area isn't about a shortcut, it's about teasing an inaccessible area with an item
[0:23:54] Schuppenninja: @la_loveiathan But have you seen Preacher's Right Arm?
[0:24:09] TheCharCzar: YouTube chat is still slightly delayed
[0:24:09] YesImEvil: Everyone warned me Dancer would beat my ass. I've got a friend who explained why Dancer is so hard with music theory. Then I demolished her in 2 tries and discovered some people can't adapt to new patterns.
[0:24:12] thewildrobocop: when your build is at its peak how much damage do you think it would have for a charged r2
[0:24:20] ArchPong: That would happen on the site as well
[0:24:21] TheCharCzar: It's like the API doesn't do realtime calls, just batch calls
[0:24:24] Aevee: music theory? OMEGALUL
[0:24:27] jeffbriant: the blasting
[0:24:28] shinytrashcan: pvp in ER gets really broken at high levels, with tons of AOW and powerful spells.
[0:24:29] KnotUp: Might be some API thing
[0:24:38] la_loveiathan: @Schuppenninja there's a few WAs but like overall it's better to just use r1s and r2s
[0:24:43] mintslice95: wait there's golden kappa train lol
[0:24:52] xlingotti: THE LONG POKE
[0:24:57] motoboy1803: @shinytrashcan especially with inescapable frenzy
[0:25:01] kingezontop: w
[0:25:03] thewildrobocop: what kind of buff do you put on your sword?
[0:25:09] YesImEvil: @Aevee Dude's a complete nerd, he's a nuclear engineer now.
[0:25:10] la_loveiathan: like the r2 on the fugs is SO good
[0:25:14] DogsHeadCigarettes: Backstep power
[0:25:26] DogsHeadCigarettes: DS1 backsteps
[0:25:32] YesImEvil: "short"cuts
[0:25:41] thewildrobocop: what kind of buff do you put on your sword?
[0:25:46] Schuppenninja: @Schuppenninja I did a whole run with just PRA's weapon art and it was the most fun run ever.
[0:25:48] Nararawr: if u die to scythe guy
[0:26:02] Thenastyraven: I think they put the elevator to get faster to irythill dungeon
[0:26:03] DogsHeadCigarettes: They definitely were rushed on this area. I mean Pontiff was definitely not supposed to be that early.
[0:26:06] Aevee: might be broken
[0:26:08] Thenastyraven: probably Shrugeg
[0:26:23] iatemypet2: @DogsHeadCigarettes that was literally always a boss arena
[0:26:28] 000bandit000: Pvp in 3 is like... so long as everyone has a proper build for it, fair. In ER aow with passive poise... it's kinda either one sided or boring
[0:26:47] motoboy1803: Do you prefer a casual AB or a no hit AB?
[0:26:48] shinytrashcan: ...now I am imagining ER with that, all those bleed builds would be absolutely broken
[0:26:51] thewildrobocop: what do you think is the best souls like?
[0:26:51] maohayato: @YesImEvil dancer is just blade spinny go BRRRRR.
[0:26:52] iatemypet2: poor cretin
[0:27:01] la_loveiathan: i like that they added weapon arts because it paved the way for elden ring's ashes but i never  understood fromsofts design decision to make cool things mostly wet noodles
[0:27:02] idogecuh: wth does that item even do LUL
[0:27:05] DogsHeadCigarettes: @iatemypet2 yeah, but Pontiff wasn't in that boss arena. There was a witch boss originally.
[0:27:24] Nararawr: BLASTED
[0:27:24] Aevee: noob
[0:27:25] Doctorserious: rip
[0:27:25] jumpinjaq: ez
[0:27:26] KnotUp: lmao
[0:27:27] Alphidel: Blessed FUGS for the win!!!
[0:27:27] mintslice95: rolled
[0:27:39] thewildrobocop: what kind of buff do you put on your sword?
[0:27:40] Kazaguya: "oooo you so scared rn"
[0:27:47] iatemypet2: @DogsHeadCigarettes which was turned into a normal enemy and replaced with the boss that became Pontiff, like the boss was put in that room before the "pontiff" lore even existed
[0:27:52] jeffbriant: if they aren't scared, they're at least blinded
[0:27:55] thewildrobocop: what do you think is the best souls like?
[0:27:55] idogecuh: this weapon is truly blessed
[0:27:56] mintslice95: @thewildrobocop Blessed weapon
[0:28:10] thewildrobocop: ok
[0:28:27] Aevee: i hate the 2nd r1 tho
[0:28:51] jeffbriant: fucken flashlight is useful in this area KEKEW
[0:28:56] BatchBrewer: what sword is that
[0:29:00] thewildrobocop: what is the best and worst weapon class in the game you are playing?
[0:29:14] charo_deyy: Greetings) shall I lose my points?
[0:29:17] KnotUp: @BatchBrewer Fume ultra greatsword
[0:29:49] YesImEvil: Downside to Blessed Weapon is the bloom in dark areas makes it a bitch to see.
[0:29:50] Aevee: have u done a smough hammer run in this game
[0:30:00] thewildrobocop: what is the best and worst weapon class in the game you are playing?
[0:30:03] darthriven117: @ginomachino in dark souls 3 what is the bet katana from base to max.
[0:30:06] Xehanz: You don't like teleporting dogs?
[0:30:06] puptime: dviperPride dviperBoop starwo4Smile buffpupPrayge weakexL
[0:30:09] Thenastyraven: Do you get more hp regen from blessed weapon as you get more faith? monkaHmm
[0:30:16] Aevee: funny camera
[0:30:28] mintslice95: @Thenastyraven no
[0:30:29] 000bandit000: U need like 1-2 pts to end for 3rd r1
[0:30:32] sirautozone: GINO! DUDE I WATCH ALL YOUR YOUTUBE VIDEOS! I just not subscribed to your twitch. Just wondering if you would ever be interested in doing a dagger or double dagger in elden ring?
[0:30:46] motoboy1803: Which souls game have the best katanas
[0:30:49] Thenastyraven: @mintslice95 ok so you only get more AR from faith then ok thanks
[0:30:52] sirautozone: I just subscribed to your twitch
[0:31:00] Kazaguya: wait torches emit light??
[0:31:02] KoenigOne: Smough's hammer is super strong, but it's stamina consumption is annoying
[0:31:04] Goatslayer56: what about a naba regeb shield so you cast hp rege without drinking?
[0:31:07] motoboy1803: Not countingvER
[0:31:12] iatemypet2: torch is useful for when you get covered in maggots
[0:31:16] jeffbriant: torch this, kaza THIS
[0:31:18] Komugi_: ds2 has counter damage mostly
[0:31:21] mnrt: katana pretty good in sekiro
[0:31:34] thewildrobocop: what is the best spear in Elden Ring?
[0:31:37] mintslice95: @Thenastyraven Well no blessed weapon is a flat 7.5% ar and static health regen no matter your faith
[0:31:39] Aevee: do mobs even have mana
[0:31:41] Aevee: that you can drain
[0:31:42] Hoodzz__: i think the uchi is a pretty good katana start of game ds1
[0:31:48] motoboy1803: @mnrt damn
[0:31:50] iatemypet2: factually correct

[0:32:45] thewildrobocop: what is the strength required to wield that sword?
[0:32:52] mintslice95: @Thenastyraven the blessed infusion will scale damage with your faith and the health regen will increase with weapon upgrade level
[0:32:58] Eona93: ayy, stream is smooth again
[0:33:06] darthriven117: @ginomachino in dark souls 3 what is the best katana from base to max.
[0:33:08] YesImEvil: @thewildrobocop There's also Death Ritual Spear. But that's not really a spear. That's an airstrike summoner.
[0:33:22] sirautozone: What dark souls is this?

[0:38:39] MachinoBot: Any pylons in the chat dude machinoPylon
[0:38:42] YesImEvil: @spleen17 Just casually grease/dust your fists with fire.
[0:38:42] Osman_iac: Awoken Wankage I'm on mobile tell me if the emote works
[0:38:46] sirautozone: If you could go bare fist and have kicks and awesome melee moves

[0:38:52] geraltdelettenhove: you are
[0:38:55] Thenastyraven: you will kill greirat
[0:38:56] siilk13: you do
[0:38:56] mintslice95: It's fine to talk to him but not necessary
[0:39:01] KoenigOne: quest fucked, worst ending OMEGALUL
[0:39:04] Thenastyraven: if he moves, greirat is Deadge
[0:39:05] Xehanz: Not if you want to save Greirat
[0:39:08] iatemypet2: he doesn't move until you go further in distant manor
[0:39:10] AbassAli092: If he leaves greirat will die while plundering
[0:39:13] venomenonlive: i think greirat dies if you walk to him
[0:39:17] RafamelLopes: quest ruined PogO
[0:39:20] eliya58: You just can't go in the dungeon
[0:39:22] ItK228322: Just talk before you go to irithil dungeon
[0:39:28] AtomicAziz: if it's fine maybe with Patches quest
[0:39:29] eliya58: From what i understand
[0:39:32] motoboy1803: Fat midget
[0:39:33] geraltdelettenhove: oh yeah greirat dies in lothric castle if you talk to him before greirat gets back
[0:39:40] mintslice95: As long as he is there he will save greyrat just don't go past the manor or he will move
[0:39:44] thewildrobocop: what games has the best whips
[0:39:49] ItK228322: In its prob do Aldrich before yorm
[0:39:55] venomenonlive: i also think you patches can save him but his quest is so weird
[0:39:58] Aevee: is greirat #1 worst fromsoft questline
[0:39:59] Thenastyraven: greirat can only be saved by an "onion knight" gino
[0:40:11] 000bandit000: Idk why they make some stuff just unviable, the all have like some application somehow, but if u wanna punch barefist they should make a way to make it fun somehow
[0:40:14] ArchPong: I wouldn't put it past From
[0:40:17] charo_deyy: Chop suey reference btw (Grab a brush and put a little makeup)
[0:40:27] KoenigOne: I had to restart until NG+6 to get all quests because of that reason OMEGALUL
[0:40:32] javinknislay: PRAISE THE SUN
[0:40:39] geraltdelettenhove: isnt it patches who saves greirat and not this guy
[0:40:40] Thenastyraven: greirat says that after scavenging irtythill
[0:40:54] mintslice95: @geraltdelettenhove either can
[0:40:56] thewildrobocop: what games has the best whips?
[0:41:00] iatemypet2: Patches dresses as Siegward when he saves Greirat, that's why he needs to keep the armor
[0:41:11] Xehanz: Why not the Ariandel Slab
[0:41:21] Doctorserious: isn't ariandel easiest
[0:41:27] geraltdelettenhove: @geraltdelettenhove oh
[0:41:36] charo_deyy: Deep dark fantases and Yhorn is Dungeon Master
[0:41:38] 000bandit000: @geraltdelettenhove it's either or depending on whether you get siegwards armor back to him in cathedral
[0:41:43] ArchPong: What is earliest slab actually? I usually grab coiled sword, but i guess ariandel or siegward is earlier?
[0:41:47] kastrels: fromsoft try not to make the most obtuse quests ever challenge
[0:41:49] siilk13: you can get a lot of slabs from siegward if you kill him and do a lot of running
[0:41:49] Xehanz: @doctorserious it is, Ariandel is like a 5 minute trip
[0:41:50] AtomicAziz: Ariandel slab is easy
[0:41:55] sirautozone: BOP
[0:41:58] iatemypet2: yes
[0:42:01] AtomicAziz: simply spook glitch
[0:42:17] ArchPong: How tight is timing on spook quitout
[0:42:17] MachinoBot: 9 hours
[0:42:27] JustRecycle: glitches on a casual playthrough peepoWeirdLeave

[0:42:53] BatchBrewer: what’s the purpose of putting a shield to the back ?
[0:42:53] siilk13: is spook quitout possible on current patch?
[0:42:57] mintslice95: Probably because it's the earliest one even though it's kinda out of the way
[0:43:01] siilk13: @BatchBrewer passive healing
[0:43:08] sirautozone: What will be your next celebrity playthrough in ER?

[0:51:44] Aevee: yes you basically win trades with bosses
[0:51:46] sirautozone: Have you ever done a basic dagger no hit?
[0:51:47] ArchPong: You can upgrade that shield for more regen / s, looks like you need it ;)
[0:51:52] matt_aot: yo osman
[0:52:02] kastrels: i did an ultra greatsword build on my first playthrough it was so easy lol
[0:52:05] cIomid: I used guts sword and beat every boss in like 3 tries
[0:52:09] iatemypet2: you're not allowed to storm ruler Yhorm now that you have  this weapon :tf:
[0:52:30] ArchPong: @iatemypet2 Need to give him more restriction than that i think haha

[1:04:47] jacob_hyde: I didn't expect ds3 to have good graphics, i had not played it

[1:05:34] Osman_iac: Over encomberd
[1:05:38] AmazingBlanket: @ThisIsLightning yeah they need to be actively attacking you. it's not an aura/aoe
[1:05:39] RafamelLopes: @ThisIsLightning yeah
[1:05:56] galeriephantom: nameless soon?
[1:06:04] MiroslavSmiley: it is
[1:06:06] iatemypet2: I do like how the player would be comfortable by this point in the game, and the game throws these life draining fuckers at them
[1:06:12] siilk13: @jacob_hyde best bossess by far
[1:06:18] Thenastyraven: Good thing they didn't make the jailers as a bossifght in DS3, because they certainly would in ER PepeLaugh
[1:06:20] AbassAli092: Mimic drops estus shard
[1:06:35] jacob_hyde: @the_musko i played elden ring and beat it 3 times but didn't give interest into the other souls games
[1:06:44] REFLECTlONS: 15
[1:06:45] madmanPecos: elden ring would have a jailer trio boss fight
[1:06:45] siilk13: 15
[1:06:47] jeffbriant: 15?
[1:06:48] mintslice95: 15
[1:06:50] RafamelLopes: 15 + 10
[1:06:54] jeffbriant: 15
[1:06:57] AZCollins: @jacob_hyde You're missing out
[1:07:06] N1to_0: mimics are one of the hardest enemies?
[1:07:29] Qffset: at least 40
[1:07:31] ThisIsLightning: Even 20 is plenty LUL
[1:07:35] siilk13: @N1to_0 not really, very easy to dodge
[1:07:38] jeffbriant: late game ER is insane the damage you take
[1:07:40] shinytrashcan: 40 is the first softcap, but up to 60 is common
[1:07:41] RafamelLopes: mimics have pretty basic moves so idk
[1:07:41] Thenastyraven: In ER you would be dead with 40 in the same situation LuL
[1:07:42] MiroslavSmiley: Vigor hard cap in this game is 30, in ER it's 60 LUL
[1:07:48] MlLLXR: especially embered you have alot of hp
[1:07:49] mintslice95: you're right the amount oif vigor needed in elden ring is way higher
[1:07:49] c10dub: just don’t get hit
[1:07:57] torzxy: do u think a elden ring no dodge run is possible and if so would u attempt it
[1:08:03] kastrels: 40 is basically all you need in er
[1:08:07] 000bandit000: No you're right. Elden ring changed the balance a lot. Enemies hit harder and are more complex. But they also made it easier to get powerful
[1:08:08] Osman_iac: Vigor in ER is 40 and 60
[1:08:09] madmanPecos: i usually have 32 vigor in ds3 but i always get at least 55 in elden ring
[1:08:09] iatemypet2: what's the more valuable stat, defense or absorption?
[1:08:17] Sean_J: hello twitch chat and gino
[1:08:18] madmanPecos: @kastrels 40 is too low
[1:08:18] siilk13: chunk yeah
[1:08:18] jacob_hyde: I heard ds2 is good but which one is better ds2 or 3
[1:08:20] KoenigOne: looking at your sword feels like looking at the sun ginoYEP
[1:08:26] MiroslavSmiley: @jacob_hyde 3
[1:08:28] Flyntdefault447: Ds3 never really did let you feel tanky

[1:08:34] Nararawr: KEK
[1:08:35] madmanPecos: @jacob_hyde 3
[1:08:35] KoenigOne: OMEGALUL
[1:08:36] c10dub: I go about 40 vig elden
[1:08:42] kastrels: @madmanPecos its fine for me, it doesnt feel like a huge difference between 40 and 60
[1:08:44] iatemypet2: @jacob_hyde 3
[1:08:51] SilentRebel217: elden ring you gat so many levels though
[1:08:52] iatemypet2: and 1 and DeS Kappa
[1:09:03] mintslice95: @torzxy do you mean no dodge not hit? Cause just no dodge is definitely possible
[1:09:03] REFLECTlONS: @jacob_hyde ds3 has better bosses and less unfair shit but ds2 has the most replay value and build variety imo
[1:09:07] Haosfortum11: this fight seems like fire giant phase 2
[1:09:22] korayuh_: hey Gino do you like playing these games more casually or competitively (challenge runs / tournaments)

[1:11:49] trompiesteopp: infinite rats
[1:11:57] madmanPecos: prisoner's chain is more useful in this game instead of radagon's soreseal in ER
[1:12:05] Sean_J: lol siegward is like that one passive aggressive guy at work that says things out loud around people so they get help without asking directly
[1:12:07] Aevee: let him solve that one
[1:12:10] Aevee: no spoilers
[1:12:29] iatemypet2: funfact, that was actually a cut interaction from DS1, it was supposed to happen in Duke's Archives in the prison
[1:12:30] torzxy: do u think a elden ring no dodge run is possible and if so would u attempt it
[1:12:36] Thenastyraven: @Sean_J "If only someone could do that for me" LuL surely never heard that one before
[1:12:44] Sean_J: @Thenastyraven lol
[1:13:16] REFLECTlONS: insane loot

[1:15:09] croompley: i was always wondering how lothric knights make their swords white, now i know
[1:15:12] madmanPecos: pyromancies are fun in this game
[1:15:17] tenshin2002: I remember dying here a few times
[1:15:24] iatemypet2: y bully forgs
[1:15:34] indianbaj: all 3 sorciers incants and pyro is good in er
[1:15:38] Sean_J: you could prob do a mage build with heavy armor and do no dodge that way yeah
