[2:01:28] SwyfteWinter: According to Encyclopædia Brittanica polar bears are carnivores
[2:01:33] stellar_sorcerer: Bears will eat more or less anything, including garbage
[2:01:49] stellar_sorcerer: Polar bears are carnivores because there's not much vegetation where they live

[2:02:18] SwyfteWinter: Even despite knowing cats are carnivores, people still bulk out cat food with wheat :/ Which sucks because my cat is allergic to wheat
[2:02:25] zectifin: yeah like cats are obligate carnivores cus they cant make their own taurine and have to get it from meat. we on the other hand make our own. if cats don't get it they'll go blind and eventually die.
[2:03:08] LysanderPhoenixBorne: Wikipedia say faculative carnivore, mesocarnivore and omnivore all mean the same thing
[2:03:09] SketchThisWave: obligate means "has to"
[2:03:26] zectifin: ok a carnivore thrives on meat while an obligate HAS to have meat
[2:03:34] stellar_sorcerer: Omnivore is an animal that can digest both plant and animal matter
[2:03:37] mangobaggins: It comes down to the difference between possibility and actual behavior.
