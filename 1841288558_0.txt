[2:37:39] Benersan: Is Diablo 4 even good? I know nothing about it other than server issues early on
[2:38:18] FluffehZ: in a casual way, it's pretty good
[2:38:46] FluffehZ: you can get a good amount of gametime in it with just one character

[2:39:02] Benersan: Any dirty live service stuff? Immortal was really succesful after all
[2:39:19] FluffehZ: Not yet....
[2:39:51] LysanderPhoenixBorne: All the reviews have been positive, except for the $25 cosmetics that came out post launch. I don't care how good it is, I ain't giving Activision Blizzard my time of day anymore
[2:41:22] Benersan: That's pretty based. Still I'm happy for people who like them
[2:41:31] Benersan: But always remember, pirating is the correct way to boycott

[2:42:09] LysanderPhoenixBorne: Fair, but I never really got into the previous games either.
[2:42:48] Benersan: Never tried them. On the list
[2:48:58] Benersan: Whatever happened to dread hunger?
[2:50:46] LysanderPhoenixBorne: I think they changed one of the maps significantly to the point it might as well have been a new map and should have kept the old one too, which people weren't happy about. Then they had a long period without updating it.
