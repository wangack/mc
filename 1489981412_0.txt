[0:35:54] MstPanda: what ilvl is waffle at?
[0:36:07] mitsuki_11: that was real disappointing for max, was it an issue with his DRS so he just gave up? or was it actual loss of power?

[0:41:42] Dagmoo: @nevadaha peepoPat
[0:41:48] renjiii: how do you put the icon under the boss to show what direction he is facing ?
[0:41:53] NevaDaha: @Dagmoo PETTHEPEEPO
[0:42:01] renjiii: anyone knows ?
[0:42:08] loafabreadly: Whats the plan for after Lost Ark chat?
[0:42:10] Fufcia: @renjiii it was added in patch 2 days ago
[0:42:14] Nexhunter: yep default
[0:42:15] Hazno: yeah, enabled by default with new update
[0:42:23] renjiii: oh nice
[0:42:26] renjiii: thanks
[0:42:52] HolyLlamalord: get lucky
[0:42:53] Nexhunter: you catch up this way
[0:42:55] CrackaBTW: swipe lol
[0:42:56] Warkless: We could boost you
[0:42:56] AtheonBarcota: swipe
[0:42:58] Nnnxia: rmt KEKW
[0:42:59] gnomeseleven: widePepeLaugh 1
[0:43:03] TripleCakes: swipe swipe
[0:43:08] Nexhunter: your alts feed into the main to catch up
[0:43:11] Nexhunter: and my alts are shit KEKW
[0:43:12] Grizzlybooey: vikis Normal should only be 1430
[0:43:18] Face_32: ilvl is the last thing you should boost tho. Gems, tripods and engravings give way more dmg
[0:43:21] Argentwingss: just swipe right?
[0:43:24] Gelil: Just become a tomato 5Head
[0:43:24] Nexhunter: i only have one and that a lopang worker
[0:43:28] Warkless: i "only" have 5 1370 alts
[0:43:29] Nexhunter: cause my silver generating sucks
[0:43:32] Warkless: wait Susge
[0:43:49] renjiii: i cant get passed 800 sadge
[0:44:11] Assure__: 1340 alts are somewhat easy atm, just time consuming, 1370 is pain for a lot of alts though. It slows down your main a lot imo, if you want to stay up to date with content to be released
[0:44:11] Moobot: You can sub to Waffle by clicking this neat link -> twitch.tv/giantwaffle/subscribe
[0:44:52] Hazno: getting alts to 1370 with the stronghold research and honing books is fairly easy, unless you only want to use bound mats

[0:45:17] celadriel23: skyrocketing price....afternoon delight?
[0:45:26] Archelonde: its definately cheaper to just make them at the stronghold
[0:45:39] celadriel23: you have to have mats
[0:45:41] Hazno: price of destruction stones in your region atm? @Giantwaffle
[0:45:47] celadriel23: but you can get mats w/ the farm thing
[0:45:54] Hazno: 18?!

[0:46:35] PuppyHavoc: its cheaper to make if you dont factor in the time and life energy used to gather the mats so you can make a profit from seeling em
[0:46:42] Venxuri: my mental is down the drain, spent 3h waiting for a group to form for Gate 1, people were so toxic it died right after killing first boss
[0:46:44] Assure__: It's cheaper to craft yourself, while not by a lot, I do earn around 600-800 gold per 20 Icraft
[0:46:45] PuppyHavoc: u also have a chance to crit the craft

[1:01:46] obscure_13: @Assure__ i feel like thats pretty good tbh
[1:02:04] BobTaco21: No sleep for waffle tonight
[1:02:10] Im_Axz: Normal valtan doesn't deal too much damage so you can only focus on main mechanics
[1:03:04] Im_Axz: That's going to be 90% of the deaths pepeLaugh
[1:03:19] Assure__: @Assure__ Yeah, I think it was pretty good as well, very good fight, but a lot of small things that needs ironing out before you can get the kill.
[1:03:44] SaltyLuigiKart8: is valtan pug able?
[1:04:15] ilove2derp: @SaltyLuigiKart8 did it yesterday NM no supports

[1:12:14] obscure_13: Sadge not 1415 yet im appart of sup shortage
[1:12:18] Nexhunter: maybe @Giantwaffle you should get your god dang support leveled up sodaMad
[1:12:34] Neonnimbus: I honestly doubt having a 3rd support class would fix the end game support shortage. Most would end making her as an alt
[1:12:57] Nexhunter: you gotta get to 1445 that were need supports KEKW
[1:13:03] obscure_13: @Neonnimbus i agree with that
[1:13:08] Fufcia: AYAYA

[1:13:42] Gelil: DPS Paladins? PauseChamp
[1:13:43] HostileLogOut: artist is apprently a crap support role. compared to bard and paladins
[1:13:50] Nexhunter: artist was crap pre patch
[1:13:52] Mandorake: *doubt*
[1:13:52] AIex_0: wasn't it because you had to pickup the artist hp orbs before
[1:13:57] Nexhunter: post patch it better
[1:13:59] AIex_0: artist is fine now
[1:14:05] Assure__: Saint said he never cared what supports he had in hell mode, but for kakul he really felt like paladin was needed
[1:14:10] Xev_00: NOTED so bard best in NA
[1:14:14] Nexhunter: @AIex_0 yep was all about the orb pickup
[1:14:17] PureSpider: just be decent lewSmile
[1:14:28] Proxzyn: KEKW @G4mb1txx
[1:14:41] Venxuri: I think its because paladins have 100% buff uptimes since tight dps checks in hell, maybe
[1:15:05] CrackaBTW: i wnet thru stack of 50 destro nades
[1:15:10] NolungsTV: ive done like 5 hours of HM prog like 200 desto bombs
[1:15:13] Nexhunter: if you gotta timestop you are fucked

[1:17:51] Oztington: its scary
[1:18:04] Oztington: if ppl are having issues with normal
[1:18:11] HostileLogOut: i mean people struggled on Argos alot to. before they finally killed it
[1:18:28] Assure__: It's a learning process we haven't had before in the game, it'll most likely be the same for the consecutive raids we'll get
[1:18:30] Oztington: asmon didnt beat it
[1:18:34] SkaiOnTv: asmon wasnt able to do it

[1:18:54] ayaya_prime: His setup is shit and refuses to use battle items
[1:18:56] resku89: ilevel doesnt matter when you fall off LUL
[1:18:57] sogerr: asmon was trolling, he was avoiding doing mechanics
[1:18:59] HostileLogOut: he prob doesn't know how to play lol.
[1:19:00] FearYang: there is these things called mechanics
[1:19:00] Felipe_sl15: shit engravings
[1:19:09] Assure__: Item level doesn't matter, he doesn't really care about mechanics from the looks of it
[1:19:13] Oztington: he was hoping his gearscore would be enough to carry him
[1:19:14] Mandorake: asmon is a wow player so he kinda bad by default
[1:19:16] CrackaBTW: yes
[1:19:29] HostileLogOut: if u have 3 or 4x engrave your fine lol.
[1:19:31] Kotthuet: That's what happens when you dont believe in mechanics.

[1:26:48] Oztington: PepeLaugh
[1:26:59] SlyPoooper: @Venxuri NODDERS
[1:27:37] itzSimondr98: Pretty sure people that hit 1415 towards this week can do Valtan hardmode next week NODDERS
[1:27:41] Astrophysics288: the person who stays alive the most is best suited for raid leader
[1:28:10] itzSimondr98: If the raid leader dies he just gives the leader away NODDERS
[1:28:12] Mandorake: @Giantwaffle Got 2 alts to 1370 yesterday and destroyer to 1355
[1:28:33] Proxzyn: definitely need someone that is comfortable with multitasking, and doesnt get flustered with it
[1:28:48] AtheonBarcota: Thought I'd check on support accessories...200k per piece :(
[1:29:01] Oztington: dunno if stripes are very in
[1:29:07] Killsauce: yea buying relic accessories is not the play right now. id wait a few weeks AtheonBarcota
[1:29:10] Neonnimbus: I think most people only park alts at 1325 for classes they wanna play but are playing more than 6 classes
[1:29:18] TwinMG: I opened my random gold card packs yesterday and I got the light of salvation set complete, I only had 2 in the set before
[1:29:20] Killsauce: truuue
[1:29:27] Neonnimbus: you wanna park alts at 1340 if you actively play them
[1:29:32] celadriel23: i should try to get a relic stone on my main for the HP increase
[1:29:37] AtheonBarcota: @Killsauce Agreed but I was just curious and it is nuts
[1:29:39] celadriel23: im not going to bother w/ relic acces suntil i get to 1445
[1:29:59] Killsauce: everyone wants more supports and then runs up the price on them Sadge

[1:33:09] NexX_____: @Fufcia thanks
[1:33:21] Nostalgic_am: Why not do all 3 in Feiton?
[1:33:42] Blasian__: @Nostalgic_am third one in feiton is 3 leap and longer
[1:33:46] Triz08: 3rd in feiton is 1 gleap less and a long run
[1:34:03] Oztington: feiton last one isnt time efficient
[1:34:04] Blasian__: shushire/hope and 2x feiton is the speed run leaps
[1:34:15] Mandorake: I like Hope Island
[1:34:58] Felipe_sl15: why is it bad?
[1:35:02] Mandorake: its slow
[1:35:03] Felipe_sl15: :(
[1:35:03] Triz08: i do that daily
[1:35:23] TorchOSRS: its worht on main
[1:35:25] Triz08: 5 gleaps is money in the bank
[1:35:25] Blasian__: just slower. if you have a bunch of alts to log in daily hypno, kalhertz, etc are just too long
[1:35:27] caeno_o: its 1 extra per day - its worth
[1:35:29] Mandorake: you need it for a ship though
[1:35:32] itzSimondr98: Dont do hypno unless u have rested insta KEKW
[1:35:46] obscure_13: i did it for the rep
[1:35:57] Mandorake: i use instans on allakir
[1:36:00] Blasian__: 1 hypno you can run through 2-3 alts dailyx2 and guild donation
[1:36:08] itzSimondr98: I wouldn't do hypno unless its rested and I had an insta una NODDERS
[1:36:09] Uavirtue: Where Unsolved Kinsera
[1:36:15] Uavirtue: Best 3
[1:36:19] HostileLogOut: i wish they would allow us to like use all our bonus for chaos and guardian raids all at once. so like 5x bonus +2 daily would concentrate it by 7x.
[1:36:32] Fufcia: I play 21:9 on 27" 16:9 and it's not bad
[1:36:32] NexX_____: playing sorc or gunslinger sucks without UW
[1:37:24] Uavirtue: @giantwaffle did u try destroyer 960 rn hella fun
[1:37:24] omar_i_: can you capture that on a side like your camera Waffle?
[1:37:49] itzSimondr98: This aint even the rough part widePepeLaugh
[1:37:56] ecnerw4l: @giantwaffle whats that application you used to mute lost ark?

[1:38:05] ayaya_prime: like picture in picture
[1:38:06] HostileLogOut: we are only getting a powerpass every second character right?
[1:38:22] Fearthewatson: damage reduction
[1:38:23] itzSimondr98: Balthor = immune NODDERS
[1:38:24] ecnerw4l: oh really. it looks so different. is that cuz win11?
[1:38:34] itzSimondr98: correct
[1:38:35] akdk29142: balthor can ignore insta death mechanics
[1:38:42] THEgoodCOW: if you hav the balthor you dont need the blue orbs
[1:38:51] Fearthewatson: balthor allows you to ingore orbs
[1:38:55] THEgoodCOW: 130 bar
[1:38:56] Fearthewatson: you do it at like 133 bars
[1:38:57] MellowKoNeko: stoopz does it on 130 bar
[1:38:58] SinfulOnline: At 130 bars
[1:38:59] Venxuri: x130
[1:39:01] itzSimondr98: 131, 16
[1:39:05] SinfulOnline: Buff lasts 30s
[1:39:05] akdk29142: 132-130 bar
[1:39:11] SinfulOnline: So doesn't need to be THAT timed
[1:39:12] itzSimondr98: or like 131 / 17 NODDERS
[1:39:14] MellowKoNeko: around 128 is when the mech happens
[1:39:22] MellowKoNeko: but the buff is long
[1:39:24] sogerr: there is a cheat sheet for what to do on each bar
[1:39:28] akdk29142: 30 sec
[1:39:31] SinfulOnline: 30 sec
[1:39:36] MistaBleak: no
[1:39:38] THEgoodCOW: no
[1:39:39] Dibbsu: No they explode if you do
[1:39:39] itzSimondr98: Thats not the hard part widePepeLaugh
[1:39:47] Slymph: No, chat dont last that long widePepeLaugh
[1:39:54] Fearthewatson: you dont take out pillars untill he removes the floor
[1:39:57] akdk29142: you can use timestop if you don't have time to hide behind pillar
[1:40:07] Fearthewatson: 50 bars
[1:40:13] akdk29142: however you must avoid red zone
[1:40:17] sogerr: 15 to 50
[1:41:00] Dibbsu: That part it doesn't matter about towers cause they explode after anyways

[1:41:26] itzSimondr98: pepeLaugh fun part
[1:41:56] itzSimondr98: Luckily you have heavy armor for this
[1:42:08] omar_i_: 70 bard Prayge
[1:42:27] perciculum: COunter
[1:42:27] Venxuri: counter
[1:42:30] Fearthewatson: grab
[1:42:30] mrchadiuss: doesnt really natter with wipe mechs KEKW
[1:42:32] itzSimondr98: I mean I had a grudge DB that got oneshot without getting knocked off OMEGALUL
[1:42:32] Dibbsu: Susge  Heavy armor abuser
[1:42:35] Venxuri: ghost is x15
[1:42:38] CrackaBTW: no not yet
[1:42:39] akdk29142: no ghost is at 15bar
[1:42:41] sogerr: after this cutscene you count to 3 and counter
[1:42:44] mrchadiuss: this isnt ghost
[1:42:46] Fearthewatson: you wait like 3 seconds then counter for the grab
[1:42:47] SinfulOnline: It's not hard at all. Count to 3.
[1:42:57] itzSimondr98: No
[1:42:58] mrchadiuss: YEP
[1:43:02] CrackaBTW: once you kill his entire health bar he respawns for the ghost phase with 40 bars
[1:43:04] SinfulOnline: Yes, hard wipe if you fail it
[1:43:07] Fearthewatson: if you dont counter grab he wipes
[1:43:09] wraith2288: its def a wipe
[1:43:10] itzSimondr98: Or.. the one after the cutscene, yes
[1:43:19] mrchadiuss: YEP YEP
[1:43:26] perciculum: Not a wipe but the follow up counters + charge are even ahrder to interrupt.
[1:43:35] itzSimondr98: He also has a counter which you NEED to counter the 3rd or its wipe
[1:43:48] Fearthewatson: you need a min of six to survive to ghost phase
[1:43:55] perciculum: 3 counters is a random mechanic
[1:43:55] akdk29142: if you fail the counter, he will grab player infront of him, and if someone didn't got grabbed then he does another counter mechanic until all players are grabbed or someone does the counter right
[1:43:58] Venxuri: arena break
[1:44:10] HostileLogOut: u dont need a minimum lol. u can solo Valtan
[1:44:14] Venxuri: x35~~
[1:44:17] itzSimondr98: If you have a gunlancer or wardancer you only need 2 KEKW
[1:44:25] Fearthewatson: not at current ilvl you cant solo
[1:44:30] Fearthewatson: hard
[1:44:31] perciculum: everytime his stagger bar get locked, it is the next mechanic.
[1:44:36] perciculum: *gets
[1:44:43] HostileLogOut: no but u can solo which means u can do all counter solo.
[1:44:54] Proxzyn: oh, it's Titan from FF14 KEKW
[1:45:02] Venxuri: sly [*]
[1:45:04] itzSimondr98: You wanna get 2 pillars witht hat at this point
[1:45:09] Dibbsu: KEKW Nex got knocked off
[1:45:13] SlyPoooper: I died before falling EZ
[1:45:16] zsdzsf: I did 10 hours of valtan yesterday didn't make it :D
[1:45:18] SlyPoooper: still not like nex
[1:45:24] perciculum: yes
[1:45:24] akdk29142: yep
[1:45:25] itzSimondr98: YEP
[1:45:25] Fearthewatson: yes
[1:45:25] MellowKoNeko: yes
[1:45:34] akdk29142: but not necessary
[1:45:54] HostileLogOut: its like 0.5 second in that roar + charge u can i believe
[1:46:02] perciculum: after the 2nd stomp you can counter
[1:46:03] itzSimondr98: Its sketchy to counter it as the red bar comes. better to look at his ''glow''
[1:46:03] celadriel23: only 305 million health left lol
[1:46:08] perciculum: 15 bars
[1:46:10] akdk29142: 15 -> 40
[1:46:11] perciculum: resets to 40
[1:46:30] Fearthewatson: but he doesnt move from middle after ghoest phase
[1:46:30] FearYang: looks fun af
[1:46:37] Fufcia: ppHop
[1:46:43] i_W4tCH_i: Why is his chat cut in half?
[1:46:45] Venxuri: what ilvl is Xev on his SH?
[1:46:46] nxusr: ppHop
[1:46:53] akdk29142: most groups ignore balls, just use balthor
[1:47:00] Fufcia: @i_W4tCH_i he is playing at 21:9 but streaming at 16:9
[1:47:02] ayaya_prime: 1445 on the SH
[1:47:12] wraith2288: its the same as normal
[1:47:18] HostileLogOut: same mechanics. just less hp and damage i believe.
[1:47:21] HostileLogOut: and some new mechanics
[1:47:21] perciculum: Yeah only for hell mode you need to do the orb mechanic.
[1:47:24] mrchadiuss: what is with hard mode ? more hp ?
[1:47:24] i_W4tCH_i: @i_W4tCH_i Aaah got ya thanks!
[1:47:25] MellowKoNeko: there doing the method where you take out the armor stacks early with corrosive and destruction combo
[1:47:27] bimmyneuron: Is this Diablo 4?
[1:47:29] itzSimondr98: hard mode and normal mode is the same, except a bit more ghosts on hardmode
[1:47:41] Blasian__: after the tower stagger you throw 1 corrosive and 7 destruct. then weakpoint skills, not really dps
[1:48:02] Dibbsu: Cockroach run
[1:48:05] HostileLogOut: that running animation is so ugly lol
[1:48:06] Dibbsu: Trueeee
[1:48:09] Venxuri: cockroach
[1:48:12] perciculum: Some of Valtan's pattern push you instead of staggering in hardmode
[1:48:32] NexX_____: i hate the look of the SH in demon moode
[1:48:39] Dibbsu: Anya's like monkaS face is so funny
[1:48:52] wraith2288: have 2 break 2 columns
[1:48:53] perciculum: they forgot
[1:48:58] mrchadiuss: KEKW
[1:48:58] MellowKoNeko: that was hella late
[1:48:59] Dibbsu: They used it late
[1:49:00] itzSimondr98: pepeLaugh to late
[1:49:03] HostileLogOut: way to late
[1:49:03] Moobot: You can find Waffle's Youtube channel here - https://youtube.com/giantwaffle
[1:49:04] EmVvVv: One piece tonight PogChamp
[1:49:09] Venxuri: Xev fucked up pepeLaugh
[1:49:11] Blasian__: he aimed it away from party 2l ol
[1:49:12] wraith2288: not invincible
[1:49:14] itzSimondr98: 30 sec ish
[1:49:15] mrchadiuss: super long
[1:49:15] Fearthewatson: 30
[1:49:15] Catsanova: its like 30s
[1:49:15] wraith2288: just take reduced dmg
[1:49:18] akdk29142: the biggest differencs between hard and normal is random patterns that stiffens younin normal becomes knockoff in hard
[1:49:20] narutomanic: narutomanic subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 21 months! 
[1:49:20] omar_i_: Waffle is Valtan normal mode very tough to do?
[1:49:25] mrchadiuss: YEP
[1:49:28] itzSimondr98: YEP
[1:49:29] MellowKoNeko: yeah the animation takes a bit
[1:49:33] Catsanova: I cast it on 130 every time
[1:49:36] Catsanova: and it lasts
[1:49:48] sogerr: normal and hard have the same mechanics anyway
[1:49:56] itzSimondr98: ^
[1:50:12] Dibbsu: I think I'm going get some snacks for tonight cause we got argos and valtan to do.
[1:50:12] Venxuri: Nex pepeLaugh
[1:50:15] akdk29142: the biggest difference between hard and normal is random patterns that stiffens you in normal becomes knockoff in hard
[1:50:23] Fearthewatson: its jsut more damage mostly
[1:50:28] Fearthewatson: between hard
[1:50:31] Fearthewatson: and normal
[1:50:34] perciculum: yes
[1:50:39] Venxuri: idk what the dmg difference is too, but hard hurts af
[1:50:40] Shadeflame1911: Why is waffle watching Xev and not doing himself? Is he doing it later?
[1:50:51] caeno_o: boss didn't hit the pillar
[1:50:52] SlyPoooper: nex fucked us again
[1:50:57] Venxuri: fucked up charge
[1:51:00] mrchadiuss: pepeLaugh
[1:51:03] itzSimondr98: SlyPoooper kick nex widePepeLaugh
[1:51:10] Proxzyn: Nex widePepeLaugh
[1:51:11] Catsanova: target is random
[1:51:18] itzSimondr98: Target is random indeed NODDERS
[1:51:18] MellowKoNeko: random so they all stack
[1:51:26] akdk29142: will you do valtan today?
[1:51:31] MellowKoNeko: no
[1:51:37] DeadlyBrother: goal is to break armor
[1:51:37] MellowKoNeko: it lets u destroy his armor
[1:51:42] itzSimondr98: You want to take the pillars out to destroy his armos
[1:51:44] itzSimondr98: armor
[1:51:47] Blasian__: pillar staggers him so you can throw bombs to break armor
[1:51:50] wraith2288: columns are the things with orbs
[1:51:53] Blasian__: also drops the blue orbs if you dont cheese
[1:51:57] mrchadiuss: YEP
[1:52:02] perciculum: no 2 on both
[1:52:07] ayaya_prime: It's always 2
[1:52:12] wraith2288: its the same
[1:52:14] Venxuri: thats hardmode, he has 2
[1:52:15] perciculum: later on ghost phase he has 4 stack on normal and 6 on hard
[1:52:16] Shadeflame1911: If he goes lower than 130 bars, he doesn't do anymore charges, so you have the rest of the combat with his armor stacks
[1:52:17] mrchadiuss: 4 would be giga hard
[1:52:26] Venxuri: silence on counter
[1:52:29] publicgift_: anyone else not able to connect to NA West?
[1:52:38] boolgogiking: US West is down :(
[1:52:46] AsianAgPhoenix: AsianAgPhoenix subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 8 months! 
[1:52:48] akdk29142: it was 8 but got nerfed in early kr release LUL
[1:52:48] boolgogiking: all
[1:52:54] itzSimondr98: I highly recommend running in circles for the axe drop mech NODDERS
[1:52:54] tinymeteor: NA West is down, with even more extended maintenance to 1:35 Pacific
[1:52:55] Fearthewatson: sadly all
[1:52:56] MellowKoNeko: charge into wall + destruction spam while he is stunned
[1:52:57] perciculum: you can use the cheat sheet i created on maxroll if you want :P
[1:53:02] Balafore: All
[1:53:05] Balafore: Been down all morning
[1:53:07] DeadlyBrother: 8 is hell mode now
[1:53:07] Archelonde: its been down for like 6 hours already
[1:53:14] publicgift_: wtf amazon
[1:53:22] Proxzyn: same. i learn by doing
[1:53:24] RaunaPls: same for me KEKW
[1:53:36] obscure_13: bot purge would be so good
[1:53:41] akdk29142: kr rule is someone throw corrosion when valtan is charging and others throw destruction after valtan hits
[1:53:53] AceBlizzardz: when he hits the walls that's when you use destruction bombs and weak point to destroy armor
[1:53:53] Moobot: New here? Welcome! You can usually catch Waffle Mon-Sat at ~1400 UTC. Feel free to hang out in chat before the stream and/or join the !discord. waffleEgg
[1:53:55] NexX_____: yeah thats cool but people are so impatient they fucking scream at you for doing 1 thing wrong
[1:54:02] perciculum: that is the correct way of using corro and destruction.
[1:54:09] 4rakthis: satisfactory update 6!!
[1:54:19] MellowKoNeko: pubs almost never do this and just brute force lol
[1:54:38] Tenkaichi500: sheesh. Toronto got this crazy hail storm going on. just lost power waffleBlind
[1:54:39] DeadlyBrother: pubs will do this if they don't outgear it
[1:54:40] akdk29142: corrosion can be throwed before valtan crashes
[1:54:46] neuad: Satisfactory is so much fun, but it needs some sort of help with mass building factories. Maybe not full blueprints and robots like factorio. . .but something
[1:55:01] MellowKoNeko: corrosion after initial spin
[1:55:06] MellowKoNeko: 25sec duration
[1:55:14] Blasian__: corrosion lasts 20s so you can throw during the charge windup
[1:55:26] Proxzyn: NOTED
[1:55:37] Blasian__: normal corrosion is 20s, splendid is longer
[1:55:47] caeno_o: yes
[1:55:47] Catsanova: Correct
[1:55:49] akdk29142: YEP
[1:55:51] Wetware: @Tenkaichi500 Where are you? I'm in mid town, nothing here yet. Got a storm alert on my phone though
[1:55:56] caeno_o: break his armor
[1:55:57] DeadlyBrother: armor
[1:55:58] akdk29142: armor
[1:56:01] MellowKoNeko: yeah, corrosion adds weakpoint to weakpoint dmg
[1:56:08] bertsu02: gives +1 to weakpoint dmg
[1:56:09] Fearthewatson: valtun has very high defense and you need like 40 weak point
[1:56:14] perciculum: The charge animation starts once he stomps with his fist on the ground. After the first stomp throw corrosion. After the 3rd stomp you dodge and throw destruction.
[1:56:23] Tenkaichi500: @wetware Etobicoke
[1:56:31] RuostePuu: Does weak point skills work vs him
[1:56:33] Wetware: Ah, it's on its way here then
[1:56:34] 89Puppies: corrosión adds a weak point bonus to each destruction thereafter. usually one support does it
[1:56:40] perciculum: @RuostePuu yes
[1:56:47] akdk29142: balthor ignorse both
[1:56:50] Tenkaichi500: @wetware stay safe homie
[1:56:55] perciculum: yep
[1:56:57] akdk29142: YEP
[1:56:57] Fearthewatson: yes
[1:57:22] perciculum: balthor makes you push immune, prevents some wipe skills and reduces the damage you take by 50%.
[1:57:22] Moobot: You can sub to Waffle by clicking this neat link -> twitch.tv/giantwaffle/subscribe
[1:57:30] Catsanova: 85 is first arena destruction

[1:58:23] Fufcia: it doesnt one tap. it was 62k dmg and he was low on health
[1:58:26] Fearthewatson: the pizza is better to get a bit close cause narrow exit
[1:59:00] ピッザダディ: No revives in Valtan?
[1:59:01] xCC___: you could get a UPS too
[1:59:07] itzSimondr98: could also be stopwatched later on in yellow zone Fearthewatson NODDERS
[1:59:23] Catsanova: FYI for Balthorr it doesn't always go exactly on your mouse cursor so give the raid a heads up when you cast
[1:59:25] akdk29142: yes
[1:59:26] 89Puppies: yup
[1:59:32] Dibbsu: 3

[1:59:57] Balafore: My UPS can run my computer, 2 monitors, a desk lamp, and my router for 8hrs
[2:00:28] Fearthewatson: the yell is a kill
[2:00:39] Catsanova: I'm fairly sure that's a random attack
[2:00:48] bertsu02: 65 is counter 35 another area break
[2:00:51] akdk29142: this is grab pattern, he put his one hand up and grabs player infront of him
[2:00:59] Mandorake: @Balafore but not your fridge
[2:01:01] Fearthewatson: @Giantwaffle if you get hit by yellow and there is not edge of stage its and instand knock off
[2:01:02] itzSimondr98: its random
[2:01:06] MellowKoNeko: green orbs + counter is one of the most annoying ones aside from silence counter
[2:01:11] akdk29142: then he launches the grabbed player with yellow zone
[2:01:19] akdk29142: earlier
[2:01:37] MellowKoNeko: the one with exploding green orbs until u grab them all

[2:01:38] Catsanova: We never saw the silence counter on normal
[2:01:52] Venxuri: because its a hardmode mechanic
[2:01:53] itzSimondr98: 4 persons have to get orbs while 1 counters
[2:01:55] Fearthewatson: the stagger check wipe is annoying
[2:02:02] Mandorake: i think silence counter is only hardmode
[2:02:10] Catsanova: ah didn't know that @Venxuri
[2:02:15] Venxuri: np
[2:02:19] itzSimondr98: Silence is in normal as well
[2:02:30] akdk29142: this is silence counter
