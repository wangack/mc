[0:17:30] Sunbart: I got my first Pfizer shot yesterday - I feel fine, just a sore arm, but don't tell my employer :D
[0:17:39] Kxtaclysm: it is a small percentage, however i do know someone who sadly lost their mum from taking their first vaccination
[0:17:44] Aerafae: Transfeminine HRT increases blood clots
[0:17:46] EsotericFish: The risk of blood clots is exceptionally low, but if you get the clot it's a 25% chance of death
[0:17:47] Aerafae: also nicotine
[0:17:50] capitol86: One of the first people investigated was a 50 year old man so... no birth control pills involved :P
[0:17:50] smellytommy4444: oh I forgot boba actually knew medical stuff
[0:17:52] killerzwerg123: i got Atrsa First and Biontech/P-fizer second
[0:17:57] LilWarmSnowflake: It's usually the 2nd one that knock you off your feet Sunbart
[0:17:58] Jambobinator: Is Dunc on auto pilot jumping about on blocks
[0:18:00] TheGrahame: it worked out that like 40,000,000 had the vaccine and out of that 8 people had a blot clot.... and cause they started with the old people yh, there's nothing confirming such
[0:18:01] mattypea: I think the risk group was largely women in their 40s from what I remember
[0:18:02] Dorren_: Boba sounds more articulate today
[0:18:02] the_greatest_moose: it was mostly women with blood clots
[0:18:04] warpcraft: Boba smrt

[0:18:33] ReChampJ: I heard that all 6 people who had clotting were women between the age of 18-40. I read it on reddit so it must be true.
[0:18:33] TyrsHTML: i was sick for 2 days after my second pfizer shot
[0:18:35] BurnoodTakedown: I get swelling in the legs from too many burgies
[0:18:41] 4FoxSake: it was more likely in women but not necessarily Estrogen linked (though likely hormone linked) but yes very rare
[0:18:43] Cakesmith: Australia's rollout of the vaccine has been abysmal

[0:19:17] PunNotFound: But how have you bee-n since last stream?
[0:19:18] Scaedura: Frozen_Mew they just don't test shit seriously on women, a lot of women afterwards have noted that it has effected their period and yet there's been no research on it, would be nice of the medical world started to give a shit about women's bodies
