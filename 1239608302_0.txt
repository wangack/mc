[0:19:53] officialzip: xp bottles at least
[0:19:54] Warkless: trade cleric for xp bottles
[0:20:06] mechoriet: useful to tell if the ServerThread is getting overloaded above 50ms which results in lag
[0:20:08] QuazarSamCoupe: Cheer100 Great to see more Minecraft! I started watching you many, many. many years ago when you were making big circular moonbases in Minecraft...
[0:20:28] IamWambo_: I like the idea of no personal xp farms and just the community ones
[0:20:29] xDIGIT84: essentials should have shop signs built in, as well as xp signs. at least it was there back in 2014 don't know why they would have removed them

[0:22:47] skokpo: I remember playing in a server like that
[0:22:56] Deathu: then maybe the best option waffle is to have 3 main xp farms 1 in the nether 1 in the overwolrd and 1 in the end (where every world is on another thread so shouldnt lag) or that
[0:23:00] Lazdrin: Oh that's a cool idea
[0:23:07] gamerdudeisa: someone put the server ip in chat
[0:23:12] Deathu: omg yes personal 300x300 worlds i'd love that

[2:08:26] ZyrnUwU: Lush cave with skybox :)
[2:08:30] Miestro: Yo there's an AMAZING cave near spawn that's under one of the mountains to the east
[2:08:34] GarlicJelly: @Deepcast He did and he doesn't care about it
[2:08:45] GarlicJelly: @Deepcast He's kinda done with Icarus
[2:08:48] Miestro: someone built an outlook over it
[2:08:59] DeadeyeWolff: Build a home inside that cave would be nice
[2:09:01] byob7: Its 99 levels
[2:09:06] Fronku: I managed to get the plugin that simulates 100+ people on the server working, server is running on a 5950x instance running pufferfish-purpur and I'm getting 20 tps, someone is doing something on the server 100%
[2:09:11] Archaegeo: stat reset supposedly coming and will cost exotics to do
[2:09:26] GarlicJelly: Sage?
[2:09:32] BlackdaStar: BlackdaStar subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 8 months, currently on a 8 month streak! waffleH
[2:09:42] Miestro: does it simulate 100 people spread out on the server Fronku ? or all in the same area
[2:09:46] Scopenhagen: is it sadge or sadge?
[2:09:50] D_roi_D: why is server vanilla out of curiosity?
[2:10:14] GarlicJelly: @D_roi_D Because of the new caves update
[2:10:22] yonikasz2: How do you get netherite
[2:10:26] Kaomie: "Fully" "released"
[2:10:27] Fronku: @Miestro spread, but it's not truly human behavior, it just spawns a bunch of ai and they mine blocks in a specific interval
[2:10:33] D_roi_D: cool thanks
[2:11:06] Miestro: is there a reason to use coal over charcoal? I've always wondered
[2:11:08] Bearded__Wonder: you can be like quake champions and just be in early access for 5+ years
[2:11:17] tripwires: don't forget to implement NFT's in that game to become massively popular on social media
[2:11:18] soe_frost: Imagine one creeper near all those chests LUL
[2:11:26] 0rangelight: You should make a game like Forza Horizon but you bike like Zwift
[2:11:29] Kaomie: Creepers are off I thought
[2:11:32] MSUdude: @soe_frost I was thinking the same things haha
[2:11:32] zedvawn: @Miestro coal is easy to get. You have to make charcoal out of a smelting process
[2:11:43] FarmPeaches_FreePalestine: 14 sold
[2:11:46] Aoewin: millions in PR damage for what.. 400 bucks?
[2:11:47] Chackler: pepeLaugh
[2:11:47] LastSajin: Wasnt even a launch lol
[2:11:55] phragment: nft = scam
[2:11:57] Apparentthreat: Kaomie mob griefing on to allow villager breeding
[2:11:59] FauxNoodel: @Giantwaffle The nft craze is so silly. Even the Seattle Kraken hockey team is doing an NFT sale. wtf
[2:12:10] 514484: Ubisoft is a joke
[2:12:11] DrHax_: it honestly warms my heart to see shit like that flop rooAww
[2:12:15] fiterpilot: Wow who would of thought a stupid idea would fail
[2:12:16] Variosit: imagine being the dude who signed off on that
[2:12:18] Chackler: KEKW
[2:12:21] Iksess: you cant release game with nft, its only worth anything in existing games
[2:12:24] drewdegroot: you should get a silk touch pick axe to save your time
[2:12:32] bozobaity: a wet fart takes more effort than an NFT
[2:12:38] JoxerTheM1ghty: Just like toilet paper in 2019
[2:12:39] Miestro: but WAY more expensive
[2:12:39] Enlil5: 14 more than they shuold have gotten if you ask me
[2:12:42] bictage: Why is the staircase only two wide and not three wide as it should be :(
[2:12:47] Miestro: a beanie baby was like 15 dollars
[2:12:50] mahajimbo: PepLaugh how do they know how many sold oh wait :)
[2:12:51] 0omkins: Everyone has an Aunt who has like 1000 of them....
[2:12:56] JoxerTheM1ghty: But at least I can wipe my ass with the paper.
[2:13:07] Mr_Fungi: my uncle has a beanie baby worth a few hundred thousand
[2:13:09] soe_frost: Nfts arent a scam, theyre just being misused rn IMO
[2:13:13] Malak044: just the influation kicking in after 60years
[2:13:21] Akunin_EQ: No one talks about the next evolution of NFT tech, verifying ownership of ANY digital product (art, game, software, etc) Your OS will verify you own that software before you can run it on your PC.
[2:13:24] Klorell: I ead Ubisoft is bleeding out devs too?
[2:13:25] rieurru: that starcase tho
[2:13:30] celadriel23: is this the Waffle Lair?
[2:13:33] GlennC: Aren't cubesat measurements taken from the size of beanie baby containers?
[2:13:51] 0rangelight: Is any game company good LUL

[2:14:00] sleepymisaki: vibechecks
[2:14:02] johahs95: If you press down your scroll wheel while looking at the stone you get a new stack in your hotbar @Giantwaffle
[2:14:02] Mr_Jarv1s: AAA doesn't mean "good" anymore
[2:14:02] Deepcast: do you want zoop in MC?
[2:14:05] fiterpilot: 2042 was a fail, vangaurd was a fail

[2:14:36] officialhunterx: are you using the stone cutter to make stone brick
[2:14:39] MSUdude: if they added that to vanilla Minecraft I would nut
[2:14:44] Miestro: are we going to need amethyst for the megabuild? I mined out a cave of it near my base
[2:14:51] Miestro: have like 5 or 6 stacks of it
[2:14:55] SLlCK_WlLL: AAA means 100gb install
[2:14:59] Sloopwafel: triple A means big budget, not quality
[2:14:59] Zendhal: Activision-Blizzard is like trashcan on fire and they just keep pouring gasoline to extinguish it
[2:15:05] banshay3: tripple A is almosta a red flag
[2:15:14] Kaomie: So Minecraft is AAA then
[2:15:14] mahajimbo: wafflePog devolver went public
[2:15:16] Immp: @officialhunterx no point, cutters dont give extra on bricks, only stairs
[2:15:16] afetus24: all they care about is the money they make not the qaulity of product
[2:15:19] matey1116: 12 tps monkaX
[2:15:20] Dagmoo: and lately AAA has meant that the game is shit too LUL
[2:15:23] Dum8kid: @banshay3 true Sadge
[2:15:23] Moobot: You can sub to Waffle by clicking this neat link -> twitch.tv/giantwaffle/subscribe
[2:15:25] bozobaity: @zendhal people keep spending money on those mediocre games tho. Every. Single. Year.
[2:15:32] GarlicJelly: AAA = cookie cutter gameplay with 0 innovation YEP
[2:15:34] Apparentthreat: Kaomie you look at actual dev team size or publisher size?
[2:15:41] Deepcast: its Ci he bwoke it
[2:15:41] n31lw: aaa means it has its own launcher
[2:15:42] Firstnecron: pepeLaugh 👉 📉 tps
[2:15:43] Apparentthreat: how large is Mojang's team for MC ?
[2:15:47] Kaomie: It's fine until it's not
[2:15:49] ahless: hi waffle PauseChamp
[2:15:52] 5mOkEwOw: what's the draw distance on server side? I think default is 10 chunks, most servers set it to 7
[2:15:55] Bearded__Wonder: did you make the change to limit whats being logged like you said yesterday
[2:15:57] Deathu: It is a lot waffle with the new changes its more world more to load and stuff
[2:16:02] Miestro: Yep
[2:16:05] Miestro: it's true
[2:16:16] SirT0ad: do you think in couple weeks when the server dies down a bit, you'll increase the mob cap?
[2:16:18] Astalavista87: you mean proper corpo.
[2:16:19] tripwires: would the average ping influence the amount of TPS?
[2:16:21] CallMeRazzie: manager to lead team of other managers
[2:16:23] ZyrnUwU: Manager managers 😤
[2:16:23] Sonycbourn: True LUL
[2:16:24] Apparentthreat: Bro we have so many project managers and Agile people
[2:16:26] DrWraithjr: Perfectly said
[2:16:27] crystal_fiction: "managers are more important than workers" Pepega
[2:16:31] Astalavista87: super manager
[2:16:36] adamcirillo: don't forget the bean counters
[2:16:42] xevos221: We call that corporate bloat
[2:16:51] Zendhal: jeez that sounds like they need a manager to manage all the managers
[2:17:02] Minelmonia: You are so right! i work for a massive company and the amount of BS project managers are the worst
[2:17:08] Malak044: is there any way in minecraft modded MP to loadbalance the rendering of chunks by distinct servers ?  (via shared caches, or w/e)
[2:17:12] Maherishi: The manager manager
[2:17:14] DrWraithjr: "the bureaucracy is expanding to meet the needs of the expanding bureaucracy"
[2:17:19] bozobaity: damage control half the time
[2:17:34] atamala: not a manager but imagine having to schedule all of your meetings, multiple teams, deadlines etc WHILE developing. no ty
[2:17:35] DeadFury222: A lot. Disregarded every procedure in my first 3 months at my job I reduced build times by 70% LUL @Giantwaffle
[2:17:36] Kaomie: You just describe the entire Agile Method
[2:17:38] Kaomie: LOL
[2:17:41] 0rangelight: US universities too, sooo many admins
[2:17:47] Mr_Jarv1s: Corporate Bloat is very close to  Government bureaucracy to me
[2:17:51] RoninStorm: as an IT manager... can confirm... most managment positions spend the majority of their time trying to validate their own existence.
[2:17:55] Arimil: That's a big issue where I work we have multiple developers spend days in meetings.
[2:18:06] Variosit: imagine if you had the ability and means to add something that will fix a game forever, but you have to wait till it goes though 30 layers of approval before it gets back to you, IF it gets back to you
[2:18:10] Zendhal: It feels like AAA companies spend more money on PR teams than dev teams
[2:18:20] Deathu: The nether rn has been bleeed dry ngl theres 1000 tunnels everywhere
[2:18:50] itsIffy: as dev, you ought to handle your corporate bloat. patially it does need to exist, but how much needs to exist, that's sort of up to yourself
[2:19:06] banshay3: star citizen Kappa
[2:19:07] bozobaity: Among Us
[2:19:12] mechoriet: tbh there werent alot of feature rich engines that werent studio owned
[2:19:14] atamala: depends on what you define as 'indie' there were a lot of really small studios that had to get the massive publishers to support them
[2:19:14] 0rangelight: Well yeah you don't have to make money for investors
[2:19:24] 0omkins: That shift has happened in a ton of industries. Music too
[2:19:31] br1llo: And then you end up with sexual harrassment
[2:19:35] Sloopwafel: they do not have a monopoly lol
[2:19:41] lokhu: We just have to inform investors we're wasting money paying managers
[2:19:46] 5mOkEwOw: i just wished all launcher had the same quality as steam and were as easy to use
[2:19:48] Minelmonia: With one caveat, an indy company can only make 1 mistake, whereas big companies have the $$ to afford more mistakes
[2:20:03] Hot_Rodster: Social media is huge for artists that don't have a backer
[2:20:04] Mr_Fungi: id say streamers getting bored and doing more variety brings light to some of the indie games as well
[2:20:06] punkgeek: Technically depends on the contract, but yeah, that's mostly how it goes
[2:20:08] atamala: the benefit of the label is you're protected by them, the teams of lawyers  etc
[2:20:08] 0omkins: distrubution used to be the issue
[2:20:09] snor6: didnt Valheim have like a team of 4 or 5 when it was released in EA?
[2:20:10] fry_like_a_pirate: that's why C418 was dropped for minecraft recently, he owned all his own music
[2:20:11] Bearded__Wonder: i heard there was an album the other day that was independently produced or whatever hit no 3 on itunes
[2:20:14] havanacouplebeers: if you have a label you really don't own your music
[2:20:18] ManneehFresh: you make less but you keep more so you make more
[2:20:22] Drzswagg: Many rappers do that
[2:20:23] banshay3: a legal bullshit that they created themselves
[2:20:25] nfm1lk: Yes labels make it insanely difficult for Indy artist to get attention
[2:20:26] Variosit: steam takes 30% for pretty much any purchase. which is also considered industry standard
[2:20:28] xevos221: Steam is as popular as it is because it is a solid launcher/marketplace/forum
[2:20:34] The1_TS: Amazon gaming !
[2:20:35] BuLLeT_LV: Rockstar? :D
[2:20:40] punkgeek: It's pretty easy to self publish these days, but the money is crap even without labels taking a big cut
[2:20:57] havanacouplebeers: farming sim 22 is the best game of 2021

[2:25:02] Chickinlegs: i searched for year and years and i eventaully hit EFT and now i cant stop the same as wow back in the day
[2:25:03] Arimil: The issue with games like that is people's mentality around games has changed. So they can't exist the same way they used to.
[2:25:10] griffin38: damn true
[2:25:11] Drzswagg: Maybe is an age thing, I def can’t play like I used to

[2:25:53] Mheruy: as a lot of people said, turning a hobby into a job, makes it a terrible experience Sadge
[2:25:53] ZukaZamam3e: I think games were just better back then because the game was complete on released and patches were harder to do back then.
[2:25:53] sleepymisaki: I think its rather a "we've seen it already" thing

[2:26:32] kyanpeppaa: for me gaming is just a full community thing now, don't havent that much fun solo like I used too, hoping for games like palia or something sparks my interest again
[2:26:33] theswampdonkee: studying and collecting specific plants is actually dope as hell
[2:26:34] 0omkins: It's tough. I turned photography into a business. There's highs and lows for sure.

[2:26:44] Astalavista87: Sadge
[2:26:46] Arimil: I have that problem since I like programming I find myself looking up stuff for work during my freetime.
[2:26:50] McFatbutt: S OMEGALUL CIAL in 2021
[2:26:51] OMICRON: its true, you want a job where its your passion, but if your passion becomes your job then you start to mix what's fun and what's work and can lose interest all together

[2:28:44] Kevincav: I had an AFF lesson with someone sponsored by redbull so he might be making a living with skydiving.

[3:55:28] xsaucychanx: @Lordbreeze_ i look foward to the big veins when playing modded; i think the reason they made them so big in vanilla is so people are encouraged to build with it

[4:17:36] RpidFrTommyGun: facts
[4:17:39] Hurtwolf: i think the stones in the dirt make it seamless
[4:17:40] Chris_Cross_Crash: Probably because the grass always needs to be up
[4:17:44] slothfarms: true, but can be over used

[4:24:45] Variosit: the honey makes your friction in game diffrent
[4:24:51] Lost_Leviathan: the honey blocks are just less than a full block so you  still touch the water
[4:24:57] Yumzoi: I think its coz honey blocks aren't full width so you actaully hit the bubble stream behind the honey which takes you up
[4:25:14] TheFernweh: I love that mustachioed man
[4:25:19] soe_frost: The bubble column is behind the honey blocks
[4:25:19] Lordbreeze_: the water on the other side maybe?

[4:25:20] Mundakka: Yo do know about the standard bubble elevator right?
[4:25:21] GarlicJelly: You touch just the tip of the water block so you don't have to enter the water much
[4:25:26] MetalBBA: the honey are like 15/16ths of a block so you clip the corner
[4:25:28] Lost_Leviathan: you touch the corner of the bubble collum
[4:25:29] oIRise: the water shoot with soul sand still has bubbles in it
[4:25:33] CountRubbish: that would mean setting up a honey farm as well. It would take while to get that many blocks of honey to be honest.

[6:01:29] BelgiumBTW: its mainly hoppers
[6:01:33] Scopenhagen: ouf
[6:01:37] Filsklor: and keep the deal
[6:01:39] JoshuaACasey: i believe the solution to that is to use barrels instead of chests
[6:01:41] chadica12345: @Giantwaffle funny enough i just covered a villager
[6:01:43] Myekos: anything bigger than a double chest?
[6:01:55] Face_32: putting composters on top of hoppers helps

[6:07:44] DeMayon: would you use a shop plugin?
[6:07:54] TheFernweh: that would be so nice so I don't have to built a bunch of farms
[6:07:55] mechoriet: @514484 anarchy is so easy to host KEKW
[6:07:56] JoshuaACasey: @514484 if i ever host a server it won't be "anarchy". But it will be Survival
[6:07:58] hackett33: I used to just spawn in one type of each village that has all the standard things it sells
[6:08:10] GFQPR1882: i remember playing on a server and i made a really kl pyramid base but then some assholes came and ruined it Sadge
[6:08:12] 514484: mechoriet exactly, and it's beautiful
[6:08:24] daemonaedryn: Could we limit farms to End farms since theyre the most efficient?
[6:08:28] MrUpload0: You can install wildstacker or some sort of plugin to make mobs stackable
[6:08:35] bintanraver: then let us centralize villager trading
[6:08:47] TheFernweh: yeah for sure
[6:08:49] mechoriet: @MrUpload0 doesnt help :)
[6:09:03] mechoriet: @MrUpload0 cause the server would still try to hit the mobcap
[6:09:11] Tabakhase: uh? everyone needs like 32cows, 12 sheep, 131 chickens and at least 40 bats DansGame
[6:09:13] JSmitty1900: trades are per user i thought

[6:09:47] Xerexos_: hark making it a 100% chance to cure a zombie villager
[6:09:57] DjinN_SS: reduced trade price from turning zombie villagers is a per person thing. whoever cures gets the discount
[6:09:58] DX_Plates: @514484 Only 20% of the server needs to sleep
[6:10:00] Xerexos_: hard mode*
[6:10:01] INFR_Darkfire: 1.18 runs horribly in general
[6:10:05] mechoriet: @Giantwaffle YEP it has been bad for like 3 version on high player caps
[6:10:06] inclaved: its not even optimized for single player
[6:10:07] FlipFlipFlaparoo: Can zombie villagers spawn from zombie spawners
[6:10:12] MrUpload0: Get that 1.12.2 velocity jar
[6:10:16] 514484: DX_Plates ah, votelseep, that is cool

[6:13:22] Orejo58: Make a jail server where the subs are prisoners and the plebs are guards
[6:13:26] Gh3ttoboy: @mrupload0 you wont see those though once the floor is in
[6:13:28] 514484: i used to love stone bricks, but there are so many choices now
[6:13:29] ThatOnneGuy: DX_Plates no, start in jail, in debt, get out of debt, get out of jail, go back to jail cause the odds are 100k:1
[6:14:10] ThatOnneGuy: the gross thing is someone would do it.
