[1:27:02] Amandroid: @Brixxii linkzzeyGig
[1:27:12] Abrakaidabra_: I also hate seeing spiders in my car NoThanks
[1:27:23] fjfbfkxi: spiders are okay till they have hairs on them
[1:28:36] Abrakaidabra_: I have a deep fear of sky diving, but i'm not scared of heights
[1:28:45] R2RHIN0: been skydiving once. Never again
[1:28:48] MotownMiki: they’ve made some crazy spider movies over the years… no wonder people keep getting the heebie jeebies
[1:28:49] MeteoricBadger: I've been slowly getting over my fear of flying / turbulence. It's so liberating!!!
[1:28:50] Amandroid: linkzzeyGig yeah, no way you're getting me to skydive
[1:28:51] Amandroid: !crunch blushPoint
[1:28:51] StreamElements: @Amandroid, Linkzzey has hit the wall 10201 times. linkzzeyFly
[1:28:53] ChazzyMac: yeah i dont think i will ever jump out of a perfectly good airplane
[1:29:08] CrabbyKronos: i respect falling its the sudden stop that scares me
[1:29:14] Amandroid: YesYes I've been bungie jumping, but no way I'd skydive
[1:29:44] CrabbyKronos: sky diving is so much fun
[1:29:49] Wickednush: I would like to skydive but never want to bungie jump
[1:30:02] CrabbyKronos: never bungie jumped tho but i would do it
[1:30:04] Amandroid: catCheck
[1:30:10] R2RHIN0: ive never been bungee jumping, but I can see how it would be a bit more scary
[1:30:15] willowmoon92: linkzzeyHi linkzzeyHi
[1:30:17] Abrakaidabra_: I've been in a hot air balloon once, It was beautiful
[1:30:19] Amandroid: @willowmoon92 linkzzeyHii
[1:30:23] ChazzyMac: oh man. i took a doors open helicopter ride around the island. it was beautiful, but in a turn i felt like my belts were a little loose. wasnt very pleasant
[1:30:51] donczenezero: Who I dont understand are those wingsuit guys.
[1:31:01] Wryfrost: Speaking of heights, the "Call of the Void" is the word for when something in your head tells you to jump from a high place. It's normal to be scared by that but it's just your brain reminding you that doing that is a bad idea, and not something you should be concerned about. You're perfectly fine in the head, in other words.
[1:31:17] ChazzyMac: how do you land with elytra? now you know
[1:31:19] ChazzyMac: LUL
[1:31:38] donczenezero: Yeah they have a parachute
[1:31:46] willowmoon92: Good just waiting on the 12 inches of snow that we are supposed to get tomorrow. How are you doing? I love this build your working on!
[1:31:48] Wickednush: or those crazy parkour people that climb and jump all over tall buildings with no gear whatsoever; big nope
[1:32:01] minecutter666: Ey yo linkzzeyCozee
[1:32:04] Wryfrost: Actually, someone DID land like that and walk away. He set up a landing pad made of thousands of cardboard boxes and just crashed into them
[1:32:07] Amandroid: @minecutter666 linkzzeyHii
[1:32:11] Abrakaidabra_: @Wryfrost I'm trying to do a TL;DR on that but I cant consolidate it myself OMEGALUL
[1:32:11] R2RHIN0: we are expecting like 8-12 inches of snow
[1:32:27] Abrakaidabra_: linkzzeyGib why is everyone getting snow and not me linkzzeyAgony
[1:32:29] willowmoon92: yeah thats about the same here too
[1:32:30] minecutter666: hey chat and hey link TwitchConHYPE
[1:32:40] MotownMiki: it’s 71 degree Fahrenheit at my house
[1:32:42] fjfbfkxi: i’ve been on a helicopter without the frame. just a chair with a motor. it was so scary
[1:33:05] ChazzyMac: it was 64F this morning. thought about getting the parka out LUL
[1:33:08] Chree7248: Hey people linkzzeySnack
[1:33:15] storey_book: It's supposed to be -30F here tonight. And that's not the coldest it gets here....I must be crazy
[1:33:16] Amandroid: @Chree7248 linkzzeyHii
[1:33:18] willowmoon92: lol we had rain earlier this week and the school had a snow day. if they dont call it ima be so mad lol
[1:33:24] MotownMiki: yes, about, I keep the house at 68 in the winter
[1:33:25] Chree7248: @amandroid linkzzeyHii
[1:33:43] Chree7248: !watchtime
[1:33:44] StreamElements: Chree7248 has spent  20 days 15 hours watching linkzzey
[1:33:48] R2RHIN0: The thing with skydiving is that once you're out of the plane, there is no going back LuL  so there is a bit of peace in that. As weird as that sounds
[1:33:58] Brixxii: peepoPantsFly it is windy and that wind is cold AF
[1:34:04] Abrakaidabra_: I'd love to do para-sailing! it sounds so fun!
[1:34:04] Amandroid: I feel like a hot air balloon ride would go on way too long - like, I'd be good after like 15 min
[1:34:16] Wryfrost: The top of my room is a nice warm temperature but the bottom is cold af! I've got a little fan set up to pull cold air up and bring hot air down to mix it but it's not working very well
[1:34:21] willowmoon92: not yet. .i have kiddos
[1:34:44] CaptainChaos2112: I have bungee jumped and did a vertical accelerator
[1:34:54] Abrakaidabra_: do you have a backup power supply?
[1:35:07] MotownMiki: !lurk
[1:35:08] StreamElements: @Miki_MC_, See you soon, as you head into the boooshes to lurk, thank you! linkzzeyHide
[1:35:10] willowmoon92: lol i live close enough to walk but i dont want to do that either lol
[1:35:24] Wryfrost: I don't think I could ever do bungee jumping. Knowing my luck, my fat ass would over-stress the cord and I'd go face first into the ground
[1:35:32] CaptainChaos2112: shoots you in the air from the ground
[1:35:43] ChazzyMac: so a human cannon?
[1:35:44] ChazzyMac: LUL
[1:35:50] Amandroid: linkzzeyGig I realized years later that when I bungee jumped, I shouldn't have been allowed to - went with a bunch of friends when we graduated high school, but I graduated a year early so I was actually only 17 at the time
[1:35:54] Wickednush: @Amandroid I think it be fun during something like the Albuquerque Balloon fest where there are hundreds around; plus with the scenic view
[1:36:22] Chree7248: KEKW
[1:36:32] Amandroid: not grad school UHMM

[1:38:19] ChazzyMac: it would be eon's for me LUL
[1:38:27] yodanotiam: on the cable is there a mixer box with a volume wheel?
[1:38:52] Amandroid: @Normalguy2424 linkzzeyGig it literally didn't even occur to me til like a year or two ago - like, they must've checked IDs for the first few of us and then didn't bother with the rest
[1:38:53] MTY_ZWGreen: no ive tried everything
[1:38:55] mcswizzle7: @zwgreen3964 one time I was worried about my headphones and I had accidentally bumped the on-headphone volume control linkzzeyGig  I hope your problem is that simple
[1:39:04] duenna99: Steam Boat Willie
[1:39:08] yodanotiam: mickey mouse is copy right

[1:41:28] ChazzyMac: i gave up on math when they put letters in it

[1:42:41] ChazzyMac: 100 years ago?

[1:43:02] Chree7248: Math was fun when it  rhymed I’m talking one two buckle my shoe linkzzeyNote
[1:43:08] duenna99: actually, it is 95 years on copy right... so 1929 ?
[1:43:11] ChazzyMac: depends, you can re-up copywrite i believe
[1:43:36] ChazzyMac: disney is celebrating 100 years.
[1:43:41] MTY_ZWGreen: yea corsair is good
[1:43:53] MandaLin: there might be a maximum that they can re-up mandal3THINK
[1:43:56] Rozsy: they are not allowed to
[1:44:04] Amandroid: you can't always - all copyrights are meant to run out eventually
[1:44:10] ChazzyMac: makes sense
[1:44:11] Rozsy: lego is the same they lost the patent too
[1:44:14] Fiefff: linkzzeyHi linkzzeyHeart
[1:44:15] duenna99: i watched a video from an actual lawyer about i :D  the max is 95 years
[1:44:21] PurpleSquirrel1503: Nerdge after the original creator dies, they have a limited amount of re-copyrights they could do
[1:44:25] Amandroid: linkzzeyNod exactly
[1:44:31] DawzFroggy: hey link and chat
[1:44:36] Amandroid: @Fiefff linkzzeyHii
[1:44:37] Mykroft_SA: @MandaLin They used to be one of the biggest lobbyists to try and push up the maximum, I guess they finally got push back.

[1:45:03] DaMomma36: love Legal Eagle
[1:45:08] Roundaround: but Disney was cheeky and copyrights a new version of Mickey every few years. so right now the Steamboat Willy version is public domain but not the more modern versions of Mickey
[1:45:16] stahlcord: linkzzeyHii
[1:45:55] PurpleSquirrel1503: @Roundaround linkzzeyNod exactly - put the white gloves on him, and he's copyrighted again linkzzeyGig

[1:46:21] zero_o00o: I wanna live in that castle man its sooo gorgeous
[1:46:28] Roundaround: basically if you make anything involving Mickey Mouse, you're gonna get a letter from Disney's lawyers and will have to make your argument in court because they intentionally made it as big of a gray area as possible
[1:46:39] zero_o00o: linkzzeyGig
