[1:10:26] Apparentthreat: you could at least build more of the same machines for parallel processing
[1:10:28] Kascade418: The entire story of the Line so far is fix one bottleneck find the next
[1:10:29] Apparentthreat: he left signs

[1:12:11] kane1941: stone dust is a byproduct of every ore
[1:12:12] Purecrew: OH nvm yea it is
[1:12:18] deadgolfer: it should be there
[1:12:31] mechoriet: @Purecrew pepeLaugh this is probbly still backlogged from inserting ores last night

[1:14:28] CoolAcid: Alexa, set a reminder for Waffle to investigate stone dust in 30 mins.
[1:14:36] boogerbomb01: Give it 4 hours then you will see it lol
[1:14:47] PureSpider: why are there just random machines on the floor?
[1:14:57] matori666: untill it macerated everything, you will have stone dust backing the system

[1:15:03] mechoriet: YEP 2048
[1:15:19] mechoriet: you need like 512 for one craft
[1:15:20] Allmostdone: but you have no way of knowing when it will stop putting stone dust in
[1:15:34] Kascade418: If so much stone dust gets made might need to make a centrifuge just for stone dust and filter it away from other machines
[1:15:40] mechoriet: didn't you need like 500+ for one craft of a item?
[1:15:57] davethulhu: use the ingots
[1:16:03] mechoriet: but you kinda do cause your gonna hate yourself for not doing it

[1:27:19] ValueTown: LCRs are great. i did a lot of my HV chemical processes in them in GTNH. my cetane boosted diesel setup was so clean. not needed in this pack though (it was for power)

[1:28:00] fbritoferreira: I think it was like 4/5 days
[1:28:01] AtheonBarcota: AtheonBarcota subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 28 months! 
[1:28:12] FusRohDakkaDakka: storage is easier than crafting
[1:28:15] DX_Plates: He always blitzes digital storage
[1:28:27] sorefingers: it took me solo like 16 hours to get the first basics of ae2 but until you are at a point where you can really start to automate its a lot longer because you first need to automate the first circuits without ae

[5:20:49] darthrithen: 10 might as well be 16 then
[5:21:21] Timiderxbox: Check the used for mk1 maybe something else you can skip with that

[5:31:54] kbigLiar: I'm so glad you did the rant on isakai the other day... finally found the anime genre I actually like watching lyeojSmile
[5:31:55] Vovosunt: the cooking anime? Manga was super chill but kinda boring
[5:31:56] SailorWS: I couldnt watch by the grace of the gods bc of the VA for the MC
[5:32:07] SailorWS: the voice was pissing me off
[5:32:20] ligerzerof: @kbigLiar if you're looking for chill vibes, you should watch restaurant in another world
[5:32:44] fbritoferreira: @dr_Griff True but also it depends tbh most senior get a bit complecent in their job roles
[5:32:49] CanadianHealthCare: they are good for a season
[5:32:51] dr_Griff: @PureSpider Ya man, understood. I'm in a sr dev role now, but fortunately I'm a one man team. Things will change soon. =(
[5:32:54] Vovosunt: the shadow garden anime is kind of fun, cause it knows it's doing dumb cliches LUL
[5:33:09] kbigLiar: that crystal making machine seems to get jammed ocasionally

[5:33:59] bcdmonkey: Slice of midlife crisis
[5:34:08] chaoskub: Crafting card?
[5:34:23] PureSpider: fbritoferreira 300 devs is more than the entire company i work for seqKEK
[5:34:25] DarkbuilderX: Th Princess & Genius Lady counts too, even though they skip the whole isekai setup
[5:34:46] dr_Griff: @PureSpider Sounds intense. Digging the startup life for now, but gotta wear a lot of hats.
[5:34:47] The_Stone_One: are inputs configured on the block?
[5:34:51] fbritoferreira: @PureSpider I has working for sky/comcast in the past but yeah 300 is a bit insane
[5:35:04] PureSpider: dr_Griff yea, i get that
[5:35:19] Vovosunt: @Giantwaffle use a buffer chest
[5:35:22] fbritoferreira: @PureSpider Have a offer for a 5 person dev team, it seems quite a nice gig
[5:35:25] PureSpider: fbritoferreira best of luck! :D
[5:35:27] Unkn0wn_Nam3: input into a chest or crate first
[5:35:28] karsb23: Make bufferchest
[5:35:30] usernameNull: did the xp get too low in the system?
[5:35:30] fbritoferreira: @PureSpider ty
[5:35:30] Vovosunt: and have the machine auto-pull
[5:35:44] Pict1on: buffer chest will solve this ossue
[5:35:49] Morlega: why wouldn't you be able to do a buffer chest? simple solution
[5:35:57] tyler312ytgameing: hi nick
[5:36:06] Swocoom: filter
[5:36:07] Vovosunt: put interface on the chest
[5:36:17] kane1941: just Interface pointed at the chest
[5:36:20] Vovosunt: let machine to auto-input by itself
[5:36:23] tyler312ytgameing: hi Nicole
[5:36:30] Kunja: put the chest directly under the interface so the autocrafting system thinks thats the block that crafts it. Then have the machine pull and push back into the system to complete the craft
[5:36:31] Morlega: Treat the chest as the machine, then just item conduit between chest and the actual machine?
[5:36:31] DarkbuilderX: Interface into the chest, then just pipe back into the interface NODDERS
[5:36:35] lvyEartman: just automate like the 1000s of other machines you are doing
[5:36:57] dr_Griff: @fbritoferreira You plan on moving out to CA, or working from UK if you get the gig?
[5:37:02] Morlega: interface <-> chest <-> item conduit <-> machine
[5:37:31] bcdmonkey: Nah waffle do it
[5:37:33] Morlega: ah I forgot you need to pipe the result back out into the interface
[5:37:55] hisdue: it was me, dio
[5:37:59] fbritoferreira: @dr_Griff Its a uk based role, CA is only for the executives / other teams, they are trying to build a team here where I live
[5:38:06] SailorWS: Copege not my fault
[5:38:11] TheUsefulDistraction: wait this code doesnt make any sense who wrote this...oh wait
[5:38:18] lvyEartman: not the right fluid in level emitter?
[5:38:19] chaoskub: You need the OUTPUT
[5:38:20] kbigLiar: does the output hatch auto-push?

[5:44:47] jdog0616: @fapohogu wouldnt the mod itself get dmca?
[5:44:55] primo_qwe: i think you can just split sound so we can listen in stream but vod doesnt have sound. lots of streamers are doing it
[5:44:56] guessgtwc: show your first stream lol
[5:45:00] daedmissica0: did you see that webb stuff?

[5:46:15] Probni4ek: @Giantwaffle I have a photo where you keep a lot of parcels with warhammer figurines. Even when you were studying.
[5:46:17] PureSpider: just play your own goddamn music
[5:46:20] fapohogu: deleting a vod from 8 years ago is like burning down a house of a family line that ended

[6:32:00] WARHERO322: @jdog0616 If a modpack uses channels for ME then it needs the dense ones for more channels
[6:32:03] Purecrew: &!
[6:32:03] Bulltank: @jdog0616 typically, AE2 has channels and the wires have limits on channels. Regular wires are 8 channels and dense are 16.
[6:32:03] 0x4273: and not draconium
[6:32:06] BlackNocturne: Look at the example
