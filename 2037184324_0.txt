[0:41:51] CherriKushBearE: Turtle eggs are guaranteed to crack during random ticks between 21600 and 22550 ticks in-game time (3:36 am and 4:33 am). This is a roughly 48-second window for the player. About 95% of eggs crack or hatch during this night-time window. On average, an egg hatches in 4-5 nights. 90% of eggs hatch in 7 nights or less.

[0:45:55] DeePick: A new county ordinance took effect Jan. 16 that bans "stopping, standing or engaging in an activity that causes another person to stop" on certain parts of the Strip. Tourists often stop on the pedestrian bridges to take photos of all the casino lights or to watch street performers, but that practice could soon land you behind bars. People who violate the new law could be charged with a misdemeanor and face up to six months in jail or a $1,000 fine for their actions.

[1:24:27] genericvillain: I've seen streams with channel point rewards to get a sub, but that's not the smartest thing for a streamer to do
[1:24:33] kylexy3: You play to win the game!
[1:24:39] thederpjesus: I think a bunch of the app dating “after we clicked” to me sounds exactly like other groups that see a dwindling supply and just commit.

[1:25:44] SummitSummit: Jon, "Play games." also Jon, "Don't play games."
[1:25:50] sarosa25: @jonbams you’d be surprised even on dating apps men like to play games. I think we’re on the same page though just be cool and confident and yourself
[1:25:57] dw33z1l: Games only work if the 2 people are playing the same one. As there are thousands of these "games", it gets frustrating. The only winning move is not to play.
[1:26:11] noddy009: do an ice harvest - doesnt that take a few days to complete...? :)
[1:26:22] JayoRed: Cheer200 people tend to put on an act even if it's a small act at the beginning if relationships so within the first year alot of people get tired of not being themselves without noticing it my current relationship is going on for 2 plus years and we've been ourselves the whole time and it still feels like the honeymoon phase so what you're saying is correct right and true
[1:26:25] MGWilsonz: thats some thick ranch

[1:28:51] DeePick: and drew bledsoe getting hurt
[1:29:08] JayoRed: That superbowl where Payton manning was getting whooped in his final season and the whole stadium's lights shut off then Payton manning came back and won
[1:29:11] osamba: @JonBams where the lights shut off
[1:29:11] Denbrew: was it a the black out one sf vs baltimore

[1:29:53] slackertron: sounds like a bills play
[1:29:53] PrincessVanellope: @Mach424 I think it has turned into a meme to know if someone is of our generation or not. I bet if you said you lost the game to the kids that were in here earlier, they would have no idea
[1:29:57] TheGr8Pre10der: raiders bucs in 2002

[1:30:15] slackertron: lower the honey dumby
[1:30:21] JTSmith44: yeah, my thought is always, if there is money involved, someone is pulling strings
[1:30:24] Mach424: @PrincessVanellope ah, agreed. Those games date our generation. Sadge
[1:30:26] neonninja24: stairs faced the other way?
[1:30:26] DeePick: Jan 22, 2013 — Tim Brown, a receiver on the 2002 Oakland team, accused Coach Bill Callahan of losing to Tampa Bay intentionally out of spite in Super Bowl
[1:30:28] TheGr8Pre10der: raiders center went AWOL pregame. very strange series of events.

[1:31:56] stunningsquirrel: Something that worries me is I drink a fatally  small amount of water
[1:31:57] connor_assassin5: if it was fully scripted like that then why do we get boring superbowls sometimes
[1:32:11] Mach424: bamGiggle bamHearts for the nostalgia MLADY @PrincessVanellope
[1:32:19] RollyPinder: people who think the nfl is scripted are just as stupid as flat earthers

[1:35:28] kayccs: bamSmrt
[1:35:30] connor_assassin5: my only argument to that is if refs are betting like that why haven’t they been caught. they’ve caught players betting using every which way to try to hide it. there are plenty of amazing services to find refs placing bets

[1:36:16] bu1dak: Hamlin coming back from death making a super bowl is a good story. but Taylor Swift sells more tickets

[1:38:12] thederpjesus: @yakefromstatefarm lol Apple is running the show that won’t happen
[1:38:13] zestytreats: Detroit in a Super Bowl would do amazing views.  People love the story. Buffalo had their time, they failed.  Detroit going to the Bowl would be a must watch and would garner views from the rest of the NFL @JonBams
[1:38:20] connor_assassin5: Brady vs Brees would’ve been better
[1:38:22] Lekerstein: @Denbrew 5 years ;) time flies
[1:38:33] Thedarkvet53: Cheer100 Cheer100 If the chiefs make the super bowl, will taylor swift make an appearance at half time with usher
[1:38:38] BruisedCranium56: the last time the broncos was there it was terrible. Payton couldnt throw throw the ball anymore
