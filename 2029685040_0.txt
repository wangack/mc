[3:23:41] Archeraplyxa: Just a small warning, short videos (Under 2m30s) can break Cinema
[3:24:08] Archeraplyxa: Also there is a small chance for long videos that are over 2 hours long to break Cinema
[3:24:28] Archeraplyxa: I speak from experience of breaking Cinema both with too long and too short video
[3:25:09] RobPik: Lets be honest any video might cause cinema to break
[3:25:26] dnilra: Truuuueeee
[3:38:29] Archeraplyxa: True, but excessive long one makes it a higher chance
