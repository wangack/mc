[3:10:54] Tabakhase: win11 has to wait for ddr5 to become reasonable here... then new build NODDERS
[3:10:54] daemonaedryn: The lag is making it all do minimum damage I think
[3:10:55] Tom7258: @fadamaka SAME the audio driver issues are driving me mad
[3:10:55] 514484: should do a gamba about the date he installs PaperMC Kappa
[3:11:01] daemonaedryn: Its taking me like 10 hits to kill a zombie
[3:11:10] melo_signed: @Giantwaffle your swing is still on cooldown because of the lag is why youre not dealing as much
[3:11:16] Blade0406: you want the regular axe to do damage

[3:11:33] daemonaedryn: The lag is fucking up damage @Giantwaffle
[3:11:35] DerEliteTeufel: real dmg comes from axe-crits
[3:11:40] Fadamaka: @Tom7258 I had realtek drivers on both of my PCs I both had issues, but a simple reinstall helped
[3:11:42] Iksess: pickaxe does not deal extra damage, only sword/axe iirc
[3:11:48] Rottastic: @Giantwaffle You don't need to place so many torches anymore. Mobs will only spawn at 0 light level
[3:11:55] officialhunterx: you could place a torch every 23 blocks now when caving
[3:12:01] WarpOs: waffla can't time

[3:12:11] Markus11982: its new yea
[3:12:19] shoegaze: Wasting so many torches :(
[3:12:20] Allmostdone: of course you just need to rollback on the audio drivers to fix
[3:12:23] CorSPACE: except for spawners

[3:12:45] pepeneros99: zoomer patch

[3:12:52] Iksess: you can fortune iron
[3:12:52] Tabakhase: *now
[3:12:54] Fadamaka: @Tom7258 no just the audiodriver, you have to install it again, you dont even need a win 11 specific version, just install the win 10 driver again and it will get fixed
[3:12:59] The_kid_as_a_teen: what
[3:13:05] 514484: yeah it seems good, having to put torches everywhere was quite ugly
[3:13:12] Deathu: fortune works on everything now i think

[3:13:28] iivu1canii: I do be struggling to load in PeepoSad

[5:56:32] HeyItsADK: Does it take that long to teleport to the nether now or is that just the server lag? Lol
[5:56:34] IceRoads: Cant forward ports
[5:56:35] lookout888: dns does not do port.
[5:56:37] Miestro: can't point to a port like that really
[5:56:37] QuesoBad0nga: you want an alias
[5:56:41] ImposterArchitect: DNS doens't go port
[5:56:46] JoshuaACasey: you'd need to setup a CNAME record
[5:56:50] phoenixxua: it's Alias and not CNAME. alias should work
[5:56:52] QuesoBad0nga: and it depends if the server requires the specific url
[5:56:54] mechoriet: srv :)
[5:56:59] mechoriet: SRV record
[5:57:03] ForzaBlueNY: SRV
[5:57:09] QuesoBad0nga: A record converts name to IP
[5:57:11] Thedulus: Could work with a Srv entry
[5:57:12] banshay3: this shit can be so slow
[5:57:17] mechoriet: yes its a A record
[5:57:20] QuesoBad0nga: Alias is name to name
[5:57:22] tbossles: A = ipv4, AAAA = ipv6
[5:57:23] Langes01x: Can't you just add the port to the end of the address?
[5:57:26] pr00fster: You need CNAME for name to name, A for name to IP. DNS doesn't allow ports.
[5:57:27] ForzaBlueNY: same as with an autodiscovery record
[5:57:35] ImposterArchitect: SRV record can include a port
[5:57:37] fishypooos: !mc
[5:57:38] Moobot: Waffle finished setting up a vanilla 1.18 sub server. How can you join? Gotta be a Sub and use the IP mc.giantwaffle.tv | Connect to mclink.dries007.net in your minecraft client first to connect your twitch account, then you can access sub server.
[5:57:38] mechoriet: but for the whitelist you would need to do a SRV record cause its a different port
[5:57:45] The1_TS: its nothing to do with the port. The web server must see you coming to their url
[5:58:03] Miestro: you could try a SRV record with the name _minecraft._tcp pointing to the other domain and port as a load balance record
[5:58:04] fishypooos: -a
[5:58:05] ImposterArchitect: nslookup
[5:58:07] ImposterArchitect: -a
[5:58:45] mechoriet: SRV record
[5:58:47] QuesoBad0nga: thats becuase of the http server
[5:58:51] Miestro: you can use a SRV record
[5:58:52] Sanduckchan: its probably a reverse-proxy ion front?
[5:58:59] ImposterArchitect: @mechoriet has it correct
[5:59:23] Miestro: oh gross, move the domain to cloudflare KEKW
[5:59:27] mechoriet: you need to do it in the dns manager not a http forwarding KEKW
[5:59:29] QuesoBad0nga: its port 80 unless you specify it

[5:59:43] banshay3: www is something different
[5:59:47] The1_TS: you can't do it with an http port, minecraft doesn't speak http
[5:59:54] tbossles: http is a protocol, www is just a subdomain
[5:59:55] mechoriet: you need to do it in the dns manager not the webhosting part of forwarding
[5:59:58] GFQPR1882: @Giantwaffle ive put mc.giantwaffle.tv as the address but cant connect to the server
[6:00:00] Miestro: it's not HTTP
[6:00:02] wulfnorek: www is just subdomain
[6:00:05] Langes01x: It's assuming you're using it for web hosting
[6:00:07] GFQPR1882: @Giantwaffle and have linked
[6:00:11] orangecreamsicle3: auteursrechtenorganisatie quit ti
[6:00:11] JoshuaACasey: @Miestro i use cloudflare for everything. registrar, dns, static site host (cloudflare pages) ♡
[6:00:12] orangecreamsicle3: it
[6:00:16] KotsBeu: sorry
[6:00:18] TheSavageCoder: LOL HTTP?? 😂
[6:00:21] friendy_man: port 15555?
[6:00:21] KotsBeu: i just try to help him
[6:00:26] QuesoBad0nga: becuase you have to change cofig in http proxy server
[6:00:30] QuesoBad0nga: it is the virtual host
[6:00:30] haradok: remove http and www and leave port, wont work?
[6:00:39] Miestro: @Miestro yeah, ddi you see they're adding email and shit too? custom video streaming image hosting
[6:00:43] Miestro: they're adding so muhc stuff
[6:00:47] simik2: you can't do anything at dns level to redirect to a specific port
[6:00:49] Thedulus: Ionos
[6:00:55] mechoriet: @Giantwaffle https://www.ionos.com/help/domains/configuring-txt-and-srv-records/managing-srv-records/ this is what you need
[6:00:56] orangecreamsicle3: Pepega 's stop
[6:00:59] QuesoBad0nga: exactly
[6:01:01] Malaclypse17: what you need is a SRV record my dude
[6:01:02] Miestro: you can using a SRV record but it sounds like your registrar isn't allowing you to set it up correctly
[6:01:03] OwlBST: whoops I left your stream on for a whole day
[6:01:04] orangecreamsicle3: subs can do links
[6:01:07] onkelkonkel: KEKW poor non-subbed chatters
[6:01:12] pr00fster: You can, but you'll still need the port.
[6:01:17] daktheunknown8832: hi
[6:01:20] mechoriet: @Giantwaffle check my link above :)
[6:01:20] xDDmg: that would have to be handled on the server itself
[6:01:21] QuesoBad0nga: no becuase depens on the http sever that mc link uses
[6:01:35] Malaclypse17: wait what server is he using?
[6:01:39] jazzassin: hamachi tunnel bro
[6:01:43] orangecreamsicle3: his own Malaclypse17
[6:01:43] Miestro: SRV
[6:01:45] Sanduckchan: srv
[6:01:48] mechoriet: SRV
[6:01:53] Miestro: which is meant for loadbalancing
[6:01:56] Malaclypse17: yeah sure, but is he using, official, paper, spiggot?
[6:01:57] piwo_se: For a CNAME you need a . at the end of the thing you are aliasing to if it's outside your own domain
[6:01:59] ken9128: CNAME
[6:02:01] mechoriet: _minecraft
[6:02:17] mechoriet: 1 and 1
[6:02:24] mechoriet: doesnt matter
[6:02:28] mechoriet: thats fine
[6:02:28] aylamar: set wait as low as possible, priority won't matter
[6:02:30] Malaclypse17: weight 0 and prio 5
[6:02:34] Miestro: service is _minecraft protocol TCP, prio doens't matter
[6:02:35] TheSavageCoder: SRV is pretty much A record with a Port, put very simply
[6:02:37] Malaclypse17: _minecraft
[6:02:37] Miestro: _minecraft
[6:02:38] KotsBeu: TTL to 60
[6:02:39] mechoriet: _minecraft
[6:02:40] nxusr: _minecraft service _tcp protocol
[6:02:40] Charlesiv: those are for load balancing basically
[6:02:45] mechoriet: _tcp for protocol
[6:02:59] fishypooos: @orangecreamsicle3 did he build the server himself out of interest or is it a minecraft OOTB image type thing?
[6:03:04] Miestro: port is whatever you needed
[6:03:08] Miestro: the target should be the other domain
[6:03:10] KotsBeu: ttl 60
[6:03:13] mechoriet: TTL 60
[6:03:14] aylamar: TTL is time to live
[6:03:14] Charlesiv: time to live
[6:03:15] KnickKen: time to life
[6:03:15] Malaclypse17: default is okay, time to live
[6:03:15] Miestro: TTL can be auto or 60 min
[6:03:16] nxusr: anything low is fine
[6:03:16] banshay3: time to live
[6:03:17] QuesoBad0nga: Time to live
[6:03:17] Syrenthra: ttl is time to live
[6:03:17] wulfnorek: time to live
[6:03:17] mechoriet: seconds
[6:03:17] brage123_fl: Can i seeeeeeee

[6:03:34] tbossles: live as in biological life
[6:03:35] nxusr: 1min is good
[6:03:36] SlrKnight: TTL means time to live default normally people use 5 mins
[6:03:37] The1_TS: seconds until it will fall out of peoples dns cache
[6:03:37] KotsBeu: 1 min
[6:03:39] mechoriet: 1 min is good enough
[6:03:43] TrickyHi: 5 min is fine
[6:03:45] Miestro: target should be the other domain though. This is important. not your servers IP @Giantwaffle
[6:03:45] Myekos: it doesn't matter, you don't have a redundant to fail over to
[6:03:56] piwo_se: yes
[6:03:57] Miestro: yes
[6:03:59] TheSavageCoder: TTL is how long computers will remember a DNS result before it goes back. 1 hour is usually safe. if you aren't charged for DNS, 1 min works

[6:56:53] Sevrene: Lahee?
[6:56:55] bictage: shiny pokedex in any Pokemon game
[6:57:00] Larklen: Its a completely optional thing for just a mount, so its not actually needed KEKW

[7:02:52] enderslug: Are star citizen NFTs a thing yet?
[7:02:55] DrSwank: Isn’t NFT in gaming just Steam Item trading outside of Steam?

[7:03:39] Driitzz: DrSwank it is , but instead of money it's cryptocurrency that then you convert into money
[7:03:47] DrSwank: I’m not sure why that is bad?
[7:03:54] Sevrene: I mean can't NFTs be literally anything you feel like making it?
[7:03:57] Apparentthreat: but isn't the point of these items is to say "I have GiantWaffle's xyz" Wouldn't certain items be worth more then?
[7:03:57] elf_machine: Basically it means you own your digital assets

[7:05:42] 0rangelight: At least you have gold tho...
[7:05:45] lonelyemojii: @elf_machine this. people as of now just think of monkey pics sadly and shout scam and money laundering or whatever everyone is saying
[7:05:48] Apparentthreat: but gold is actually useful
[7:05:54] Chronoes: gold is useful though
[7:05:55] elf_machine: @elf_machine 100%
[7:05:56] celadriel23: banks are useful though?
[7:05:57] emanymanheman: I would feel better about NFTs if the websites that hosted the sellign of them would actually crack down on copyright infringements and people stealing others art and making it their own NFT to sell
[7:05:59] Takii: You say you hate mivrotransactions, yet you spent thousands on PoE

[7:07:04] DrSwank: Thousands, yeesh
[7:07:04] kakefisk: Its rich people and banks afraid of bitcoing. Beacuse every investment made on bitcoin is investment not made in bloated bit corp stocks. That only exsists to make the rich richer.
[7:07:12] resku89: @quickypie Yes youll be a millionaire tomorrow.
[7:07:13] Driitzz: quickypie thats just a loss , to make any money at all you have to invest at a minimum 15k$
[7:07:22] Larklen: People ready to hate on NFT's for "stealing other peoples art/ideas" but turn blind eye to litterally every other online shop and 'artist alley' at conventions KEKW

[7:51:50] Arimil: One of our managers converted our entire database into an excel sheet so they could more easily search it.
[7:51:51] Variosit: dude
[7:51:53] kakefisk: they use visma at work. But, its sooo bad.

[7:52:02] metalwrath22222: thats a big facepalm
[7:52:04] Larklen: @Arimil what...
[7:52:04] Zicore47: such excel files are daily business sadly
[7:52:05] TrickyHi: @Giantwaffle I know of a schoolboard that keeps all student records in an excel sheet on onedrive.
[7:52:07] iriskcriesinbed: Excel is a fantastic application but not a replacement for a real DB
[7:52:09] MushuTushu: Excel has a 1m row limit
[7:52:14] Arimil: @Larklen They did it by hand.
[7:52:22] Arimil: They also got fired a month later.
[7:52:27] Larklen: PainPeko emote here
[7:52:28] Klorell: 3 million lines excel are common when you extract finance eports from erp
[7:52:28] LiL_LiLi_ALi: the company that i'm in is the num 1 plastic box maker and we use excel
[7:52:29] dzigsaw: You don't understand, but at the same time you do understand why so much is so slow and around 20 corners

[7:53:59] L707644: Just throw some fire potions KEKW
[7:54:14] Apparentthreat: Chronoes problem w/ excel and similar programs is they don't allow for automation as easily. You have to run a program against a static file and god forbid it's an xlsx file instead of csv.
