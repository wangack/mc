[2:14:56] fishflip: Btw Minecraft is on the game pass so subs can join if you’ve got it!
[2:14:58] stormblaz: did anyone even played that halo rts lol
[2:14:58] WDForty: 5 and Wars are not in MCC, but it has all the number'd games

[2:16:44] Pyanthar: o/
[2:16:45] cazabel: G2A is the reason why companies geolock
[2:17:00] stormblaz: marshmallows in hot coco or no?

[2:22:59] ShinyBadger: an xp cart or tiny shop so you need to travel
[2:23:25] MarquesCoding: @Giantwaffle For mending items, it has to be dropped xp, not player inventory xp
[2:23:25] JamesySmithy: you can make a sign into a 4 or 5 row gui with infinite of the item
[2:23:29] DeMayon: why dont you just use a repair plugin
[2:23:29] VengeanceUM: repair plugin?
[2:23:32] 5mOkEwOw: I remember having a sign for xp levels
[2:23:35] CMDR_WeeJet: can you use something to edit the values xp bottles give so you can make them give like 5 levels worth of xp?
[2:23:46] FaustinM: repairs items
[2:23:47] MarquesCoding: you could just have a sign that just repairs the tool btw...
[2:23:55] MarquesCoding: sorry for copy and paste
[2:24:00] DeadeyeWolff: If you want a quick way to gain experience points or even experience levels in the game, you can use the /xp command to add as much experience as you need (see also the /experience command).
[2:24:15] MarquesCoding: @DeadeyeWolff that won't work, because mending requires you to have dropped xp

[2:24:40] Soraffe: @Giantwaffle If you add the plugin World Edit, you can easily destroy things that shouldn't be there or clear out areas.
[2:24:48] Myekos: can you just set xp for all players to max lvl ?

[2:48:47] mikalway: probably
[2:48:50] Kevincav: oh it was a single command
[2:48:53] Johnhugem: @Tompop23 Because we use 230V in the UK our electric kettles boil faster, generally speaking American kettles take alot longer

[2:50:45] XxTeam48LowesXx: Wont take long pepeLaugh
[2:50:47] LUCIFER_RA: natural gas is common in households for decades across west, and it is cheap, so there was no real need for electric kettles

[5:46:54] MrDroolBucket: build it bigger is soo cool @Giantwaffle and also big bigger and biggest
[5:46:58] Crizzle777: What they will start doing is just hire devs across the country so that COL shit won't matter
[5:47:03] 0sem0: Thanks for the warp waffle

[5:50:44] Sypheron: Or maybe they do and are just having fun LUL
[5:50:50] Kevincav: It's not FAANG anymore :), It's MANGA or MAAAN if you use alphabet instead of google
[5:50:59] johnshepherd104: Architects make devs do their coding, game comes out confusing

[5:53:15] Yukigumii: what is that drawing LUL
[5:53:22] Robohornet: @Kevincav It was FANG originally so Netflix was there from the start because it is/was the dominant company in streaming
[5:53:23] Notikk: what was the abomination Kappa
[5:53:26] xdeadlycatcherx1: what dat
[5:53:28] daemonaedryn: So you want two stair cases on the sides with a waterfall in the middle

[5:54:11] Yukigumii: like a cave entrance surrounded by waterfalls
[5:54:13] Kevincav: @Crizzle777 We think of big-n as the massive tech companies that have their hands everywhere.  Google, msft, amazon they all have consumer products, enterprise, hardware, etc...  Netflix has... well netflix really.  Plus it's like 100 employees.  So no I don't see it as big-n.
[5:54:13] daemonaedryn: Maybe that pool splits into small cannals that travel all through the city?

[5:55:38] Kevincav: @Robohornet *shrug*, I never really considered it big-n tbh.  At this rate I'm basically looking at working at all of the big-n so the more there is the harder it is for me.

[5:56:26] LUCIFER_RA: you know what would be sick. if the arm was the bridge
[5:56:27] Kevincav: Netflix does one thing, they're absolutely solid at it, but it's only 1 area.
[5:56:31] Crizzle777: Are you full stack then Kevincav front end focused?

[5:57:16] Robohornet: @Kevincav It originally fit within the selection criteria for FANG when the term was coined. You make a valid argument for why it no longer fits due to evolution of the term tho
[5:57:18] kinglouisxvii: kekw

[6:33:11] kieranm_123: SLABS WOULD WORK PERFECT
[6:33:14] Enforcer__: Kevincav im gonna assume that i7 is boosting to 4.8 and the xeon is probably baseline at 3.5

[6:34:12] Frecked: :)
[6:34:15] Enforcer__: Kevincav my guess is, the base of the i7 was lower than the xeon, but even still, its throttling and probably hurting its own performance due to all the back n forth.  just a theory
[6:34:23] Du_woasd_scho: we all know what waffles "temporary" means KEKW

[6:55:31] Caritien: Just use a dome tool (ie: it tells you the blocks) and you make the center piece longer so it's like a bowl shape

[7:19:30] daemonaedryn: Probably
[7:19:30] pr00fster: @Giantwaffle  Worst part is you need to replicate on other side as well.
[7:19:31] Kerstez: maybe just a L bend instead
[7:19:36] daemonaedryn: But who knows the equation
[7:19:37] llevi_rs: yeah in order to go down that far you need a bigger circle lol
[7:19:42] undeniablyrexer: the steps don't necessarily need to curve.  There are some curved staircases that us straight steps

[7:21:01] Crom1974: @Giantwaffle  what r u trying to do is not possible , im a mathematician ... your stair are too narrow and the stairs in the outer side should be bigger , even if u approach the numbers visual it will suck ... nice try though
[7:21:03] GoRilla2015: we should have an OCD trigger warning KEKW i nearly cant watch this <3
[7:21:17] orangecreamsicle3: @Crom1974 FeelsWeirdMan

[7:21:37] pukeborn: Back to original plan!
[7:21:39] Goldps1: its unique
[7:21:43] daemonaedryn: Could still technically have the same style, just go straight forward then straight left?
[7:21:43] preparedincanada: You can do and "L" shape staircase, might be good
[7:21:50] KandieMan: Imagine it as a radius and step down linearly from the center
[7:21:53] slothfarms: if you could get it to work it would look top dollar, but is it worth the pain? probably not
[7:21:53] preparedincanada: For both sides
[7:22:00] Robohornet: there is probably a spiral staircase generator out there for minecraft
