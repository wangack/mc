[0:17:11] Kyoame: Otherwise, Kitty, I'll ask for something
[0:17:14] BlastJordan563: @Vinka90 Hello! DinoDance
[0:17:47] TheWormbo: advancement time?
[0:17:49] poisso3: I have been putting off fighting the dragon and End City raiding, but I think I will be doing that soon as I have become a little unmotivated to keep building.
[0:17:54] TheWormbo: ah, not quite
[0:18:00] everknitter: shulker sounds, or the zombie from terraria dying sound
[0:18:04] h4ppy61lm0urj1337: while fighting shulkers I always get the issue where they teleport INSIDE blocks. divert annoying
[0:18:10] GingerTheLily: @h4ppy61lm0urj1337 pixlriPride pixlriPride
[0:18:15] lewkgee: I'd never thought of the water bucket to drag oneself down when shulkered. This is the thing i've learned today. Thankyou.
[0:18:20] BlastJordan563: @h4ppy61lm0urj1337 Hello! <3 DinoDance
[0:18:25] Kyoame: I'm the opposite, @poisso3 , cannot build if I have no shulkers Xd
[0:18:35] moah_mcplayer: Are there people in this live plays Minecraft pocket edition cuz I do
[0:18:57] nekoithecupcake: the dragon fight is easier than it looks, I followed Pix's advice for preparation and got the dragon first try!
[0:19:04] GingerTheLily: @nekoithecupcake GG!
[0:19:12] Kyoame: I have it, I don't play it. I used when I was bored or nothing to do between classes to design buildings Xd
[0:19:12] moah_mcplayer: Gg
[0:19:13] nekoithecupcake: shulkers are much more of a pain honestly
[0:19:19] BlastJordan563: @nekoithecupcake Nicely done!
[0:19:28] fragglemeat: 'deleted by scenery' is the saddest epitaph
[0:19:31] poisso3: @Kyoame I have been doing just that for a while. Not easy LUL
[0:19:35] nekoithecupcake: Thank you guys! :heart:

[0:20:37] ozzynakashima: that’s the pause command ginger lol
[0:20:42] jenny_b14: yes @gingerthelily  that would make building easier for sure
[0:20:56] moah_mcplayer: Yess tho
[0:21:08] GingerTheLily: @jenny_b14 It sure would!
[0:21:09] AbsentNyx: I haven't played mc in a while but joined a server this week and have played a little bit. Boy do I get rusty when I don't play. And I lose all faith in my ability to not die HypeLUL

[0:21:32] GingerTheLily: @AbsentNyx your dying skills are very high though!
[0:21:33] BlastJordan563: @CommissarFeesh Hello! DinoDance <3
[0:21:36] fragglemeat: walking into the arrow store, 'one arrow please!'
[0:21:39] nekoithecupcake: Only thing I recommend about the dragon fight: practice your long-distance shots a LOT. Also, never ever forget your extra blocks to make a tower or platform with. Very useful against the endermen if you dont like to use the pumpkin head
[0:21:46] Kyoame: I'm wondering, do the ppl with japanese nicknames now what the name say?
[0:21:47] BlastJordan563: @AbsentNyx Going out in style is a skill! LUL

[0:23:42] Kyoame: Sorry. Famimart, typing it in English feels weird
[0:23:44] BlastJordan563: @Neongod_22 Hello Ne! LUL DinoDance <3
[0:23:53] poisso3: @GingerTheLily I switch between Hard and Peaceful. When I am building, I don't like being attacked, but I do like the challenge of exploring on Hard.
[0:23:56] IrishRodent: I am looking forward to the auto  crafter just to craft iron bars into blocks automatically.
[0:24:05] ozzynakashima: @kyoame what about family mart?
[0:24:19] BlastJordan563: @ozzynakashima LUL
[0:24:22] Bedrig: why didn't you just filter the flowers? why the extra sorters?

[0:30:29] Bedrig: Do you think they will allow the ability to stifle the chortle of the skulk sensors for more hidden detectors??
[0:30:32] tuff_st: Why weren't bundles added to the game?

[0:39:12] distilledbiscuits: Opinion on the sniffer?
[0:39:12] Kyoame: @Mas0nIsTheGreat think if as a learning experience. You start copying and following tutorials to understand about the reasoning behind and develop your own like that
[0:39:12] patidi: theton2HYPE djdesc1Ravekitty
[0:39:23] Kyoame: think it*
[0:39:26] Rob_42: AI?  Pix IS the AI
[0:39:26] GingerTheLily: @tuff_st When he gets his office back!
[0:39:27] yk_king_28: why not just use the same title as twitch.
[0:39:34] IrishRodent: It's funny to me that those are the last two shulkers you found in that city, lol

[0:40:13] tuff_st: @gingerthelily isn't he streaming inside his office😅
[0:40:27] Mas0nIsTheGreat: @ozzynakashima ok
[0:40:28] yk_king_28: do it in the thumbnail the date and else
[0:40:39] Another_JT: sometimes it's just a bit too ambient
[0:40:44] GingerTheLily: @tuff_st Yes, but he has a guest using it as a bedroom, so he can't spend all day editing stuff/
[0:40:54] dumdum_mister: I need end raiding gear with prot 4. Most of my stuff has fire protection and that leaves me vulnerable with shulker pellets.
[0:40:55] phisig: @Pixlriffs what's the feature you're looking forward to in 1.21 ?
[0:41:14] Kyoame: @Mas0nIsTheGreat grian had a series called "building school" that is nice to see, but you also got Bdubs that tends to explain why he does what he does

[1:20:41] mummybear6053: w
[1:20:41] fragglemeat: ...and it will always going to be orange concrete if there's concrete, so you don't need to try every color
[1:20:53] GingerTheLily: or pink glazed terracotta
[1:21:08] BrokenPhysics13: or blue trimmed leather armor
[1:21:09] wakejilliams12: Some type of terracota possibly?
