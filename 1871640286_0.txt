[0:23:00] Viaurora: use the axe
[0:23:02] RubelliteFae: but the etymology.... absolute's not in there originally: "Perhaps a borrowing of a Lydian word for ‚Äúking‚Äù or a similar word in another language of Asia Minor.  Compare Hittite [script needed] (≈°arawana≈°), [script needed] (tarawana≈°), Philistine ê§àê§ìê§ç (·π≠rn, ‚Äúlord, ruler‚Äù), and Etruscan êåïêåñêåìêåèêåç (turon, ‚Äúmistress, lady‚Äù), a surname of Venus, which is probably related."

[0:24:16] RubelliteFae: What's Briony's lore for fighting the dragon?
[0:24:22] Nightjar: NOPERS Kirsty and her anti-dragon propaganda

[0:30:19] AnalogueDroid: around the isle, there is another teleport surrounded by cobble?
[0:30:21] Nightsharm: around the edge should be floating 1x1 portals surrounded by bedrock
[0:30:30] swornsta: now on the perrimieter of the isldand you will see a mini portal thing that you have to throw an ender pearl into

[0:32:37] Faaafv: you can just build up to it and trapdoor yourself to get in
[0:32:38] darkvamp79: Climb up to it
[0:32:44] chironicle: Sneeze brionyPeep
[0:32:48] seymour47: I would use a trap door to go into crawl mode and go in that way. It's safer.
[0:32:54] Viaurora: build up and build a platform just below and throw enderpearl
[0:32:55] RufusTheHairyCatWrangler: rat your way in if you can make a hatch
[0:33:20] kingzan: That's not an ender pearl.

[0:37:43] Faaafv: now you want to find end cities preferably with a floating boat
[0:37:45] Redstonemonster: can shoot the flowers with arrows to knock them off
[0:37:47] Nightsharm: iirc the cities spawn on a grid, so when you find one it should be easy to find others
[0:37:53] swornsta: so the islands here are in a grid and on that same grid are the floating boats that you will find elytras in

[2:06:21] RubelliteFae: rubellLove
[2:06:23] RufusTheHairyCatWrangler: you can put stuff into a shulker while it's in your inventory. Need to put it down to get the stuff out though
[2:06:42] murderbird: I thought a shulker box inside of another caused a rift and opens a gateway into the astral plane.
[2:06:50] HoboWith2Shotguns: you can also Dye them
[2:06:57] murderbird: It was that a bag of holding? I forget. ü§î

[2:08:18] Viaurora: 1 gunpowder plus 1 paper (do not USE colored fireworks with elytra it will KILL you)
[2:08:29] RubelliteFae: That's why Minecraft Steve is the strongest video game character. He can walk around with an inv of shulkers full of gold.
[2:08:31] RubelliteFae: Meaning he can carry more atoms than the universe contains.
[2:08:51] RufusTheHairyCatWrangler: I have been forced to change my position on the matter. Coke is now the superior drink, ever since they started putting sweetener in classic Pepsi and it tastes bad now

[2:10:39] RufusTheHairyCatWrangler: Briony, you're a gamer; you can do this
[2:11:09] kacs_ky: to make it back to the main island you'd either have to build a pole at least 2000 blocks up, make a bridge 2000 blocks across, or find one of those enderpearl tps
[2:11:30] JamesKingOfKent: JamesKingOfKent subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 56 months!

[2:14:35] Im_Just_Hannah: this miiiight end in disaster
[2:14:39] RufusTheHairyCatWrangler: they don't know how to rat brionyGiggle they lack the critical information
[2:14:42] georgehehheh: LUL
[2:14:52] 3v1lc0w: HAPPERS
[2:14:53] HoboWith2Shotguns: it forces you into swim mode if you place it on the bottom of the block at head height
[2:14:58] georgehehheh: Faaafv's real voice hryPog

[2:37:42] HoboWith2Shotguns: No that's an iron farm
[2:37:45] RaiyneV: no you turn them into zombies and cure them
[2:37:49] HoboWith2Shotguns: you scare them with a zombie to spawn golems
[2:37:49] RaiyneV: and then you get a discount
[2:37:52] TheEternalUser: D:
[2:37:58] Voltzzocker: EARPERS
[2:38:08] AnalogueDroid: if you save one from zombificatioon they can be cheaper right?
[2:38:19] RaiyneV: If they turn to zombles and you cure them they give you a good discount but only the one who cured
[2:38:22] chironicle: I think if they are turned into a zombie and you cure them they sell stuff for cheaper, not 100% sure though
[2:38:50] Viaurora: nope you need to cast a potion of weakness and a crafted golden apple to cure zombie villager back to normal several times in a row to get the 1 emerald per item sold
[2:39:23] 3v1lc0w: it's not like kirsty will log in and zombify every villager during the week daveCheck
[2:39:28] georgehehheh: @viaurora once is enough to reduce it a lot thou
[2:39:32] georgehehheh: though
[2:39:58] Viaurora: they said for 1 emerald and that is what is required for that trick
[2:39:59] Captain_byrd: But Rythian is the Zombie guy
[2:40:07] HoboWith2Shotguns: if you wanted to, make sure the server is on hard first!
[2:40:19] RaiyneV: theoretically, you just gotta get a zombie in there, then make sure they don't burn up, and then use a potion and golden apple. but only theoretical
[2:40:19] fireeld: they can be found in mountain bioms
[2:40:23] Viaurora: trade crops and iron farm are best way to get emeralds
[2:40:24] HoboWith2Shotguns: you can only find emeralds in certain biomes right?
[2:40:25] Voltzzocker: i think they spawn more in mountains
[2:40:27] HoboWith2Shotguns: or is that an old thing
[2:40:30] ginjninj: dont think as rare, but the veins are smaller like 1 or 2 blocks
[2:40:31] avocamentum: Zombie guy, across all games, it‚Äôs cannon
[2:40:37] HoboWith2Shotguns: Make a fletcher and trade sticks for Emeralds
[2:40:42] HoboWith2Shotguns: that is the easiest way early on
[2:41:12] swornsta: you would have lived in the end with the friendermans
[2:41:14] Im_Just_Hannah: well you took ages to figure out where you wanted to settle, so you may have never settled :')

[2:43:54] TyrsHTML: HONK SO HO
[2:43:59] Viaurora: rythian put a bucket of lava down in a hole  or light the seeds up with flint and steel to burn them up or they can cause lag as they take 5 realtime minutes to despawn
[2:44:08] RaiyneV: I love seeing fifi's name through the wall KEKW

[2:47:53] kacs_ky: as a so called "baby" who uses landlines as part of their work yes I do know the sound
[2:48:02] falla_softpaw: It makes me feel so old!
[2:48:19] Viaurora: lol i lived with dialup for over 15 years before we got a better system
[2:48:26] JPcursed: i only ever experienced dialup once and that was enough
[2:48:40] falla_softpaw: I have the Windows startup noise in my head now for some reason
