[2:54:00] ThermiteTheFur: RAVS. I read the sentient sword stuff and, in an anvil, put the sword on the left and a tartaric gem on the right.
[2:54:03] NoReturnGaming_: the electrical age mod is is both interesting and frustrating at the same time
[2:54:06] hgfhdhss: don't you need recipes in the interfaces? ravsThink
[2:54:28] XainXahk: i've only used interfaces for patern crafting
[2:54:35] Jeff_Darkfire: can either use an exporter, or some form of item transportation between them
[2:54:40] Power46: You need a crafter in RS
[2:54:48] yingdomo03: bees are over
[2:54:53] yingdomo03: no more beez
[2:54:55] drbomb: So, if you set up an interface, I think you have to pull out the items still
[2:54:57] starlitesparkl3: duncan try to put it on the top side?
[2:55:03] wally314garcia: bees are over, time for sky of diamonds

[2:55:53] starlitesparkl3: but he also needs an exported
[2:55:54] Zzorkblart: you have to put an AE recipe into the interface so it knows what it's meant to do; ie: export x items, and import y back

[2:56:26] DaBossWade: import brings stuff into the system, you want steel blocks on the export
[2:56:41] thomasnelson4: You have it backwards. Importers will just import to the system, but exporters are needed to send items to things.
