[0:45:09] raion564: Why not the fly machine??
[0:45:10] obitwokanoby: smallant are you able to make a lag machine to make the time that it takes the item frame to break longer?

[0:45:31] scpoder: what is a shuckler?
[0:45:33] blueapple_64: @cr4bsx he got all the enchanting tables thru a snapshot version of mc. That version had been used to debug some stuff, so you spawn with enchant tables
[0:45:33] thsgrn: @ShazamPasteleiro !skyblock
[0:45:33] itcamwdcbook: would it work if you find an elytra on the edge of a chunk, turn render distance down, and send a flying machine to catch it while you turn render distance up?
[0:45:41] baddvader: what if you build a platform way below the elytra to catch it
[0:45:47] pepper9_: You're gonna get so many item frames

[0:50:32] sniearrs: @Inkiiy yes but a friday in wisconsin means something veryyy different than most places
[0:50:33] maxthechillbot: @shuov he needs to get an elytra and was doing a poll to see if chat would let him back up the world and retry with one elytra or he has to try different ones if he fails

[0:50:55] Cammywhamy: @jmangh888 the timer in the bottom left is how long he has worked on this skyblick world

[0:52:29] filipitiyorkis: how did he get the shulkers?
[0:52:29] thsgrn: Easy way to test for certain is just have a redstone repeater line go three chunks out and then come back
[0:52:43] thsgrn: flick a lever and see if the signal comes back or not
[0:52:48] porkychopies: if a flying machine flys under an itemframebefore the frameis loaded when the frame is loaded it will fall into the flyingmachine

[0:53:38] thsgrn: @CycloN_LIVE wiki kinda ambiguously implies it might do something. given the time it saves if it works and how easy it is to test it's worth testing here lol
[0:53:45] BooKnQuiL: I kept watching the clips though, and now I'm interested in speedrunning again, last time was a year ago. Who knew digits of pi would make me want to do speedruns
[0:53:50] thsgrn: @beagri he went through an end portal. :P
[0:53:51] Halmiccc: can you make a flying machine long enough that u just stay at the back and it catches it in the front as soon as the chunk loads chat?
[0:53:52] RonitG1204: if I remember right that pi thing did happened during skyblock

[1:07:22] TheCodaMinecraft: @5quidwyrm you just need do download addons and put them in a folder but on java you need to download forge and java and the mods and its a lot harder

[1:08:36] devine_cmd: @Inkiiy it's also a curse cause i just straight up forget some german words where the english one makes more sense in my head
[1:08:37] catcatmegan: learning/keeping up with another language can be such a pain imo

[4:40:18] sam_ham_22: PAGGING
[4:40:19] heather_storme: EZ
[4:40:23] PyjamaMole: they arent that hard NODDERS
[4:40:24] adiman_: how do you make it stop ?
[4:40:27] mrmasterapprentice: smallant is smort
[4:40:27] Rimimimimimimimm: Smallant isnt even good at minecraft he just has a good headset, with that headset id make the same worl
[4:40:28] svm22: i think i saw a video once that had something similar to that device
[4:40:30] RopTopGanes: Roptop raid
[4:40:36] missionimpossible_: sorry if this is a dumb question but how did he get to the end?
[4:40:38] RopTopGanes: i'm raiding with 1 person
[4:40:41] lord_manda333: All it takes is 8 blocks. Wow.
[4:40:42] RonitG1204: just make this 10x10 maybe
[4:40:43] itazake: nice last minecraft vid√©o ;)
[4:40:49] mrmasterapprentice: @SmallAnt is very smort
[4:40:51] SuperFire92_: 12
[4:40:53] PyjamaMole: 12
[4:40:54] gutgyk1234: 12
[4:40:59] zombiehatt: 12 pwe piston

[4:41:01] kirbo123490: 12
[4:41:05] mrmasterapprentice: 12
[4:41:05] Rimimimimimimimm: @mrmasterapprentice no he just has a good gaming headset
[4:41:06] DrewD64: 13
[4:41:06] Kirito2508: Im currently watching the entire series on YT. I am at the gold farm sorting system video. Do you ever get trouble there with chicken jockey drops? cause my inner OCD is crying RN
[4:41:11] DrewD64: 12
[4:41:21] gutgyk1234: MAX IS 12
[4:41:21] strawberry_taco: What happens if an armor stand with frost walker boots goes over water?
[4:41:24] LightningZach: redstone
[4:41:24] usingername_: too many blocks
[4:41:25] PyjamaMole: too many blocks NODDERS
[4:41:29] JexBus: hello
[4:41:31] kirbo123490: 12 blocks
[4:41:33] RonitG1204: these are like 25 blocks
[4:41:35] magicquoquo: ????
[4:41:36] missionimpossible_: the water will be removed
[4:41:38] logmania: hmm
[4:41:46] gutgyk1234: MY DESIGN WONT WORK!! NOOOOO
[4:41:49] mrmasterapprentice: @SmallAnt is very smort
[4:41:49] SuperTheUnderDog: can you make 2 go at once to make it wider?
[4:41:50] Rimimimimimimimm: PUT WATER IN HOPPER
[4:41:58] Rimimimimimimimm: PUT WATER IN CAULDRON*
[4:41:58] livipup: atirelHmm So, do you need to repeatedly make an infinite water source?
[4:42:02] Eldoil: ice
[4:42:03] PyjamaMole: I believe water logges stairs need to be moved using 0 ticks
[4:42:05] deadlydrumer0: leaves?
[4:42:07] Ishigh: @gutgyk1234 Guy stop screaming
[4:42:23] RonitG1204: droppers?
[4:42:25] linklingboy: linkusBlur linkusBlur linkusBlur
[4:42:27] happy_boi84: finally he‚Äôs gonna get the elytra Pog
[4:42:32] RedCoded5: you might need 0-ticks
[4:42:33] PyjamaMole: @RonitG1204 not movable
[4:42:34] SuperTheUnderDog: So would adding a repeater help to add delay?
[4:42:35] RonitG1204: sorry dispensers
[4:42:36] willartron07: how many shulker shells did get?
[4:42:36] mrmasterapprentice: check mumbo jumbo vid
[4:42:41] PyjamaMole: @RedCoded5 I think so yes
[4:42:42] mrmasterapprentice: he has something about this
[4:42:44] coolbeanzforlif7: Watch the ilmango video for water part
[4:42:45] RopTopGanes: atirelHmm
[4:42:46] gutgyk1234: an ill mango
[4:42:49] yompop9: massive iq smallant
[4:42:50] RonitG1204: @pyjamamole oh I forgot
[4:42:51] AntusX: THE GOAT
[4:42:51] higildypiggldy: could you have a four cycle system? piston, dispense, dispense, piston? or do pistons not push dispensers
[4:42:56] DrewD64: ilmango the GOAT
[4:42:56] kccrimson_: Does it matter where the water source is coming from? Like a specific block
[4:42:58] livipup: @RoptopGanes atirelHmm
[4:43:00] tyler86496: @willartron07 he has over 10 stacks in one of his chests
[4:43:03] Ishigh: @willartron07 about a chest I believe
[4:43:03] Rimimimimimimimm: How did you even get to the end in Skyblock???
[4:43:04] sam_ham_22: @redcoded5 zeero tick is removed from game, isn't it??
[4:43:07] kirbo123490: smolEvil
[4:43:09] Inkiiy: Mumbo Jumbo is is greaat but he uses an entity moving mod!
[4:43:17] yompop9: has he got to the end yet?
[4:43:28] RedCoded5: @sam_ham_22 no, 0-ticks for farms has been patched
[4:43:38] logmania: @yompop9 yeah beaten the dragon and got shulker farm
[4:43:38] blombingo: @yompop9 long time ago
[4:43:40] SuperTheUnderDog: Can you try the Bedrock design and see if anything doesn't work in Java maybe?
[4:43:47] sam_ham_22: @redcoded5 oh ok
[4:44:03] Coltanzebot: what are you doing
[4:44:03] RonitG1204: observers didn‚Äôt existed 3 years ago? I thought they were like 7 years old
[4:44:06] PyjamaMole: I am pretty sure observers were a thing? they were added in 2016 lycelEyes
[4:44:11] mrmasterapprentice: why you use crimson planks?
[4:44:19] logmania: @coltanzebot making a machine to catch an elytra
[4:44:24] krambalamba: what are your thoughts on pointcrow
[4:44:30] RonitG1204: @pyjamamole same
[4:44:37] khaosking6: i just joined what are you doing rn
[4:44:38] vaxvea28: hey smant
[4:44:39] logmania: nether wood is good NODDERS
[4:44:40] yesntloI: @krambalamba did they have beef or something?
[4:44:41] Rimimimimimimimm: ohhh Im guessing it needs to be a infinite source to fill auto ig
[4:44:41] blombingo: @krambalamba Great Guy
[4:44:49] LightningZach: @krambalamba don‚Äôt go there
[4:44:50] livipup: @mrmasterapprentice they're friends
[4:44:52] kirbo123490: same y crimson
[4:44:53] Rimimimimimimimm: infinite water sauce mechanic thats why
[4:45:00] zackrourke27: brain hurt
[4:45:02] RedstoneJunkie: If it doesn't fill forwards could you slow down the flying machine?
[4:45:11] doubletroble6: maybe waterlogged slabs?
[4:45:14] Joking_Ace: Dont know Minecraft physics :/
[4:45:14] nochincio: WAYERLOGGED THINGS
[4:45:15] spiralhornet09: maybe it moves like half at a time?
[4:45:18] Kerico: I really don't think this is possible in unmodded java
[4:45:35] michaelman3117: what is this cmachine
[4:45:36] khaosking6: @SmallAnt why dont you take a flying machine then just build the water thing after with buckets??
[4:45:41] michaelman3117: machine*
[4:45:42] StevanM02: Maybe if you let the water fall a block and push the machine in that direction?
[4:45:54] strawberry_taco: what if you put blocks around the slab
[4:45:59] RedCoded5: yes ilmango uses 0-ticks to move the water so you probably should look at his design because it's more involved than observers
[4:46:01] Inkiiy: hi wtf observers are 7/8 years old
[4:46:01] sam_ham_22: Unmodded Java doesn't allow entity to push through pistons I think
[4:46:11] AllegedlyBenny: maybe you have to 0-tick the waterlogged block? i could be making stuff up
[4:46:13] vaxvea28: what are you trying to do??
[4:46:15] Galnis96: might misremeber, but think it has to be 1tick moved to retain it's water
[4:46:16] MaxUumen: dropper and water bucket
[4:46:17] 3_bluray_copies_of_Shrek2: What happens with cauldrons being pushed?
[4:46:21] Mindstormz: I found a design with observers by SciSyf. He fully explains the design, and shows how to build it.
[4:46:22] Rimimimimimimimm: I think you need it to auto fill an infinite source?
[4:46:22] PiepieweenieOSRS: mangrove roots i think
[4:46:23] sam_ham_22: Cauldrons?
[4:46:23] average_antt: Goodnight
[4:46:24] RedCoded5: no
[4:46:25] CageyRogue: fences i think
[4:46:29] RonitG1204: @strawberry_taco result should be same
[4:46:29] R_Stark12: stairs maybe?
[4:46:30] RedCoded5: unless 0 ticked
[4:46:31] TheFireDem0n: stairs
[4:46:34] BehIsReal: try leaves
[4:46:36] doubletroble6: maybe mangrove roots?
[4:46:36] mrmasterapprentice: push waterlog the leaves first
[4:46:37] coolbeanzforlif7: chest/
[4:46:38] missionimpossible_: pretty sure you need to 0-tick it for it to work
[4:46:39] PiepieweenieOSRS: mangrove roots
[4:46:42] S2unna: whats going on
[4:46:42] callmefrenzy2: chests?
[4:46:45] Rimimimimimimimm: fence gate/ signs???
[4:46:47] iansonofthor_: Mangrove roots?
[4:46:50] BehIsReal: Leaves
[4:46:52] Galnis96: use a button on the piston to 0 tick it
[4:46:56] QuantumRand: Can you push water itself?
[4:46:56] mrchickenman682: mangrove roots I think
[4:46:57] vaxvea28: what if you push it into water
[4:47:01] MissingPxl: Leaves maybe
[4:47:01] jameswilko_: can you push like a surrounded source and have water come out form 1 block below?
[4:47:03] RedCoded5: it's patched for farms
[4:47:05] PyjamaMole: he uses a waterlogged stair, and I am pretty sure the pistons need to be 0 ticked, its not patched, only 0 tick farms are
[4:47:06] PatManDX: @BehIsReal leaves break when pushed
[4:47:07] mrmasterapprentice: you could try
[4:47:08] PiepieweenieOSRS: mangrove rootss
[4:47:09] RedCoded5: it's still a feature
[4:47:10] natsleao: we are back to skyblock? i didnt believe it
[4:47:11] LightningZach: I miss the media shares
[4:47:14] Jojobiggz: button on the back should do ity
[4:47:15] BehIsReal: ah ok
[4:47:18] Inkiiy: @quantumrand iirc no, sources cant just be pushed
[4:47:19] pezdispenser2: Try pulling it maybe?
[4:47:21] khaosking6: Small ant what if you just make the flying machine at low y level then fly to a elytra and make the water catcher after
[4:47:21] GLWuffie: If you need to travel water, maybe ice?
[4:47:23] livipup: atirelDance
[4:47:27] callmefrenzy2: mangrove roots
[4:47:29] PyjamaMole: yep
[4:47:31] logmania: PAGGING
[4:47:32] PiepieweenieOSRS: mangrove rooooooooots
[4:47:32] sam_ham_22: Oh

[4:47:47] iansonofthor_: That's actually revolutionary
[4:47:48] linklingboy: PauseChamp
[4:47:51] PiepieweenieOSRS: mangroveeeeeeee roooooooooooots
[4:47:52] RemiTh3Rat: cocnut omalle !! !
[4:47:56] heather_storme: Drake pj
[4:48:01] Kerico: did you see ilmango's design?
[4:48:01] khaosking6: mumbo jumbo did it once
[4:48:02] logmania: smolShrug
[4:48:02] yevieh66: Pog
[4:48:03] sam_ham_22: PogU
[4:48:03] leacwm: engineering
[4:48:05] SuperTheUnderDog: how does ilmango's work?
[4:48:09] Rimimimimimimimm: CAN YOU DO IT WITH A LEVER AND HAVE THE LEVER KEEP TURNING ON AND OFF?
[4:48:10] vaxvea28: you can tyou have to manually push it
[4:48:12] WhaleStalker71: why do you need water?
[4:48:13] sweeby_hm: WE JUST GOT COCONUT MALLED
[4:48:14] RedCoded5: look at ilmango's design
[4:48:17] missionimpossible_: he's on 1.18 chat
[4:48:22] usingername_: KEKW
[4:48:24] Sightwalker: LUL
[4:48:26] WalterGerig_: finally
[4:48:28] katty1234123121: Maybe shoot it with a bow the button
[4:48:28] nile36: PogU
[4:48:28] Jordance11: OMEGALUL
[4:48:30] Inkiiy: KEKW
[4:48:31] yesntloI: lol
[4:48:31] RonitG1204: I mean you are just going forward so it should not be a problem
[4:48:32] coleslahw: What are you making
[4:48:35] Rimimimimimimimm: TRY A LEVER THAT TURNS ON AND OFF
[4:48:35] sam_ham_22: KEKW
[4:48:37] kccrimson_: Can you connect it to a different block so it doesn't destroy the button?
[4:48:39] Ishigh: @Rimimimimimimimm How do you want a flying machine to flick a lever ?
[4:48:44] Areays: i just got coconut malled :(
[4:48:48] sam_ham_22: LULW
[4:48:48] drakoserptenus: Just came here, whats happening?
[4:48:59] jeanguyouest: @drakoserptenus science
[4:49:00] leacwm: would waterlogged leves help maybe?
[4:49:01] logmania: @drakoserptenus testing machine designs to catch an elytra
[4:49:01] Rimimimimimimimm: @Ishigh Repeaters, redstone
[4:49:13] drakoserptenus: @logmania oh cool
[4:49:15] vaxvea28: why are you trying to push it?
[4:49:15] EzraManning: wait we switched back to skylbock
[4:49:17] bdogo6: mumbo jumbo also has a vid
[4:49:21] Potatachip: SciSyf looks like they have a video for ice bridge in the end called "Automatic Ice Road Maker for End Dimension - Tutorial - Minecraft " I believe its in java
[4:49:23] some_stupidusername: hmmm
[4:49:24] EzraManning: Sadge
[4:49:28] RonitG1204: @rimimimimimimimm that should not work because it needs to be zero tick it will way to slow
[4:49:31] LapizSapphire: could try using an observer for the 1 tick?
[4:49:33] shuov: what are you trying to build?
[4:49:36] dab_cucu: E
[4:49:38] livipup: @EzraManning just started
[4:49:40] Rimimimimimimimm: @RonitG1204 oh maybe u right lol
[4:49:40] PyjamaMole: someone made a tutorial for his flying machine btw
[4:49:40] khaosking6: what are you trying to make??
[4:49:44] bdogo6: observers
[4:49:45] robonob0: How did he get to the end?
[4:49:46] TheFireDem0n: are you trying to make a flying machine?
[4:49:49] mrmasterapprentice: replace regualr pistons with sticky
[4:49:54] spiralhornet09: quasiconnectivity to 0 tick?
[4:49:55] Rimimimimimimimm: what version is this?
[4:49:58] bdogo6: yess
[4:49:59] Zyonji: Wasn't an observer on piston without slime blocks always s0 tick?
[4:49:59] sam_ham_22: Use a button everytime for it to move
[4:50:01] phiepon: yeah
[4:50:02] missionimpossible_: observers will do a 1 tick but not 0 tick
[4:50:04] TheFireDem0n: just make yes
[4:50:06] EzraManning: @livipup oh good lycelLuvSign
[4:50:06] magicquoquo: @Rimimimimimimimm 1/18
[4:50:06] drakoserptenus: I think observers 1 tick
[4:50:07] blombingo: @SmallAnt What exactly is it that you need? Just a Bridgemaker that works in the end?  So your chat can actually look stuff up instead of spreading misinformation?
[4:50:10] RedCoded5: you can 1 tick but not 0 tick
[4:50:10] mrmasterapprentice: no
[4:50:13] dab_cucu: smolWop
[4:50:23] PyjamaMole: smant if you want, someone made a tutorial for ilmangos flying machine
[4:50:23] TheFireDem0n: observers can 1-tick yes
[4:50:24] Rimimimimimimimm: @magicquoquo damn alr thx
[4:50:26] vaxvea28: put redstone block in middle
[4:50:26] coolbeanzforlif7: I think it was a quasiconectivity 0 tick or something
[4:50:30] wad3_0w3n_watts: what are we doing rn?
[4:50:34] jouronxx: jouronxx subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 8 months! 
[4:50:37] jacket_fan: hi
[4:50:41] RonitG1204: @rimimimimimimimm unless you are saying something different then what I am understand it should not work because it is too slow
[4:50:46] mrmasterapprentice: smallant listen
[4:50:47] TheFireDem0n: smant I am pretty good at this myself if you want I can help
[4:50:50] daveth5lave: whats going on?
[4:50:57] missionimpossible_: observers do 1 tick not 0 tick
[4:50:58] spiralhornet09: quasiconnectivity
[4:51:06] yesntloI: @daveth5lave engineering
[4:51:07] EyeCrave: use a sticky?
[4:51:09] Ishigh: "Automatic Ice Road Maker for End Dimension - Tutorial - Minecraft" seem to use observers
[4:51:10] mrmasterapprentice: you can place a sticky piston pushing your black of choice
[4:51:11] Homemade_Calamity: How's it going?
[4:51:12] pyro2341_: There's a way to do 0 tick with target blocks i'm pretty sure
[4:51:13] Zyonji: Observer on sticky piston without slime block.
[4:51:17] livipup: luceHmm Is there a good reason for that>
[4:51:22] coleslahw: Which version?
[4:51:23] happy_boi84: try sticky
[4:51:24] logmania: same
[4:51:30] Mindstormz: SciSyf has a design that uses observers, full explanation, and shows how to build it.
[4:51:31] smorpd: @coleslahw 1.18
[4:51:34] PyjamaMole: I saw one by scisyf that used observers, but it does leak water
[4:51:34] Rimimimimimimimm: @RonitG1204 yeah I forgot that the tick speed is an issue tbh
[4:51:35] tiyanigean: @coleslahw 1,18
[4:51:38] mrmasterapprentice: replace the regular piston with a sticky one
[4:51:40] jazardly: I have seen a simple flying machine that places a block behind the item frame so the elytra never falls
[4:51:42] leacwm: why not do it without observers if you know that works?
[4:51:45] Potatachip: SciSyf looks like they have a video for ice bridge in the end called "Automatic Ice Road Maker for End Dimension - Tutorial - Minecraft " I believe its in java @SmallAnt
[4:51:50] vaxvea28: how does it make ice
[4:51:51] RedstoneJunkie: Wait are you standing on this or how is it creating ice?
[4:51:51] khaosking6: why are you making ice?
[4:51:54] manbat08: manbat08 is paying forward the Gift they got from AlaskanArsonist to the community! 
[4:51:54] manbat08: manbat08 is gifting 1 Tier 1 Subs to SmallAnt's community! They've gifted a total of 1 in the channel! 
[4:51:54] TheFireDem0n: how does it create ice exactly?
[4:51:55] manbat08: manbat08 gifted a Tier 1 sub to Lord_Shicon! 
[4:51:56] willartron07: you could do a basalt bridge to
[4:51:58] Sightwalker: I think this is going to be a breakthrough on Minecraft when you manage to do it!
[4:52:04] sevenbee: @Potatachip what version
[4:52:09] mrmasterapprentice: then place a regular piston facing out on top of the sticky one
[4:52:16] robonob0: Is there a way to get an end portal in skyblock or was that cheated?
[4:52:22] RonitG1204: @rimimimimimimimm ya it happened when created something this complicated. people forget some minor things
[4:52:22] EyeCrave: Armor stand frost walker
[4:52:27] TheFireDem0n: ah it creates infinite water sources I see
[4:52:35] jameswilko_: is a water source block is pushable if you surround it with 4 other blocks? if so can you have the flow leaving from under the source?
[4:52:39] RedstoneJunkie: ahhhh
[4:52:46] Mindstormz: @sevenbee It is only from 2 years ago.
[4:52:51] LightningZach: 2024 Is going to be a terrible year for youtube
[4:52:54] coleslahw: Does the one by SciSyf work for your version?
[4:53:00] Galnis96: doesn't armor stand count as an entity? so it stops at when it's out of simulation range?
[4:53:02] LapizSapphire: maybe try putting a piston above the pistons, and have those pistons powered by an observer?
[4:53:05] vaxvea28: LOOOL
[4:53:05] usingername_: apparently not
[4:53:06] meowmoddafokka: slime?
[4:53:08] Ishigh: @sevenbee It doesn't say but it's using observer and is from 2021, so it fits
[4:53:08] pyro2341_: minecarts???
[4:53:08] RedCoded5: you can't really easily create 0-ticks with observers to my knowledge
[4:53:09] sam_ham_22: Button
[4:53:11] RonitG1204: what?
[4:53:12] spiralhornet09: oh no
[4:53:18] mrmasterapprentice: has to be on top of ice first
[4:53:18] doubletroble6: uh oh
[4:53:18] LightningZach: Matpat retired + famous youtubers dying in 2024
[4:53:19] Mindstormz: You put the armor stands on trapdoors
[4:53:19] meowmoddafokka: it does
