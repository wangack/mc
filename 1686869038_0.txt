[0:42:03] ohbi78: dont deploy when people wont be around to fix it
[0:42:04] AlphaSchnauzer: yes tornado and eurofighter (partially)
[0:42:11] TheGreatLemon: @Yemtron the question is who broke it?
[0:42:31] banshay3: code freeze = no prod deployment
[0:42:37] JayDeerTay: the 35 is garbage
[0:42:53] JayDeerTay: it looks cool yea

[0:42:56] JayDeerTay: 22  is better
[0:42:56] punkgeek: 35 is multirole and ground support before air sup
[0:43:08] Furiak: f22 is far superior to the f35 in fighting

[0:43:40] RopeFlavouredRope: The Hercules is the best
[0:43:41] Furiak: @xNew this
[0:43:45] lgamer7: @TigerLuv  in my experience, the more ram you can dedicate to mc modpacks the better. but it depends on how much overall ram your laptop has
[0:43:46] SisyphusAgain: The F35 is known as a disater
[0:43:49] TigerLuv: Dagmoo - that is the number I was looking for thank  you

[0:44:07] Merc_Roy: how about the A-14, that shit is lit
[0:44:09] punkgeek: 35 is still good, it's just not a purpose built dogfighter like the 22
[0:44:13] Nexhunter: that is how superior in air to air combat it is PrideLaugh
[0:44:27] Dagmoo: @tigerluv well @lgamer7 disagrees LUL so idk

[2:17:59] MonteKuchen: Timiderxbox its not really worth it for most liquids
[2:18:02] LiveType: @kenshin2666 Take it from me. Get that commute time down to under 30 mins. You'll thank yourself in the future. Keep looking until you find it. The stress isn't worth the pay increase unless it's absurd.

[3:02:47] MaxNeedsSnacks: @LiveType because extracting it from H‚ÇÇ in this pack is slooooooow
[3:02:49] cansley123: im without water in dfw area
[3:02:50] Sentinel1_9: texas no power in the cold? im shocked
[3:03:11] The_Holas: YES
[3:03:12] iKyuute: bless
[3:03:13] The_Jack_Cheese: Did you get it?
[3:03:13] Boonie828: bless you
[3:03:14] dylan0806: Do Americans start to believe in climate changes?
[3:03:15] TelRehiad: heavy water
[3:03:17] CoolReal: It's complicated water
[3:03:19] MaxNeedsSnacks: deuterium is H¬≤, i.e. hydrogen with an extra neutron
[3:03:19] akaCube: one extra neutron
[3:03:20] DoubleOughtNot: No...
[3:03:24] TheGreatLemon: it's H3O
[3:03:24] thatguylntheback: deuterium has a neutron
[3:03:29] HeyAFrozenZebra: Extra neutron
[3:03:30] Skylance117: has one newtron
[3:03:33] Sentinel1_9: its 2h
[3:03:34] TheGreatLemon: Or H3 maybe
[3:03:39] akmazero: extra neutron and tritium has 2 extra
[3:03:40] kingjord: Anyone wanna place bets now that he‚Äôs gonna have to come back to this machine cuz he needs hundreds of them and we told he do it right once lol
[3:03:40] gartoks: and Tritium is H2 with 2 extra neutrons
[3:03:40] The_Jack_Cheese: @dylan0806 ravageYablewit  Low tier bait
[3:03:42] Skeptacal: Skeptacal subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 46 months, currently on a 46 month streak! 
[3:03:44] The_Holas: 2 extra neutrons is tritium i belive
[3:03:46] MaxNeedsSnacks: @TheGreatLemon that's hydronium / oxonium
[3:03:58] TheGreatLemon: fair
[3:04:01] PureSpider: yea deuterium is a hydrogen isotope, you get it from heavy water
[3:04:02] Supremagorious: It's an isotope
[3:04:06] MaxNeedsSnacks: it's an isotope of hydrogen basically
[3:04:17] imNoxel: no extra proton, neutron
[3:04:26] SeaOfMadness_: Can't you just liquify ender air for deuterium?
[3:04:29] Luxen77: extra proton would be another elements
[3:04:29] a_brink: D2O
[3:04:30] dylan0806: Hoe
[3:04:30] TelRehiad: h30
[3:04:31] MaxNeedsSnacks: H¬π is hydrogen (1 proton), H¬≤ deuterium (1 proton, 1 neutron), H¬≥ tritium (1 proton, 2 neutrons)
[3:04:33] TinaCarlysle: i can't hear waffle but i'm reading chat andyou all being so repetative lol
[3:04:34] PureSpider: yes
[3:04:40] PureSpider: D2O
[3:04:40] Moobot: You can sub to Waffle by clicking this neat link -> twitch.tv/giantwaffle/subscribe SUBprise
[3:04:40] akmazero: yes
[3:04:41] MaxNeedsSnacks: @SeaOfMadness_ that needs IV tier distillation towers
[3:04:41] LiveType: water with deuterium instead of regular hydrogen
[3:04:43] akaCube: heavy water is water made with deuterium instead of normal hydrogen
[3:04:44] Myekos: per
[3:04:46] a_brink: H2O2
[3:04:46] HeyAFrozenZebra: Yeah it tastes sweet
[3:04:47] The_robstah: h202
[3:04:48] theszechuanslinger: H202
[3:04:51] Dagmoo: chemistry sucks because there are "rules" but then theres tons of situations when they dont apply
[3:04:52] Furiak: heavy water is D2O or 2H2O
[3:05:03] imNoxel: ^2H is the notation for deuterium (hydrogen-2)
[3:05:06] akmazero: no proton would change the element
[3:05:07] MaxNeedsSnacks: H‚ÇÉO is "oxonium", the ion responsible for acidity in acid solutions
[3:05:09] Sentinel1_9: @Giantwaffle its @h, hydrogen with an extra neutron, considered heavy hydrogen
[3:05:17] Janzert: deuterium is either written as a D or 2H with the 2 superscripted
[3:05:18] Sentinel1_9: 2H*
[3:05:28] aedenwe: No h3o is hydronium
[3:05:30] Sentinel1_9: yes
[3:05:39] 1killersquirrel: Chemistry is not a theoretical science, not like physics or maths
[3:05:39] drsnaki96: deutirium water can be written as D2O
[3:05:41] PureSpider: ¬≤H2O, or D2O
[3:05:43] The_Holas: yeah why is there even rule when you dont use it in half of the cases LUL
[3:05:43] lordsandwish: H3O+ btw
[3:05:45] Kaines: bro im feeling dumb :D there is so many smart people there
[3:05:46] Janzert: in front
[3:05:46] PureSpider: same thing
[3:05:53] n00rman_: h2o is water btw
[3:05:56] MaxNeedsSnacks: @aedenwe H‚ÇÉO has a LOT of names, also yeah it's H‚ÇÉO‚Å∫ i forgot that +
[3:05:58] Furiak: there's also semi-heavy water LUL
[3:06:02] TheGrumpieGnome: NOTED
[3:06:02] Skylance117: Technically all water is heavy water, its just about the concentrations
[3:06:04] mainG__: deuterium is hydrogen with a neutron where normal hydrogen doesn't have any neutrons, it's heavy hydrogen which is in heavy water molecules
[3:06:11] Dagmoo: @kaines best part of this chat NODDERS
[3:06:14] Experiment_B: so this is where all the chemists hang out when they're bored LMAO
[3:06:16] SolarisFall: NOTED
[3:06:21] Godlypwng: this will all be on the test at the end of the pack chat, take notes
[3:06:23] drsnaki96: H3O+ is simplified as H+
[3:06:24] Sentinel1_9: neutron
[3:06:26] CoolReal: Neutron
[3:06:28] Kaines: @Dagmoo I agree
[3:06:28] Sentinel1_9: it has a prton nomally
[3:06:30] Duke1454: im a history teacher can i help
[3:06:34] imNoxel: neutron.. adding protons changes the element type
[3:06:36] LiveType: @drsnaki96 this is the way
[3:06:38] akmazero: hydrogen with an extra proton is helium
[3:06:44] akaCube: protons change the element
[3:06:47] Trollsamaa: Heavy water is extra proton H2O yes. hence the "heavy" because its mass is double normal Hydrogen (D2O)
[3:06:48] lintensteel21: its 2h because it has an extra neutron instead of just a proton you can also have tritium or 3h
[3:06:52] The_Holas: hydrogen is just one proton ... deuterium is proton + neutron
[3:07:03] 1killersquirrel: + 1 neutron because it has no charge
[3:07:05] HawaiitoFL: test? monkaS - NOTED
[3:07:05] aedenwe: @maxneedssnacks I‚Äôm a chemist but thanks
[3:07:22] Furiak: are there no inductors in this game?
[3:07:33] Kaines: @Dagmoo i remember when we played KSP and waffle was calulating some space shit on white board
[3:07:38] MaxNeedsSnacks: @aedenwe i just meant that i called it by the german name we learned >.>
[3:07:44] Trollsamaa: erm not proton. F
[3:07:46] kikakeki: when plane go fasttt!!!!
[3:07:51] ChromaCym: They said spring
[3:07:55] Jhreks: season 1 was fun to watch
[3:07:56] PureSpider: fuck i'm so looking forward to that
[3:07:59] a_brink: Yeah other languages call things differently I‚Äôve heard
[3:07:59] TheCairon: February 10, 2023.
[3:08:00] drsnaki96: @LiveType mandalorians always know da way
[3:08:02] meghantheehorse: it‚Äôs comes out in february
[3:08:03] matey1116: feb i think
[3:08:05] a_brink: Chemistry wise
[3:08:07] 0x4273: its so sad that clarkson is being a cunt again in the news
[3:08:09] The_Holas: Ci should named him "Heisenberg" to help you with chemistry Kappa
[3:08:11] semizotu: I can't see the heights that ores spawn in JEI. Is there a setting for it?
[3:08:11] The_Holas: HUH
[3:08:14] Dagmoo: @kaines yeah whiteboard was a lot of fun. orbital mechanics is crazy too
[3:08:22] Thalmize: alright pizza has been ordered Pog
[3:08:23] InternetPlumber: I loved everyone telling him his tractor was too big

[3:09:29] Dagmoo: @kaines haha thats really cool peepoHappy
[3:09:36] dylan0806: Do you have fluid cells for gas?
[3:09:43] 0x4273: @Crashkt90 lmao people who care about not supporting racist cunts
[3:10:01] bobolpwnz: You need HV chemical bath
[3:10:08] LiveType: You need the yellow because higher wavelengths of light disrupt the silicon during manufacturing
[3:10:26] drsnaki96: @Kaines more like specialised to other stuff than what you specialised

[3:15:02] MaxNeedsSnacks: multiple recipes :p
[3:15:04] lnkr: lnkr subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 11 months! 
[3:15:07] Soul12eaver: there were also many of them to divide the work @Dagmoo
[3:15:17] akaCube: Totally on course for beating the pack till new year right?
[3:15:21] MaxNeedsSnacks: @Tidalllwave yep that SoC recipe was *IV* even lol
[3:15:51] MaxNeedsSnacks: yep
[3:15:57] BillyMilwaukee: What's the clinking noise in the background?
[3:16:05] Venxuri: the other stuff is slightly cheaper
[3:16:08] Venxuri: once you have infra
[3:16:09] Dagmoo: @Soul12eaver i think the nosleep team is only 4 but still impressive when waffle says his brain is fried after 8 hrs let alone 16
[3:16:18] Crashkt90: I can‚Äôt play this game, yet this guy is building Elon musk
[3:16:22] Akiron_rafa: PJSalt
[3:16:23] raironzera: Maybe was just overthinking
[3:16:24] mainG__: PJSalt
[3:16:26] Soul12eaver: some people are built different @Dagmoo
[3:16:26] LiveType: Why have you not pushed for automation yet?
[3:16:29] IlsaGold: This is an ASMR stream
[3:16:30] n00rman_: cheaper recipe, soon you will need thousands of circuits automated
[3:16:32] 0sem0: Why is there a sphere on top of the terminal... It makes me angry...

[3:17:37] MaxNeedsSnacks: honestly tho, HV through IV are the most fun parts of nomi and greg in general, so all i can say is have fun :p
[3:17:38] 0sem0: So complicated...
[3:17:40] Staticsprite: Is it playable for solo-players?
[3:17:55] Akiron_rafa: just copy IRL YEP
[3:17:56] LiveType: @Staticsprite Nope. You need a server to be running 24/7
[3:17:57] InternetPlumber: i'm playing solo... day 5 i just got deep mob learnign going
[3:17:59] Luxen77: Guregori
[3:18:02] Venxuri: @Staticsprite sure, just a longer comittment
[3:18:04] Staticsprite: @LiveType Oh damn
[3:18:04] InternetPlumber: so yes... but
[3:18:05] Boonie828: are all those fans around the base serve a purpose or just aesthetics?
[3:18:05] kotwin: at least it's not GTNH COPIUM
[3:18:12] Tidalllwave: did you finish the modpack where you built that giant factory building?
[3:18:17] 0sem0: @Staticsprite for sure, it won't be fun solo though.
[3:18:22] Dagmoo: @Staticsprite only if you are slightly crazy and/or a MC degen willing to play for months
[3:18:28] 1killersquirrel: there's a wabbit in the base
[3:18:30] 0sem0: Is it?
[3:18:31] kotwin: GTNH is harder
[3:18:37] MaxNeedsSnacks: it is, and it's waaaaay worse with its time gates
[3:18:38] Venxuri: GTNH is 10x harder and grindier
[3:18:39] officialhunterx: yes 10x worse
[3:18:44] n00rman_: GTNH is far harder
[3:18:44] MaxNeedsSnacks: you wait 60 seconds per aluminium ingot for example
[3:18:46] Staticsprite: @Dagmoo Hm. Time to rally some friends
[3:18:50] 0sem0: Is it harder than POE Kappa mode ?
[3:18:51] Boonie828: modCheck
[3:18:52] LethalBro: donowall
[3:18:53] officialhunterx: the modpack is 5k hours

[3:19:28] MaxNeedsSnacks: gtnh is too much for me because they just went "oh yeah let the player WAIT, that's fun"
[3:19:29] Face_32: isnt this pack gregified? so its probably on par with GTNH
[3:19:41] Tidalllwave: what was the modpack that you built that giant building for the factory?
[3:19:44] IlsaGold: Doggowalk perhaps
[3:19:44] MaxNeedsSnacks: wanna upgrade your EBF coils? better wait 128 minutes for your kanthal to get ready then
[3:20:00] 0sem0: who is Greg anyway?
[3:20:06] officialhunterx: watch a base tour from gtnh i promise youll be shocked
[3:20:09] moonman7890: how did you automate the pulsating dust for deep mod learning
[3:20:19] officialhunterx: gtnh stargate is 5k hours
[3:20:31] Venxuri: @Staticsprite tbh, just give it a shot you're not at an disadvantage by not playing on a server. But its a 300h+ comittment minimum.
[3:21:21] Larklen: widePepeLaugh
[3:21:24] MaxNeedsSnacks: not a single recipe, just total playtime right?
[3:21:25] Moobot: You can find Waffle's Youtube channel here - https://youtube.com/giantwaffle
[3:21:30] officialhunterx: its called stargate
[3:21:30] daemonaedryn: 5k hours is literally pointless
[3:21:34] Face_32: some people say 6k
[3:21:39] kellerjudo: This one has the NAN that takes 3.4 years doens't it?
[3:21:39] MaxNeedsSnacks: it is yeah
[3:21:47] Venxuri: yet people do it
[3:21:54] Face_32: stargate is the whole goal of GTNH
[3:21:54] lateknighthero: 208+ 24 hour days :D
[3:22:02] officialhunterx: there was a team that did it
[3:22:06] n00rman_: Pyanodon has been beaten
[3:22:06] MaxNeedsSnacks: GTNH has **15** voltage tiers
[3:22:10] kotwin: the journey until you decide to abandon GNTH is fun though
[3:22:12] MaxNeedsSnacks: as opposed to nomi's 8(?)
[3:22:20] dollar_cave: more tiers for more tears
[3:22:24] DonMerkuzio: you need it for 100% dont you?
[3:22:33] MaxNeedsSnacks: and you end up making science fiction tier circuits like supra causal mainframes
[3:22:47] Staticsprite: @Venxuri Yeah. It's kind of my comeback to MC after years of not playing. Might be overwhelming at first.
[3:22:54] Gh3ttoboy: you need 100ds of everything
[3:23:17] landsharkbomb: catJAM catJAM catJAM catJAM

[3:24:16] MaxNeedsSnacks: alright brb food time, don't quit the pack while i'm gone :p
[3:24:28] Venxuri: @Staticsprite I mean... there is nobody standing behind you with a whip, take it at your own pace :D
[3:24:29] Trollsamaa: i dont like mods that add "difficulty" through numbers. complexity is fun, needing to strip mine 1500 chunks to get enbough resources to build 1 thing is not.
[3:24:36] Noblez_: Is this basement up to code?
[3:24:44] Bahhman: But the despair comes from the stressing playstyle you have. That's what we love, but one CAN play minecraft slower.
[3:25:11] CoolReal: Pati is in my recommended Pog

[4:34:31] ForgottenTime: @neveryotherday Responsibility usually makes me go to sleep before I‚Äôm tired lol
[4:34:33] Myekos: depends on the individual.  I'm twice his age and can do it if needed.
[4:34:34] PureSpider: sounds horrible
[4:34:36] bytebeagle: used to the college life of sleep
[4:34:40] nAZAr1uS: member Runescape?
[4:34:40] thewot: same
[4:34:42] officialhunterx: i do the same thing
[4:34:49] Romil01: i thrive on 4-6 hours of sleep. no more than that.
[4:34:54] officialhunterx: smelt it
[4:34:58] officialhunterx: then macerate it
[4:34:59] birdoffire: you dont have deep sleep, because you lack heart. i have same problems.
[4:34:59] theszechuanslinger: @Romil01 Disgusting
[4:35:01] Kerold: Sounds stress related
[4:35:06] kingkhal_drogo: The sleep average of like 6-8 hours is just that - an average. Some people require more and others require less.
[4:35:07] Moobot: You can find Waffle's Youtube channel here - https://youtube.com/giantwaffle
[4:35:08] bytebeagle: if I don't get 8h of sleep I am a complete potato for the day
[4:35:15] Furiak: probably sleep apnea ?
[4:35:18] Romil01: @theszechuanslinger i love it
[4:35:27] PureSpider: could be sleep apnea actually
[4:35:31] Keydose: yeah apnoea is a breathing thing
[4:35:33] 0omkins: Yes apnea relates to breathing.
[4:35:34] lurking_2: would you even know
[4:35:35] P00nDozer69: it's stopping breathing yeah
[4:35:38] TelRehiad: if you have apnea you would probably snore a lot
[4:35:44] Furiak: I mean yeah it's breathing, but I don't hink you notice it until you can't sleep....
[4:35:54] Atzgee: insomnia  also difficult to stay asleep
[4:35:54] TheGeekPeek: restless leg syndrome, apneas, light sleepers, and some day night cycle syndromes could cause that
[4:35:58] TheGeekPeek: I have sleep issues aswell
[4:36:05] Romil01: pretty sure i'm apneatic, if thats a word. if not, i just created it. bam.
[4:36:10] ninopanda: if i get more than 4 hours and less than 6 hours.  I wake up the next day with no issues.
[4:36:11] kingkhal_drogo: He would notice if he has a tracker/watch that tracks his O2 and heart rate.
[4:36:14] TheKayo: I have multiple friends with sleep apnea that never knew why their sleep was crap till they did a sleep study, now with cpap they sleep better than me
[4:36:17] Face_32: snoring doesnt have to wake you up to be detrimental
[4:36:20] adamh29: 4 hours sleep all a get
[4:36:25] FireForEffekt: could be anything. wrong mattress, koffein, bad breathing.....there are some blankets that are really heavy to hold you down, some find that really relaxing and makes them drowsy
[4:36:26] Balafore: 5-6hrs is my norm
[4:36:36] Balafore: it's not healthy but is what it is
[4:36:37] TelRehiad: when I got diagnosed with apnea.. that first night after getting my machine.. was the best night of sleep ever.
[4:36:45] Face_32: i love sleep
[4:36:51] Face_32: sleep is great
[4:36:52] Driitzz: i get 5 to 8 i cannot go higher

[4:37:20] Keydose: it's like coal duuuuust
[4:37:24] PureSpider: it's like gold dust waffleSPINFASTER
[4:37:35] ok_juju: DJ fresh gold dust??
[4:37:35] TelRehiad: @Spikey770 you don't realize how debilitating not sleeping is until that moment..
[4:37:39] ninopanda: @kenshin2666 do you watch Critical Role?
[4:37:40] Spikey770: ^^^

[4:39:48] CrackaBTW: that was put out for the 10th anniversary of the song they did a few new remixes this year
[4:39:49] kenshin2666: @ninopanda  well wtf XD that is unexpected, and i have no idea how my brain got that idea
[4:40:11] MaxNeedsSnacks: i wouldn't even say it's not his style because then he puts out stuff like good time and the out my head remix :p
[4:40:29] ninopanda: @kenshin2666 KEKW brains be wierd.  i am a horror freak so i would probably wake myself up laughing if I had that dream
[4:40:38] MaxNeedsSnacks: like i said, just... massive range from happy go lucky pop(?) dnb i guess to jumpup and dancefloor stuff
[4:40:59] Kaines: Kreygasm

[5:42:00] EverlastingIce: ahah, you probably use more diamond farming than generating power
[5:42:10] hippiedude212: also you need the extractor speed upgrade in the connection under the farming station
[5:42:11] FanaticMouse: do you have tinkers construct ?

[5:42:48] MonteKuchen: the text determines for which machines they are good for
[5:42:53] Tapeman83: you have to try them in machines one by one to figure out which ones are the best
[5:42:56] boogerbomb01: I think reddit has the decoder for them
