[1:10:40] Dagmoo: yeah this one isnt that bad tbh
[1:10:41] Ji_nX: whats a kaki map ?
[1:10:41] punkgeek: Is this just RNG? Can you even learn to do this consistently?
[1:10:43] darknotch: Did you get this map before?
[1:10:51] Dagmoo: so close
[1:10:55] Sandboxie97: i think cronos doesn know kacky widePepeLaugh

[1:11:55] C0ldf1re: monkaSTEER
[1:11:57] Cronos_100: Is these kinds of maps a normal thing with this Kacky mode?
[1:12:16] TechNaOkami: anotherone bites the dust
[1:12:17] Rainstorme: @Cronos_100 they're custom maps, not part of the normal game
[1:12:19] HiPN0TiKx: where?
[1:12:21] Ghandus: @Cronos_100 no usually they are more absurd lol
[1:12:22] bredar: where was the watch along?
[1:12:30] Cronos_100: @Ghandus oh LULW
[1:12:32] vennikeTM: @Cronos_100 search "Kacky Reloaded 2 Validation" on youtube
[1:12:35] SupaStevo: the real word people are looking for is chaotic. A tiny, normally negligible difference in input results in a ridiculously large difference in output
[1:12:38] Sandboxie97: @Ji_nX its a map type where the tracks are only finishable with Bugs or a ton of luck. There is a Video on Yt showing all Maps this year and how they can be finished. just search on YT for "All Kacky Reloaded 2 Validation Replays "
[1:12:40] vennikeTM: itl show the maps
[1:12:42] Lazdrin: next year, just got a tesla robot and tell him to win cup of the day.. ez
[1:12:46] SupaStevo: so these maps have a lot of chaos built into the design
[1:12:46] JBourden: thats all they do
[1:12:52] snorrow92: @Cronos_100 yep, kacky is an event twice a year for a month. maps are made really hard and its your job to finish most of them (75 maps)

[1:15:08] Lazdrin: practice makes perfect Kappa
[1:15:08] Slymph: Gotta practice ice for todays map Prayge
[1:15:14] bcdmonkey: Take it right just a bit before the left
[1:15:15] SupaStevo: yeah maybe start by reversing so you launch with more speed
[1:15:17] leo_k4n: just back up a bit LULW

[1:15:42] Sandboxie97: usually ever 1st of a month its a kacky or lol style map for cotd
[1:15:48] obylix: everyone that has tractrion has thier nose pointed more up
[1:15:57] FoXsTeRDOTA: 1st of the month is typically some LOL map
