[0:49:53] iwakura0: nice
[0:49:53] candedgarcia9: you need to be faster
[0:50:01] candedgarcia9: because cobble forms bc of flowing lava
[0:50:23] Kexiv_: i think its more of a server tick thing
[0:50:25] Azur3Dream: if i recall when you place an obsidian, you have to start mining the cobble immediately
[0:50:29] Moo_God41: also the portal practice map the more you play it the fweirder the tickrate goes for some reason
[0:50:36] Kexiv_: so its kinda more gamesense muscle memory
[0:50:48] captain_jack253: where is online bro? :(
[0:50:51] Azur3Dream: @Moo_God41 yeah this too
[0:51:09] Kexiv_: i notice i get like infinitely more ghost buckets and half doors in practice than i do in real runs
[0:51:20] Kexiv_: didnt know if it was skissue or the map being bad
[0:51:45] Moo_God41: i think when you throw the snowball it activates command blocks which messes up the tickrate
[0:51:51] Moo_God41: dont quote me
[0:52:20] Azur3Dream: pb is 9 40
[0:52:27] Kexiv_: 9 flat
