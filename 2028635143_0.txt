[3:18:04] DanielSteele: it has to shriek 3 times to summon it, from what I thought/remembered
[3:18:48] DanielSteele: I believe it is the same for each warden
[3:20:01] FryingKirby: gumi Gumi GUMI k3llyShy

[3:23:19] DanielSteele: you only need to worry about the shriekers
[3:23:37] DanielSteele: the sensors are nothing more than a sound indicator that can travel to a shrieker
[3:24:08] DanielSteele: yeah, if you destroy all the shriekers, then the warden won't spawn
[3:24:48] FryingKirby: have you found any Jigglypuff?
[3:25:08] Nightbot: Come and chat with the Gumi Gang on Gumi's official Discord server! https://discord.gg/gumi
[3:25:19] DanielSteele: if the warden isn't alerted to anything for a while, they will despawn
[3:25:33] DanielSteele: so the 2nd one might have despawned
[3:26:43] DanielSteele: you can use the wool to block sound too, by like surrounding the shriekers
[3:27:17] StreamElements: Wanna buy Gumi a X-mas present? Gumi's privacy friendly wishlist at https://jointhrone.com/vGumiho !!

[3:39:04] beelatedhehe: yay kelp
[3:42:02] DanielSteele: the only solution I can think of is placing a bucket of water on each block to find the one that is missing
[3:42:04] Nightbot: hha,,,h,,,,,,, so,,, do u come here oftne haa,,,,h,, u didnt answe,r, , ,r,
[3:42:16] SupremeJustice: all I can suggest is emptying it and adding water to each edge
[3:42:26] DanielSteele: that too
[3:43:08] DanielSteele: I know if you place kelp down it makes that water block into a source water block
[3:43:18] superstarchole: HI GUMI
[3:43:20] DanielSteele: maybe break the kelp in the middle and see if it helps?
[3:43:42] DanielSteele: cause you have to break the kelp to make it source I thought
[3:43:45] DanielSteele: I might be wrong tho
[3:44:26] superstarchole: What are you making?
[3:44:27] DanielSteele: maybe the spots you can't place the kelp are the spots missing water?
[3:45:03] Nightbot: Hey man Want to see POGGERS BOOBA and modCheck install bttv now to see all these emotes frogWalk https://betterttv.com/
