[1:54:34] rapacides: MORE LIKE BITCH WATER AMIRITE
[1:54:37] Zarquonnix: didn't you already had emerald bees ?

[1:54:39] rapacides: ravsY
[1:54:42] Goldthwait: Witch water turns squids into ghasts. Have fun with the explosions

[1:55:18] Worker_Drone: omg, can't wait for the ghasts to burn the platforms
[1:55:24] Faylone: so you just need to farm them in an obsidian cube?
[1:55:33] mykyx: @antibrine4545 too salty
[1:55:33] lord_mada: the hopper has a 5 block radius
[1:55:40] Faylone: wait, is cobble ghastproof?
[1:55:43] lord_mada: not chunk radius
[1:56:03] Goose_Venom: @faylone Believe so
[1:56:19] rjsmoby: Rags, use a sink and pump water into barrels to make witch water
[1:56:20] azurepony: Put the pollinating block in the ground the bees can get stuck otherwise Duncan
[1:56:28] DeimosMechanicus: DeimosMechanicus subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 43 months! yogP2
[1:56:31] lord_mada: it's 5 blocks including itself btw
[1:56:40] ADarkPain: why not put it inside
[1:56:41] ADarkPain: yeah
[1:57:12] AureliaaX: He earned his freedom D:
[1:57:34] Danriths_: Pipe on a cooking for blockhead sink is an infinite source of water
[1:57:39] azurepony: This is why you need player filters
[1:57:39] Doomsailor1: let it bee free
[1:57:43] Faylone: yes he did, then they earned recapturing him.
[1:57:44] ADarkPain: i love their spinning
[1:57:46] Goose_Venom: Ravs gonna make a sink?
[1:57:46] Danriths_: Instant refill for barrel
[1:57:51] Slousifer: item collector has a larger radius
[1:57:53] MishyaMisery: Put it under?
[1:58:09] ADarkPain: it wouldnt work unless it is floating in the middle of the box....
[1:58:11] lord_mada: not sure how high or low it goes
[1:58:21] starlitesparkl3: does it work with pipes
[1:58:22] Minor_Edit: Put it round
[1:58:23] Pejaycee: just put it in the middle
[1:58:28] starlitesparkl3: can you lay a pipe out
[1:58:31] Faylone: It earned the freedom it had for that short span, that's why they recaptured it instead of killing it for daring to leave
[1:58:34] azurepony: Isn’t there an item puller
[1:58:43] 39SaltyCookies: catJAM

[1:59:26] Goldthwait: Building with dirt feels so risky, it's too easy to break sometimes. Why not build with cobble?
[1:59:43] Jaranon: i'm genuinely surprised ravs isn't trying to push ped to his death right now LUL
[1:59:48] Ironic_Pickle_Jar: Why not just make the whole floor the blocks you need.
[2:00:00] lord_mada: as many as you can cause they stop each other touching the block when they bump into each other
[2:00:05] azurepony: One bee per block Duncan
[2:00:05] ADarkPain: do you actually need th mud floor given they just need blocks of ore?
[2:00:09] Ironic_Pickle_Jar: Expensive but it'll look cool.
[2:00:15] ADarkPain: just put the chest inside the cube
[2:00:18] Minor_Edit: Bees making honey from their own refined honey
[2:00:21] Savage_Darkness_Games: @jaranon I was thinking same thing, perfect time for a Ravs troll
[2:00:32] YapYapTHESTREAMER: need more pylons
[2:00:36] Faylone: Sometimes you need to hold off on pushing somebody to their death so they get soft and trust you so you can manage it successfully later.
[2:00:51] Goose_Venom: We must construct additional pylons

[2:01:08] CuriousSnake: catJAM
[2:01:18] ADarkPain: can't you pipe out from the crusherthing into the chest?
[2:01:19] CuriousSnake: RATJAM
[2:01:21] RulingMink: one annoying thing with this pack is that the bees will default to pollinating all the same block which slows it all down. the bees should distribute evenly by default :/
[2:01:39] lord_mada: you need to get a block of everything the normal way and then the bees can give you endless amounts of it
[2:01:44] Goldthwait: Mekanism makes steel easier if the modpack allows it
[2:01:45] starlitesparkl3: isn't there a workaround for steel where you can craft it with coal powder and iron powder or coal and iron and some tool? Can't remember/
[2:02:09] EsotericFish: You have a whole nether fortress of blocks to mine
[2:02:10] Sushian0: Ye see if you can make steel via mekanism :P
[2:02:18] Savage_Darkness_Games: @goldthwait  it’s gated, mekanism
[2:02:22] azurepony: Just make a red stone bee they are not hard
[2:02:30] Sushian0: Mmh right
[2:02:39] RulingMink: blast furnace or blood altar, first one is easier lol
[2:02:44] Ironic_Pickle_Jar: Would an alloy smelter be easier to make?
[2:02:58] Danriths_: @Sushian0 They would need a power source for that though... Can't be asked LUL LUL
[2:02:59] Ironic_Pickle_Jar: If its a thing in this pack?
[2:03:04] starlitesparkl3: you can just go to the nether and mine up some netherrack or nether brick?
[2:03:15] Viztee: nothing in the nether iirc
[2:03:20] Ironic_Pickle_Jar: Sadge...
[2:03:23] starlitesparkl3: ah

[2:03:45] Jaranon: i et a scorpion once
[2:03:46] mykyx: there's a simple multiblock alloy furnace
[2:03:51] CityOfDoors: BEEf burger
[2:03:53] Danriths_: Shush... let Duncan figure it out

[2:04:09] 39SaltyCookies: Boba's feeling unwell today after getting the vaccine @Byrdshot

[2:05:43] CuriousSnake: Honey Coom
[2:05:44] DawnMX: yogB
[2:05:46] hgfhdhss: maybe make a breeding area where the bees can't escape? like an empty hive boupheShrug
[2:05:47] azurepony: And this is why you breed bees in a closed building Duncan
[2:05:51] CuriousSnake: hryYep
[2:05:55] ADarkPain: go get a diff bee?
