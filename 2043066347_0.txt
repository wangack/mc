Damn 19 Month #nevereverleaving I have a question why is the chance to find an archive bound to the dungeon size and not to the difficulty cause I would expect to have a at least 50% to find an archive in an impossible dungeon also why can't u craft a jewl with legendary modifiers cause on armor u can get legendary modifiers from crafted ones

[0:16:51] ensalys: I use some kind of product in winter for really dry hands
[0:16:51] TheXanderTheMander: You should add new chest trap that turns the chest into a void liquid source
[0:16:53] Pineapple0nPizza: hand sanitizer can dry out your skin so that might be why you need the lotion?
[0:16:53] PirateLouie: I love lotion
[0:16:53] 20egemen04: @psyridium I asked on discord before. The issue is that the mods they use are not all on there so they can't right now.

[0:17:09] TobyButt89: Hate the texture, but it's necessary in the winter

[0:17:57] HMS_sarb: sleep in a pool of hand cream so you dont have to worry about it during the day
[0:18:00] pendelluft: Sanitizer + lotion is gross. Cleaning off sanitizer and then putting on lotion while hands are slightly damp feels so good
[0:18:01] Cluemily: Gotta take care of your skin so it can take care of you
[0:18:02] smolkato: it’s 68% humidity where I am. Ick.

[0:20:57] elio_saratsis: Fire dowsky so you can hire seki
[0:21:03] SirFlachzange: Thanks for not forgetting my question iskBro
[0:21:06] andrevictorau: People really need to just get good
[0:21:09] AyushJind: Hmm
[0:21:10] jane_co11: Yeah
[0:21:10] lizerich: difficulty = difficulty
[0:21:15] grynd3rfl: Balancing the challenge and reward
[0:21:16] elplii: i like scavs, people need to git gud
[0:21:19] Ribery931: ye. its very hard to design difficulty correctly
[0:21:22] jaegerdreadful: @elio_saratsis They are married KEKW How would that help them
[0:21:23] GyroscopeX: difficulty is fun
[0:21:36] zeus_o9o2: great point @SirFlachzange
[0:21:37] sp0rsk: thats not really the point of the difficulty in the dungeon though right?
[0:21:40] nighthawk_2604: @jaegerdreadful wait what
[0:21:51] ramnite_tv: This way "the rich get richer", and casual players already skip harder dungeons, so they would lose out on more stuff...
[0:21:53] alivedemonnyte: Shield off as well
[0:22:06] TobyButt89: Because the difficulty of the dungeon is opt in, you don't want to lock people out of archives simply because of the difficulty/risk of death
[0:22:10] grynd3rfl: Agreed
[0:22:15] TheXanderTheMander: Image is still blocking iskalls "face"
[0:22:19] MattyXCS: You should make some sort of paragon level where you increse loot amount
[0:22:21] cl4sh3r_69: @ramnite_tv not rich get richer, it’s risk vs reward
[0:22:21] wendymoto: ^
[0:22:23] lukeminer2: do coins give more coins as well the jarder the dungeon?
[0:22:28] Xarallon: two tunable difficulties: 1) size and 2) "difficulty" (normal -> impossible). Also two tunable rewards, a) archieve and b) chest contents
[0:22:29] sp0rsk: no were not what are you talking about
[0:22:29] GyroscopeX: i would never Kappa
[0:22:31] zeus_o9o2: Keepo Keepo Keepo  not me

[0:22:41] phoenix_king_01: i dont
[0:22:41] Wizard_Chach: "properly"
[0:22:41] cineeleo: Archive in a normal dungeon is an accessibility thing
[0:22:43] RobUrHood: Immortality and storm arrow ftw
[0:22:44] wendymoto: ^ to Toby’s message
[0:22:51] MarkDatter: he's not wrong
[0:22:52] jaelj_: i would never Kappa Cause i dont play the game
[0:22:56] sharkyteeth101: Who would ever do that!
[0:22:56] asimithehero: Why cheese when dungeons are easy Kappa
[0:22:58] shekel9999: not able to place blocks inside a dungeon
[0:23:00] YanityZ: @ramnite_tv agreed
[0:23:04] hellpiegamin: I don't cheese them , i just outsmart the dungeon :P
[0:23:10] ramnite_tv: @cl4sh3r_69 Rich get richer. You're already good enough to tackle impossible dungeon, now you also get a guaranteed gear modifier
[0:23:14] smolkato: @shekel9999 ouch haha
[0:23:16] Ribery931: ye. totally not cheesing impossible dungeon Kappa
[0:23:16] danial177: make dungeons impossible to place or destroy blocks in
[0:23:18] Kasszi_: lol duck
[0:23:23] Zinoba: Trueing
[0:23:24] avian946: @hellpiegamin based in using that line
[0:23:34] YanityZ: hey! that's me! normals are hard enough
[0:23:35] TobyButt89: I don't cheese, just super tank heal build that isn't good in the rest of the vault lol
[0:23:38] MarkDatter: I had to cheese a large piglin dungeon and just use fear on the champion to actually get the archive at the end lol
[0:23:39] cineeleo: Very good point, we all agree KEKW
[0:23:47] brokkoli_tim: Hello Mr. IskallMAN
[0:23:48] xanking96: make it impossible to place and brake blocks in dungeons
[0:23:49] Lakosius2: in PoE its already hard for casual players to get to Yellow maps
[0:23:50] Wizard_Chach: Keep Scavs in the rotation
[0:23:54] ithillion55: As someone who mostly sucks I like that design decisions
[0:24:04] midouzs: Yea but scavenger vaults are little bit harder for "weaker players" and they have the best loot on completion
[0:24:06] Arwen036: hallo iskall and dylan

[0:30:56] blake2arif28: Hi mr iskall....
[0:30:57] QDC__: something wells said in his video, get xp based on how many items you submit so you can also half complete a scav
[0:31:01] jaegerdreadful: BUMBLE
[0:31:05] LuckyManTTV: what about a system where it gives you a choice of what the vault could be? you select which one you want and that chance is a 50/50 of succeeding or it to be random, but that extra chance of saying of its monos, guardians, etc, might make it a nicer appease for running vaults @iskall85
[0:31:10] Lakosius2: that person is like fr fr , annoying everyone equally regardless of background Kappa
[0:31:11] urban_beach: He trusts the process!

[0:31:40] sharkastic_shark: I think Swampy should stay
[0:31:56] gaymersalsa: BONEEEEE
[0:31:58] PiggyKillerQ: I think it means like make a book that you put on the vault altar, with insertable pages that add a vault objective to the rotation, for instance you start with monoliths, and do a quest to unlock elixir, and you can add/remove any page given you have atleast one. Would kinda trounce on seals, but could maybe be worked with if the minimum was like 2-3 types.
[0:32:00] zeus_o9o2: @LuckyManTTV interesting
[0:32:02] kriptou21: we are used to the saying 'if it isnt broken dont fix it'

[0:36:25] JahinDraws: Trying to be creative is hard and takes a big toll legit.
[0:36:26] basman333: brainskall
[0:36:30] Attackeight: @Kasszi_ this
[0:36:41] wendymoto: kasszi I want to be creative but I’m so bad at it that I end up hating it
[0:36:42] jetlius: hallo baymer hayeHey
[0:36:42] LuckyManTTV: @gaymersalsa pzhH DinoDance
[0:36:48] lordeclipse01: have I missed paradox
[0:36:59] gaymersalsa: allo lucky, betlius o/
[0:37:01] sp0rsk: thats a good saying, the squeeky wheel gets the grease
[0:37:03] Kasszi_: @wendymoto sameee i redo the same thing a million times
[0:37:04] kumail2003: the smart people are the lazy people eg: car to not walk, bulbs to not light fires stc
[0:37:12] cassemess: Being lazy is a good thing lazy people find creative ways to complete a task
[0:37:26] Kasszi_: @IceSpice12 Susge
[0:37:27] sharkyteeth101: Casual and dragged are different types of difficulty right
[0:37:27] wendymoto: @kasszi_ that’s why I like doing builds in creative ivyheaHypeivy
[0:37:33] gaymersalsa: lol
[0:37:35] Pineapple0nPizza: i think this guy thinks everyone thinks the way he does
[0:37:36] PiggyKillerQ: harlocking items to difficulty is bad imo, increasing loot for difficulty is good
[0:37:37] sboggsie02: @lordeclipse01 nope, doing game design talk first
[0:37:37] AyushJind: lol
[0:37:38] Kasszi_: Monos were being af
[0:37:38] gaymersalsa: yes.
[0:37:41] doctor_pan30: chadskall
[0:37:43] shaydeejay: and it was a great change
[0:37:43] Ribery931: agreed.
[0:37:44] wendymoto: most of us didn’t like it hahaha
[0:37:44] Trouss: Bob has lost the plot
[0:37:45] kibaz_x: What good portion are they talking about lol
[0:37:45] What_At_Twitch: @cassemess not if they dont wanna be creative lol
[0:37:45] get_d0wn: there were boring tho
[0:37:47] Lakosius2: Monoliths were a very simply concept , but also very boring
[0:37:47] onno1legend: agreed
[0:37:49] xanking96: agreed
[0:37:49] forelini: monos we’re boooring
[0:37:50] alivedemonnyte: Lazy as in I will work hard for money so that I can be lazy
[0:37:53] baka_raion_hato_31: tréasure finder
[0:37:54] proshooter27_: which vid is iskall talking abt?
[0:37:59] doctor_pan30: scavs are fun
[0:37:59] nationofcarrotia: The thing is, people want crazy specific things. It's never enough modifiability for some people.
[0:38:00] MaraudingBacon: I dont care about why monoliths were changed. the changes were so so so so good
[0:38:01] twilight_zephyr: monoliths were very dull. scavs are hard, but really fun (especially when you complete a hard one)
[0:38:05] SammJ85: and although we've not played, they look a lot better
[0:38:05] avian946: monoliths were a bit boring. now they look pag
[0:38:06] Frangus_: Im tempted to exit a vault when i get a monolith. They are real dull to do
[0:38:08] JashinFanatic: monoliths felt like discount hunt the guardians
[0:38:10] TobyButt89: I play casual, and I like having an omega items now and then
[0:38:15] phoenix_king_01: monoliths were good but brazier are better
[0:38:15] MikeyPi_: Just came from a bit of vaulting during lunch but now I am stuck in meetings for the rest of the afternoon so lurking with you on mute :(
[0:38:17] CheekyGirl43: @TobyButt89 this, me too
[0:38:17] Cicatrix1988: I commented that monoliths would be cool as a custom seal like your idea for scavs
[0:38:17] rad_ju: could you make the world map available if the objective is paradox?
[0:38:21] TheImmortaldonut: You surprised us with the vault buff change in braziers
[0:38:26] GhostCraft1984: O love Scavs as they are yeah I feel bad when I don't complete but I feel amazing when I complete a scav
[0:38:28] DaddyBonesMC: dear Iskall, I am so bad I completed my first vault post level 50 at level 54 and it was a 9 monolith run.
[0:38:28] hygenhund: I don’t understand what the deal is. You can choose your vault now, even down to the braziers vaults. People are weird
[0:38:29] muttpacket: I had no feeling for scavs neither positive or negative. but now I think they are a lot of fun (1 year and 3 months into playing)
[0:38:30] elio_saratsis: I don't get how people don't like scavs
[0:38:34] AppleS0ju: I like how people behave like they paid for this modpack and feel entitled to criticise iskall for every decision they don't like
[0:38:35] occathereptil: you need a benchmark to balance the game though
[0:38:36] sp0rsk: why make a toggle when you can just adjust to the player skill
[0:38:41] Sootydog47: too many commentslags think because they comment on a youtube that what they think is what everybody thinks
[0:38:58] edsa71: I feel if someone doesn't like the way the game is created. Then they should take the initiative to create their own game the way they want.
[0:39:09] TheXanderTheMander: Not everybody can play a game 30 hours a week, some people can only play a few hours on a weekend.
[0:39:10] Pineapple0nPizza: @Sootydog47 100% this
[0:39:13] Cicatrix1988: @sootydog47 ir opens it up for discussion, though. That's quite a good thing
[0:39:15] Darkwytchcraft: perhaps some people just don't like scavs like some don't like other things
[0:39:15] Lakosius2: @iskall85  It would help if you have an options screen that also explains the differences in the difficulties
[0:39:16] FrostiTosti: diluteskall
[0:39:26] Nitsah4671: you get the "oh well you just play on easy"
[0:39:29] MaraudingBacon: @TheXanderTheMander what does hours played have to do with difficulty though.
[0:39:29] mamvis01: just use a seal???? like it’s not that deep!
[0:39:31] tonTeufel: The 1 issue with gamerules is that they aren't really documented anywhere. Many people are not gonna know that a gamerule exist
[0:39:35] jaegerdreadful: @hygenhund No you WeirdgeCouncil
[0:39:37] YanityZ: As someone who completes a Scav maybe 1/20 of the time, I still find them very fun!!  I'd like to complete them more often, but it makes me feel AMAZING when I finally complete one!
[0:39:51] twilight_zephyr: what about a gamerule to remove scavs from random rotation instead? then the difficulty of scavs itself wouldn’t need to be affected, while everyone who likes scavs would be unaffected
[0:39:54] forelini: iskall have u added the soul flame coin shop?
[0:40:08] ramnite_tv: @tonTeufel I mean... all the important ones are introduced in the quest line iirc
[0:40:11] evesteroo: @yanityz same here! I’m awful at scavs but I still love them!
[0:40:13] Cicatrix1988: I don't think any objective should be locked behind bault difficulty or whatever. I'm a causal player on easy and still love scavs
[0:40:17] FrostiTosti: i prefer it to be behind a command. if you get the choice when entering a server most will change it immediately
[0:40:40] BONNe1704: Minecraft have
[0:40:49] kinghingle: doInsomina false
[0:40:52] romdow: this is exhausting, if you dont live scav then just skip those vaults, or use seals. There are already ways to custimise your vault experience, use those tools and move on
[0:40:54] gifted0h: just add Harder vault stone
[0:40:58] TheXanderTheMander: @maraudingbacon less time to play means less time to try and practice or git gud
[0:41:00] minipax84: In in game way to modify the acac difficulty would help that, so you can run a simple acav or a full scav
[0:41:07] Cicatrix1988: @romdow agreed
[0:41:12] basman333: just got here whatsupp!
[0:41:16] Darkwytchcraft: I could easily argue that a lot of people who are higher skill, want to police how lower skilled folks enjoy a game
[0:41:22] jaegerdreadful: Time for work, goodbye
[0:41:25] YanityZ: @basman333 hi!
[0:41:29] What_At_Twitch: @jaegerdreadful cya
[0:41:32] iljalz: yup
[0:41:33] mahik750: Emotions are difficult. I get annoyed by others loudly disliking stuff that I like in the game solely because I am scared that these end up changing.
[0:41:36] ramnite_tv: @jaegerdreadful mrmatt17Howdy
[0:41:37] basman333: @YanityZ hey. what have i missed
[0:41:37] Pineapple0nPizza: I like that entering a random vault could be a nice easy monolith / braizer, or it could be a scav and be more of a challenge - it keeps it exciting.
[0:41:38] sh4dow_d3mon: I like scavenger
[0:41:39] kinghingle: i love scavs, i think its a cool objective
[0:41:39] CyberGeiger: Poll?
[0:41:41] iljalz: no i do not mind them at all
[0:41:41] xemx_: I LOVE SCAVVV
[0:41:42] Wizard_Chach: i love scav
[0:41:42] wendymoto: @romdow exactly I don’t want scavs to be removed from rotation
[0:41:42] Pineapple0nPizza: I love scavs
[0:41:44] YawNeon: Yes sir
[0:41:45] peppa_j: Poll time
[0:41:45] heighleybaily: I like the challenge
[0:41:45] Kasszi_: i love scavs even if I fail them half the time by myself
[0:41:46] tonTeufel: it's defnitely a loud minority who have an issue with scavs
[0:41:47] AyushJind: poll
[0:41:49] onno1legend: its amazing but sometimes frustrating
[0:41:49] brokkoli_tim: Scav for president
[0:41:49] TheXanderTheMander: Poll
[0:41:50] jackattack_657: Im bad at scavs but i love them
[0:41:50] lightdemup22: Love scav!
[0:41:50] Pineapple0nPizza: poll is a great idea
[0:41:51] mr_lego__: I love co-op scavs but hate solo
[0:41:51] mahik750: I love random scavs
[0:41:52] wendymoto: I love then
[0:41:52] TheCykel: agreed
[0:41:54] Jason_vK: scav = best
[0:41:55] Skylion62: scavs are a fun challenge
[0:41:55] Darkwytchcraft: I don't mind it too much, when playing with other people who know how it works
[0:41:55] gaymersalsa: not completing a scav -> next completed scav feels much better
[0:41:56] MaraudingBacon: @TheXanderTheMander this is not true. you can make a creative world is you want to practice and get good and do nothing but run vaults.
[0:41:56] twilight_zephyr: my favorite object is scavs, even if I can’t always complete them.
[0:41:56] jimi_dean: I love scab, despite being terrible at it
[0:41:57] niku71: I’ve come to love scavs
[0:42:01] r1serva_: r1serva_ subscribed at Tier 2. They've subscribed for 13 months, currently on a 13 month streak! 13 months for update 13? 😂😇
[0:42:02] jetlius: i dont like scavs, but that doesnt mean i dont run them, i just dont complete them as much
[0:42:02] Pineapple0nPizza: poll it?
[0:42:03] fabbitheapple: can’t wait for the vanilla baised vh
[0:42:03] nationofcarrotia: That. I think that people want too much gamerules and modifying commands. At best, like a reroll scav command for the people who don't like omega items. But honestly, scavs are amazing.
[0:42:04] shaydeejay: i dont really like them that much, but im totally ok with them in the game. I have enough choices outside of them
[0:42:05] slimboyrobin: I love scav even when I fail a few of them
[0:42:06] ladylauz: Yeah i just seal the crystal because i dont like scav
[0:42:08] Lakosius2: i think a lot of players also dont like scav because its not a 100% clear rate for them and everyone WANTS to complete EVERY single Vault
[0:42:08] peppa_j: Poll
[0:42:08] sh4dow_d3mon: I agree
[0:42:10] xemx_: I am addicted to scav
[0:42:13] twilight_zephyr: poll!
[0:42:15] PiggyKillerQ: whenever I see scav, my heartrate goes up a bit, but I complete it more than monoliths cuz i greed too hard on monoliths. Whenever i want to win, i just elixir seal.
[0:42:21] fin03103: I don't see what the problem is with scavs being difficult. If you don't think you can manage the difficult scavs, just leave the vault and make a new crystal, or treat it as an architect vault and just go for loot.
[0:42:22] UTxMelina: I love scav even though i didnt finish one sofar but always trying DinoDance DinoDance
[0:42:24] suptrace: I hated scavs before level 40. but after that I lovedddd them. lvl 91 now and play mostly scavs.
[0:42:26] Frangus_: Scav is great but can be frustrating when you multiply times miss one item
[0:42:26] TheImmortaldonut: I've come around on Scav because I'm getting better at the game and the strategy for how to complete
[0:42:27] kriptou21: but sealing the crystal remouves the catas drop
[0:42:27] mahik750: Poll wouldn't be representative, majority of the players are not here.
[0:42:29] sp0rsk: i think the issue with scavs is that multiplayer scavs are a LOT easier than solo scavs, there just needs to be a mechanic that can simulate something like you can do in a multiplayer vault
[0:42:30] YanityZ: Would making "empty seals" less rare help?
[0:42:30] Shoot_Blank3: Scavs are challenging, BUT fun
[0:42:31] xanking96: poll it
[0:42:31] ladylauz: Yeah im not good at the game lmao
[0:42:35] littlepepperbutt: I really don't think there needs to be a change
[0:42:36] itzliam_222: SKILL ISSUE
[0:42:37] Kasszi_: Meli iskHeart we can run some scavs together
[0:42:38] xanking96: make a poll about it
[0:42:38] avian946: yup I don’t like doing scavenger early game so I seal. nice and simple
[0:42:39] nighthawk_2604: I think that people are whining over nothing, you can simply just leave the vault. Its not like all scavs are locked. making another crystal is pretty easy with he automation so just leave the vault. (ps: ik about the trinkets taking damage, just make it so that they dont take damage if you dont get exp in the vault just like gear)
[0:42:39] brokkoli_tim: I have failed many scavs but I will always try and that's fun
[0:42:42] occathereptil: there are soo many ways to play and adapt the vaults and the more you play the more you grow your own skills
[0:42:49] UTxMelina: Kass yeaaaa
[0:42:49] dropsteel: i lost more monolith than scav
[0:42:50] kinghingle: i think i get kek'd more by glorp than scav
[0:42:55] mabbieee: The fact that scavs aren't autocomplete and are more of a challenge is why they're my favourite objective, the completion rate in general is actually fairly high when compared to other games like Bloodborne where you have to fail/die many times to make progress, the possibility of failure makes success feel so much better
[0:42:55] twilight_zephyr: you should NOT have to complete everything.
[0:42:55] chrisw333: I LOVE scavs, but I don't complete many of them because I'm in singleplayer
[0:42:58] strainjp: It is good for the soul to lose every now and again
[0:43:04] Drummer10113: Now that braziers are sealed doesn't that mean all objectives have a seal? So there's no need for someone who doesn't like scav to ever run a random objective
[0:43:05] Attackeight: I think the randomness is good, sometimes you just get kek'ed by the game, and there isn't much you can do
[0:43:06] gcox2012: When you put a seal on a crystal can you still get catalyst
[0:43:07] urban_beach: Except soulslike games
[0:43:07] YanityZ: @brokkoli_tim same
[0:43:08] Darkwytchcraft: basically it doesn't matter if someone likes scav or not, it's their opinion and if someone has difficulty let them live
[0:43:09] sharkyteeth101: I fail like 50% of my vaults and I find it so fun!
[0:43:09] IceSpice12: poggingtons
[0:43:10] Jackkabuki: Can we get the seal back if you dont complete the vault? Maybe for scav brazier elixir only
[0:43:12] Kalwei_: Meanwhile, one of the most popular games in recent years is elden ring
[0:43:13] Kasszi_: yep
[0:43:14] romdow: Do we think that? Souls-like games are pretty popular currently
[0:43:15] UTxMelina: thebay10Cool
[0:43:17] sharkastic_shark: Mario
[0:43:17] codetamine: scavs are best but they might get outshined by braziers modifier dynamics. Maybe a solution to scav are strong modifiers for each compleated set?
[0:43:17] peacefulaligator: Love scav, have never completed one because i only play a little and i am bad at them, but they are still fun
[0:43:20] nerdoidaao: failing is fun, you guys never played Contra from NES?
[0:43:22] rad_ju: maybe if it would be "Bonus crate quest" and not "Objective" players wouldn't feel bad when they don't complete
[0:43:27] mahik750: Look at the original vanilla WoW difficulty and the one now. It got so easy. I miss the challenging games and that is one of the reasons why I love VH
[0:43:28] Spiderwolf27: You cannot celebrate a victory without knowing the loss
[0:43:28] advcky: scav either feels great or terrible
[0:43:29] WoodenNebula: *cries i Souls-like games*
[0:43:31] TheCykel: thats meee
[0:43:33] doctor_pan30: games now just keep holding your hands till the very end
[0:43:33] Nitsah4671: I hate scavs, BUT objectives are optional, so I just ignore them KEKW
[0:43:33] Arvom: I'm not good at scav but i don't seal my crystal cos i like the randomness of the objective
[0:43:35] Atomxs77: MEE TOO
[0:43:36] IceSpice12: what’s craft
[0:43:36] kaelanirizar: me lol
[0:43:38] slimboyrobin: I'm in that 1%
[0:43:40] urban_beach: Elden Ring was game of the year last year
[0:43:41] StandaSK: I'm the 0.5% then lol
[0:43:43] nationofcarrotia: Yeah. I grew up with the likes of pokemon emerald, and it took me a very long time to complete. The only pokemon game that ever gave me the same feeling was pokemon ultra moon, and it's now my favorite game.
[0:43:44] bbanta4life: Yeah I'm in that boat. I'll.quite often just leave the vault if it's a hard scav, it doesn't bother me all that much. And sometimes I like scav just for a bit of a change.
[0:43:44] Kasszi_: a little bit me
[0:43:44] SammJ85: woo im one of the 0.5%
[0:43:44] tonTeufel: I've come back because of vh
[0:43:45] xemx_: I love those last minute clutches with scav, it just makes it so much fun. and when you dont get to finish yeah thats part of the game. You shouldnt win all the time
[0:43:45] karthavya: I want challenge to play games , if there is no challenge I will probably not even touch that game
[0:43:45] romdow: also rougue likes have failure built in usually
[0:43:49] eXQyu_: whats minecraft? is it popular
[0:43:50] MaraudingBacon: @romdow this is an edge case game that is like BECUASE of its difficulty. its not the in any way the norm
[0:43:51] kagtobio: im not the best player i lose about 50/50 of my scavs but even if i lose its still fun and i get a ton of free stuff to smelt down into shards, its not a crate but still feels fun for that
[0:43:53] rad_ju: every vault hunters player is minecraft player
[0:43:54] Arvom: I'm in the 0.5% too ahahah
[0:43:56] EVO_Gaming6000: I'm in none of them
[0:43:56] baka_raion_hato_31: @WoodenNebula smokeBRO smokeOP
[0:43:56] lynx6008: And viewsers who just like watching u.
[0:43:58] smots: 30 is young?
[0:43:59] rad_ju: it's subsez
[0:43:59] YanityZ: @rad_ju or even "bonus objective"
[0:44:02] GhostCraft1984: I am 39 and play minecraft lol
[0:44:03] brokkoli_tim: It's good that you can fail in the game
[0:44:04] IceSpice12: kids
[0:44:11] suptrace: I’m 33. thanks for calling me young. lol
[0:44:12] cassemess: I think people who play Terraria also play vault hunter
[0:44:14] Teodorplays4life: first live hello, mr iskall
[0:44:16] andrevictorau: I enjoy a difficulty curve. which is why I do HC VH Means I have to take less stupid
[0:44:17] cylusmaxii: Roblox is way up there
[0:44:20] Lakosius2: Get in and out 25 minute Adventure , Grab everything you get , the rest is optional
[0:44:21] Darkwytchcraft: I like to take it from a disability perspective. Today, developers are trying to ensure that all players can enjoy a game, not just those who are at an advantage (whatever that looks like)
[0:44:22] jane_co11: Yeah, like Mario Bros. You as long as you can without diying. Or then start all begining and try to be better
[0:44:23] lightdemup22: 32, I'm just a baby
[0:44:25] pursued__toast: everything should be “winnable”. there should never be a vault so difficult that it just cannot be completed. if you improve your skills then you should be able to complete every vault.
[0:44:25] HazzaBazza9: none of my friends like Minecraft but love playing VH with me
[0:44:29] UTxMelina: I feel that DinoDance
[0:44:29] ddaffy_: Or dads that can play once a month
[0:44:33] Arvom: All Dylans are young
[0:44:34] EVO_Gaming6000: Fortnite Mobile is my daily then cod warzone mobile
[0:44:37] nighthawk_2604: basically ur saying that children are stupid kekw
[0:44:38] mayaicefire: I think that problem is that the point of the pack is to get the artifacts which you get in the crates, so of course it feels bad when it feels like the objective is not completable, and we don't have a chance to get the artifact. ( just to say i like that i can't complete very vault)
[0:44:38] Oh_No_Its_Kat: I'm just a baby, don't call me old
[0:44:38] gaymersalsa: @ddaffy_ LUL
[0:44:38] smots: I dont like being called a kid. But young, ill take it
[0:44:39] kumail2003: @iskall85 have ever thought of returning normal crystals to how they worked in s2 (how they had a chance to get random modifiers i like the of s3 but the dont seem to give me the impact of luck rolling treasure, horde combo or other modifiers that change the amount of chests)
[0:44:45] baka_raion_hato_31: winning is not a reambursment
[0:44:46] ovrandir: @smots I'd say 30 is young, maybe not in video gamer terms, but definately in real-life terms
[0:44:51] GhostlyMarrow49: @nighthawk_2604 well they are
[0:44:52] HardyRah_: You have lost one armorpoint =(
[0:44:52] sudbskwodiecwgi: Not a big fan of scavs, but since they give the by far the best reward. I prefer monoliths, because they make me travel throughout the vault, but the reward is nothing.
[0:44:54] IceSpice12: I only play cream craft sir
[0:44:55] romdow: @MaraudingBacon Sure, its a genre but a pretty popular one that is built on failing. Rogue likes also usually require repeat failure to progress. Maybe MC players dont play those genres, but i doubt it
[0:44:57] the_oscar_cat: alot of singleplayer games are easier because if you want to play something super hard, go play a pvp game
[0:44:57] jack_o_nightwolf: HI iskall
[0:45:00] sp0rsk: a lot of minecrafters are not gamers
[0:45:01] Giel2002: I think the main difference here is that in vault hunters you can't really retry the same vault until you make it. If you failed a mario level, you would try again the exact same level and apply what you learned. When you lose in vault hunters the opportunity to complete that vault is gone. You lost that vault and can never attempt to complete it again.
[0:45:03] phoenix_king_01: we understand it
[0:45:04] EVO_Gaming6000: I don't play Minecraft anymore and only watch Minecraft content
[0:45:06] TheXanderTheMander: @maraudingbacon the point is that if you only have a few hours to play and just want an easier time to run some vaults. Being too difficult will be discouraging. I know plenty of people who play games on easy just because they want to play something. I personally play games on hard difficulties, but recognize that people want different things
[0:45:06] lightdemup22: Gets boring if it's easy
[0:45:09] Darkwytchcraft: I"m over 55
[0:45:11] suptrace: tell the people who hate scavs to just use treasure goggles and quit whining 😂😂😂
[0:45:13] ladylauz: Hey old people can be not so great at games too lmao
[0:45:17] TobyButt89: The difference between failure in VH and failure in other games is, in other games, you go back to the check point and try again and again until you succeeded. In VH you can never do the same run again and again because vault seeds are random every time
[0:45:19] shaydeejay: same
[0:45:22] phoenix_king_01: we are teens btw
[0:45:24] wendymoto: I didn’t either
[0:45:25] JustusIsOnline: im actually 96 years old (real)
[0:45:25] rhometheus: I think it’s important to recognize that the modded world of Minecraft is older than the vanilla world of Minecraft
[0:45:32] Oh_No_Its_Kat: i honestly think the target group of minecraft is getting older
[0:45:33] mahik750: I love to get better in games. The other day our server crashed and I relogged with half a heart, being clobbered by mobs. I survived and I felt proud, but half a year ago, I would've panicked and died. I got better, that is also thanks to VH constantly challenging me.
[0:45:33] ladylauz: I think some of the mods are super hard though lol
[0:45:33] smash7711: Dude I'm older then you and I love this game
[0:45:34] IceSpice12: pop off queen
[0:45:34] EVO_Gaming6000: I might start a hardcore world in a few days
[0:45:35] sharkastic_shark: I have thousands of hours
[0:45:37] andrevictorau: im ancient by now
[0:45:38] nationofcarrotia: Minecraft is definetely not a children's game
[0:45:39] occathereptil: at this point Minecraft is for everyone not just children
[0:45:39] smots: @ovrandir true. Videogame based i only meet younger peeps hah
[0:45:41] eselpgagHD: I dont think most vh players are children tbh
[0:45:42] strainjp: I love explaining to my colleagues why I play Minecraft at 28
[0:45:44] PiggyKillerQ: @suptrace if you normally use another trinket, its hard to do that on a random roll scav tbf
[0:45:44] UTxMelina: I play Minecraft bc of VH and there people i meet <3 <3
[0:45:46] YanityZ: hahaha truth

[0:46:04] Darkwytchcraft: that may be true, or some of us USED to be good, but then we aged and have lost some of our reflexes and other things
[0:46:04] samsam21amb: true (for me)

[0:46:08] jallyhoo: True. That describes me. Skill issue.
[0:46:09] ladylauz: I only started playing games when i became disabled hahahaha
[0:46:10] itzliam_222: i think thats a valid thing to say
[0:46:11] dcptcncrescendo: I love Minecraft. I'm terrible at video games
[0:46:11] PiggyKillerQ: i think java skews more teen than kid imo
[0:46:12] Jehosaphat697: I am not good at video games. :D

[0:46:18] EmzzyPemmzy: As a bad gamer yes thats True
[0:46:18] strainjp: 7 ornates! Go Etho
[0:46:18] jqckdaw: I would say they arent competitive video game players
[0:46:18] angelfoxruby: Fair lolololol
[0:46:19] xitzxreaperx: if the player wants a guaranteed win in a vault, seal the crystal. make it an elixir vault. but if you want a challenge, gamba with a random crystal.
[0:46:20] Asterionm: meanwhile: etho
[0:46:21] sanikdusst: 8 plnetidful etho
[0:46:21] jack_o_nightwolf: i love playing games like minecraft but dont have time for play and just watch conten and livestream

[0:46:23] Cicatrix1988: I never played minecraft until VH S3 came out. Now I can't stop
[0:46:24] BONNe1704: Iskall, most of people does not have time to play a lot of minecraft to become good in it!@
[0:46:26] SammJ85: im pants at building LUL
[0:46:27] Drummer10113: I think that's one of the good things about minecraft
[0:46:28] 20egemen04: Chat you know he's right

[0:46:41] Kitsonblu: i prefer saying I just need more practice
[0:46:42] andrevictorau: preach
[0:46:43] baka_raion_hato_31: @Cicatrix1988  that a good signe
[0:46:44] strainjp: Im a little obsessed with this game
[0:46:46] phoenix_king_01: we love minecraft so we dont play other !!
[0:46:47] JustusIsOnline: vault hunters aint yo grandmas modpack
[0:46:47] Asterionm: is vault hunters the dark souls of minecraft?
[0:46:50] brokkoli_tim: Enjoy the grind
[0:46:51] eonzcarr: I am an average player at video games
[0:46:57] sudbskwodiecwgi: @Asterionm hardly
[0:46:59] lynx6008: Vault hunters makes you challenge yourself
[0:47:02] Bikuta_IV: @Asterionm i like to think it is
[0:47:03] Darkwytchcraft: and other folks think they are
[0:47:04] IceSpice12: fart marathon
[0:47:06] Lakosius2: are a lot ? what are we ?
[0:47:07] elio_saratsis: Adge
[0:47:07] What_At_Twitch: Minecraft is not a REAL game unlike Vaulthunters! hehe jkjk
[0:47:09] Pineapple0nPizza: I find normal minecraft boring after vault hunters because there isn't enough of a challenge in the base game
[0:47:09] EVO_Gaming6000: Tbh I've not opened Minecraft this year
[0:47:09] doctor_pan30: minecraft is a very chill game. sometimes too easy of a challenge
[0:47:13] zeus_o9o2: the problem is being people having that look about oh i need 1 thing and im not gonna find single one because of bad rng but they ignore the rng that gave you 3 other things easily too
[0:47:16] bluethunder0809: i'm pretty sure they're gonna be heavier aswell
[0:47:18] Asterionm: well more like, should it be?
[0:47:20] sh4dow_d3mon: Yeah you shouldn't force a circle peg through a square hole...
[0:47:22] allintwelve: essaying
[0:47:22] buny1p_: the only people getting upset are the people that arent good at games
[0:47:24] eselpgagHD: @asterionm no its rlcraft or better than wolves
[0:47:27] advcky: probally actually more heavy jk
[0:47:28] Hamston85: !uptime
[0:47:29] Nightbot: Stream uptime: 47 minutes 34 seconds
[0:47:33] YanityZ: I'd guess either iskall was born in '85... or iskall is 85yo and never ages
[0:47:35] ladylauz: Thanks for making a game fir those of us who arent as good hahaha
[0:47:35] Cicatrix1988: @baka_raion_hato_31 for whom? XD
[0:47:37] thepolkyman: Gm gm gm
[0:47:38] Lakosius2: @eselpgagHD or better than Adventure
[0:47:38] Pineapple0nPizza: The guy saying that removing the scavs from the pool doesn't affect players who like it is just incorrect. I would lose the suspense and excitement of not knowing how difficult a vault will be as I enter it! I love the moment of realizing I have to focus because it's a scav - the challenge is fun!
[0:47:43] deanbelyke: !prime
[0:47:44] Nightbot: Amazon Prime Gaming gives you a free sub you can use here. How to: https://tinyurl.com/mpdps374
[0:47:44] sp0rsk: the kpm for vault hunters vs minecraft is like starcraft vs chess heh
[0:47:47] EVO_Gaming6000: I got bored doing the same thing
[0:47:48] angelfoxruby: I've ways thought of VH as a kind of challenge pack, but to be fair that's how I view it as a typical peaceful player. I don't like being startled but I'd still love to play VH
[0:47:51] Taigacha: IskalMAN spitting out bars right now
[0:47:54] jack_o_nightwolf: this is fine
[0:47:55] LobsterCanary: VH only gets more difficult if you don't keep up with gear and abilities etc.
[0:47:58] IceSpice12: studskall #daddi
[0:48:01] MP_Hazard: @Pineapple0nPizza I agree with this
[0:48:02] sudbskwodiecwgi: Monoliths are my favourite, but the rewards are bad
[0:48:03] Kasszi_: I only started seriously playing MC for VH despite watching MC content

[0:48:05] Jehosaphat697: would you say that Minecraft players have mushroom for improvement?

[0:48:50] lemonz3f: @iskall85 I played vault hunters 1.16 and, after a failed update, my 300+ hour world corrupted. I never could find the motivation to play 1.18 VH but all your content on it has reignited my passion for the game. Thank you sir
[0:48:52] MaraudingBacon: @evesteroo but this is the point he is making.
[0:48:54] RobUrHood: This pack is /almost/ exactly what I'm looking for. I love it, I tried joining the sub servers, but I couldn't connect so I run solo =\
[0:48:57] kinghingle: but for thoes of us that love both this is great, lmao
[0:48:59] bobbie1986disney: I have always been terrible at video games. I play mostly for story and always play on easy
[0:49:02] IceSpice12: what’s a peppa
[0:49:04] StandaSK: altar still has the same recipe from the video :D
[0:49:05] YanityZ: It's not that minecrafters are bad at other video games, but you don't have to be a good gamer to play minecraft
[0:49:09] strainjp: I like watching Vanilla but playing vault hunters is equally as enjoyable to watching it. Never experienced so much enjoyment from a game
[0:49:09] urban_beach: #ThisIsTheWay
[0:49:11] doctor_pan30: I watch minecraft content most of the time. Unfortunately I never got the chance to play VH. I have a potato laptop.
[0:49:12] cineeleo: I agree.. its like saying people playing Sims have same skill with elden ring players

[0:49:24] mabbieee: I agree that winning should take effort and shouldn't be guaranteed, Minecraft's base game lacking any sort of fail condition makes players less able to deal with failure

[0:49:37] lemonz3f: <33
[0:49:37] sp0rsk: i can't build a nice looking castle but grian could never in his life perform a single frame knee cancle in virtua fighter so we're even
[0:49:37] mabbieee: Vault Hunters is great because it creates challenge and caters slightly better to PoE/Souls-like players than the base game, I haven't gone back to the base game after starting Vault Hunters
[0:49:38] baka_raion_hato_31: @IceSpice12  it's a dév ; prety bassed if you ask me
[0:49:46] Lakosius2: Im good at not getting hit and being fast in Videogames , i used to do no hit speedruns

[0:49:57] Oh_No_Its_Kat: i started VH a few months ago and I'm so addicted, it's not even funny anymore. Really plays into the whole "gather all the stuffs"
[0:49:58] gaymersalsa: vanilla deaths are so annoying LOL
[0:49:59] LobsterCanary: You can always recover your losses in Minecraft.

[0:50:01] phoenix_king_01: i am not good in building
[0:50:03] mahik750: VH made me better in the game. I love that it could do that and that is thanks to the challenges.
[0:50:05] tyrsia: I think Vault Hunters is really fun. Its different. I play with a group of adults. Most of them stopped playing because its too “grindy” and they want a game they can invest fewer hours in to get progress. but they selected out of the player group already. I am still playing and I love it. so, I think you should make the game for the people like you who love it.
[0:50:05] ladylauz: When I do eventually win (even though its on easy) I am so happy haha
[0:50:09] oficialstuff: Iskall palworld?
[0:50:09] Darkwytchcraft: chatting isn't really talking
[0:50:12] Ribery931: playing hardcore has a better fail condition KEKW

[0:51:23] Arqae: @iskall85 I think you can call vault hunters its own game these days most games uses so many outsourced assets and code that it might as well be called a mod as well :)
[0:51:23] tymac300: same for me, vh has made me such a better player
[0:51:23] valkojam: Practice makes progress.
[0:51:28] dia__hi: Impulse has gotten much better
[0:51:30] basman333: has impukse played a lot on the server?
[0:51:33] NakeZast: Impulse is still Impulse the Dwarf
[0:51:34] GhoulHunter811: but i feel they havent still learnt the overworld part of vh
[0:51:35] thargonian: The vanila minecraft failstate is potentialy extremely punishing. It basicaly teaches you to never take any risks.
[0:51:36] heighleybaily: It's confidence mostly
[0:51:40] HazzaBazza9: foot pedal meta
[0:51:41] andrevictorau: most of th eplayerbase of minecraft really doesn't know how to play the game outside of building/ tech/ etc.
[0:51:41] lumistormpaw: VH is very much a different skill set of minecraft than what vanilla players use
[0:51:42] lightdemup22: I sucked at vh in season 2. I died so much. I used the command to get my stuff back haha. Now I'm in season 3 and I'm ready to restart on season 3 and play using the spirit if I die
[0:51:44] IceSpice12: vault hunters is why Harry got 3rd place in that competition
[0:51:44] djchange: one thing to be a pvp/fighter and anither to be a technical/passive player
[0:51:45] gaymersalsa: omg. can’t wait to see this server playing on hermitcraft next season
[0:51:46] Pineapple0nPizza: vaulthunters has also made me so much better at minecraft
[0:51:48] Ednoria: It can be overwhelming at first! Having other people to watch makes it feel less embarrassing to be bad at first, the practice can be fun too.
[0:51:49] Raynj12: GM GM GM Iskall and Chat!!
[0:51:51] Darkwytchcraft: I have experience gaming from the 80's through to today. But it's hard to communicate properly in a chat environment.
[0:51:51] Taigacha: Then you have False on the opposite end of the scale, a skilled PvPer
[0:51:52] ladylauz: Your passion is infections
[0:51:53] PiggyKillerQ: positional awareness and meta-planning of the fight
[0:51:54] angelfoxruby: Impy said he'd like to take his time if he plays VH again. I hope he does a run with his pal Skizz
[0:51:57] valkojam: Navigation is a learned thing in VH
[0:51:57] sp0rsk: i was very proud of joe on stream the other day just laying waste to mobs
[0:52:00] EVO_Gaming6000: The best thing in Minecraft is the mid-game when u make mega farms
[0:52:01] bobbie1986disney: Joe is amazing
[0:52:02] YanityZ: I play vaults like X on his day 1 :P
[0:52:03] ithillion55: Joe was smashing it yesterday
[0:52:04] TobyButt89: Of course they are going to get better, they play how many hours a week?? Some people play a couple of hours, a couple of times a week
[0:52:04] zeus_o9o2: Joe really got so good in the game
[0:52:05] Ednoria: Joe is doing great
[0:52:10] littlepepperbutt: Heck yeah
[0:52:10] spacefalcon15: It was all in Iskalls plan, he hated seeing his friends be bad at the game so he forced them to get better /j
[0:52:11] gaymersalsa: joe,’s usage of abilities is so fun
[0:52:11] Spiderwolf27: JoeHills is Epic!
[0:52:12] ShapNine: Joe looking pro now
[0:52:15] Kasszi_: Joe has been grinding like mad
[0:52:20] occathereptil: I personally love the rng of scavs and they are so much fun with friends, I find them harder on myself but still fun and even if I fail the objective I feel like I still win in a sense with the amount of soul shards I get
[0:52:21] patto290: Joe is most improved
[0:52:22] Arqae: When you try to use stonefall in vanilla Kappa
[0:52:27] Thirdeyechakra69: I feel like I’ve gotten a lot better since I started playing. same can not be said for my friends skill level yet XD
[0:52:27] Nicola_002: joe was horrible first day but now hes great
[0:52:27] AyushJind: Joe's adaptation is so good
[0:52:34] enne0404: Boot camp lol
[0:52:35] TheImmortaldonut: The biggest danger in vanilla is creeper bombs from above
[0:52:35] RobUrHood: I have to go to bed but I want to keep watching. I'll watch the vod, but there's something special about being live.
[0:52:35] Kasszi_: I'm 100% better at playing mc because of vh
[0:52:35] eXQyu_: I normally had those 1 month minecraft spree with my friends but I watched minecraft contents all year long. and I just had recently started VH world last month and tbh it felt like a different game and made me play Minecraft longer. VH is just a totally a different game and it just have a lot of content in it that it made me play minecraft longer by either just finishing the content or creating a fresh world.
[0:52:36] fin03103: joe is gonna be trying his storm arrow hotkey in HC S10 lol
[0:52:36] Lakosius2: Suuuuure Clueless
[0:52:37] HazzaBazza9: Joe has been one of my favourite vh play throughs ever.
[0:52:38] dia__hi: All part of his masterplan
[0:52:41] dia__hi: LUL LUL
[0:52:43] phoenixdrakenfire: Question sir: Flesh and Enigma chests are a fun part of Sky Vault. Any chance of bringing them into regular Vault Hunters, maybe as unique POIs in Blood Moon and Void vaults respectively?
[0:52:45] mahik750: My parkour skills skyrocketed compared to before VH
[0:52:46] Ribery931: LUL LUL
[0:52:46] GhoulHunter811: impulse told u that he would be helped with vh in mcc as well right @iskall85 ?
[0:52:47] Darkwytchcraft: navigation for the disability community is a huge thing, but I'd agree that I have gained some confidence and some reflex skills playing this game
[0:52:48] Attackeight: I hate not having dash in Vanilla lol
[0:52:49] soalsoll: But still lose in pvp againts gem
[0:52:49] angelfoxruby: Lololol
[0:52:53] eonzcarr: Their skills improved overtime

[0:55:55] mr_lego__: lol
[0:55:55] ramnite_tv: I'd like to have post-game stats for this too, KEKW
[0:55:56] pootch_1: he looted a ton of ornate judging by the wands?
[0:55:56] Nightbot: Everything in VH 1.18 is very under development & things might change.. Just Trust the Process-- iskall & Devs
[0:55:59] Lakosius2: Lv 62 Vault , this a very doable one
[0:56:01] baka_raion_hato_31: focus coin and wooden *
[0:56:02] bestbla: SKILLISSUE for sure omega
[0:56:05] PiggyKillerQ: probably over commited to wooden chests
[0:56:07] ghostp0_ogs: Hi isksll
[0:56:09] Arqae: @iskall85 Have you been playing any diablo 4 season 3 yet? :D
[0:56:10] dreneasuwu: ever since VH, i became more skilled and more into mods
[0:56:11] elplii: skill isue
[0:56:14] Koxy_XIX: wow that is a low armor score
[0:56:16] Darkwytchcraft: and skills are not ALWAYS going to improve to the ultimate degree
[0:56:17] Giel2002: Not getting purple mob essence is crazy imo
[0:56:20] Ginjajewfro: Honestly, well produced so far. I’m shocked, so many “an open letter to ____” videos are fairly low quality
[0:56:22] dia__hi: At 62 , 8 purple mob essences brother?
[0:56:25] PiggyKillerQ: look at the amount of greens tho iskall
[0:56:27] MarkDatter: ...thats a lot of ornate and living scav items
[0:56:28] Ferdster02: Looted a mot of living for a non-living scav
[0:56:38] eXQyu_: bro is a pacifist
[0:56:43] oficialstuff: Iskall just cant get how horrid scav vaults are. I hate them with my whole soul. Completely unfun.
[0:56:46] Jaxitac: Question - Can you add Fortune to Netherite pickaxe? does it work?
[0:56:46] What_At_Twitch: is he gonna blame RNG lol
[0:56:47] phoenix_king_01: me skipping the video then i remember its iskall showing us the video
[0:56:49] kinghingle: 5 empty jar a bit steep but kidna fine
[0:56:49] ovrandir: Hey guys don't bully this youtuber
[0:56:49] baka_raion_hato_31: @iskall85  loocking at he's scav bag could he  miss focus on the  scav ithem sources
[0:56:52] lightdemup22: Those are easy
[0:56:53] rad_ju: 2 super easy
[0:56:54] Lakosius2: Drowned Hides , he will never get those :p
[0:56:55] missionimpossible_: @oficialstuff what makes you say that
[0:56:57] nerdoidaao: ez scav
[0:56:57] gaymersalsa: @jaxitac the enchantment, yes
[0:56:57] silvain_shadows: Getting kekd on the blood vials, i can believe, but the purple should be free
[0:57:07] PiggyKillerQ: last scav was harder, the amount of wooden chests was a ton
[0:57:09] SnipyPlays: He got over a stack in green essense, he is focussing on the wrong mobs
[0:57:10] oficialstuff: They just feel so bad to play single player
[0:57:11] mr_lego__: main thing with scavs is you need to know where to look
[0:57:12] oficialstuff: pure rng
[0:57:15] Attackeight: the jars are difficult tho
[0:57:15] Giel2002: piles or poi?
[0:57:18] usernameunavailablevtff: @silvain_shadows Tbf 9 blood viles is free too...
[0:57:21] Jaxitac: I want to add fortune10 to netherite - will it work ?
[0:57:22] Lakosius2: or One living Dungeon
[0:57:24] nerdoidaao: and the good part of the scavs is the feeling of 'will I be able to complete it'
[0:57:25] ghostp0_ogs: No shield tho
[0:57:32] elplii: 5 empty jar could be hard
[0:57:33] the_oscar_cat: @oficialstuff nah, i like em
[0:57:37] howdy_neighbor412: This. This is how it should be calculated.
[0:57:37] pootch_1: people just dont have the Skill of going for specific chests and ignoring, i had to learn it myself and only got good at it recently
[0:57:40] Lakosius2: Ornate Dungeon or Village
[0:57:44] Darkwytchcraft: I"m going to say this, I can't see the "what I need to scav at next to the items, the image is too small" do you know of a way to make it larger
[0:57:44] strainjp: lets see his point hhaha he might not go after rng...
[0:57:45] oficialstuff: You chose between looting stuff or focusing 100% on objective and even then failing half of them
[0:57:52] Jackkabuki: He had hunter with living specced in a non living scav i think
[0:58:03] tonTeufel: isn't it 1 in 4 chests for the common item? 50% chance to get a scav item and 50% of those to get the common one?
[0:58:03] Sicketjr: 5 jars is not that bad.
[0:58:06] iljalz: thats not true
[0:58:07] kinghingle: LUL
[0:58:08] phoenix_king_01: not bad we have seen difficult ones
[0:58:10] Koxy_XIX: his tools might be bad, or have no damage/speed
[0:58:11] Drummer10113: Hunter kind of a necessity for single player scavs
[0:58:11] 2d_whack: yes
[0:58:11] lukeminer2: lol
[0:58:11] JustusIsOnline: LOOOOL
[0:58:12] 1imb_: this is why hunter exists lol
[0:58:13] missionimpossible_: kek "are you delusional"
[0:58:14] jennthefierce: Maybe we could watch the whole video first see his point
[0:58:15] Luxi86: @gaymersalsa hryStare
[0:58:15] xsmilesx: I scav every single vault I run. they are the best. I fail maybe 1/20. getting rnged on occasion sucks but I love it
[0:58:16] doctor_pan30: LUL LUL
[0:58:19] Kasszi_: he plays SO MANY scavs by himself Dylan....
[0:58:19] occathereptil: skill issue imo
[0:58:20] gaymersalsa: where did you learn that word!! hryLaf
[0:58:21] Lakosius2: Iskall is also the guy that most of the times carry others with the stuff needed
[0:58:23] tacoman_thegreat: My iteam rarity is 173, it helps lol
[0:58:24] Arqae: I looted 36 living for 3 drowned hides KEKW rng is a pain sometimes
[0:58:25] avian946: naaah scavs aren’t difficult. people complain about scabs but we then find out they only mined 70 chests the entire vault. you get better as you play
[0:58:25] ylme2001: I'm bad at the game, but I love scav, sometimes I win them and it's so good !
[0:58:25] Yesat: We saw Iskall do constantly do solo scav. His level 100 scav was solo...
[0:58:26] SnipyPlays: This dude got over a stack of green essense. I think he focussed on the wrong mobs.
[0:58:26] sharkyteeth101: Did Noone see his video yesterday??
[0:58:28] AyushJind: lol
[0:58:28] gaymersalsa: @luxi86 hryStare
[0:58:29] Jaxitac: @gaymersalsa so if i add lv 10 to the netherite pickaxe it will work? ty in advance
[0:58:33] Oh_No_Its_Kat: skavs are hard but doable. And it would be boring to get every single one at level 10
[0:58:33] shaydeejay: everyone is huffing copium
[0:58:36] PiTo_27_: Actually it's average of 4 chests for a common scav item on average hryFlex
[0:58:39] basman333: imagine cake scavs. where you have to collect a random amount of different items to make a cake then you win!
[0:58:41] howdy_neighbor412: There are odds involved. Pois multiplies by drop rate, multiplied by total acav items
[0:58:42] dia__hi: He plays plenty of solo scavs chat
[0:58:42] Attackeight: @PiTo_27_ nerd
[0:58:48] SammJ85: Jelousy be ugly Dylans. #benice
[0:58:49] silvain_shadows: @usernameunavailablevtff it's free if you find coin pois, yeah. I've seen- rarely but i have- vaults with no coins
[0:58:50] PiggyKillerQ: So each standard POI gives on average 1 Blue scav item, .5 yellow, .25 purple and .125 green?
[0:58:52] JustusIsOnline: @tacoman_thegreat scav items arent affected by item rarity or quantity
[0:58:58] ghostp0_ogs: What's your next move for vault hunters?
[0:58:59] What_At_Twitch: ooh stream exclusive
[0:58:59] thargonian: PepegaAim
[0:58:59] Jackkabuki: You can always leave when you dont like the scav list
[0:59:00] CedH1: I'm not agree at all, I mostly play alone and all scav are doable and exciting to run solo
[0:59:01] strainjp: its like rolling a dice and being sad you rolled a 1 and then a 6
[0:59:04] AyushJind: oooooh
[0:59:13] occathereptil: interesting
[0:59:14] gaymersalsa: @jaxitac I don’t understand the question? you can’t modify netherite pickaxes like vault pickaxes.
[0:59:16] sharkyteeth101: Fragged??

[0:59:35] mr_lego__: f
[0:59:36] Stanbroek: lol
[0:59:36] kinghingle: scavs are a case of staying on the job and not getting distracted
[0:59:37] ylme2001: I just know that I'm bad at scav, but I still enjoy them !!
[0:59:38] djchange: Isn’t it supposed to be a challenge and not gimme though
[0:59:38] st_ure: hej hej är sjuk
[0:59:42] nighthawk_2604: will do
[0:59:42] SociallyAwkwardBea: I wish the guy showed the end screen and how many chests he looted/mobs unalived cause that gives more info for the scav bag
[0:59:46] baka_raion_hato_31: @Lakosius2  what the points
[0:59:47] missionimpossible_: damn we got a whole 20 seconds into the video
[0:59:48] ithreymesh86: do the scav items get affected by looting and item rarity, if you have high rarity does that mean it effects the type of item
[0:59:49] abhinav_agrawal: i play singleplayer lvl 91 and i love scav btw first time playing minecraft
[0:59:52] strainjp: Losing is good for the soul
[0:59:54] pauLLiaNN: I'm level 90, from level 60 a think i played only scavs and from a point I can complete every scav
[0:59:54] gaymersalsa: @yuvalal click on your profile picture at the top right, there should be a mode setting
[0:59:55] Kasszi_: true
[0:59:56] Lizerdman87: I complete probably 50% of scavs and I’m ok with that. I have a lot of room to improve
[0:59:56] baboobraz: i only play solo and i complete prolly 70-80% of scavs. im lvl 90 in my current world
[0:59:57] iljalz: i dont win every scav, but i really enjoy em, its less fun winning everything, for my opinion, that is
[1:00:02] notTheRealHelmis: Perhaps posting the rarity of items will give people a better scope to understand they are bad at the game
[1:00:02] lightdemup22: People don't like loosing. Softies
[1:00:02] Darkwytchcraft: I really need to know is there a way to make those info things next to the scav items VISIBLE they are too small to see
[1:00:05] Arqae: @iskall85 The real challenge in vault hunter is gathering stuff for crystals KEKW
[1:00:06] advcky: only reason why i get mad at scavs is when i get an omega room with 1 minute remaining that i needed
[1:00:06] Lakosius2: @baka_raion_hato_31 a True Omega Challenge , just for the gist of it
[1:00:09] basman333: what happens after lvl 100?  does it keep going up
[1:00:11] TheImmortaldonut: Scav is tough, but this is my first playthrough of VH
[1:00:12] 1imb_: ive only ever done 1 real playthrough and scavs were one of the only vaults i ran because of how fun they were
[1:00:14] gaymersalsa: also chat. be nice :)
[1:00:14] Jaxitac: @gaymersalsa i want to add lv10 fortune to the netherite pickaxe so can get better all the mod ore when i mine it.
[1:00:15] ChapDawg_: I only play solo and scavs are my favourite vault, it’s ofcourse more difficult solo but there’s only been a handful completely undoable without incredible luck, but generally they are doable
[1:00:16] kinghingle: i aprove of ur objection to this
[1:00:21] littlepepperbutt: We also have no idea what he focused on in the vault
[1:00:21] JustusIsOnline: Genuinely 100% of scavs are doable, even in single player vaults
[1:00:22] Hyrim_JW: i wish i could play vault hunters but for some reason it wont work on my pc
[1:00:24] st_ure: slippper spanska prov i skolana så ja ä glad
[1:00:26] steve44445: it took me until lvl70+ to get my first scan that was completely unattainable(2creeper eyes and a wand). Most scans are doable
[1:00:26] TEONYco: Im taking a toilet break, dont do anything exciting while in gone
[1:00:27] sharkyteeth101: My only problem is that I keep running out of blank seals
[1:00:28] chrisw333: My issue with scavs are that I can't keep from opening chests that I don't even need for the scav. :D LOL
[1:00:28] reinaerdvdw: reinaerdvdw subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 41 months, currently on a 39 month streak! 
[1:00:30] Kasszi_: Dylan please be polite iskHeart
[1:00:31] ghostp0_ogs: What was your favourite moment creating vault hunters
[1:00:32] the_oscar_cat: @Hyrim_JW rip
[1:00:36] lightdemup22: Iskall, maybe give participation trophies for those that don't complete the scavs 😂
[1:00:36] romdow: Not enough!
[1:00:37] Goosnargh42: I have trouble completing scavs, but that makes it so much more fun when I eventually do finish them
[1:00:40] phoenix_king_01: we love the game !!
[1:00:42] crazumi_: but you have singleplayer lets play too wtf
[1:00:42] baka_raion_hato_31: @Lakosius2  so the  god orianted vault  isn't enougth or to late game ?
[1:00:43] Ednoria: @Darkwytchcraft I agree, those icons need to be a little bigger for those of us who can't remember where all the scav items are
[1:00:44] Jackkabuki: @gaymersalsa There is no all the mod ore in this mod pack
[1:00:44] gaymersalsa: @st_ure please English only so we can moderate!
[1:00:45] jametrics: I found I'm not great at scav. But when I get into a scav I usually focus on loot on bail. I don't mind it, I just know my skill level
[1:00:45] lukeminer2: Also you had a singleplayer series
[1:00:46] basman333: imagine a cake scav where you have to collect a random amount of different items to make a cake then you win!
[1:00:48] lemonz3f: Scav is meant to reward the player for a difficult objective...
[1:00:48] Koxy_XIX: i played a really fun scav where i had to find a lot of coins with less than 2 minutes, and i found a normal coin dungeon
[1:00:49] flat4jax: I see scavs as a chall3nge I never go out of my way to do a scav but when I do randomly get one it is a nic3 challange to try and focus it
[1:00:51] ladylauz: You do a lot alone!
[1:00:55] ThePxlFox: - Iskall plays his own game
[1:00:55] BlaziusBB: BIASED, not flawed
[1:00:58] cakesareyummy11: Arrrrg it's an ad :(
[1:00:59] sharkyteeth101: Greed is good
[1:01:02] rad_ju: 360 == 0
[1:01:02] mr_lego__: that is so true leaving chests hurts
[1:01:04] sharkastic_shark: I win more scav than i lose
[1:01:05] Hyrim_JW: @the_oscar_cat big rip
[1:01:06] GhoulHunter811: wait wasnt his lvl 99→100 vault a scav and alone, take that ppl!! LUL LUL
[1:01:06] Ferdster02: I'm not great at the game, but very rarely feel like a scav is impossible. I got a scav for 4 different rare drop items (total of 10 items) and 2 omega items and I missed 1 rare item due to being to scared to commit at 1 min remaining
[1:01:06] ithreymesh86: does rarity have no effect on the item generation or does it effect the rarity of the item type that is generated at all
[1:01:06] mahik750: 360? So no change?
[1:01:08] zeus_o9o2: Driftskall
[1:01:08] Yesat: But if you 360, you continue the same way :P
[1:01:08] the_oscar_cat: @Hyrim_JW maybe ask in the discord, see if anyone has anything you could try top make it work
[1:01:09] silvain_shadows: Tbh i think scavs are fine. I play singleplayer and complete about half of them, even when i greed
[1:01:11] gaymersalsa: @jackkabuki huh?
[1:01:11] usernameunavailablevtff: Why so much rage over scavs, don't like them, don't do them, why beating yourself so hard over something you don't even enjoy i don't get it
[1:01:15] AyushJind: @ThePxlFox SO?
[1:01:15] crazyzone0: 360 brings you back to the same place
[1:01:19] Lakosius2: @baka_raion_hato_31 I did Herald already , just want some other challenging stuff to do , as said , its all an Opt in Challenge/dificulty
[1:01:20] maloki: Scavs are great for soul shards too even if you don't "win". 😍
[1:01:24] zirh05: how other keep complaning but still keep playing VH ?
[1:01:25] Shoot_Blank3: Scavs get easier with pouches and better tools 100%
[1:01:25] Darkwytchcraft: thanks @Ednoria  and it's something I wish I could get an answer to
[1:01:26] YanityZ: 360: I think he means bring everything together
[1:01:26] gaymersalsa: LUL
[1:01:31] spurlucke: He shouldve showed how much chests he looted
[1:01:34] kumail2003: does 360 mean basically do nothing
[1:01:35] Gage_UK: Yeah but you know what he meant, don't be intentionally awkward
[1:01:36] Jackkabuki: @gaymersalsa allthemodium is from all the mod modpack
[1:01:38] SammJ85: I'm not the best player, I'd guesstimate i complete 50-75% of scavs but i'm aware thats my fault as I'm like a Magpie...... ooo shiny!
[1:01:41] MaraudingBacon: where are his poiches?
[1:01:45] Kasszi_: this guy has a nice voice
[1:01:46] cakesareyummy11: So what is hermitcraft vault hunters?
[1:01:51] strainjp: You cant complain about a sample of 2 though
[1:01:51] gaymersalsa: @jackkabuki what does that have to do with anything I’m confused
[1:01:55] CedH1: I mean, so scav, I get really unlucky and get frustrate not being complete them, but if there is never any frustration, the thing become less excited don't you think ?
[1:01:56] xitzxreaperx: with the video, how do we know he was JUST focused on the scave? we don’t. he shows “bits” of the videos. what if he waisted 80% of his time just looting or fighting compared to him just focusing on the task?
[1:01:57] jennthefierce: he does have a good voice
[1:01:58] avian946: pfffffft iskall talking about someone’s inventory being a mess.
[1:02:01] Koxy_XIX: got a lot of horde mobs
[1:02:03] CedH1: Some *
[1:02:03] littlepepperbutt: Lololol
[1:02:05] mr_lego__: we need to see his chests as well
[1:02:05] baka_raion_hato_31: @Lakosius2  i mostly stugel to see how far the difficulty  modifie the mobs stats; but i honetly love the difficulty
[1:02:06] lightdemup22: 😂
[1:02:06] missionimpossible_: tbf it should really be more clear what mob drops what essence
[1:02:06] kinghingle: well yea, u didnt explore for coins enough and spent too much time killing mobs u didnt need
[1:02:07] SnipyPlays: he got over a stack of green essense
[1:02:12] gaymersalsa: @cakesareyummy11 vault hunters server for some hermitcraft members
[1:02:15] Jackkabuki: 80 chests at lvl 61?
[1:02:16] anonymoususer281: 131, 80 chest on lvl 60+ is pretty bad too
[1:02:18] eXQyu_: prolly didnt know which mob drops what tho hahahahah
[1:02:20] Jaxitac: online says you can't add fortune to a netherite pickaxe so i thought i'll ask a hermitcrafter  ( expert) @gaymersalsa
[1:02:21] PiggyKillerQ: he probably doesnt know
[1:02:23] Drummer10113: That statement kind of screams he doesn't know the drops
[1:02:27] Oh_No_Its_Kat: iskall escalating :D :D
[1:02:27] Luxi86: CAKE
[1:02:28] lemonz3f: 73 green essence... MoRe MoBs
[1:02:31] missionimpossible_: @eXQyu_ is it actually said anywhere in the game lol
[1:02:34] sharkyteeth101: OMG WHAT
[1:02:35] phoenix_king_01: lol
[1:02:35] YanityZ: lol
[1:02:35] iljalz: HAH
[1:02:35] bingbangbomber: how is someone new to the ghame supposed to know these things tho... idk what mobs drops what, nor is it explaiend anywhere
[1:02:37] 1imb_: wouldn't it be funny if we all boosted this guy to 1k subs
[1:02:38] scoutofthewoods: i was just catching up on vodskall when i saw that iskall is live!!!!
[1:02:38] Nightbot: @PiggyKillerQ -> cmonBruh [stop spamming symbols] [warning]
[1:02:38] hina9191: Loll
[1:02:39] DasRosi: did you know? Kappa
[1:02:40] Xarallon: cakes changed?
[1:02:41] rad_ju: what cake update?
[1:02:42] WoodenNebula: wait, cake vault changed?
[1:02:44] Kasszi_: Cake vaults are changing?
[1:02:45] RavenclawNatsfan: they changed cake vaults?
[1:02:48] ijulia24: LUL
[1:02:50] Lakosius2: @baka_raion_hato_31 Most Mobs can be avoided , and its possible to do 6k damage regularly , so there needed , at least for me , more challenge
[1:02:51] sharkyteeth101: cake is changing???
[1:02:52] J_l_H_1: iskPower
[1:02:56] silvain_shadows: Dear god this poor guy needs a better bag setup. Sir. Sir i will give you pouches for junk items.
[1:02:56] widepeepohappy53: Is update 13 out?
[1:02:57] tacoman_thegreat: He sounds like wels and hypno had a baby
[1:02:58] What_At_Twitch: yeah its a different game mode, different fun
[1:03:00] angelfoxruby: DinoDance DinoDance DinoDance
[1:03:00] TheImmortaldonut: It's sometimes not clear which mobs drop which essence
[1:03:02] Jackkabuki: Did he ask to use your footage?
[1:03:04] Kasszi_: what was the problem with the boss crates
[1:03:04] gaymersalsa: @jaxitac weird, you should be able to in both vanilla and vault hunters
[1:03:09] Luxi86: cake are changing D:
[1:03:11] pootch_1: i thought the EXACT SAME BEFORE i learned to ignore and focus on specific chests i need for the scav, it took me playing for months before it clicked for me
[1:03:12] dia__hi: Iskallception
[1:03:13] angelfoxruby: Iskall sception
[1:03:13] nerdoidaao: LOL
[1:03:15] kinghingle: oh i see whats coming, conflaiting cake with scavs
[1:03:17] hina9191: Huh
[1:03:17] AyushJind: oh old Iskall changing
[1:03:22] ramnite_tv: ????????? lolwut
[1:03:23] strainjp: comparing apples with oranges
[1:03:23] rad_ju: :D
[1:03:25] zeus_o9o2: Bro thinks he won the argument
[1:03:30] CheekyGirl43: oh gosh
[1:03:32] francesca828: I think maybe it was more clear which mobs drop which colour he would know?
[1:03:33] eXQyu_: when did cake vault change?
[1:03:33] usernameunavailablevtff: Way to strawman that argument lmao
[1:03:33] romdow: has he forgotten that cake vaults are about searching for cakes?
[1:03:34] Jason_vK: cake vaults arent comparable since they arent normal objectives
[1:03:35] lynx6008: Lol
[1:03:35] crazumi_: lmaoooooooo
[1:03:35] littlepepperbutt: iskFool
[1:03:35] fenixcrafter05: haha took him out of context
[1:03:36] TruePat: Cake and scared are different vaults
[1:03:36] Kasszi_: im confused too
[1:03:37] Lakosius2: "... And thats not fun ...."
[1:03:37] mahik750: Taking things out of context lvl 2000
[1:03:38] missionimpossible_: apparently looking for things in general is bad lmao
[1:03:38] Gage_UK: Snipped a piece of info without context to make it fit his narrative
[1:03:39] Ferdster02: That looking for a crake is cringe
[1:03:42] regardingcoco: ohhh thats gonna be a wild argument following
[1:03:45] nationofcarrotia: What-
[1:03:48] baka_raion_hato_31: @Lakosius2  gears is an investment ; i enjoy the skill to back up the  ( player skill level )
[1:03:49] YawNeon: Hmmmmmmm
[1:03:49] CheekyGirl43: i mean, forget looking for a cake at all then
[1:03:50] Hyweed_: he's probably talking about the handovers in scav?
[1:03:50] WoodenNebula: man is asking for scav submission thingy in each room by that logic
[1:03:50] dia__hi: Looking for scav pedestals aren't fun..
[1:03:51] ijulia24: Hey! Did you know that they changed cake vaults?
[1:03:51] regardingcoco: I know where this is going
[1:03:52] SammJ85: nothing, bad cutting and chopping
[1:03:54] mystoken: average twitter user
[1:03:57] PiggyKillerQ: searching for pedestals every room is not interesting, therfore searching for scav items in every room is not interesting
[1:03:57] romdow: Wild logic here lol
[1:03:58] Pambo3: this guy trying to turn your works against you :D
[1:04:03] shook_2190: LOOKING FOR THE PEDESTAL, thats what he meant
[1:04:06] gaymersalsa: LOL
[1:04:06] smash7711: Lurching for something that might not be there. So the Scavenger items might not be there
[1:04:09] missionimpossible_: iskall does it say ingame what mob drops what essence?
[1:04:09] Giel2002: He's saying that looking for something that might not be there also applies to chests in scavs I guess
[1:04:10] pootch_1: WHERE IS NUANCE AND CONTEXT?
[1:04:11] duckiedonuts5: Bro thinks scav turn in's should be in every room
[1:04:14] bobbie1986disney: Scav requires looting. Cake does not
[1:04:17] GhoulHunter811: omgg wthh this guy made a video off LUL
[1:04:17] Jaxitac: @gaymersalsa ok great i will add lv 10 fortune to my netherite pickaxe and how i can get all alot of modium ore instead of just one.
[1:04:17] Koxy_XIX: scav needs to be somewhat luck based, but cake vaults need to be more consistent to finish
[1:04:19] P3pp3rF1y: for some reason he missed the fact that you actually need to look for cake in cake vaults, but maybe that one is really obscure? :D
[1:04:22] zeus_o9o2: the guy doing some 360 turns

[1:04:30] chrisw333: Elixer is NOT auto-complete...sometimes it's impossible to finish :P
[1:04:31] LobsterCanary: Noooo please no electro swing
[1:04:34] gaymersalsa: KEKW
[1:04:36] sharkyteeth101: That's sarcasm
[1:04:36] magicw0lfrider: this sound harsh but it sounds like he's a clot chaser
[1:04:37] dyniss_: He took it as that we don't like tryna find things that aren't there applying that to items you can get from mobs and chests and not getting them but they are there, just by a chance
[1:04:41] lemonz3f: Man watched the entire VOD, decided to nitpick, and thought he had a point
[1:04:42] brett_232: not good at vault hunters but I love it, I am constantly learning, and I've wasted some knowledge for things I can't or don't know how to use haha, but will get there one day
[1:04:43] beefy_booty: KEKW THE SARCASM
[1:04:43] nerdoidaao: LOL
[1:04:44] nationofcarrotia: What is this lmao
[1:04:44] gaymersalsa: oh no.
[1:04:50] littlepepperbutt: Oh boy
[1:04:50] thespectrescall: I'm confused by what they're saying, you still have to look for cakes in cake vaults
[1:04:51] gaymersalsa: sarcasm missed noooo
[1:04:51] ramnite_tv: oh boy
[1:04:53] SammJ85: hes twisting the words and using them to "prove" his point. Bad journalism at its finest

[1:05:23] PandaDeusRex: This is O'cake
[1:05:24] crazumi_: scav vault is kinda roguelike
[1:05:24] lauraannierose: he doesn’t know if it’ll be possible FOR HIM to complete the scav
[1:05:24] wendymoto: lol whaaaaaat
[1:05:25] SociallyAwkwardBea: So he wants to complete every single vault and wants to auto win every time
[1:05:25] Chandler86_: LUL
[1:05:25] dia__hi: He's not a scav fan and that's ok..
[1:05:25] pootch_1: @G4G3UK EXACTLY, learning to focus is THE KEY
[1:05:25] CedH1: But he just explains why vault are actually fun
[1:05:26] xitzxreaperx: bro smoked his fair share of copioum AND THEN SOME! lol
[1:05:29] the_oscar_cat: no, that guy is fully wrong, the reason they are fun is that you dont know if you will complete @iskall85
[1:05:29] notTheRealHelmis: the solution is that you push yourself
[1:05:30] avian946: the journey and trying to complete IS the fun part
[1:05:31] RavenclawNatsfan: who is this guy and why do we care?
[1:05:33] elreonsol: scavs are the best
[1:05:35] strainjp: Chat agree or disagree, dont get out your pitch forks!
[1:05:37] What_At_Twitch: Hes saying its not hard, just impossible???? thats a contradictiob
[1:05:38] Lakosius2: Scavs are like a box of chocolate , you never know what you get
[1:05:38] baka_raion_hato_31: @Lakosius2  there is a lot to take in but  there is no dead ends  none the less
[1:05:39] SkullyWho: He doesn't understand sarcasm.
[1:05:41] Luxi86: EZ
[1:05:43] doctor_pan30: @VIrosueS yes he was joking
[1:05:47] romdow: the first one he did was TO difficult apparently
[1:05:48] Todumbtodie: i love scavs man
[1:05:52] sudbskwodiecwgi: I'll just run the objective that gives me the best crate, which is by far the scavengers,
[1:05:55] josephbramah: i dont get why everyone is so upset about it. Just dont play scav if you dont want to play scav? The game gives you every oppertunity to avoid ut
[1:05:57] Kasszi_: hes taking so much out of context i think
[1:05:57] Nitsah4671: @baboobraz for you, not everyone shares this feeling
[1:05:59] phoenix_king_01: solo scav arent that fun
[1:06:00] sp0rsk: i dont know what he means by them not being fun
[1:06:00] gaymersalsa: ethoMAN
[1:06:02] missionimpossible_: this is bad journalism
[1:06:05] GhoulHunter811: obv ehot was sarcasticcc
[1:06:05] the_oscar_cat: yes
[1:06:05] emilbxd: ya
[1:06:06] duckiedonuts5: Pitchforks!!! theexp29Hi
[1:06:06] ladylauz: Noooooo my internet is lagging the stream lol
[1:06:07] doctor_pan30: yes
[1:06:08] dia__hi: If it's not difficult why did you fail bro?
[1:06:09] iljalz: ig he doesnt lol
[1:06:10] SkullyWho: Yup
[1:06:11] angelfoxruby: Yea
[1:06:11] romdow: yep, its the sarcasm that gave it away
[1:06:11] NotSoClutch: scav vault best vault
[1:06:13] PiggyKillerQ: The challenge of scav is not mechanical or unique, its looting specific things. He doesnt think that is hard, yet clearly it is.
[1:06:14] mahik750: I think scavs are fun, even if I don't complete them. That is not that makes it fun, it's the process.
[1:06:21] Kasszi_: hey clutch
[1:06:21] samsam21amb: yes
[1:06:22] crazumi_: even me whos autistic i understood that he was sarcistic
[1:06:22] gaymersalsa: brb
[1:06:23] xitzxreaperx: you can hear the sarcasm when etho spoke. lol
[1:06:25] littlepepperbutt: They are fun!
[1:06:25] DElyMyth: DElyMyth subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 14 months! Hallo!
[1:06:25] Kasszi_: ok salsa
[1:06:28] Chandler86_: I think they are the second most fun vault type
[1:06:30] TheCykel: winning a solo scav is the most fun in the game
[1:06:30] lukeminer2: @NotSoClutch o/
[1:06:30] Drummer10113: FAILING a solo scav isn't always fun
[1:06:31] gamerpaul32: I like scav because I cant win ever time.
[1:06:34] Arqae: Of course you "want" to win everytime, but the fact that you may not makes a lot of sense to build up motivation to try and win the next
[1:06:34] thepolkyman: This guy sounds like he just trying to start drama
[1:06:36] fenixcrafter05: scavs are fun even tho i almost always fail cause i cant focus xd
[1:06:37] AdonMrPika: !followage
[1:06:40] abhinav_agrawal: i live scavs cuz they arent auto pilot
[1:06:42] Gage_UK: They're the most difficult I find purely because you've got to focus and not greed, which for most of is hard. That doesn't mean bad!
[1:06:42] Darkwytchcraft: twitch went nuts, restarted it and now ads :(
[1:06:43] phoenix_king_01: but playing and competing with friends is fun in scsvs
[1:06:46] lady_vorbarra: Fun is subjective
[1:06:48] What_At_Twitch: alright bye gotta eat pals logic him away while im gone lol, hes contradicting himself
[1:06:52] P3pp3rF1y: I feel it's more solo scavs feel better when completed vs coops feel good because of cooperating with others
[1:06:53] regardingcoco: it can get a bit challenging... but what is live without a little challenge?
[1:06:53] Snowtiger_21: Even I understood that etho was sarcastic and I don't get sarcasm usually
[1:06:53] PandaDeusRex: it's O Cake
[1:06:53] mahik750: Depends on your definition of fun
[1:06:58] Xarallon: multiplayer scav also ad some interaction and coordination
[1:06:58] scoutofthewoods: why is he arguing 'iskall is missing the point' when he's just disagreeing with a subjective sense of fun
[1:07:03] Jaxitac: I've never played this mod pack as its abit advanced
[1:07:04] PiggyKillerQ: the reason i like watching scav multiplayer is it spreads the RNG thinner, and it forces interaction between players
[1:07:04] SammJ85: it gives more jeopardy, more variety, and you have to focus
[1:07:05] Darkwytchcraft: it was easy to tell by etho's voice he was being sarcastic, but some folks may not be able to read that vocal cue
[1:07:05] AppleS0ju: i just feel like scavs are like a benchmark on how much and fast can you loot chests/kill mobs and focus on specific objectives. some ppl might like that and some dont have to
[1:07:06] sudbskwodiecwgi: Scav gives best crate
[1:07:07] missionimpossible_: i like scavs because they make you do something different inside the vault to complete them
[1:07:07] bram_stoops: I think defeating your objective should be like defeating a boss, which should only happen after a lot of work and failure, and even then it should be a rare and hard occurance.
[1:07:07] nerdoidaao: contradicting
[1:07:07] Ferdster02: I've been running exclusively scavs (both solo and coop) lately because bounties keep happening, and it's been really fun to do and I keep getting better at them wich is very rewarding
[1:07:08] dndgay: Good morning
[1:07:09] CedH1: I totally respect everyone opinion, he doesn't like scav right, but he just explain after why scav are fun lol
[1:07:10] eXQyu_: copium
[1:07:11] Jackkabuki: Do mailboxes work in vaults? to send scav items to each other?
[1:07:13] peppa_j: I like this guys personality
[1:07:15] maloki: Scav on multi-player may require sine
[1:07:16] jetlius: i also dont like scavs, but thats my personal taste... i disagree with this dude, but it's his opinion, sure
[1:07:17] SociallyAwkwardBea: Solo scavs are so fun! I spent 10minutes in a scav yesterday just running around looking for living chests. I didn't complete but still had fun
[1:07:18] baka_raion_hato_31: @AdonMrPika  followed since 28th october 2021
[1:07:18] Danymaddox: i mean i hate elixir but not because i hate them you should remove the objetive lel
[1:07:18] elreonsol: bruh
[1:07:20] Werisha: scav is not funn when you fail several times in a row and have the book quest to finish
[1:07:21] mahik750: I like filling out paperwork, because I find it fun, while a lot of people hate it. Fun is not objective.
[1:07:22] littlepepperbutt: Well he needs to believe in himself wtf
[1:07:25] CedH1: That's the fun lmaooo
[1:07:25] rhometheus: the ‘hard’ part that this guy is missing is exactly the stuff you talked about the other day… has he set himself up for success? scav bag? best tools? focused looting versus bulk looting?
[1:07:27] crazumi_: well thats the fun part
[1:07:27] baka_raion_hato_31: scavenger rng iis the point
[1:07:27] gamerpaul32: Can't win everything all the time. When I fail one I do one straight after to become I don't like losing haha
[1:07:29] MaraudingBacon: that is WRONG. every scav is possible. its a skill thing
[1:07:29] blackjacksepp: For me that is exactly what makes it fun
[1:07:32] Danymaddox: i do not know if elixir will be completable either
[1:07:32] jelly_ggg: It would be so boring if you knew you'd win every time
[1:07:32] yas_fel: @pandadeusrex  indeed it is O cake😁
[1:07:33] ido_katz: you had a scab run with etho and false where you needed one more omega item. it was one of the most fun videos to watch
[1:07:34] velvet2405: But isnt that part of the gane ??????
[1:07:35] xPebblesx: Does he like elixirs?  There is no guarantee there wither
[1:07:35] proshooter27_: the delulu is high in this one
[1:07:35] Jaxitac: but you'll never know fi you dont TRY right>?
[1:07:36] anonymoususer281: I think they are fun bc they are unpredictable
[1:07:36] Gage_UK: It's possible if you focus. If you need a guarenteed "no matter what you do you win" don't play computer games
[1:07:36] missionimpossible_: all just boils down to people not wanting to lose lol
[1:07:38] Sootydog47: ALSO, I imagine he spent 25 minutes in a vault and didn't get ANY vault loot, poor fella
[1:07:38] bluethunder0809: that's.... kinda the point?????
[1:07:38] littlepepperbutt: They're all possible
[1:07:39] CedH1: @blackjacksepp exactly xD
[1:07:39] JustusIsOnline: i mean you also dont know if you can complete any of the other vaults lmao
[1:07:40] lightdemup22: Give him a participation crate when he leaves scavs without completing 🤣
[1:07:41] elio_saratsis: The fun part is not knowing if you can complete it
[1:07:44] wendymoto: SKILLISSUE
[1:07:45] lemonz3f: Target? You are given the targets about the sav idem..
[1:07:45] scoutofthewoods: the tension of possible failure is a big part of fun!
[1:07:45] brokkoli_tim: Interesting mindset of if I can fail I won't bother
[1:07:46] WoodenNebula: get this man a splashscreen saying its easy
[1:07:46] lone_courier_6: then don't play scavs
[1:07:48] Koxy_XIX: just go faster and try harder to complete every single scav
[1:07:48] Kasszi_: the same can be said for elixir, you never know what amount you need and what thiungs give you the most glorp
[1:07:50] Drummer10113: Bro is stating an onpinion like it's a fact for everyone
[1:07:50] maloki: Omg message sent before it was finished.
[1:07:52] ImACompewta: Scav vaults are not fun because they aren't cake vaults /j
[1:07:55] littlepepperbutt: That's what a scavenger hunt is...
[1:07:59] TheImmortaldonut: I think this is all going down to not liking RNG
[1:08:00] Arvom: Wait am i dumb? He's saying that scav are fun right?
[1:08:02] occathereptil: I think they are fun because I don’t know if it’s complete able that’s where the challenge is
[1:08:02] Taigacha: I think he's talking about the rng of chests and the rng of the scav
[1:08:04] jelly_ggg: 10.000 BLUE cobblestone?
[1:08:04] SuiSyth: goal-orientated
[1:08:04] Arqae: @iskall85 If so, then you could make drop rate 100% but up the quantity a lot KEKW
[1:08:07] silvain_shadows: I wonder if maybe he doesn't know where all the scav items come from
[1:08:15] nationofcarrotia: The exact opposite thing is why i quit hypixel skyblock - it wasn't hard, it just took a lot of time. Both of those ticked off is fine, just hard is the best, just the last is horrible.
[1:08:15] AndyLurks: Nobody complains when their scav needs 2 omegas but they still manage to complete...
[1:08:17] Kasszi_: @Arvom video-person was saying it is not fun
[1:08:22] Gage_UK: I think it's more down to this guy wanted clicks sub tbh
[1:08:22] angelfoxruby: My thing is, even scavenger hunts in real life aren't always winnable. You may not find everything you need. It sucks to lose, but it's just a possibility that can happen
[1:08:24] missionimpossible_: @silvain_shadows it says it in the top bar lol
[1:08:25] lemonz3f: @jelly_ggg Kappa
[1:08:27] kraken151: arguably elixir is more of an unknown bc you could low roll and not know
[1:08:29] IceSpice12: fart character
[1:08:32] OneTrueSpry: Good morning from California USA. I appreciate you iskall
[1:08:33] TumikimKaNgMasarap: For me scav and elixir is the same. But elixir does not dabble on rng. And it makes it fun.
[1:08:33] anonymoususer281: Bro's just bad at the game
[1:08:40] nerdoidaao: skill
[1:08:40] tyrsia: I did not like scavs at first, but after watching your videos and understanding item rarity, how to find the different mob essences, etc, then I started having more fun. There is a learning curve but from the in game quest text only, I didn’t understand that at first. I still am bad at them but knowing that its a skill I can improve makes it fun.
[1:08:42] littlepepperbutt: It's about how you play
[1:08:43] NotSoClutch: skill diff
[1:08:44] Chandler86_: I'm the 1 percent LUL
[1:08:45] Jaxitac: Gheez i dont get that guy ... why play it then? silly billy
[1:08:45] peppa_j: He is saying he thinks some scavs are impossible
[1:08:45] jelly_ggg: Some people are just better at the game
[1:08:46] Darkwytchcraft: once you've made the creation of our own vault crystals easier maybe it will be, but some folks never make their own vault, they just push the button, take the crystal and go vault
[1:08:46] MaraudingBacon: @kraken151 THIS. so much THIS
[1:08:46] baka_raion_hato_31: @IceSpice12  enougth tooting around
[1:08:47] ido_katz: they scale how can it be rng
[1:08:49] lemonz3f: So what you are saying is that it's a skill issue
[1:08:49] AyushJind: SKILLISSUE
[1:08:51] Palmer306: I think a lot of the issue is down to the build and play style.
[1:08:53] Timtheunissen: @NotSoClutch Skill issue ;)
[1:08:53] eonzcarr: waoLurk
[1:08:54] Arqae: EZ ways KEKW
[1:08:54] PiggyKillerQ: I think people dont like the RNG of RNG, where sometimes hitting 10 10%s give you 5, where other time it gives you 0.
[1:08:55] angelfoxruby: iskDoom
[1:08:56] thargonian: like all of this is subjective because it all just amounts to 'fun'
[1:08:58] beefy_booty: I am the 1% KEKW #badandproud
[1:08:59] Arvom: @kasszi_ oh ok i understoon that they are fun for him 😂
[1:08:59] Baab83: Drop chances are rng but that not something bad
[1:09:00] Tobsi723: scav vaults feel like RNG, but in the end its all about prioritisation
[1:09:02] iljalz: yup
[1:09:02] BONNe1704: GREED is the issue. PEOPLE ARE TOOO GREEDY
[1:09:03] Gage_UK: Why would you run anything else then?!
[1:09:04] ithreymesh86: there was a comment the other day between you and etho the other day the issue is no one can loose in a video game anymore and everyone wants a medal @iskall85
[1:09:04] P3pp3rF1y: imagine if all rng was removed from VH - going into the same vault all the time seeing the same POIs with the same mobs at the same locations, ....
[1:09:07] pootch_1: @nationofcarrotia Hypixel Skyblock is really good for when you have tons of time, but i agree, especially early on, there is some skill to specific things, but otherwise its mostly gear and time sinked it
[1:09:10] StupidNamingSystem: Iskalll when you had the hermit scav event you had so many hermits in the same vault and most manage to finish the vaults why competing for loot, i think it is a skill gap as there was enough loot for multiple hermits
[1:09:11] Ravioliwith: I complete more of my scav vaults then my elixir
[1:09:13] momkus: Bro, you cant please everyone, dont even bother with this
[1:09:14] rachs224: im nt the best at scavs but i love a scav
[1:09:16] sharkyteeth101: NO
[1:09:18] avian946: scavs would be meta at that point lol
[1:09:18] nerdoidaao: lol buff scavs
[1:09:19] jetlius: i dont usually finish scavs, but it's my choice, i dont want to focus on that
[1:09:19] iljalz: what
[1:09:20] Gage_UK: Again, I would only run scav then
[1:09:20] sharkyteeth101: Just no
[1:09:20] Pambo3: lol
[1:09:21] mr_lego__: lmao
[1:09:21] ramnite_tv: I wouldnt care about scav completion xD
[1:09:22] sp0rsk: these are bad ideas
[1:09:22] AyushJind: lol
[1:09:22] Arqae: These are horrible suggestion ngl
[1:09:23] littlepepperbutt: This is not a solution
[1:09:24] slimboyrobin: Thats worst lol
[1:09:25] crazumi_: lmaooooo
[1:09:25] romdow: this would be game breaking
[1:09:26] SammJ85: magpie mentality is generally the problem if you fail scavs
[1:09:26] iljalz: he doesnt play the game as good LOL
[1:09:26] Cicatrix1988: @tumikimkangmasarap elixirs are totally rng too, though. You could roll a ridiclulous elixir and still barely manage to finish it
[1:09:26] missionimpossible_: someone doesnt understand balance *or* rng
[1:09:27] Nicola_002: this guy KEKW
[1:09:28] bbanta4life: Yeah such a bad idea lmao
[1:09:28] Kasszi_: that would be way too easy
[1:09:28] mr_lego__: easy level 100
[1:09:29] Arjan308: Yeah that would make scav's op
[1:09:29] oat_milk808: so he says difficulty isn't the issue, but wants to make things easier?
[1:09:30] doctor_pan30: omega vault
[1:09:30] kraken151: lmao a dungeon in every room is so overpowered
[1:09:32] iljalz: dude what is this guy
[1:09:33] baka_raion_hato_31: now it will be scav méta
[1:09:34] jelly_ggg: But would you know you can succeed every time?
[1:09:36] bluethunder0809: bro is onto absolutely nothing lmaooo
[1:09:37] littlepepperbutt: iskFool iskFool iskFool
[1:09:39] sudbskwodiecwgi: lol I would get so many chests every run
[1:09:39] lemonz3f: Man does not understand the point of a dungeon lol
[1:09:40] elplii: kekw
[1:09:41] eXQyu_: dude is making scav OP... I like it ahhahahaha
[1:09:41] Darkwytchcraft: at least he's trying to come up with an idea rather than just complaining about it
[1:09:41] EllieIsShmexy: Yeah nah this ain't it
[1:09:42] dia__hi: Then they die, then they cri...
[1:09:44] bbanta4life: That would be so OP
[1:09:44] xpcju: players are good as spotting a problem, and terrible at providing a solution
[1:09:45] Ribery931: every one will just run scavs for dungeons and just go into the normal/hard ones and be looting like crazy
[1:09:46] Kasszi_: thats just handing you the win
[1:09:47] IceSpice12: getting ready for fabs dungeons
[1:09:48] brokkoli_tim: Solution make everything easy to get but mobs harder
[1:09:48] MaraudingBacon: This is the problem with "easy" solutions
[1:09:49] lemonz3f: @eXQyu_ shhhh
[1:09:51] Ktolos: so far this solution makes Scav vaults the meta
[1:09:53] kibaz_x: Yeah it would completely break the balances
[1:09:54] xPebblesx: So you arent doing a scav you are just going in for dungeons and champions
[1:09:58] cylusmaxii: i think its a matter of challenging combat skill VS challenging tactics, navigation, time management, and loot types skill .
[1:10:00] shaydeejay: watching some people talk about this game makes me realise that people dont think about the whole process when it comes to game design
[1:10:00] Lakosius2: or the Ornate Village
[1:10:01] lynx6008: But make them difficult dungeons
[1:10:01] mahik750: yep, exactly
[1:10:03] Pambo3: very true. Dungeons carry
[1:10:03] xitzxreaperx: you would have to redo the loot table to go his route…
[1:10:04] pwn3dzilla: for sure. i beat most of my scavs by finding the right dungies.
[1:10:07] silvain_shadows: @missionimpossible_ it does, yes, but if he can't tell whether he can complete, either he doesn't know what to target, or he's not thinking things through
[1:10:08] AyushJind: true
[1:10:10] buny1p_: @Iskall85 there is one way to make Sacv easier without making them easier by mkaing a difficulty that just acts like a permanent hunter effect for the needed Scav items
[1:10:10] ido_katz: yes
[1:10:11] cameloOK: It's down to how many chests you can loot in a run. I can loot 100-150 chest on average so scavs are hard, and that's OK, I just need to get better.
[1:10:12] Prismarine_Studios: Hello there
[1:10:13] andrevictorau: yeppers
[1:10:13] angelfoxruby: Yup
[1:10:14] Ribery931: or find an ornate rare poi
[1:10:14] Sicketjr: I’m not sure this guy understands balance
[1:10:15] VIrosueS: it's an appealing but flawed game design, no? @iskall85
[1:10:15] avian946: dingoes are already part of the objective they have chests lol
[1:10:16] Jackkabuki: The best way to find 5 jars is finding ornate chests.
[1:10:16] flipstix92: 100%
[1:10:18] Mr13igh: Is this fella not learn what he collects when he kills or loots something
[1:10:18] doomyjuke: "good players will know" THE SHADE
[1:10:18] IceSpice12: we love fabbers
[1:10:18] Koxy_XIX: or get lucky and find the x mark room a lot
[1:10:19] crazumi_: thats how u did with your bloos vial in your last video
[1:10:20] JustusIsOnline: putting this nicely, i dont think this solutions were thought through very well
[1:10:21] Kasszi_: @Prismarine_Studios ello!
[1:10:22] baka_raion_hato_31: @Prismarine_Studios  halo
[1:10:23] Drummer10113: If you implemented that he would complain that finding the right type of dungeon is too hard
[1:10:27] ithreymesh86: dungeons are more common thus more likely to get it yes
[1:10:32] avian946: dingoes…. auto correct popping off as per
[1:10:36] Jaxitac: I mean alot of the stuff hes s\aying will put people off from playing this pack..
[1:10:37] trashgamer300: Iskall I can't find dungeons tho
[1:10:40] The_Real_Casj: TLDR: Skill Issue
[1:10:42] Ferdster02: I feel like the people who say that scavs are to hard won't be able to love dungeons, so the next leddit would be that dungeons are way to difficult
[1:10:43] CooldAtTV: You are talking about someone that has gem ores in their inventory at level 65, Iskall
[1:10:43] jametrics: Honestly after watching your choas theme scav, I want to try that method
[1:10:46] Ginjajewfro: I think this point could be implemented… if every dungeon was “impossible” lol.
[1:10:46] xoMommySiren: I’ve never completed a scav but I’m not sitting here crying about it.
[1:10:48] OneTrueSpry: I mean or Xmark or pois  I don't agree with him it would break the game
[1:10:49] ithreymesh86: lol I just said that
[1:10:52] ramzezramzez: I love scavanger hunts even though im 1 of the unskilled 1% completion noobs
[1:10:53] Chandler86_: LUL

[1:11:09] AyushJind: chadd
[1:11:10] MP_Hazard: would it make sense to use a non-trap disarm tool to get more dwellers for purple?
[1:11:10] elplii: kekw
[1:11:10] YanityZ: I love etho's sarcasm
[1:11:11] HeyimJrules: i loved this video hes so sarcastic lmao

[1:11:40] 1imb_: click on the endscreen vids!
[1:11:40] Darkwytchcraft: Okay, that may apply for those who are perfectly ordinary, but now lets add the lens of a disability.  Most devs of games are attempting to INCLUDE disabled gamers in their content, not exclude.
[1:11:41] nerdoidaao: LOL
[1:11:42] iljalz: so he doesnt like RNG thats it
[1:11:43] Gage_UK: They're fun!

[1:11:49] AyushJind: wut?
[1:11:50] dia__hi: Same as scav
[1:11:50] phoenix_king_01: we love scav how they are !!
[1:11:50] lemonz3f: Scavs are always completable... with skill?
[1:11:50] Sicketjr: so are scavs kekw
[1:11:51] Gage_UK: So wtf

[1:11:52] littlepepperbutt: iskFool iskFool iskFool
[1:11:52] ido_katz: lol
[1:11:52] missionimpossible_: scavs are also completable with skill lol
[1:11:53] nerdoidaao: the most contradictory guy ever
[1:11:54] gurglet: so he wants a parkour course instead?
[1:11:54] regardingcoco: ohhh boii
[1:11:55] valkojam: Ooh, spicy ad
[1:11:55] xPebblesx: so he is saying he isnt skilled at scavs LOL
[1:11:55] bbanta4life: "with skill"
[1:11:56] Luxi86: hryElp lightmode
[1:11:56] SammJ85: was this a parody??
[1:11:57] HeyimJrules: any scav CAN be completed with skill
[1:11:57] Ribery931: Is this guy playing on fragged then?
[1:11:57] angelfoxruby: He contridicts himself what the heck
[1:11:58] Jaxitac: Well thats a person i will never follow whats his name?
[1:12:00] MaraudingBacon: LAWL he contradicted himself at the end
[1:12:01] Giel2002: regular mario games did not have pixel perfect jumps lol
[1:12:01] ithillion55: different type of skill than pixel jumping
[1:12:01] sboggsie02: this guy made NO point
[1:12:02] brokkoli_tim: Maybe he doesn't have the right skills
[1:12:04] ido_katz: he tripped himself
[1:12:04] lightdemup22: How many chests he looting in a vault?
[1:12:06] BONNe1704: ***
[1:12:07] samsam21amb: what?
[1:12:08] What_At_Twitch: Hes saying hes good enough to always win, hes just not good
[1:12:08] P3pp3rF1y: was the whole video sarcasm?
[1:12:08] ELBLADOO: maybe you can allow partial complete so people dont feel bad for failing, and scale the exp and crate accordingly
[1:12:09] avian946: what? he changed his mind?
[1:12:09] IceSpice12: Pop off dadiskall
[1:12:10] elreonsol: yea alright he just doesnt like rng, fair enough. Gotta have some rng
[1:12:12] illycat_: iskHeart iskHeart iskHeart
[1:12:13] bestbla: SKILLISSUE omega
[1:12:13] JustusIsOnline: this wants knack gameplay
[1:12:14] kraken151: "always completable with skill" just admit you're bad bro
[1:12:15] Pambo3: loots 80-120, wants more skill :D
[1:12:15] CedH1: When rng is well balanced (like it is in VH in scav) it's AMAZING
[1:12:15] Kasszi_: bonne are yout rying to link something?
[1:12:16] hinsher116: I am a bad player lol
[1:12:16] JahinDraws: Man's never played a Roguelike lol
[1:12:16] Lakosius2: knowing where to Loot is also  a skill , what does he mean then
[1:12:18] vegzard: I hated scavs in the start, partly cause it was hard and partly cause I expected to complete every vault. As I got better and adjusted my expectations (and got maxed out hunter) I have grown to love them.
[1:12:19] sudbskwodiecwgi: Well that guy is lacking skill
[1:12:19] Nitsah4671: I wouldn't say it's 100% RNG, but there is a large portion of scavs that are RNG
[1:12:19] Mr13igh: LUL LUL LUL guy needs to listen to his own advice #skillissue
[1:12:20] thankyouforstraming: Hi iskall85
[1:12:22] smash7711: Dude didn't get the sarcasm. He didn't get it.
[1:12:23] valkojam: What is this person's name I missed. Want to watch it now.
[1:12:24] pwn3dzilla: this guy does deserve his view tho, so we should all go check him out. :)
[1:12:26] Ferdster02: RNG is what a bag player calls skill
[1:12:27] maloki: As a new player of VH I didn't think I'd like scavenger it looked too annoying! But completing my first one was soooo satisfying!!
[1:12:27] minitaurus_boi: Iskall distracted by thr lingery
[1:12:27] ithreymesh86: it’s the skill in dealing with the rng that is the issue
[1:12:29] What_At_Twitch: The RNG is how hard it is, it never makes it impossible
[1:12:29] ramnite_tv: ramnite_tv subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 11 months! Dylan, a friendly reminder - DO NOT comment nasty things on that person's video. Don't be weird.
[1:12:29] gotitm3m0r1z3d: in my opinion, RNG is what makes the scavs fun like having one that you get real close to completing but didn't get the right about of POIs or just didn't kill enough mobs is what makes you want to go back and get better because the satisfaction of finally completing one is well...satisfying
[1:12:30] kunfudragon: Hi iskall
[1:12:34] elplii: crit chance in lol
[1:12:34] iljalz: watch out itll get tken out of context LOL
[1:12:35] BONNe1704: @Kasszi_ mispaste :D
[1:12:37] fin03103: YES YOU WILL
[1:12:38] xPebblesx: lol
[1:12:41] PiggyKillerQ: you will, and its called cope
[1:12:41] The_Real_Casj: Iskall literally standing on Business right now lol
[1:12:42] Taigacha: I feel like they are the type of player to full clear a room before going to the next
[1:12:42] silvain_shadows: Possibly my favorite scav I've run lately was one i failed- had to kiwi for an ore room for my last item, died to fall damage jumping up to submit
[1:12:43] zeus_o9o2: Which dragon soul will come in LOL game too @iskall85
[1:12:43] yuvalal: What?
[1:12:44] Kasszi_: @Kasszi_ no worries
[1:12:48] kriptou21: i think its a skill to target loot and not get distracted
[1:12:48] DnGato_31: its predictable
[1:12:49] baka_raion_hato_31: crossair ishue
[1:12:51] TotallyNormalLlama: isnt there a spray pattern in cs tho?
[1:12:51] JDistrict1: stupid spray of that ak47 KEKW
[1:12:51] lizerich: the idea is to increase your probability of winning
[1:12:53] SammJ85: the true skill is learning and improving your game play despite the RNG
[1:12:53] candidcrafter: They do complain right ?
[1:12:53] jametrics: People upset about RNG so just play chess online and that's it
[1:12:54] Xarallon: scav is about time management and priorities
[1:12:54] andrevictorau: he literally answered his own question, completeable with skill. I am not a good gamer in fact I am probably one of the worst... I can complete 60% of scavs
[1:12:58] Pineapple0nPizza: Even if you're the best vault hunters player in the worls, there will always be a chance you can't complete every single scav. That's a good thing otherwise would it even be fun?
[1:13:00] IceSpice12: stud
[1:13:01] dannyyhoyland: I know I'm bad a scav vaults I really struggle with them so like you say I just run some other vaults but even I agree they are a fun challenge and when I do complete one it feels really good
[1:13:03] elio_saratsis: Blaming rng is COPIUM
[1:13:07] kumail2003: no offence but not every one is a professional player
[1:13:08] Luxi86: SkillIssue
[1:13:09] bbanta4life: Literally, at his level,.both them scabs he showed were so easy like SO EASY, he couldn't have focused on what he needed, it's really not a hard concept
[1:13:09] Gage_UK: "go give it a like" = "go block that guy" :D
[1:13:13] regardingcoco: this guy is gonna get the views of his life...
[1:13:13] DElyMyth: I am a bad player and I know it, I don't blame RNG for everything though, I just loot vaults without completing if I think I won't be able to complete (had a hunt the guardians I basically skipped earlier today)
[1:13:24] angelfoxruby: DinoDance DinoDance DinoDance
[1:13:28] 1imb_: "Thank you, you are wrong." - Iskall 2024
[1:13:32] ithreymesh86: scavs are fun but for me they are the most stressful lol
[1:13:34] lynnie_thelurker: @g4g3uk don't be toxic
[1:13:34] jazjax1: Hello all, what did I miss
[1:13:35] OneTrueSpry: I love scavs I won 3 in a row yesterday I felt like I was doing an amazing job
[1:13:36] SammJ85: @G4G3UK no sir, don't purpetuate hate
[1:13:39] Lakosius2: Bullet spread in Counter Strike is Not random btw 😶
[1:13:43] Ednoria: @DElyMyth me too. I am working on it, but it takes a lot of time to get good.
[1:13:45] doctor_pan30: tbh I was shocked to know that scav vaults are hated this much
[1:13:47] zeus_o9o2: @iskall85 the best example will be dragons in LOL no ?
[1:13:47] HardyRah_: Scav is dif kind of challenge, ofc its not for everyone
[1:13:49] ramnite_tv: @G4G3UK This person took time to articulate an open letter with sources they considered worth sharing. Nothing wrong with that. Deserves a like, even if we disagree
[1:13:49] Gage_UK: @lurkerlynnie I'm not being toxic?
[1:13:50] maloki: Scav definitely skill based!
[1:13:53] Meena4578: good morning guys
[1:13:55] veteranseaker: I find scavs much more fun to watch
[1:13:59] Jaxitac: Maybe hes just not good at it...lol
[1:14:00] What_At_Twitch: RNG changes skill required, doesnt make it impossible
[1:14:03] fin03103: if its too difficult just loot and leave, dont be a negative nancy about it smh
[1:14:04] Lashings: In a game with gear that makes you more powerful. Skill is less of a factor
[1:14:05] MFRuckus1: MFRuckus1 subscribed at Tier 1. 
[1:14:06] RedTheMiner: get gooder
[1:14:08] ithreymesh86: you Get Good
[1:14:09] CedH1: But when you got a omega difficult scav, and actually manage do succeed at the last kiwi, it's so so SO amazing
[1:14:09] IceSpice12: papaskall loves a challenge
[1:14:11] mahik750: I am slow in vaults, so I don't complete solo vaults. Skill issue, 100%
[1:14:12] heighleybaily: It depends what skills you've picked too
[1:14:12] bu1dak: love that the video just claims that everyone has come together in some meeting to agree we hate scavs LUL
[1:14:13] Drackst_Gaming: Just get good
[1:14:15] Knew_It_Owl: Just got the notification 1 hour late.. thanks Twitch! Anyway.. iskHA iskLL iskO Iskall & Dylan!
[1:14:17] angelfoxruby: Guys, even if we disagree with them don't go to their video and be toxic. It won't make you any kinder or make your opinion any more correct
[1:14:18] the_oscar_cat: its based on RNG, but you control the RNG with skill
[1:14:20] breadandbutter07: I love scavs! They’re my favorite even if I don’t always complete them
[1:14:21] phoenix_king_01: nothing in the world is rng (rng depends on other conditions , if you know them there are no rng )
[1:14:21] Nightbot: For everything Vault Hunters, check out the website! https://vaulthunters.gg/
[1:14:25] What_At_Twitch: @Jaxitac yeah but hes acting like its not his fault its impossible... its possible if youre good
[1:14:28] itsnotneon: @Lakosius2 Yeah but valorant has a random spray pattern
[1:14:29] jametrics: Respect to the guy for making a video though
[1:14:30] SammJ85: hi @Knew_It_Owl
[1:14:35] DElyMyth: @Ednoria I have a full time job and other hobbies, so I take it as it is, if I can complete a scav I'm very very happy, if I can't, I hope I see it soon enough to be able to switch to "don't care, just loot"
[1:14:36] GhoulHunter811: personally, i dont like scavs, but ik i can seal a crystal and if i dont seal it then i accept the fact that i can get scav and am ready for the challenge
[1:14:40] ithillion55: I'm pretty bad at the game, so the win feeling of completing a scav is AMAZING
[1:14:47] Ginjajewfro: For me, it’s not that scavs are harder. It’s that they took far longer to get good at. In the early levels, you lack so much knowledge on what mobs drop what essence, what certain POIs look like, even things like what village rooms have what type of chests takes a long time to internalize.
[1:14:52] vegzard: He lootet like 100 chests +-20, so it's not weird that he found the scavs hard
[1:14:54] lightdemup22: Yes! Iskall etho mode!
[1:14:54] Nightbot: To add your alias to VHSMP-- Go to the official VH Discord https://discord.gg/vaulthunters  & add in the alias-request channel found in the VHSMP Category.  shorturl.at/ekxLX
[1:14:54] ithreymesh86: so an insane mode lol
[1:14:57] Koxy_XIX: i didn't like scavs, but than i made new tools and ran a really fun scav that spiked my adrenalin getting it completed in the last 5 seconds
[1:15:02] aniketop123: Have you already ran your divine paradox??
[1:15:04] lemonz3f: Dylan was the paradox fixed?
[1:15:07] DElyMyth: @ithillion55 Last scav I completed I almost didn't notice I had all the items, I was just too happy about it :D
[1:15:07] TumikimKaNgMasarap: For me I like the challenge of scav. Even on solos, it adds flavor. Not auto complete. But it if i feel i cant complete the scav i just ignore the objective Or at least try to complete.
[1:15:07] Arqae: I totally agree
[1:15:13] BONNe1704: ISKALL, the issue is: THERE is random on SCAV and RANDOM on ROOMS. And to complete scavs, players need to know how to loot a lot of different ROOMS. I do not know if there is any statistics, but I would like to know how many rooms players actually complete!
[1:15:14] YanityZ: @aniketop123 no, not on stream
[1:15:17] cobswicked: i think presets are a good idea already
[1:15:18] Nightbot: Watch iskall85’s VOD’s at https://youtube.com/@vodskall85
[1:15:19] baka_raion_hato_31: rng  reatch to far apart
[1:15:25] aniketop123: @yanityz ok
[1:15:25] MFRuckus1: Iskall is a fun guy iscrea6Blink
[1:15:31] missionimpossible_: drop rates are good imo
[1:15:32] Jaxitac: @What_At_Twitch Yeah i totally got that. but practice practice practice right...
[1:15:38] Nightbot: Support the devs & the pack.  https://www.patreon.com/VaultHunters
[1:15:42] PiggyKillerQ: I totally agree, i really only miss the EXP and i dislike having to run to the portal to leave
[1:15:46] IceSpice12: shart
[1:15:50] kumail2003: chance doesnt mean guarantee 1 in 10 chance doesnt mean guarantee 1 in 10 if ur luck is bad enough then 1 in 100 or more is also possible
[1:15:52] bu1dak: Jason out there bruting this man's RNG KEKW
[1:15:56] vaalwater: Question about mob spawns in vaults. Do different vault types have different spawn rates. Such as purple essence, some vaults I'll get 50 dwellers, others I'll only have 5 spawn.
[1:15:56] Darkwytchcraft: if you have a difficulty mode, will there be a way within the game to amp it up should you want to?
[1:15:57] Nightbot: Everything in VH 1.18 is very under development & things might change.. Just Trust the Process-- iskall & Devs
[1:15:58] strainjp: People need to understand what random means
[1:15:59] zeus_o9o2: what is pity mechanic?
[1:16:01] missionimpossible_: if you want a pity mechanic just play casual
[1:16:04] Gabinska: let the man cook
[1:16:05] Kasszi_: Ice you got one more chance to be normal today
[1:16:06] jametrics: Pity mechanic?
[1:16:06] lightdemup22: Ew, pity Mechanic
[1:16:07] EllieIsShmexy: Iskalls in the kitchen
[1:16:07] AyushJind: LETHIMCOOK
[1:16:08] Gage_UK: The thing is with all these things. When you play, you as a player, you think about your own personal experience. As a dev, you've got to thing about the experiences of all skill levels, play time available for each person etc. The additions to VH for difficulty, tweaks for crystals etc cater to that and now you can seal to ignore the vault types you don't want.
[1:16:09] xitzxreaperx: I feel scavengers are 60% skill / 30% dedication to the objective/ 10% luck(RNG)
[1:16:10] angelfoxruby: PikaRamen PikaRamen PikaRamen
[1:16:11] WoodenNebula: let him COOK
[1:16:14] Ferdster02: You could make different setting: "pag mode" which is just how you want it and "baby mode" which is auto complete everything. Then if people are ledditing you could just tell them to play baby mode and they won't because of the name

[1:16:20] PiggyKillerQ: 10 vaults with no trinkets, free trinket run 10
[1:16:28] gotitm3m0r1z3d: @darkpuls_58 random number generation
[1:16:28] ithreymesh86: could you have a way to alter a crystal to improve your rng but negate the artifact chance
[1:16:32] jennthefierce: I think Scavs might be fun if you could sometimes choose to alter them to have no time limit, but get harder the longer you're in.
[1:16:32] Gabinska: RNG is math and people hate math
[1:16:38] itsquix_: if you never fail, it wouldnt be exiting to win
[1:16:40] IceSpice12: poggies
[1:16:42] jallyhoo: ew, no
[1:16:50] ToastingPasta: This is like playing Scrabble with my friends. There is def luck in getting good/bad letters, but a good player can mostly still get a lot of points anyway
[1:16:54] Tobsi723: the only pity mechanic i could see reasonable would be a "free" crystal to try again
[1:16:55] TumikimKaNgMasarap: Its a slot machine rng.
[1:16:56] shaydeejay: @Ferdster02 people would just be mad its called "baby" or something that makes them feel lesser. I think this has happened before
[1:16:57] ido_katz: gambling?
[1:17:00] peppa_j: Agree
[1:17:02] ricnunes: @iskall85 why not make the crate from scav the same way as the new cake? That way, whoever doesn't like the awesomeness of scavs can always finish them.
[1:17:02] oficialstuff: iskall thinks gatcha rng is favorable
[1:17:03] charly_lina: I am an absolut noob, that button smashes almost every game. Im playing on the easiest difficulty, can't complete every scav, lost my first five or so, but I love them! It feels sooo good to complete one, even more so when they are difficult.
[1:17:04] baka_raion_hato_31: @IceSpice12  for all serius ness why are  you monologing about  posterior venting ; when the topic isn't  what you say
[1:17:06] oficialstuff: 0.2% drop rate very nice
[1:17:08] kumail2003: u should be able to overfill items in scaves for better or more loot
[1:17:08] MaraudingBacon: pitty mechanics are designed to be addiction fuel they are not supposed to be good for you
[1:17:09] lemonz3f: Cheese ad PAG
[1:17:10] crazumi_: pity is when ur chance of getting it is like 0,4% and u most of the time have to do the stuff one houndred times
[1:17:12] Recognice: Which library is used to calculate the random number?
[1:17:12] Darkwytchcraft: I wish I could afford a sub *sigh*
[1:17:13] DJoleneW: ads :(
[1:17:16] PiggyKillerQ: a pity system for a cheaper crystal after a failed vault would be something nice
[1:17:21] angelfoxruby: BibleThump BibleThump
[1:17:24] nerdoidaao: no
[1:17:24] edward_buried: when is s10 starting?
[1:17:25] HeyimJrules: i died in my last vault last night and couldnt wait to get back on today to run more vaults
[1:17:26] Ferdster02: @shaydeejay I forgot to put /j  there...
[1:17:26] ithreymesh86: beer ad in Australia lol
[1:17:27] SammJ85: true, my husband has never beat me at scrabble LUL
[1:17:29] duckiedonuts5: @darkwytchcraft SAME
[1:17:38] missionimpossible_: your scav crate could be better for each one of your item objectives that you get, kinda cool
[1:17:41] Jaxitac: I'm new to java minecraft and have played a few mods but wont jump into the vault hunters til i get a little better at the basics ... then i'll advance upto that Pack
[1:17:42] K3AN0N: @edward_buried soon (tm)
[1:17:44] thargonian: yea a game needs a failstate
[1:17:44] Darkwytchcraft: I swear I miss more than I get to haer :/
[1:17:45] bigal1978: I often experience issues completing scavs, fully put it down to my lack of skills, as an experiment I tried to test it out using spectator mode to try and beat some scavs looking for relevant chest, even using that method at best success rate went up to maybe 60%. for my skill level random defo feels like it plays a major part
[1:17:46] Drackst_Gaming: Losing builds character
[1:17:46] mahik750: Nay, let me lose man. I want my wins to feel valuable.
[1:17:46] crazumi_: losing is good
[1:17:47] jallyhoo: The only reasonable pity mechanic is that while trying you get good.
[1:17:48] YanityZ: etho just lost.... lol
[1:17:49] jelly_ggg: Losing is learning as well
[1:17:49] ithillion55: XP for item submission might be nice?
[1:17:49] johnloomis201: Can I take a moment of your time to discuss our Lord and Saviour RnGesus... He mathed for your sins but will reroll for your lewts.. iskTroll
[1:17:50] AyushJind: Etho GG
[1:17:53] francesca828: Losing makes you want to get better
[1:17:53] CoconutTiim: Scavs are amazing, I have so many hours in this game and still dont complete 100% and thats good
[1:17:53] TEONYco: streamer wants me to lose sajj
[1:17:54] Kasszi_: i love that he said that when etho survives a scav
[1:17:54] lukeminer2: loosing gives you insentive to win again
[1:17:56] SammJ85: etho timing
[1:17:56] IceSpice12: goodnight mother @kasszi_
[1:17:56] HeyimJrules: etho just lost
[1:17:56] Pineapple0nPizza: I don't like the idea of removing scavs from the pool - I would lose the suspense and excitement of not knowing how difficult a vault will be as I enter it! I love the moment of realizing I have to focus because it's a scav - the challenge is fun!
[1:17:56] nerdoidaao: losing is part of the game
[1:17:57] ChapDawg_: I love scavs but with the cake vault principle could you not put a scavenger altar In every room?
[1:17:57] ido_katz: etho won a scav just now
[1:17:57] fin03103: meanwhile etho not completing a scav
[1:17:58] valkojam: Scav just takes practice if you choose to.
[1:17:59] iljalz: adskall
[1:18:01] jack_o_nightwolf: true
[1:18:01] kagtobio: winning all the time is boring
[1:18:02] TheCykel: chadskall
[1:18:03] Ribery931: istn leaving the vault already the pitty system here?
[1:18:03] xxxqaz124: Etho just survived lmao.
[1:18:03] HighNoK: i'm bad at the game i often fail scav obj, but when i succeed i feel like the best player in the world sooo i hate pity mech
[1:18:04] jazjax1: Losing helps you get better
[1:18:04] DElyMyth: Is Etho 100 yet?
[1:18:04] bunLunaa: @edward_buried sooner than you'd expect but later than you'd imagine according to Cubfan
[1:18:05] Darkwytchcraft: let's not equate Character with losing or winning thanks
[1:18:06] Kasszi_: good night ice
[1:18:08] teutomania: by making the first vault players have to do have no completion could it make people view the completion as an extra loot bonus rather than the singular goal of the vault?
[1:18:09] velvet2405: The old Master System had no pity you died younstart again no saves anywhere worse when dinner was called we need to get back to a bit of tuff luck keepntrying and the stupid hedgehog Indid finally kill the last boss
[1:18:10] Mierrin: Lose is improve

[1:18:12] GhoulHunter811: haha
[1:18:12] YanityZ: LOL
[1:18:12] drandromeda: vanilla Minecraft can be too predictable. VH is sooo fun cause the RNG makes it unpredictable. you give up easy on TV shows that are predictable
[1:18:12] Stanbroek: LUL
[1:18:12] ithreymesh86: !stress
[1:18:12] Nightbot: Stress has been hugged 18038 times! Gotta luv ‘er!, ya monsta!

[1:18:19] Oh_No_Its_Kat: rage quit
[1:18:19] Kasszi_: LOOK WHAT YOU DID
[1:18:19] Pineapple0nPizza: insulted him off the server lol
[1:18:19] D3jvis: KEKW
[1:18:19] six_o_nine: at this point they just want you to do every vault a seal so they can only play what they like LUL
[1:18:20] ithillion55: ragequit :D
[1:18:20] edward_buried: LUL
[1:18:20] OneTrueSpry: Apparently they don't know that you can exit the vault. You don't lose a vault just because you don't complete the main objective you don't lose just because you die anymore. You still get all your items
[1:18:20] candidcrafter: Ragequit
[1:18:20] jack_o_nightwolf: Lmao
[1:18:21] TumikimKaNgMasarap: If you dont lose, its verrryyyyy booriingg
[1:18:21] doctor_pan30: leave my etho alone
[1:18:22] tumbleina: LUL
[1:18:22] dixon159753: Lmao
[1:18:23] duckiedonuts5: xD
[1:18:24] Bikuta_IV: hE'S BACK
[1:18:25] ELBLADOO: what about partial completing scavs like cake vaults
[1:18:25] w3sdeans02: what if when you turn a item stack in you get a random positive modifier
[1:18:26] MFRuckus1: @iskall85 can you join my vault im scared i cant do it myself iscrea6Blink neffSucc
[1:18:27] cylusmaxii: The more RNG is used, the less chaos emerges. More RNG calls means a closer distribution to the curve . You only really get outliers when RNG is sparingly used .
[1:18:27] Ribery931: etho lurking LUL
[1:18:30] angelfoxruby: 2 ads on my phone 4 ads on the TV. The 2 ads are like a minute long and the 4 were like 20 seconds each. What the heck
[1:18:31] Jaxitac: I just said that ^^^^^
[1:18:31] baka_raion_hato_31: @iskall85 loosing , is the oportunity to reflect while winning is the reward end of  the researtch and practice
[1:18:32] BONNe1704: Iskall, is there a statistics on how many room players actually loot through vaults? As it would explain why some people complains about scavs and others are not!
[1:18:32] vegzard: If scavs where easier it would not be as fun as it wouldnt feel as good when you actually complete it
[1:18:36] occathereptil: you learn from losing and figure out what you can do to become better
[1:18:37] Pineapple0nPizza: yes!!
[1:18:38] RavenclawNatsfan: did etho hit 100?
[1:18:41] steve46: go to bed etho
[1:18:42] six_o_nine: NODDERS
[1:18:42] the_oscar_cat: when?
[1:18:43] muppification: yup
[1:18:43] Chandler86_: Yep
[1:18:44] eXQyu_: very true, whats the point on winning if you know you would win either way beforehand. It is not an achievement by then, it is just that you completed a chore....
[1:18:44] Cluemily: those were dark times
[1:18:44] kibaz_x: Yupyup
[1:18:44] lynnie_thelurker: Yep
[1:18:45] ithreymesh86: locked was so harsh
[1:18:45] nerdoidaao: I miss locked vaults
[1:18:46] mr_lego__: yup
[1:18:46] phoenix_king_01: yep
[1:18:46] SammJ85: yep
[1:18:46] great_chubs: all of them
[1:18:46] Sea_Jay27: yup
[1:18:47] jdubbs211: yep
[1:18:47] mahik750: Locked was soooo scary
[1:18:47] themadpeanut1: if you cant complete the scav as long as you exit the vault you still gain loot which improves your character and meaning you have a better chance next time
[1:18:47] jack_o_nightwolf: YUP
[1:18:47] AyushJind: yup
[1:18:48] Kasszi_: yup
[1:18:48] ChapDawg_: yeah hard times haha
[1:18:48] korfal_barbarian: I remember
[1:18:48] duckiedonuts5: yep
[1:18:49] mystoken: it was so painful
[1:18:49] Ravioliwith: Loved locked vaults
[1:18:49] emmery196105: yep
[1:18:50] six_o_nine: ya used to lose like 90% of the vaults ya did too
[1:18:50] supermarcus11: Oh yeah
[1:18:50] iljalz: yup
[1:18:50] Ferdster02: And if everything is auto complete and you do lose one because of a massive misplay that loss will feel even worse
[1:18:50] Bikuta_IV: Yep
[1:18:50] baka_raion_hato_31: sand of time event was pog
[1:18:51] PRIPYAT715: i do remember
[1:18:51] andrevictorau: please don't reminf me
[1:18:51] What_At_Twitch: bye
[1:18:51] sabrina1202r: @RavenclawNatsfan yeah
[1:18:52] FrostiTosti: since when do people cry so much about losing once in a while? if you want to win everything why even play
[1:18:52] dropsteel: yup
[1:18:52] itsaspacestation: lol the memories
[1:18:54] ido_katz: ofc
[1:18:54] lemonz3f: lemonz3f subscribed at Tier 2. They've subscribed for 2 months! First sub, never leaving iskHeart
[1:18:54] iljalz: i do
[1:18:55] Gage_UK: Yep o/
[1:18:57] zeus_o9o2: the thing here is rng is both bad and good but i feel this has to do with the sample size so anyone playing less games will be on the side of hating them is what i feel
[1:18:59] iljalz: @itsaspacestation IKR
[1:19:00] ramzezramzez: thnk god for removing locked vaults btw
[1:19:00] Mastereo_: Watching your stream while sorting items man this is tough
[1:19:01] jametrics: I actually miss the locked vault days. But I'm in the minority
[1:19:01] jdubbs211: bring back locked vaults lol
[1:19:02] basman333: i completley agree that you gain lots from losing. but i often don't and just die LUL LUL LUL LUL
[1:19:03] suptrace: finally switched to my PC from my phone.
[1:19:03] valkojam: Locked was not for me.
[1:19:03] buny1p_: I loved the hardcore aspect of vaults
[1:19:05] crazumi_: yep most of my scav i just leave the vault 'cause i'm scared
[1:19:07] suptrace: wsup chat!
[1:19:11] smash7711: Etho is on line. It's so early over here. Must not be a west coast Canadian
[1:19:14] jelly_ggg: And that is a big difference with Decked out! you have to succeed the objective in Decked out, and everyone loved that...
[1:19:14] EllieIsShmexy: This comment is so true
[1:19:18] Jackkabuki: If you cant fail winning loses its meaning
[1:19:22] Gage_UK: I hated it but that was my skill level rather than bad game design
[1:19:23] Nightbot: www.youtube.com/iskall85 | www.twitter.com/iskall85 | https://youtube.com/@vodskall85
[1:19:24] avian946: I don’t remember them being locked. you just could randomly roll locked
[1:19:25] Ginger_Storm: I was just talking to a friend today about how much harder objectives use to be with the stress of losing everything. I feel like the game is in a FANTASTIC state
[1:19:27] Stephexfox: it sounds like the "Kobayashi Maru" is scavege =?
[1:19:27] brokkoli_tim: Even if u die and lose u get ur stuff back and win a lot of stuff
[1:19:31] jack_o_nightwolf: i remember when vault get lock and cant finish the objectif
[1:19:32] Darkwytchcraft: I wouldn't know
[1:19:35] PiggyKillerQ: i really dont like the steep gold cost on revive, but I don't want to play casual. I wish there was like a 50-75% cheaper death cost option. I've just been commanding in gold generally to fit that mold.
[1:19:36] supermarcus11: Season 2 was more scary but more fun
[1:19:37] thespectrescall: I don't always complete vaults, I still value the stuff I get from them.
[1:19:38] lemonz3f: Yes good gaming time
[1:19:39] mahik750: Every month is gaming month!
[1:19:39] someBoots: nah its exam season
[1:19:41] Ferdster02: @jackkabuki and if you then do manage to fail it sucks even more
[1:19:43] SkyForze_: update?
[1:19:48] TruePat: You don't learn if you don't fail!
[1:19:49] baka_raion_hato_31: month to take out the pled and hot choki milk
[1:19:51] Jaxitac: When you a baby you can't SPRITN right, you have to crawl first... and you will fall down over and over

[1:19:57] hinsher116: :tf:
[1:19:57] samsam21amb: yes, especially when it’s summer holidays and it’s 38C
[1:19:59] Jackkabuki: @avian946 it was a random negative modifier / curse
[1:20:01] baka_raion_hato_31: Skill improove
[1:20:03] missionimpossible_: wow it's like skill is a thing
[1:20:03] eXQyu_: iskall was like, nah i aint reading all that
[1:20:05] TobyButt89: Honestly, once the seal is in for braziers, I think scavs being not always completeable is going to be less of an issue, because if you want to grind completions for artifacts, then there's a fairly consistent way to get completions
[1:20:07] ramnite_tv: @PiggyKillerQ You could aim for soulbound gear, and also try afterlife vaults, too!
[1:20:07] EllieIsShmexy: He is the proof
[1:20:08] anonymoususer281: Hunter is always there to compensate skill
[1:20:09] Kasszi_: who woulda thought
[1:20:12] duckiedonuts5: Wait so skill HELPS!!!!????
[1:20:13] itzliam_222: this is what we call a non skill issue anymore
[1:20:14] Jaxitac: *sprint
[1:20:15] karthavya: knowledge is skill
[1:20:19] Drackst_Gaming: He learned the tricks of the trade
[1:20:28] Gabinska: You should read the "FUN" page on the dwarf fortress wiki (lose = fun)
[1:20:29] itzliam_222: @Kasszi_ undeafen u loser
[1:20:33] xanking96: when are we gonne do a paradox?
[1:20:36] jennthefierce: he got better bc he watched your channel a lot. lol ad?
[1:20:42] Kasszi_: @Kasszi_ Stare
[1:20:48] Simon04090: scavs are by far my most favorite objective and I only complete like 1 in 3 and I don’t care
[1:20:48] MFRuckus1: Paragraphing
[1:20:51] PiggyKillerQ: is a 2 omega scav equal to a 16 common scav?
[1:20:55] maha381: @IceSpice12 u said it with TTS yet?
[1:20:58] TheImmortaldonut: I think I got better from watching gameplay too
[1:21:17] ithillion55: but by clearing a dungeon you do increase your odds because you get more chests
[1:21:17] ithreymesh86: that does seem like a cool option for dungeon
[1:21:24] Pineapple0nPizza: But the skill is being ABLE to loot more chests overall?
[1:21:31] zeus_o9o2: how does the scav difficulty change from the difficulty changed ?? anyone ?
[1:21:38] Goosnargh42: But! There's skill in looting a lot of chests as well. Not only killing a lot of tough mobs!
[1:21:45] Kasszi_: maha dont encourage him
[1:22:06] maha381: @Kasszi_ hmmmmmm
[1:22:06] ido_katz: but it’s still wouldn’t be guaranteed
[1:22:09] baka_raion_hato_31: @TheImmortaldonut  for my self watching vh 2 and  some smp on vh3 got me a lot of info on the skills
[1:22:11] iljalz: i mean thats fair enough
[1:22:12] Darkwytchcraft: and what happens if you reach your top level of speed/skill?
[1:22:15] Arjan308: But it's only partial control. not full control
[1:22:17] Gabinska: There is even hunter!
[1:22:17] mahik750: But then aren't we buffing good players? If you are good enough to beat an impossible dungeon, now you have a higher chance of completing the scav too.
[1:22:18] jelly_ggg: Also movement speed
[1:22:21] runtels: That's control of sample size, not odds
[1:22:29] Jaxitac: You control overthing you do in a game.. what a silly comment from that guy
[1:22:32] MunchNL: But sometimes I want drowned hides out of an impossible dungeon
[1:22:32] Stanbroek: don't have challanging dungues more items right now?
[1:22:34] Ferdster02: Getting dungeon difficulty to increase scav odds is actually a pretty good shout
[1:22:49] lightdemup22: Iskall game balance mode please!
[1:22:49] sandraborg: Why even have an objective if we are supposed to win every time? I love the fact that I don't win every scav because then I also have something to be better at and a goal with the game to be better and complete more scavs. I only run elixier when I have other goals in the vault then to complete the objective.
[1:22:55] Jaxitac: *everything
[1:22:57] PRIPYAT715: even though you wish to win every time you go into the vault, you will not complete every vault and that is OK.
[1:23:04] rachs224: im blind to dungeons haha
[1:23:04] Kasszi_: im proud that I dont cheese dungeons
[1:23:11] baka_raion_hato_31: can't place blocks in dungeon would not fix the chees
[1:23:13] itzliam_222: @Kasszi_ SURE
[1:23:13] hinsher116: I try to cheese everything :tf:
[1:23:15] mahik750: @Kasszi_ me neither. I die proudly in them.
[1:23:17] Pineapple0nPizza: I actively seek out dungeons in scavs already - a bunch of one type of chest is great!
[1:23:18] SammJ85: me too @Kasszi_
[1:23:21] Foxee1013: I’m a 45 year old gamer mom playing with my kids-  Scavs do make me grumble, but the elation when completing one is something I never get with elixir vaults
[1:23:21] galelos: I have had a vault where I spend 10 mintues looking for an ore room and just giving up at the end.
[1:23:23] rad_ju: is placing blocks cheesing if placing blocks is the main mc mechanic?
[1:23:24] zeus_o9o2: what change in the scav happens when the difficulty of the game is changed ? like less rare items required ? or less ?
[1:23:27] maloki: Yeah, I just sotrm arrow the first room of an impossible dungeon, and get what lot I can and get it. 😅
[1:23:30] FrostiTosti: icecream everytime i enter a spider dungeon though
[1:23:37] kathinkajean: still rng to find dungeon, though. so, I don’t get how that solve rng issue, lol
[1:23:39] Jaxitac: Whats chessers ?
[1:23:39] P3pp3rF1y: just add anti cheese?
[1:23:42] maloki: Very cheese, complete scav
[1:23:46] legion_breaker: Iskall - My only significant issue with Scavs is knowing which mobs to target for the black and purple mob essence. It would help to have info somewhere in the game that shows which mobs to target.
[1:23:46] Ferdster02: @stanbroek the odds of getting scav items are not tied to rarity or quantity. Difficulty in dungeons doenst give more chests, but the chests are better
[1:23:49] Darkwytchcraft: I'm proud to do the best I can actually do,  I'm sick of every gamer using the old tired "get gud" argument for everything.
[1:23:51] Lashings: Just put silverfish in all the blocks in a dungeon.
[1:23:53] johnloomis201: @P3pp3rF1y Lactose free Gaming?
[1:23:54] maloki: Peppa 🌶
[1:24:05] haze_deadline: Could you make blocks not placeable in dungeons above normal difficulty or something to prevent cheesers?
[1:24:06] Pineapple0nPizza: i think you need to disable being able to place blocks in dungeons, and I say this as a cheeser
[1:24:15] baka_raion_hato_31: Daniel Norgren ...  never heard of it
[1:24:15] mahik750: I am afraid of your solution

[1:24:16] Nitsah4671: @galelos same, there are times where RNG just does not let you complete.
[1:24:19] FreudPlays: I don't see the point of challenging dungeons that you can't complete
[1:24:27] MP_Hazard: and then we ignore them :P
[1:24:27] NinjaFae: NinjaFae subscribed with Prime. 
[1:24:29] Raynj12: I like the idea of scav vaults but I'm so terrible at focusing on the scav and end up looting too much random more often than not lol
[1:24:29] waithere001: The issue is the standard deviation of your randomness
[1:24:30] ido_katz: lol
[1:24:30] AyushJind: lol
[1:24:32] MFRuckus1: gladdPEPEGA
[1:24:32] jelly_ggg: Dungeons will become impossible /s
[1:24:34] WoodenNebula: all this boils down to is skill issue
[1:24:36] mahik750: here we go
[1:24:36] acemazed: I don't have any thoughts in the scavs I trust the process. I just enjoy to see your yt algorithm
[1:24:37] jack_o_nightwolf: lol
[1:24:38] P3pp3rF1y: we can again tie that into difficulty / allow changing in difficulty settings
[1:24:40] TumikimKaNgMasarap: Dungeon just spawn everything then storm arrow, poison nova and fireball. It ussually works.
[1:24:41] OneTrueSpry: I believe where scav is currently at is great. Do not change it please
[1:24:41] strainjp: cheese is a type of beef, tasty yellow treat
[1:24:42] RavenclawNatsfan: house? all you need is a two block pillar
[1:24:43] ramnite_tv: @FreudPlays Loot? liivyaLUL
[1:24:43] Zinoba: Ohh
[1:24:46] lemonz3f: ooo
[1:24:48] itzliam_222: NOOO damn
[1:24:48] ido_katz: cheese makes my stomach ache
[1:24:49] MunchNL: Just blame peppa
[1:24:50] Kasszi_: Hmm
[1:24:50] JashinFanatic: A lot of times I hear @iskall85 mention cheesers and pacifist as part of the balancing. I think if you balance around those, they become the only meta
[1:24:51] waithere001: The spread is too large
[1:24:52] eXQyu_: uuuuuu
[1:24:53] BONNe1704: NOOOOOOO
[1:24:54] rad_ju: don't tie it to mob difficulty pls
[1:24:56] pootch_1: god damn it
[1:24:56] itzliam_222: Sadge
[1:24:59] Meena4578: i don’t see the problem about “cheesers”, they will always cheese. no matter what mechanic you add to prevent it
[1:25:00] pootch_1: fair enough tho
[1:25:00] Pineapple0nPizza: @FreudPlays the encourage you to work on your build and get bette so you can complete the next one you come across - otherwise why bother to get better
[1:25:01] mahik750: sadge
[1:25:06] ithreymesh86: could you ad note in the scav section of the quest manual as to what mobs drop what type of essence I always struggle with who drops what
[1:25:07] angelfoxruby: Bro my nose just whistled what the heck
[1:25:07] zeus_o9o2: the best place for rng in competitive game is dragon system in LOL game
[1:25:08] avian946: can I make the objective more difficult?
[1:25:09] SnipyPlays: Any more people here that are bad and okay with that?
[1:25:11] TumikimKaNgMasarap: Its pepas fault.
[1:25:15] NelisCornelis: Can you make the elixr harder then?
[1:25:19] ylme2001: If people really want to cheese they'll go in creative, don't let the cheesers impact your decisions
[1:25:22] baka_raion_hato_31: the scaling of the player level limit the top end of rng so dat you still  have divercity but with low amont requiered
[1:25:24] hinsher116: KEKW
[1:25:26] AyushJind: KEKW
[1:25:27] itzliam_222: KEKW
[1:25:29] Ribery931: KEKW
[1:25:29] FreudPlays: KEKW
[1:25:30] lemonz3f: KEKW
[1:25:35] Kasszi_: KEKW
[1:25:35] baboobraz: i saw that KEKW
[1:25:36] lemonz3f: That's hilarious
[1:25:37] alex_needs_coffee: KEKW
[1:25:37] SirFlachzange: Why do u café about cheese so much? Cause if u wanna cheese something they will always find a way to cheese so it's a never ending chase and to do something not because it's cheesable is blocking evolving the game better for those who play the game as it is intended
[1:25:40] maloki: Lololol
[1:25:41] spurlucke: Lame
[1:25:44] gaymersalsa: kekw
[1:25:44] zeus_o9o2: defination of SMURFING
[1:25:45] CedH1: That's so sad tbh
[1:25:45] toby8998: that is boring
[1:25:46] eXQyu_: bruhhhhh
[1:25:46] illycat_: lame
[1:25:47] zebrainap: farming soul shards is easy even on normal tho????
[1:25:54] ryuzzei: well thats their problem isnt it
[1:25:55] jelly_ggg: That is stupid...
[1:25:55] erinlynn82: people are going to hate this shpykeLUL watch the ledditers then
[1:25:55] Monatae: ach, I am late!  gm gm, Iskall and Dylans!
[1:25:56] MFRuckus1: CakeW
[1:25:58] lemonz3f: Where did the fancy table and chairs come from
[1:26:00] Drackst_Gaming: Just creative mode it at that point
[1:26:02] Moon_FaLL: @iskall85 that's why Soulslike games have only 1 difficulty so there's no problems like that. When you accomplish something you know you did it at the same difficulty as everybody else
[1:26:03] rachs224: why not go into creative and cheese some shards in
[1:26:03] sh4dow_d3mon: I guess that's a problem any game could have
[1:26:03] Jaxitac: lol
[1:26:05] usernameunavailablevtff: When i started playing VH i found scavs really hard to complete, and being new to VH (and minecraft for that matter) in order to learn how to play the game i cheated crystals that i then modified to put like 15 cascading of each chest/wealthy/plentiful, 10 extended, and even then i didn't complete every scav. But guess what, turns out now that i'm better at the game i can complete nearly every scav i do (i scav seal every vault because i love it), without relics or Hourglass or hunter sometimes
[1:26:08] jelly_ggg: Complaining is a type of caring about the game
[1:26:10] PRIPYAT715: then why play or hard if you go on to piece of cake
[1:26:11] SammJ85: People be cheating themselves out of potential greatness
[1:26:12] sudbskwodiecwgi: You're giving too many options to change difficulties, which is just bad
[1:26:12] ms_crafty_: let them whine. don't change it
[1:26:13] buny1p_: is impossible harder or easier than fragged?
[1:26:13] Garnail20: @MFRuckus1 this should be an emote for sure
[1:26:20] strainjp: It is iskalls name next to the game so he should do what feels right to him
[1:26:21] valkojam: gtg for now all. Will return when I get outta the car.
[1:26:21] rad_ju: don't make it based on mob difficulty
[1:26:23] peppa_j: Then...why r u changing it
[1:26:25] MarkDatter: Still possible but much more of a longer process on current difficulties so yeah
[1:26:27] rhometheus: you should add the difficulty information to the vault history screen
[1:26:32] MFRuckus1: @Garnail20 fohsho
[1:26:33] Jaxitac: people love to complain
[1:26:37] lemonz3f: @Moon_FaLL Soulslike games are fun because of their difficulty! And they're amazing
[1:26:38] candidcrafter: Here is a clean way to scale scav difficulty (if you ever wanted to do that) , in easier difficulty, every chest has more odds of having scav items .. like 75% or even 100% rather than the 50% atm (iirc) .. so essentially players get 1.5x or 2x of scav items than they usually get making it easier for them to complete the same scav goal
[1:26:38] francesca828: I would prefer no scav change, I think it's a skill issue at the moment and people don't want to admit it
[1:26:40] P3pp3rF1y: difficulty preset and allow modifying clearly showing that preset was modified from its defaults
[1:26:42] Giel2002: Oh great, I shared my personal best for soul shards in a vault and didnt share my settings. I hope no one thought I did it on easy xd
[1:26:46] gaymersalsa: ty kass
[1:26:48] Kasszi_: I told him he had one more chance for today
[1:26:48] caIImePeter: @iskall85 im fine with what you decide, but isn’t that against your argument that difficulty shouldn’t be a gate for better loot in general (except dungeons)?
[1:26:49] Pineapple0nPizza: @rhometheus I really like this idea
[1:26:50] Kasszi_: ty salsa
[1:26:55] baka_raion_hato_31: @Jaxitac i'm french and i aproove this statement
[1:26:55] TheCykel: iskall is better at discussing and compromising than most politicians
[1:26:56] ShapNine: Add the mob block break mechanic from return of the night
[1:26:57] buny1p_: @Iskall85 there is one way to make Sacv easier without making them easier by mkaing a difficulty that just acts like a permanent hunter effect for the needed Scav items
[1:26:59] gaymersalsa: didn’t have to write a dm lol
[1:27:02] Tech_16: i think as a game dev, its your place to give players options, if people are ruining their experience due to cheesing the game by switching from hard to piece of cake then that is their fault.
[1:27:05] mahik750: They absolutely will.
[1:27:05] Kasszi_: KEKW
[1:27:07] EllieIsShmexy: Kekw
[1:27:13] ithreymesh86: I got missed it the chat spam, is there anywhere that tells you what mobs drop what colour essence I always struggle with who drops what colour
[1:27:15] Jaxitac: i like a challenge and that the whole point of a game .. LUL
[1:27:22] Jaxitac: @baka_raion_hato_31 lvoe this
[1:27:22] Zinoba: Noo
[1:27:24] smash7711: Bo
[1:27:25] suptrace: treasure goggles?!
[1:27:27] AyushJind: wut
[1:27:29] EllieIsShmexy: Lol what
[1:27:31] iljalz: huh
[1:27:32] lemonz3f: Alright bye Dylan and sirSkall, I have to get ready for class. Cya 'round
[1:27:32] hamisharms: @iskall85 I hate to give an issue towards this. however with all the game rules I find it overwhelming and confusing as to what level I should use at each one.
[1:27:33] MFRuckus1: cakeW
[1:27:33] hinsher116: boooooo not good idea
[1:27:34] ShadowDancer61: No
[1:27:37] nerdoidaao: adding permanent treasure googles
[1:27:38] eXQyu_: ???? whats the point by then hahahahhhaa
[1:27:38] dropsteel: no
[1:27:40] zombieokami: Huh
[1:27:41] baka_raion_hato_31: changing rng to gps LUL lame
[1:27:43] angelfoxruby: DinoDance DinoDance DinoDance DinoDance
[1:27:44] Lashings: Make Scav easier by giving people a craftable preset up scav bag
[1:27:44] ihcmoonie: Use treasure goggles
[1:27:44] MarkDatter: yeah no
[1:27:45] haze_deadline: Just use treasure goggles if that's how you want it lol
[1:27:46] GhoulHunter811: but then what u will have to do is to make the number of wizard wands higher for higher objective difficulty??
[1:27:46] P3pp3rF1y: yeah just give them out in the portal room then
[1:27:51] gaymersalsa: im conflicted on this cause the difficulty of scavs is what makes me love em. but on the other hand if the difficulty aspect is gating people out of playing, i think its fair to help those people
[1:27:52] thechair83: I think moving scav out of random rotation removes a bit of challenge and excitement from the game. I think running a random crystal and getting a tough scav is exciting and gives the game some depth skill wise. Love what you're doing with VH
[1:27:52] suptrace: treasure goggles in a scav. it helps xD
[1:27:55] NinjaFae: Cheer100 Hey Iskall! Been watching you seince season 6 hermitcraft and love your content! I have played the game since it was available on curseforge! Keep it up!
[1:27:55] abhinav_agrawal: free goggles?
[1:27:57] avian946: @baka_raion_hato_31 haha!
[1:28:03] alexsolm: I love scave its hard but still is fun
[1:28:07] sh4dow_d3mon: I think that it's still fair to get wizard wand. Otherwise why  not just put a chest containing the scav items in the portal room lol
[1:28:07] gaymersalsa: based…..
[1:28:10] crenzoiid: Maybe the scav seals can have difficulty based on the recipe?
[1:28:10] baka_raion_hato_31: @avian946  <3
[1:28:10] missionimpossible_: whaat
[1:28:14] Zinoba: What
[1:28:16] ramnite_tv: Yeah, the bestiary is a funny thing to find
[1:28:16] Oh_No_Its_Kat: whaaaaat
[1:28:16] cameloOK: what?
[1:28:17] zeus_o9o2: i feel giving compensation crates for 50% completing the scav something ig
[1:28:18] missionimpossible_: there's an entire menu???
[1:28:18] mahik750: oooooh
[1:28:18] michikatsu951: what
[1:28:19] AyushJind: what?
[1:28:19] kumail2003: whaaat
[1:28:20] tonTeufel: you can set a key for the bestiary in the options
[1:28:20] Lakosius2: can it be linked to the Guidebook or so ?
[1:28:20] samsam21amb: what?
[1:28:21] sp0rsk: ...theres a beastiary??
[1:28:21] Kasszi_: i forget that that thing exists
[1:28:22] ido_katz: what
[1:28:22] great_chubs: jei?
[1:28:23] gaymersalsa: bestiary is so based
[1:28:23] ShapNine: @iskall85 anti cheese in dungeon idea, allow mobs to break blocks like in return of the night
[1:28:23] Jason_vK: niceeee
[1:28:23] StandaSK: wait what, I meesd it
[1:28:23] WoodenNebula: what
[1:28:25] kagtobio: you can click that what
[1:28:25] ryuzzei: whaaaa
[1:28:27] gifted0h: WHAT
[1:28:28] ido_katz: since when
[1:28:28] GhoulHunter811: wait ppl didnt know that existed? RIP
[1:28:28] sparkkd: WHAT
[1:28:28] Atomxs77: that doesnt work in my version
[1:28:29] Kriskiki89: There is a key bind
[1:28:29] pwn3dzilla: 1000 hours in, first time seeing that. xD
[1:28:29] ithreymesh86: wow!!
[1:28:30] missionimpossible_: add a keybind or something
[1:28:31] samsam21amb: what is this?
[1:28:31] gamingwithtoimen: guidebook right
[1:28:31] Ribery931: well we never saw that
[1:28:33] MrHaloBoy: and there is a hotkey :D
[1:28:33] rad_ju: I forgot about this screen
[1:28:33] cineeleo: I never new this exists lmao
[1:28:34] BONNe1704: I think issue is that players are not fast enough to loot rooms! I susspect that most players are looting small amount of rooms and so they have issues with completing scavenger!
[1:28:34] suptrace: mind blown
[1:28:35] Garnail20: I did not know this existed xD
[1:28:35] michikatsu951: am lvl 99 and still know that now lmaao
[1:28:35] ryuzzei: is there a command to open it
[1:28:35] hinsher116: ??????? since when was this in the game KEKW
[1:28:36] Jaxitac: I cant wait to be better at minecraft to be able to play this modpack, i'm excited
[1:28:38] TheJollyPainter: how is this the first I have heard of this???
[1:28:38] galelos: having a page that does the opposite would be nice
[1:28:40] Hafwyn: Lol I found that by accident
[1:28:40] thespectrescall: Lol, had no idea that existed
[1:28:41] gaymersalsa: LEAK
[1:28:43] cladmi: And it's a reverse thing issue. It's not a "where do I find X" but "check everything if it drops X"
[1:28:44] MarkDatter: Isnt there a keybind for that that doesnt even have a key set by default
[1:28:44] Jason_vK: wait this isnt new?
[1:28:45] angelfoxruby: News to me, nice
[1:28:46] gifted0h: HUH
[1:28:46] maloki: @gaymersalsa best done, nothing will change for you, and it will welcome new players.
[1:28:47] Kasszi_: yuea this is too hidden
[1:28:48] sharkyteeth101: Maybe add in the guidebook or questbook?
[1:28:48] Atomxs77: i tried to view this and it dinmt work
[1:28:48] theonecalledrolo: Just wondering now you're level 100 and not using artifacts how many do you have that could be completed ?
[1:28:48] galelos: showing what mobs drop a specific mob essence
[1:28:49] crenzoiid: Maybe consider tying the difficulty of the scav to the seal recipe
[1:28:49] ChapDawg_: scavs are perfect, just wouldn’t mind an altar in every room to submit 😅 similar to the new cake vaults
[1:28:49] TheImmortaldonut: Wow, mind blown
[1:28:49] pootch_1: why not add this to the tabs in the vault menu
[1:28:50] Stanbroek: can't you add this to JEI??
[1:28:50] minipax84: In. Scavs could mods have a little essence icon above them?
[1:28:50] Zslice79: We need that book
[1:28:50] illycat_: when i started playing i though that drowneds dropped drowned hide
[1:28:54] FrostiTosti: ooooooh @iskall85 new vault mode? get a piratespeak clue to which room the end is and track your way there with closed doorways?
[1:28:54] ithillion55: will be 0 in non-scavs
[1:28:55] MFRuckus1: exposed
[1:28:55] PiggyKillerQ: There is a keybind in controls to open bestiary iskall
[1:28:56] freaktechnik: secret dev menu
[1:28:58] toby8998: KEKW
[1:28:58] Jbslim: This whole conversation is about lack of skill in the player base.
[1:28:58] Jason_vK: whahahahah
[1:28:59] Ferdster02: Whut?
[1:28:59] ramnite_tv: It's been in the game for a while, yeah
[1:28:59] TEONYco: @iskall85 what if you add a reroll feature at the beginning of the scav? In such that if the first randomly generated needed scav items are to intimidating you can choose to generate a new set of needed items
[1:28:59] cameloOK: again, what?
[1:29:00] gaymersalsa: @maloki exactly !!
[1:29:01] SammJ85: KEKW
[1:29:01] Atomxs77: doesnt work for me
[1:29:01] PiggyKillerQ: you need to assign it in controls
[1:29:02] Darkwytchcraft: ONE thing we DO need, is a LARGER print for the "where to find" xyz items, that is on the TOP of the screen.
[1:29:02] l___Nick___l: Are scavs really that much of a problem that you are being “forced” to change them?
[1:29:03] Kriskiki89: There is a key bind you can set
[1:29:03] NakeZast: can we make the Bounty Table more seamless? I.E: when we click and reroll on the 2nd bounty, instead of it sometimes randomly selecting to the 1st bounty after rerolling, it stays on the "new" 2nd bounty so that we can do consistent rerolls.
[1:29:04] get_d0wn: wait what was that
[1:29:05] charly_lina: Play on the easiest and love to complete difficult scavs, even if I don't do so often. If I din't complete it I didn't have the skill, but it's fun to see myself improving
[1:29:05] tonTeufel: you can set a keybind for it
[1:29:06] maetti1286: Hotkey ?
[1:29:06] ultra_archer: i love how people love to complain about iskall not knowing cause he only plays multiplayer despite him having multiple singleplayer worlds uploaded to yt regarding 1.18 and having made the game itself.
[1:29:06] lkaros_waxwing: I dont understand the struggle or hate for scavs. Seals are craftable if you dont wanna do scavs. I treat scavs as locked in cause its challenging and fun.
[1:29:08] gifted0h: ISKALL
[1:29:09] PRIPYAT715: @iskall85 is there a mob book that can be added???
[1:29:09] angelfoxruby: Is there a bestiary in the player menu?
[1:29:10] robor_1: you need to update the tutorial book. too much new stuff
[1:29:13] verqix: A vault theme specific bestiary would be great for scavs
[1:29:13] jack_o_nightwolf: i never see that menu lol
[1:29:15] Zinoba: I remember something about the bestiary being added
[1:29:17] admaston: Could you make the higher tier scav items craftable with the lower tier items?  Would still mean you need to look but give some control.
[1:29:19] baboobraz: just add it to the book you get when you first spawn in
[1:29:20] Lakosius2: JEVM , Just Enough Vault Monsters NODDERS
[1:29:22] maloki: Isn't it available in the book?
[1:29:22] erinlynn82: I’m ok with losing. entitlement is the word I’m looking for.
[1:29:23] TheReaperOf1985: iskHA iskLL iskO hryPog
[1:29:26] Kriskiki89: @gaymersalsa theres a key bind get that info out there lol
[1:29:26] ultra_archer: there's nothign wrong with failing a scav
[1:29:29] TheImmortaldonut: Add to the vh book you get in the beginning?
[1:29:29] ultra_archer: just leave
[1:29:29] gaymersalsa: ok iskall is going back to my phone, it’s too cold outside to have my hands out OMEGALOOL
[1:29:30] FailLior: why aren't people getting gooder?
[1:29:31] Jarhielt: Can you make it unlockable, you discover what the drops are after a kill
[1:29:32] MrHaloBoy: @iskall85 ther is a hotkey just unasigned
[1:29:32] novemberromeo1: Could you not put a tab to the bestiary to the H tab?
[1:29:34] phoenix_king_01: treasure plant !!
[1:29:35] Ferdster02: Arent the mob essenses in jei? Couldn't you get a: this mob drops them, indicator
[1:29:36] b4retto_: maybe a new item? A bestiary book you can interact with
[1:29:36] silvain_shadows: could link it underneath the quest button on the player menu
[1:29:37] lady_vorbarra: At the moment I can finish about 50% of my scavs, but I don't think they are too hard, its me unable to ignore POIs I don't need
[1:29:37] Ravioliwith: Could add a book like the quest book with a recipe or a soul shard and book
[1:29:37] Kasszi_: lol salsa
[1:29:37] gaymersalsa: oh my hod there is a jeybinf
[1:29:39] smash7711: Im
[1:29:40] Danymaddox: @iskall85 did you saw my suggestion about Ethereal/Graceful Components? its pretty large to post it here, that's why am asking :)
[1:29:40] RavenclawNatsfan: maybe put what mobs drop what that you need when you hold tab and can see similar to bounties?
[1:29:41] mrk102903: a book for the beastiary would be cool
[1:29:41] ithreymesh86: thankyou I will use that from now on!
[1:29:44] PiggyKillerQ: @angelfoxruby if you open controls, you can assign a key to open the bestiary
[1:29:44] baboobraz: same
[1:29:47] rachs224: i like scavs the way it is. unfortunately  you can please everyone. could you not just have a command to toggle scavs from being randomly rolled on a random vault
[1:29:50] candidcrafter: A clean way to scale scav difficulty (if you ever wanted to do that) , in easier difficulty, every chest has more odds of having scav items .. like 75% or even 100% rather than the 50% atm (iirc) .. so essentially players get 1.5x or 2x of scav items than they usually get making it easier for them to complete the same scav goal
[1:29:51] evinrude92: Any update when version 13 will be released to the public?
[1:29:52] Jaxitac: You need SKILL in every game and every mode...
[1:29:53] jack_o_nightwolf: true
[1:29:58] smash7711: I also would have completed them on level 45
[1:29:58] MFRuckus1: @Lakosius2 fax
[1:29:58] maloki: My smp partner made like 50 VH 3rd edition books in the game, making sure they are available!
[1:29:59] lIlIllIlllIIIIllIIIIIIllI: For some time I was wondering about "What if u can use scav items with higher rarity as items with lower rarity (of the same type)" for example 1x creeper eye = 1x drowned hide. But then it would make it too easy
[1:30:00] Pineapple0nPizza: people need to be ok with not always wining and just leaving the vault sometimes though
[1:30:02] TheReaperOf1985: OMG i missed 1,5 hour, damn iskBro
[1:30:06] Gabinska: What if you could change the rarity of scavanger itens that appear? Like, a command that only allows scavangers to demand common itens.
[1:30:07] crenzoiid: Consider putting difficulty of the scav to the recipe of the seal
[1:30:09] Jbslim: People vent their real life emotions onto the game.
[1:30:10] great_chubs: @evinrude92 soonTM
[1:30:10] Ferdster02: The first scav of that guy he didnt need any loving or ornate and looted a bunch of them judging by his scav bag
[1:30:10] LowKeyChemist: I like that scav is hard to do. opt-in is probably the best solution to this though
[1:30:13] ash_tronaut616: Hey there iskall, missed the lvl 100 celebration 🥲🥲
[1:30:13] Monatae: I play on Easy, and I'm not fond of scavs.  but I just craft a bunch of seals and don't take scav bounties?  that's how I enjoy playing, I don't want scavs to be ruined for people who enjoy them!
[1:30:14] ithreymesh86: yes a bestiary book would be awsome ingame
[1:30:15] zeus_o9o2: @iskall85 one thing i have notificed is ppl hate nether vaults but not many knows the perk of those room than other normal room any way you convey the message of more ores somehow to people
[1:30:17] CooldAtTV: That guy has gem ores in the inventory at the end of the vault. If he doesnt know how to play, its not devs fault
[1:30:18] cheekymissy: the problem isn’t lack of skill. it’s lack of willingness to try. it’s a demand for an easy win.
[1:30:19] ashton5549: Some people don't like it but that's why we have different objectives
[1:30:25] baka_raion_hato_31: rng allow for a wide veriaty of small objectiv that  take peapole out of they confort zone ( you'r in a vaul ma men  confort is the kiwi in you'r inventory  )
[1:30:26] lynnie_thelurker: Can you make scaling togglable?
[1:30:27] Astroginii: !discord
[1:30:28] Nightbot: To join iskall85's discord public chat, go to https://discord.gg/iskall85 iskHeart
[1:30:32] novemberromeo1: Could you put a tab to the bestiary to the H tab?
[1:30:35] mamvis01: there is a key bind for beastiary, you just need to bind it!!!
[1:30:35] evinrude92: @great_chubs haha hopefully real soon :)
[1:30:39] silvain_shadows: i used to hate scav but then i got good lol
[1:30:39] Sicketjr: I did not like scavs at one point, then I got better at the game now I love them.
[1:30:43] CaptainAhab34: the player gems !
[1:30:43] PRIPYAT715: I can't remember if there is a quest for SCAV vaults?
[1:30:53] Darkwytchcraft: there are also valid reasons why Some people have problems
[1:30:56] smash7711: But he was
[1:31:00] sambhavsam: I am solo player and i have about 95% complete rate in scavs except the few ones that requires 4-5 omega items
[1:31:01] crenzoiid: @iskall85 How about tying difficulty of the scav to the seal recipe. Like ascension
[1:31:04] ggamito: I don't hate scavs but I get distracted with other things LUL and the objective gets harde as the time passes inside the vault LUL
[1:31:04] bruhhmaaoo: WHAT I MISSED THIS STREM AWWW
[1:31:05] Pineapple0nPizza: yeah I agree with that - I still don't know what themes have what benefits. Maybe it could be a description on the augments?
[1:31:07] avian946: maybe the augment could tell you what the vault is good for?
[1:31:08] mr_lego__: how does silk touching gems matter xD
[1:31:13] Jaxitac: you make me laugh @iskall85 love your comments , blunt as a brick...
[1:31:13] smash7711: He ran with blocks in hand instead of a sword
[1:31:14] GhoulHunter811: is paradox fixed?
[1:31:19] Danymaddox: @iskall85 it is on discord, in suggestions sir, take ypur time, love you <3
[1:31:26] sh4dow_d3mon: That's always my issue
[1:31:27] JimJamsnz: People are unwilling to understand that the number of chests you loot in 25 minutes is in your control.  The number of mobs you can kill is as well.  I am useless at scav at the moment, because I am just not quick enough
[1:31:28] owucie: when will u go paradox wault?
[1:31:33] baka_raion_hato_31: @Danymaddox  gg's
[1:31:36] ithreymesh86: a tool tip with each type of vault their discription and pros/cons would be good
[1:31:37] NinjaFae: What if there is a command to disable certain vault themes? Then people can disable the ones they dont like?
[1:31:37] silvain_shadows: i don't think he's bad but there's definitely skills he can improve. like loot management and target focus
[1:31:38] pootch_1: i think its reductive to say good or bad for this, even AMAZING PLAYERS can fail miserably if they cant focus on the scav items and look away from other things
[1:31:43] baboobraz: im way better at scavs then i used to and now i enjoy them cuz im better at the game. also plz dont remove them from random
[1:31:46] TheReaperOf1985: I rarely make the scavs. But I love trying to get them
[1:31:47] TruePat: @bruhhmaaoo we haven't moved from this room yet haven't missed much
[1:31:48] acemazed: Hallo, I have met a lot of people that play VH without knowing you they complain because they don't understand the decisions you make. I have watching this since funcraft i know i don't, but I feel like I know how would you reply to a game design question. And I as a "game developer" i use a lot the "what would iskall say?"  So trust yourself and let them complain
[1:31:49] CooldAtTV: Its not that he is bad, its that he doesnt know what tools the game offers, inventory management is a basic skill that any lvl 62 player should know
[1:31:52] kumail2003: @iskall85  why not make a modifier dat doesnt do any thing but is used to show the effect of a specific theme
[1:31:54] lauraannierose: that guy should drop his difficulty and try to run 10 scavs in a row and see the difference
[1:31:58] Lakosius2: Always those pesky Omega rooms that show up in scavs that distracts from the objective
[1:32:00] Koxy_XIX: i used to hate scavs, but than i made new tools, which i really needed after 30 something level passed
[1:32:02] Ferdster02: @mr_lego__ in no way, silk touch or fortune does the exact same thing on ores on account of scav or copiously
[1:32:04] GhoulHunter811: what u will have to do is to make the number of wizard wands higher for higher objective difficulty?? that seems a lil unfair might be wrong...
[1:32:04] quaka95: I'm a gamer dad that can turn the PC on for like 2 hr a day when I'm willing to lose some sleep and I really appreciate the discussion but please do not ruin your game
[1:32:05] jack_o_nightwolf: @iskall85 paradox vault?
[1:32:10] Tech_16: as a game dev, you need to give players options, and if people are ruining their experience due to cheesing the game by switching from hard to piece of cake then that is their fault.
[1:32:10] redstonedad: stant downer. Now that i
[1:32:12] bruhhmaaoo: Did iskall make a new build?
[1:32:15] NelisCornelis: IF you make a difficulty setting, will you balance elirx to also be the same completion rate?
[1:32:18] Darkwytchcraft: how about less of them, not none at all
[1:32:18] baka_raion_hato_31: @owucie  need fixing , wait ti'll august for the new season
[1:32:21] mamvis01: you need to assign a bind for bestiary in controls @iskall85
[1:32:26] misterdante92: Why not use a "enchantement" that you can use on the shard for difficulty/reward ?
[1:32:26] grynd3rfl: I don't always complete my scav but I'm not afraid of them I know they're not supposed to be auto complete
[1:32:29] eXQyu_: I think most people just see that VH is just another Minecraft mode but in reality it is a totally different game where it is more like a game, game.... Idk how to say it lol
[1:32:29] PRIPYAT715: If there is not a quest for SCAV vaults then one can be made, when you make the SCAV crystal you could give them a Vault Mob book that will explain  what all the mobs are in the vaults before going into the first SCAV.
[1:32:35] Gabinska: Let me end saying: GIT GUUUUD
[1:32:42] waxbuzzzzard: on easy a total of max 6 common items /j
[1:32:44] candidcrafter: One clean way to scale scav difficulty (if you ever wanted to do that) , in easier difficulty, every chest has more odds of having scav items .. like 75% or even 100% rather than the 50% atm (iirc) .. so essentially players get 1.5x or 2x of scav items than they usually get making it easier for them to complete the same scav goal
[1:32:46] EllieIsShmexy: But the PLATINUM
[1:32:52] xoMommySiren: I don’t understand why people can’t just play the game as designed and win or lose have fun y’all
[1:32:54] EllieIsShmexy: Makes it good lol
[1:32:57] cameloOK: noob vault modifier that gives you 10 more minutes in the vault on scav.
[1:33:08] lalila01: but scav is way more fun
[1:33:09] GhoulHunter811: epic not omega
[1:33:11] forelini: is the soul coin table made yet?
[1:33:12] dia__hi: If you're removing scav from random pool, they should stay as they are
[1:33:12] gaymersalsa: Coingi
[1:33:14] brett_232: what about scavs you get the items like normal but you get a piece of paper which lets you trade it in instead of getting those items but you get a negative effect
[1:33:16] Kasszi_: omega....
[1:33:18] silvain_shadows: personally i would prefer it not be scaled to vault_difficulty because i play piece of cake bc i'm bad at fighting mobs, not bc i want everything to be autocomplete
[1:33:22] ramnite_tv: @EllieIsShmexy No joke, I prefer scav sealing over running around and looting coingi liivyaLUL
[1:33:25] Danymaddox: But elixir is boring
[1:33:31] MFRuckus1: Cant beat game on hardest difficulty...go to youtube for gated content gladdEVIL
[1:33:32] Jackkabuki: maybe add a expertise that reduces each item by 1 up to minimum of 1  / each objective by 1. You can take it and make it easier or you can pick something else.
[1:33:34] Ribery931: weird color for an omega sword KEKW
[1:33:42] ithreymesh86: talks for 5min items despawn lol
[1:33:46] Gabinska: The crate might be better, but the loot is worst, so it's the same
[1:33:46] smash7711: Gamba, will the items despawn
[1:33:48] gurglet: the seals are the only thing I would miss if I never completed any vault
[1:33:51] mamvis01: the beastiary has a section in controls but it is unbound by defult
[1:33:54] EllieIsShmexy: @ramnite_tv I do that too sometimes but scavs are also just fun
[1:33:55] Nitsah4671: @Danymaddox it's all preference, I like elixir
[1:33:58] Megaking202: But scaw is so much more fun
[1:34:00] GhoulHunter811: oooo 4 platt
[1:34:01] ramnite_tv: @EllieIsShmexy also true
[1:34:04] MunchNL: But more fun
[1:34:14] TheCrawlingHand: In all honesty I don't like scavs as i find them difficult, BUT I do still play them, both as I feel I get more practice at playing vaults in general, but also because the times I actually do complete the scav it feels like a great achievement
[1:34:15] Sicketjr: true but a scav is more fun 🤣
[1:34:19] rad_ju: exclude seals?
[1:34:20] cameloOK: seals are only in completion crates
[1:34:20] Darkwytchcraft: I'd much rather you make it my choice to make one
[1:34:21] pwn3dzilla: a lot of players say just harvest scavs for loot and if it's near completion at the 10 min mark, then focus it.
[1:34:22] vaalwater: Scav does need skill and practice. At 5 sucked. Maybe 10% completion. But you get better gear and tools, use your skill points for better movement and fighting. You can then loot more to increase chances of what you need.
[1:34:23] mahik750: This objective difficulty scaling is putting too much burden on the dev team compared to the players who loudly complain about scavs in my opinion.
[1:34:24] Nightbot: www.youtube.com/iskall85 | www.twitter.com/iskall85 | https://youtube.com/@vodskall85
[1:34:37] zeus_o9o2: @iskall85 a simple way will be a frame with information in the first room about the theme in general
[1:34:39] Monatae: Idk, Iskall and the devs have made it so easy to not have to run scavs.  I don't, and I have a great time.
[1:34:39] BONNe1704: Iskall, and that is the reason why people complains. They are looting everything, and they do not concentrate on completing scav.
[1:34:40] ijulia24: Just have fun in running the vaults
[1:34:41] ThatSnowball: Yeah if I roll a scav I generally just loot
[1:34:42] Gabinska: You don't get it, they want the fun but not the effort
[1:34:51] Darkwytchcraft: if you want it to be random, put your pre-made seals into a dispenser and get it to give you one at random
[1:34:51] WoodenNebula: don't you get exp for just looting and leaving the vault?
[1:34:53] zombieokami: !bingo
[1:34:53] Nightbot: Get your HCVH BING card here! Note: there are more squares than you might generate SeemsGood https://bingobaker.com/#65a259586e396f25
[1:34:53] BONNe1704: GREED is the reason
[1:34:53] smash7711: Bet the complete because they just run and loot.
[1:34:56] eXQyu_: you gonna check reddit?
[1:34:57] Jason_vK: are people that pick easy gonna be fine with losing? I dont think so. Yet it is supposed to be easier than normal not easy.
[1:34:58] littlepepperbutt: I really don't think they need a change
[1:34:58] baka_raion_hato_31: elixir is rng for the objectiv completion depending on what you loot source you choose . but in a scav  it tell you what to loot in the objectiv  and the rng is in the rarety of one loot source . gess if you stick to the objectiv and remoove the greed ; with then kill the fun
[1:35:02] HC_Shako: Iskall get you feet off the table!
[1:35:04] Nitsah4671: @ThatSnowball same, I ignore the objective and consider it an L if I get a scav xD
[1:35:04] forelini: how’s the state of ascension
[1:35:11] zeus_o9o2: @HC_Shako LUL
[1:35:12] stilgar4202: its good to not complete (or fail) some of the time
[1:35:13] AyushJind: gread kills
[1:35:14] MFRuckus1: LuvSkal
[1:35:15] Jackkabuki: Maybe give a higher chance for augments when completing a scav since you scavenged the vault type.
[1:35:16] Nightbot: Vault Hunters Reddit for you to check out! https://www.reddit.com/r/VaultHuntersMinecraft/
[1:35:19] ramnite_tv: @ThatSnowball That's also valid, looting IS the core objective of the game tbh
[1:35:20] Gabinska: WHAT? Lol players are the worst game players omg Iskall
[1:35:20] skye_ns: But it's the scavenger crate the only way to get an unidentified key? 🗝️
[1:35:22] mahik750: If its a difficult scav, I just greed and get out of the vault with my loot. No harm done
[1:35:23] nipla13: skill issue
[1:35:25] AppleS0ju: people nowadays don't like to put effort into anything, they just want to play and win tbh
[1:35:25] baka_raion_hato_31: greed is the solution  not tu mutch of it and you wont loose focus on the vault objectiv
[1:35:26] Nitsah4671: running around panicking over finding scav items just isn't fun
[1:35:27] Koxy_XIX: i usually just make seals for every vault i run besides the ocasional plunderer
[1:35:39] alivedemonnyte: Just came back what are we doing
[1:35:39] unknownbasket: @iskall85 you talk a lot about feel in vaulthunters, how did feel of the game change with the beginning of vaulthunters?
[1:35:41] mamvis01: @iskall85 the bestiary has a bind in controls
[1:35:42] clouse7: @skye_ns champs drop
[1:35:51] littlepepperbutt: That's a personal problem not a game prob
[1:35:51] Nightbot: For everything Vault Hunters, check out the website! https://vaulthunters.gg/
[1:35:54] pyrodivine_: !hermitcraft
[1:35:54] Nightbot: Where is Hermitcraft? https://youtu.be/8WcPvXCuG64
[1:35:55] Lakosius2: The clock also not starting before leaving teh start room already helped in getting your mind togetehr to see what you have to focus on
[1:35:57] EllieIsShmexy: @nitsah4671 so don't play scavs 🤷‍♀️
[1:36:00] Ferdster02: Elixir is so boring for people who are looking for challenge, so we want to run scavs. If you don't like it, just dont run it.
[1:36:01] BONNe1704: greed kills scav :((((((\
[1:36:04] ThatSnowball: I bail, and then I still have positive loot. I understand the issue with the failure of the obj but it's still a net positive to bail
[1:36:05] Darkwytchcraft: don't rush that, just let us make our own scavs if we want them
[1:36:05] eselpgagHD: But then theres modpacks like rlcraft and btw, where nobody complains because they are meant to be hard
[1:36:09] Jaxitac: if you wnat to build play lego, if you want a challenge with fun extra play minecraft, If you want extra fun play modded minecraft
[1:36:09] ramnite_tv: @AppleS0ju And it's perfectly fine for story oriented games
[1:36:09] angelfoxruby: I think that's why I want to play VH so much. I'm a scaredy cat on peaceful MC, but VH feels so different from regular MC. I want to play it very badly
[1:36:12] Jason_vK: when is difficulty gonna please the people, when they win everything? Thats not the purpose of difficulty
[1:36:18] smash7711: Thank you.
[1:36:20] ithreymesh86: vault now?
[1:36:20] k1_setae: Scavs are fine, iv done 3 playtroughs from 0-100 already and i LOVE the challenge, altho at this point i would like objective that is actually hard now. Would there be a possibliity of making objective to have all 3 at the same time? (scav, guardiands and elixir)? I would love that
[1:36:20] Nitsah4671: @EllieIsShmexy :p I don't, I just consider it an L and loot like normal
[1:36:20] phoenix_king_01: now paradox ..??
[1:36:22] toomuchinertia: is divine paradox fixed ?
[1:36:25] mamvis01: OPEN CONTROLS FOR BESTIARY BIND
[1:36:29] lynx6008: Thanks for the podcast iskall
[1:36:31] iljalz: did divine get fixed?
[1:36:34] kumail2003: thank u for the ted talk
[1:36:34] GhoulHunter811: iskall in obj scaling would it be like lowest can have 1 omega maybe of one type but then higher difficulty can have 2 or more omega of the same typee??
[1:36:34] Ribery931: time for paradox vault Omega
[1:36:35] bruhhmaaoo: Iksall did u make a new build???
[1:36:40] freddyb8: Time to run a scav vault now lol
[1:36:41] EllieIsShmexy: @nitsah4671  yeah that's totally fine too
[1:36:44] pincheman: 1.5 hour yap session
[1:36:45] devvadharshan: Yoooooooooooooooooooooooo
[1:36:46] pyrodivine_: hows ur personal life
[1:36:46] gaymersalsa: we don’t deserve such a caring developer for a modpack tbh. DONT TAKE THIS MAN FOR GRANTED
[1:36:48] ihcmoonie: I used to hate scavs. Now I seal them on purpose because I love the feel good when I complete. Or when I can complate my scav and most if not all my my friends if they need it while they loot
[1:36:52] MFRuckus1: iskHeart
[1:36:53] Darkwytchcraft: it's also not good to say get good, when a community is made up of people of different abilities
[1:36:53] ijulia24: Yeah that true
[1:36:55] LobsterCanary: But VH doesn't have to be fun for everyone
[1:36:57] Kasszi_: @gaymersalsa SO BASED AND TRUE

[1:37:02] Ribery931: LUL
[1:37:05] ithreymesh86: scav vault now iskall gets 5 omega items lol

[1:37:23] mahik750: Also, its more complicated, "fun" changes by the day. Sometimes I find it fun to build, sometimes I find monoliths and chill fun, other times I want chaos and excitement.
[1:37:23] gaymersalsa: bumble
[1:37:23] jasethupol: but Rl craft is one of the best modded and its is extremely difficult (best after VH of course)
[1:37:25] Jaxitac: 100% cant wait
[1:37:27] devvadharshan: We love getting MORE ISKALL

[1:37:41] mamvis01: BESTIARY HOT KEY IN CONTROLS @iskall85 ITS JUST UNBOUND
[1:37:46] GreenFlameKing: the biggest problem with the community crying is that the game is always open to changes and the people seem to dont understand that is still your decision at the end of the day. @iskall85
[1:37:48] forelini: iskall give us an update brief? remind of all the things in upd?
[1:37:53] TheJollyPainter: not many games the community gets to shoot the breeze with the game developer on the regular :)
[1:37:54] PRIPYAT715: When Thomas Eddison made the light bulb he found hundreds of ways on how not to make one.  There is no high feeling of things is there is no low feeling of things.
[1:37:57] fluxrabbit: Like the beacon mining podcasts that you used to do with rendog?
[1:38:00] Gage_UK: No, the video you played earlier I'm talking about
[1:38:01] aplato: How much more break before season 10?
[1:38:03] Loclogic: I'm going to launch my first game of vault hunters this weekend. I love CTM maps so I think I will have loads of fun

[1:38:34] Lutzio: It was an honest attempt
[1:38:34] BONNe1704: Iskall, I WANT a statistics field which would say how many rooms players go through!! :D
[1:38:34] lynx6008: Season 10 out tomorrow
[1:38:34] samsam21amb: lol
[1:38:35] Garnail20: kek you may as well ask which weekend he is busy recording
[1:38:35] velvet2405: Well we gotta try Iskall lol
[1:38:36] angelfoxruby: DinoDance DinoDance DinoDance DinoDance DinoDance
[1:38:36] Steve_Macc: I personally don't enjoy scavs as much as elixir because I prefer to play a lot more relaxed and Elixir vaults are just straight dopamine. Scavs require a lot of skill to be efficient at the game, and that's just not the way I play
[1:38:36] mahik750: worth it xD
[1:38:37] sabrina1202r: LOL
[1:38:37] xanking96: thanks
[1:38:38] spacefalcon15: We were this close

[1:38:46] PiggyKillerQ: more or less than 1 day before season 10
[1:38:47] lizerich: couple more hours he'll break
[1:38:47] PaVLo_2L: iskHeart iskHeart iskHeart iskHeart
[1:38:48] boss_siebe: U running some vaults after this?
[1:38:50] FrostiTosti: season 10 probably after 4th February
[1:38:50] silvain_shadows: ssomeone's gotta tell us sooner or later LUL
[1:39:01] gaymersalsa: oooo
[1:39:03] GhoulHunter811: GL etho!
[1:39:03] Pineapple0nPizza: ooohh i like it - nice idea bonne
[1:39:04] spacefalcon15: @lynx6008 So true elybeatmaker said it so it must be true
[1:39:04] marcus_cain: I just wanna say, I was bad at scavs. But I saw how much you enjoyed them so I practiced at them. Now I complete 70%+ and really enjoy them. It's an attitude thing
[1:39:06] AyushJind: yoink Ethos vautl lol
[1:39:07] dswa_earl: Had you played with skizzleman at all before season 10 started? Kappa
[1:39:08] candidcrafter: You could just increase the odds of chests dropping scav items for easier difficulty.. (currently it's 50% right?) .. simple way to scale it
[1:39:08] hamisharms: I don’t know if you have considered this. but if you implement objective difficulty and these people who complain start winning every vault they will get bored and quit the game. @iskall85
[1:39:09] Croseven: We will get them next time
[1:39:10] Darkwytchcraft: if I'm lucky I can do 6=10
[1:39:12] devvadharshan: Yeah paradox would be good
[1:39:20] rachs224: i do like chatskall/devskall but been enjoying the vods sooo is it time to vault? hehe
[1:39:20] rhometheus: please add the various difficulty information to the vault end screen
[1:39:26] bas3j: Did the yellow dea of combining trinkets get scraped?
[1:39:27] BONNe1704: Because if number is low, it would explain why scav is hard for them
[1:39:27] zeus_o9o2: YAYYY
[1:39:28] Darkwytchcraft: awesome
[1:39:28] devvadharshan: We should Crash etho
[1:39:29] HC_Shako: One can assume February.  Vault hunters ends and iskall said he will be really busy into March before season 4
[1:39:29] woolfie0120: @ocsisor thanks!
[1:39:30] Joprebond: What do you mean that you want to control how people move through a vault?
[1:39:30] pincheman: YES finally
[1:39:30] forelini: ascension table/ gui?

[1:39:44] baka_raion_hato_31: paradox fixed dévs are bassed
[1:39:46] usernameunavailablevtff: Number of rooms visited and some kind of stat of time per room with minimum time spent, max and median
[1:39:49] eXQyu_: for the third time
[1:39:49] gaymersalsa: GIVE IT UP FOR PEPPA AND WUTAX FEELSSTRONGMAN
[1:39:49] Gage_UK: For all the complaining, there's lots of who love the game you guys are making and appreciate the hard work you guys do trying to balance it for all. Thanks for all you do
[1:39:53] angelfoxruby: Is it possible to put invisible sensors that break after a player runs through a doorway? That will count the rooms? Or is that silly?
[1:39:55] thespectrescall: Glad to see it's working again, I hope
[1:39:55] smash7711: Dragon rooms
[1:39:58] BroCox1: Or poi's visited

[1:54:36] shook_2190: Ohh Btw Iskall regarding hermitcraft 10, If do remember correctly I think it was Scar and Xisuma were chatting in a video and they by mistake released their plans for the season and the month it might be coming. Scar was planning to do something like Scarwars like a Starwars relation and said something like I'm planning on it and have around 3-4 months to plan it out meaning it can come around May or the beginning of June. Am I right Iskall about the timeline?
[1:54:38] No_xor: skill vs RNG

[2:28:20] phoenix_king_01: cosmetic
[2:28:21] oficialstuff: fromsoft DLC does it right
[2:28:32] SuiteSunrise: spending is part of the game's psychology
[2:28:32] LittleOX_777: How do you recharge a potion during the Herald fight?
[2:28:32] JaySkinny: Cosmetic mtx is fine by me
[2:28:35] oficialstuff: Elden ring comunity right now frothing at the mouth for dlc lol
[2:28:38] ItzElixsis: So.. are Vendoors micro transactions? Lol I see you buying when ur low on Gold.
[2:28:47] gaymersalsa: and its been long running
[2:28:48] Pineapple0nPizza: i like paying extra for a new DLCs as they come out but still having the option to stop always paying and still have access to the content up to that point
[2:28:49] illycat_: iskHeart iskHeart iskHeart
[2:28:50] nounbeast: path of exile has a great model of selling cosmetic items (and stash tabs)
[2:28:51] JustusIsOnline: i too force weaker people to give me money
[2:28:53] Cluemily: I pay for the FFXIV sub and honestly, fav game ever pearlieLOL The "cash shop" is glamours and level boosts to skip. No pay to win really.
[2:28:53] gaymersalsa: in development for four dang years!
[2:29:02] gaymersalsa: @JustusIsOnline hryGun you cant get me
[2:29:07] cozmo42: he’s an iskallfluencer
[2:29:14] Hi_ImKari: Why do you not use the sort button in the backpack for the jewels?
[2:29:15] gaymersalsa: ISKALLFLUENCER LOLL
[2:29:15] MrRedVII: reachskall
[2:29:19] phoenix_king_01: dont kill it
[2:29:21] runtels: I hate the SAAS model
[2:29:23] AndyLurks: Pay to win sets bad incentives where they make a bad game so you will pay for it to become fun
[2:29:24] smash7711: Can you show your scraping setup. Did you use pipz or routers?
[2:29:26] gaymersalsa: @Hi_ImKari i think he just forgets its a thing now hryLaf
[2:29:30] baboobraz: hard disagree cuz then yo
[2:29:32] JustARegularRhino: if hypno gets to lvl 100 he will love that thorns shield
[2:29:34] Maserz: like runescape?
[2:29:35] devvadharshan: If iskall made a game, I'd probably enjoy it a whole lot
[2:29:36] achiee69: when you reroll a legendary midfier does it stay in the legendary range?
[2:29:37] CapraDiCollina: I disagree to be honest
[2:29:37] NakeZast: *cough* World of Warcraft *cough*  you buy the game thrice in a sense xD
[2:29:42] gaymersalsa: @smash7711 routers! pulling from the chest and putting into the recycler
[2:29:44] firemov01: You could make a section in the tutorial book to describe what each jewel buff is doing
[2:29:47] bas3j: Small 🐝 s and early access to updates?
[2:29:49] Kelzky: They did that to Fall Guys and now I don't play anymore
[2:29:55] baboobraz: then you dont own the game tho
[2:29:57] WilliamComartin: I mean, you could be like Ubisoft, and just say the quiet part out loud, and that people should get used to not owning games.
[2:29:58] Asterionm: that sounds like fortnite battle pass?
[2:29:59] JaySkinny: Single Player non-online makes no sense with monthly though./ It has to be a one-time payment (plus dlcs or whatever)
[2:29:59] omarjet05: nah I think pay to win games are the best
[2:29:59] ithreymesh86: lol iskallfans monthly subscription :> :> :>
[2:30:02] arlo_x: so like battle passes? or am i dumb
[2:30:04] Pineapple0nPizza: @devvadharshan he could call it something like.. vault runners? loot hunters?
[2:30:07] minso_so: so battlepass?
[2:30:07] Jaxitac: Yes there has to be something of a benefit to subscribing ...
[2:30:12] grace_the_final_frontier: like club penguin!
[2:30:20] seanlego23: Not everyone has monthly money to spend on games they only play for 15 hours max a month
[2:30:21] alivedemonnyte: Like extra money for some content
[2:30:21] supermarcus11: Basically like a Fortnite Crew?
[2:30:22] Moodle01_: personally i prefer one time remove ad payments over subscriptions, for mobile games at least
[2:30:23] No_xor: for offline games, i like to just buy it
[2:30:31] xDreerer: League of legends is F2P with micro transactions
[2:30:32] Phijkchu_Snorlax: Can you have more than one legendary modifier on a piece of gear?
[2:30:39] baboobraz: like you have it but for a limited amount of time which isnt great
[2:30:42] QuiverMeOnes: Expansions need to be bought on top of base game wow style
[2:30:43] gaymersalsa: constantly updating
[2:30:43] GreatLakesGirl: Can’t afford Patreon anymore but will always be a VH champion in my heart.
[2:30:44] The_10000th_man: the_10000th_man subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 52 months! 
[2:30:45] devvadharshan: @pineapple0npizza yeah ig, a mod he made is soo damn good so a game would be better
[2:30:47] gaymersalsa: and being poluishes
[2:30:52] gaymersalsa: polished*
[2:30:52] Lutzio: They're trying to make drama towards the Ubisoft comments
[2:30:55] ramnite_tv: @xDreerer The difference is you can only buy cosmetics in League, not anything that affects gameplay
[2:30:56] BONNe1704: Minecraft f.e.
[2:30:57] TruePat: Technically you don't own any games now a days
[2:30:58] ShelobsLair_: I like paying once to own something. Paying monthly quickly costs more
[2:31:06] st_ure: xbox game pass
[2:31:07] devvadharshan: @greatlakesgirl goat
[2:31:08] avian946: that’s why is “free” to play though
[2:31:09] fin03103: why can legendary modifiers not be rerolled? what is the thinking behind that idea. I will say, it certainly isn't an intuitive feature in my opinion, (I learnt the hard way xd)
[2:31:10] FrostiTosti: Skins=Wins
[2:31:12] ramnite_tv: @ramnite_tv Disregarding the so called "p2w skins" here
[2:31:14] OzzyRosmarie: theyve become a lot worse from what ive heard in league
[2:31:21] baboobraz: subscriptions are really expensive tho
[2:31:22] alivedemonnyte: Micro transactions in clash
[2:31:23] xDreerer: @ramnite_tv and xp boost i guess
[2:31:25] dragonslayerx453: What about csg micro transactions
[2:31:26] chuckplaysgames273: Is Minecraft the only game you stream?
[2:31:28] smash7711: Thanks @gaymersalsa
[2:31:29] mahik750: Oooh right, I remember now how my ex spent a lot of money on LoL skins O.o completely forgot about that
[2:31:30] ItzElixsis: @gaymersalsa though u were trying to say Polished..
[2:31:30] RaulRB36: some skins give advantage in league tho
[2:31:31] Ferdster02: I hate how big companies are selling full priced games and locking half of the extra, post-release development behind dlcs. Espacially games like the new pokemon games where the complete dlc is as much as the game itself
[2:31:36] boss_siebe: Did u roll ur trinkets i was away for a sec
[2:31:40] Lutzio: @OzzyRosmarie But that new Ezreal skin do be beautifull
[2:31:43] Kinteshi: in poe you buy mtx to worsen your visual clarity and then complain about visual clarity KEKW
[2:31:44] illycat_: i just rememberd the south park episode about pay to win games
[2:31:46] LittleOX_777: during the Herald fight, How do you charge your potions? #nevereverleaving
[2:31:57] devvadharshan: I'll be leaving, gotta study byee
[2:31:58] supermarcus11: Do rocket arrows still exist in VH?
[2:32:02] Knew_It_Owl: Bring back the micro in microtransactions! I hate seeing some "microtransactions" cost more than the entire game!
[2:32:02] Oh_No_Its_Kat: in this sense Minecraft is insane, pumping out update after update and when I bought it i only paid like 15€. insane
[2:32:03] OzzyRosmarie: @Lutzio i havent seen it, havent played in a year or so
[2:32:04] WilliamComartin: so what happens when there are no more purchases of minecraft, do you think it will stop being updated?
[2:32:07] Asterionm: a game has to be moddable tbh
[2:32:13] stefono4: Audible skin????
[2:32:14] NGw7_: But they get money from skins in game, and from new games sold. To pay monthly to play some game is just horrible, noone does that
[2:32:15] gaymersalsa: @ItzElixsis 🇵🇱
[2:32:16] MellowMen: Thats cap
[2:32:16] ramnite_tv: @xDreerer You need level 30 to play ranked, that's a small number tbh... then again, Ive had my account since 2010 KEKW
[2:32:19] MaraudingBacon: what league skins give advanmtage?
[2:32:20] AceClown: "this vault is sponsored by RAID SHADOW LEGENDS!"
[2:32:25] ithreymesh86: heard it here first iskallfans a monthly subscription fee
[2:32:28] looking4art: do you think you will stream the herald fight ? if not I’d watch an unedited full length video as well haha iskHeart
[2:32:29] QuiverMeOnes: imagine playing a game with add like free youtube, the horror
[2:32:30] stefono4: VPN skin??
[2:32:31] dor_ben_shmuel_: if it’s a competitive game it no fair for it to be buy to win but if it’s a game like Minecraft it’s ok in my opinion
[2:32:32] GhostlyMarrow49: @AceClown o no
[2:32:33] aczura: the thing with subscriber paid games is that if you pay for a month.. and you weren't able to play... suddenly you sorta "wasted" your money... it's like a gym membership you dont go to
[2:32:34] akii2390: isn’t looting ome is good?
[2:32:37] jarivd03: @RaulRB36 They fixed a lot of the problems a year ago or something related to that
[2:32:42] JustARegularRhino: i would support iskallfans
[2:32:42] TheCelestialFox: Final Fantasy 14 I find that yes there is a sub to the game but it helps kinda cut down the rudeness that can be associated with an MMO
[2:32:48] ItzElixsis: Vendoors are Micro transactions! Lol makes me want to spend my Gold
[2:32:49] LillyDaemon: I prefer the model of paying for the base game once then paying again if they release a DLC
[2:32:50] xDreerer: Pool Party Ziggs gives longer range for his Q
[2:32:51] mahik750: Sorry for asking again, but can we build with the color variant blocks that are inside paradox?
[2:32:53] gaymersalsa: hryLaf
[2:32:56] Chandler86_: LUL
[2:32:57] AyushJind: KEKW
[2:32:58] stefono4: Sponsor skins fa sho
[2:32:58] Stanbroek: KEKW
[2:32:59] RaulRB36: @RaulRB36 and they keep making skins that are hard to see visually or with faster animations
[2:32:59] Aether1k: mobile games OMEGALUL
[2:33:00] Jaxitac: crash
[2:33:08] runtels: They do that with in game signage
[2:33:08] fin03103: pitstop adbreaks
[2:33:08] gaymersalsa: *enters a raid vault in VH* THIS VAULT IS SPONSORED BY RAID: SHADO-
[2:33:10] zeus_o9o2: he means visual advantage somemakes the champion blend in the environment
[2:33:11] dia__hi: Just like real sports
[2:33:12] nounbeast: omg it'd be like a mobile game
[2:33:14] D3jvis: KEKW 󠀀
[2:33:16] Lutzio: Do you wanna pay 1$ for this hook to land? Kappa
[2:33:18] xanking96: are you gonne run any other vaults? @iskall85
[2:33:19] sabrina1202r: cries in mobile games
[2:33:19] drandromeda: Minecraft but when creepers explode it gives an ad pop up
[2:33:24] Thirdeyechakra69: is there going to be more gear models on the way? magnet models?
[2:33:24] ash_tronaut616: Literally mobile games
[2:33:25] Ferdster02: @mahik750 there are plans to make those blocks mineable, but they haven't had time yet
[2:33:27] JaySkinny: There aren't any LoL skins that give advantages. Anymations are no tied ot the skin, so it doesn't make a difference. Some have visual clarity issues that do get fixed.
[2:33:28] scary_cutie: scary_cutie converted from a Prime sub to a Tier 1 sub! 
[2:33:28] PRIPYAT715: there are games that do add breaks as you play already, many of the puzzle style games do that for your phone
[2:33:34] WilliamComartin: Bisect does a ton of advertising like that
[2:33:34] ZenoPlague: I think he's talking about stuff like project ashe which used to have a bigger ult hit box, but most of those skins have been fixed @iskall85
[2:33:34] gaymersalsa: !bisect
[2:33:34] ltl_drumm3r_boy: the skins give the advantage of distracting the enemy because they are admiring the skin kek
[2:33:34] Nightbot: Want to host your own Vault Hunters server? Check out https://bisecthosting.com/vaulthunters , use code: "VaultHunters" for a 25% discount on your first month of hosting
[2:33:37] mahik750: @Ferdster02 Thank you! iskHeart
[2:33:38] MellowMen: There is a few skins that have some visual hitbox inaccuracies but its miniscule benefits if abused
[2:33:39] Jaxitac: you tube ads is crazy its way to short
[2:33:41] OzzyRosmarie: @RaulRB36 yup, theres a reason some skins are banned in pro play lol
[2:33:43] gaymersalsa:  https://www.bisecthosting.com/p/vaulthunters
[2:33:46] Ednoria: Bisecthosting is great, we use that
[2:33:50] gifted0h: what about Exspress VPN??
[2:33:50] mahik750: We have a bisect server, good to know that we contribute by that too
[2:33:54] lizerich: servers I can get how about friends?
[2:34:06] jametrics: Then how do you pay your bills?
[2:34:14] NGw7_: Money isnt everything. There is Multimilion dollar gaming Companies, that dont really care about their game, they dont fix glitches, they dont do any good updates. So the game, needs to have caring owners, thats the first thing.
[2:34:19] StrangePanthers: Glad money goes back to the team
[2:34:21] Jaxitac: its nice to see a developer enjoy there own game
[2:34:25] midouzs: Hey iskall can we have a greed kiwi run merch .. and money can also help the development of vh
[2:34:25] gaymersalsa: twice, no?
[2:34:30] JustusIsOnline: swapped my vh server to bisect hosting and it became so much more stable!

[2:35:24] Nightbot: Vault Hunters Reddit for you to check out! https://www.reddit.com/r/VaultHuntersMinecraft/
[2:35:24] lynx6008: Netflix is nice
[2:35:25] ItzElixsis: I Care!!!
[2:35:30] NinjaFae: apple TV sells movies and rents them
[2:35:30] vonerii: fair point
[2:35:31] gaymersalsa: i go to 🏴‍☠ dot com and buy a CD Chatting
[2:35:32] cozmo42: I only buy Betamax
[2:35:33] Jaxitac: relevant
[2:35:34] Pineapple0nPizza: i have twitch turbo and youtube premium rather than netflix
[2:35:34] Kelzky: Less clutter
[2:35:36] AllieRise: I use netflix but I still don't like the business model
[2:35:37] aczura: i care lol, a big reason why i played gw2 and not wow
[2:35:37] IsaDrake: I do buy dvds!!!!
[2:35:37] Grim_Stoner: I got rid of Netflix years ago
[2:35:37] MellowMen: Vault Hunters Merch idea: keycaps with the icons of the various skills and abilities

[2:35:40] mahik750: I care, because they can delete stuff without telling me. If I own a movie, I can rest easy.
[2:35:40] xDreerer: i go to Blockbuster
[2:35:41] midouzs: What about a greed kiwi run merch to support vh
[2:35:42] redstonedad: I still buy movies and TV series
[2:35:43] FreudPlays: has iskall run his paradox yet?
[2:35:43] grafpa1: Nah gotta sail the high seas
[2:35:44] Michael04___: PunchTrees
[2:35:44] InflatablePanda: But a game is not 2 hours of content like a movie?
[2:35:45] QuiverMeOnes: i own a lot of games that i played once, decorating my bookshelf now
[2:35:47] gaymersalsa: @WilliamComartin Chadge
[2:35:49] Angeliqa_Arain: Plenty of people do buy DVDs/BDs still
[2:35:49] yawor_666: well... there is an old swedish website where you can find movies ;)
[2:35:50] Khalin1212: *our* content
[2:35:50] Ferdster02: @sabrina1202r or pokemon, putting more value in releasing on time then releasing a complete game...
[2:35:53] JustusIsOnline: personally i be sailing the high seas matey arrrrrrr
[2:35:54] kibaz_x: Backup time is slowly increasing lol
[2:35:54] ZeroPointBob: i care that i cant play a game years later due to a server being shut down
[2:35:54] captainzylo42: Its a weird problem where the ownership isnt there. It means movies or shows that are netflix exlusives can be removed from streaming and lost forever
[2:35:54] smash7711: What is the next vault
[2:35:55] baboobraz: it’s different with movies tho cuz i watch them once. games i wanna play whenever i want
[2:35:58] gaymersalsa: @FreudPlays yes at 2 hr mark
[2:35:58] dakewafel: Who owns vault hunters then?
[2:35:59] Kelzky: There are so many DvD and Game boxes gathering dust in my loft
[2:36:00] alivedemonnyte: Which Dev's are currently working on vault hunters
[2:36:00] Nightbot: For everything Vault Hunters, check out the website! https://vaulthunters.gg/
[2:36:03] Lutzio: I want to own the game I play, with the character I've made to replay it never gain, but be able to do it.
[2:36:03] FreudPlays: god damnit
[2:36:06] NinjaFae: Apple TV make a lot of money off of the movies they sell
[2:36:08] NakeZast: subscription is fine, but content-incomplete games being released and then promising future content updates is very awful...  Either a) make an early access. or b) just wait until your game is polished.
[2:36:08] drhallofduty: if its a subscription based game are you still able to play when offline?
[2:36:10] injore: i care about accessibility. It’s frustrating when shows/games become inaccessible after you’ve put a fair investment into them.
[2:36:10] PRIPYAT715: if you purchase something it should be your and not be able to be stolen back
[2:36:15] midouzs: @iskall85  What about a greed kiwi run merch to support vh
[2:36:19] pootch_1: but you wouldnt be able to play at any given time, you have to repay and they can pull it out at any moment
[2:36:19] sabrina1202r: @Ferdster02 yep

[2:36:25] chrisvirus124: iskall sponsors is not always good i think, sometimes it can lead to the developer being restricted. What do you think of this?
[2:36:26] ItzElixsis: In 30 years you will never be able to experience the nostalgic for a game u once played. But me at 40 years old can play Mario bros 3 on NES and enjoy it. And get that nostalgic feeling.
[2:36:26] cozmo42: did Etho make 100?
[2:36:34] NakeZast: @cozmo42 yup
[2:36:36] sabrina1202r: @cozmo42 yes he did
[2:36:36] xDreerer: Stress Dolls
[2:36:38] SwimStyle: my retirement plans include playing all the nostalgia games i played over the years, which arent guaranteed to be on a streaming platform, most cant even be legally aquired anymore if i didnt have the physical media

[2:36:47] Kelzky: Aw not Greed Kiwi Greed?
[2:36:48] PRIPYAT715: it is not late since there will be a VH4
[2:36:51] JashinFanatic: vault hunters is ending? D:
[2:36:52] gaymersalsa: fair.
[2:36:52] drandromeda: greed kiwi run can carry beyond this series tho :)
[2:36:53] JustusIsOnline: the end of all of vault hunters Sadge
[2:36:55] NinjaFae: @iskall85 Is there something people on youtube need to do?
[2:36:58] jessmay121_: I’d definitely buy tho
[2:37:04] mahik750: VH is coming to an end? O.o Phrasing sir, you gave me a small heart attack
[2:37:05] NakeZast: and Merch companies also have a fair few scammers...
[2:37:05] NicLatecomer: I'm for Greed Kiwi Greed

[3:04:50] xDreerer: Use hunter to find the God alters?
[3:04:51] MikeyPi_: I was watching on mute until now so I might have missed it but is there a release date for the update yet?
[3:04:53] TheJollyPainter: maybe it could light them up with their colour?
[3:04:54] BlazeSpaceRl: @iskall85 make the modifier light up the charm you are wearing
[3:04:55] LunaticGoneMad: Not being the find the right god for the whole vault is the annoying part rather then being able to complete them
[3:04:58] Xarallon: lighting specific sound omega
[3:05:07] Nightbot: Vault Hunters Reddit for you to check out! https://www.reddit.com/r/VaultHuntersMinecraft/

[3:05:19] zeus_o9o2: i have never seen iskall  focus on objective so much thats what made me lose the gamba
[3:05:20] 60wattlightbulb: Hunter already light up god altars. Lighting up specific altars would work on braziers
[3:05:22] Tjidobo: Lighting them up with they're respective colours
[3:05:22] danslaying: murica doesn't even have free health care xd
[3:05:24] eijebong_: Sweden is amazingly digitalized compared to other countries

[3:05:36] leroyjaymin: what if the god altar highlight was tied to the charm your wearing? if that makes it easier to code or something
[3:05:36] 999nightmare999: Oh god
[3:05:37] Zentanic: as a danish man myself, I can’t complain about internet either
[3:05:38] redzero1300: health whoo

[3:05:40] CooldAtTV: What if the modifier only highlights the altars of the gods you have X% affinity with?
[3:05:41] gaymersalsa: this guy.
[3:05:43] Yesat: I can get 25/25 up and down, for 60€ a months. It makes no sense, there's no server that can keep up, I'd need over 1k in gear to get these speed ^^
[3:05:43] AyushJind: monkaW
[3:05:43] sabrina1202r: WOW
[3:05:43] chuckleslaughed: highlighting specific altars is like highlighting specific mob dungeons or different treasure doors, doesn’t make much sense

[3:10:34] Ferdster02: @edetnak its velara tears. In u13 you can put charms on crystals to give affinity with that god. The 41 means he has an extra 41% chance at reputation when completing a velara altar quest
[3:10:36] nitchipa: How many velara reputation he has rn?

[3:49:39] the_whtvr: I hate looking for the entrance
[3:49:41] imthesidekick11: Elytra flying course vault when?
[3:49:42] piso112: How Come ive used up x6 gilded and got 3 omega mushroom 4 chromatic iron ones and few villages
[3:49:49] 0mango1: i got this room in my first vault ever yesterday and got so much gear at level 0
[3:49:54] Xarallon: nether cake run, that's rough
[3:49:59] gaymersalsa: its a nice clutch
[3:50:02] Sicknez_: what
[3:50:03] sabrina1202r: he destroyed an entire house just to get in lol
[3:50:03] Sicknez_: youy can do that
[3:50:04] gaymersalsa: esp during cake LOL
[3:50:18] gaymersalsa: NO FIZZLE SPAWNERS Smadge

[3:50:27] Lutzio: classic
[3:50:28] EVO_Gaming6000: Intense-skall

[3:50:33] stefono4: Amplifying focus lol
[3:50:33] doctor_pan30: is it a omega ornate vault of doom?
[3:50:36] 0mango1: thorns is so good for this room
[3:50:38] Pineapple0nPizza: @jenn_jennnn Iskall talked about this in a few vods recently. It takes -50 trap disarm till you have none left and are at the base trap rate of 5%. The it adds half of you trap rate each time so another stack would add 2.5% to give 7.5% trap chance and so on. Actually pretty balanced imo
[3:50:39] gaymersalsa: KEKW aiming at silverfi at 1 block, misses
[3:50:39] silvain_shadows: rip all the trinkets that creeper blew up
[3:50:44] axolotine: I will always be bringing unobtanium blocks here to mark my path
[3:50:50] the_whtvr: @gaymersalsa I feel like it being almost a labyrinth is enough of a challenge, the spawners should fizzle :(
[3:50:52] NakeZast: chat, what's the tinker counter at?
[3:50:55] thetiger711: are we still at one
[3:50:57] Asterionm: focused greeding

[3:51:15] marvelprincess2000: iskHeart
[3:51:18] Attackeight: THERE WERE 5 TRINKETS IN THOSE
[3:51:19] Kriskiki89: thats weird, why dont the spawners fizzle in this room
[3:51:21] excaliburhero19: i thought creepers dont blow up ornate chests?
[3:51:28] stefono4: Challenge room
[3:51:28] NakeZast: @thetiger711 hmm
[3:51:32] axolotine: quant is good and all but this is making me want a +100 item rarity tool
[3:51:34] AyushJind: a bit
[3:51:36] gamingwithtoimen: yes
[3:51:38] imthesidekick11: @kriskiki89 intended not to fizzle
[3:51:39] Libby_S: we hope so sir
[3:51:40] gaymersalsa: yes. if the spawners fizzled :)
[3:51:42] jenn_jennnn: @Pineapple0nPizza that is super confusing, so if i have 100 perccent trap disarm and i get 2 clumbsy then i will have 0 trap disarm?
[3:51:44] mrk102903: just got back from class what have I missed?
[3:51:46] NakeZast: I hope the completion crate doesn't count towards the total tally xD I wanna win this gamba

[3:52:54] NakeZast: that chest contains 3 trinkets.
[3:52:56] killerdayve: I think it would help his machete durability if he didn’t have max vein miner
[3:52:58] thebluesquaddd: how long are you streaming for today?
[3:52:59] yuvalal: Iskall what do you think about mobs with special affixies like immune to  posion ? maybe the mushroom mobs will have it ?  :)
[3:53:00] kinghingle: that chest knew wat it signed up for 7o
[3:53:02] grynd3rfl: I need to make a sound track of the chest and ore breaking sounds

[3:53:46] gaymersalsa: they should be similar to dragon room fizzle.
[3:53:46] axolotine: frost nova is terrible until it saves you once and then it's amazing the best ability ever
[3:53:47] CoconutTiim: @gaymersalsa you’ll be fine Kappa
[3:53:49] kinghingle: i think spawner mining for challange rooms is a good fit, i hope u run with challange rooms more

[3:54:39] stefono4: Down the drain
[3:54:42] eXQyu_: @CyanMystic_ Ohhno
[3:54:42] jenn_jennnn: i do think if the spawners were more like the dragon room spawners would be better, have had people die in them because its the only room that doesnt have fizzle spawners
[3:54:42] dracozzlol: @axolotine frost nova procs frstbite making it the best way to chain frostbite
[3:54:44] gaymersalsa: @duar_tg haha douwsky room!
[3:54:53] JustusIsOnline: @gaymersalsa wait im confused was the room changed to have fizzle spawners now?
[3:54:57] duar_tg: @gaymersalsa that roow was amazing
[3:55:09] excaliburhero19: battle cry is SOOO SATISFYING

[3:55:21] tcgaming5527: lets hope the other hermits can make it because ther is a week left
[3:55:24] gaymersalsa: MEANS IM NOT COMPLAINING ENOUGH hryLeddit
[3:55:34] danslaying: @
[3:55:36] JustusIsOnline: @gaymersalsa oh okay, have you tried mining the spawner? that usually stops the mobs from spawning
[3:55:38] axolotine: @dracozzlol huh that's weird I remember trying to do that and it didn't work :\
[3:55:38] Lutzio: Nah, fizzle spawners would be boring here
[3:55:44] Nightbot: Watch iskall85’s VOD’s at https://youtube.com/@vodskall85
[3:55:45] gaymersalsa: @gaymersalsa stfu hryLaf
[3:55:45] tcgaming5527: it would make village rooms too easy
[3:55:46] ShelobsLair_: no don't change that
[3:55:47] therealtolazytothink: I'm still surprised dragon fizzils
[3:55:50] imthesidekick11: I like the break spawner challenge.  It feels unique
[3:55:50] CoconutTiim: fizzle spawners would be weird in this room
[3:55:51] izeplaysGames: there are ALWAYS complaints, some people are complainers
[3:55:55] lumistormpaw: It's fizzle spawners. But it spawns only packs of champion mobs
[3:55:59] iPassiive: i agree, fizzle spawners in village rooms would be too easy imo
[3:56:00] ShelobsLair_: we need challenges somewhere to keep things interesting
[3:56:02] jenn_jennnn: i COMPLETLY agree, they SHOULD be fizzle spawners, it is very strange that it is the only room that has them do that, and new players are dieing in them because of that
[3:56:07] Centurian13: would you do anything like raid vaults like in s2?
[3:56:07] Nightbot: Support the devs & the pack.  https://www.patreon.com/VaultHunters
[3:56:08] danslaying: @Severian_Wolfe -50k points ICANT LOLW
[3:56:11] stefono4: And it's a hard clear
[3:56:13] saxymatt: Only change them to fizzle but they spawn 20 champs
[3:56:14] the_whtvr: I wouldn't mind breaking spawners, but the fact it's almost a labyrinth makes it really annoying
[3:56:15] fenixcrafter05: poison trap bugd?
[3:56:15] ramnite_tv: Gamba not lookin very good rn .-.
[3:56:15] gaymersalsa: yeah thats why it feels like a mistake to me
[3:56:15] JustusIsOnline: @gaymersalsa Kappa
[3:56:17] Kriskiki89: its unintuitive
[3:56:18] iljalz: ye it was
[3:56:19] chrisvirus124: Iskall why not make a iskallium shoveling/reaping hammer for a more well rounded use other then coin affinity?
[3:56:20] excaliburhero19: was that a water bottle from that chest???
[3:56:20] LootPuppy: A curse where 1/10 spawners stopped being fizzle spawners could be fun
[3:56:23] gaymersalsa: @Kriskiki89 ^^
[3:56:23] TAxels: like a king of the hill where you have to stand on top of a big mound?
[3:56:24] ShelobsLair_: it is quite good
[3:56:28] buny1p_: A soul shard room would be cool
[3:56:29] erinlynn82: every poi

[3:56:33] Knew_It_Owl: I just LOVE the amount of trinkets you're getting Copege
[3:56:34] Arvom: PLS no more mazes tho
[3:56:34] GraftyCook: I like it, the room reminds me of the old pois
[3:56:35] Pineapple0nPizza: it just isn't explained well - first time someone encounters it it's very weird and feels like the spawners are broken
[3:56:38] itsjonathanjones: I enjoyed when there were some spawners were not fizzle
[3:56:42] gaymersalsa: @excaliburhero19 no i think that was a cloud from a mob dying?? idk
[3:56:43] jadevixen_: Mojang copied it
[3:56:46] PvMElectron: I like the break spawned challenge. I wonder if there’s a way to highlight visually that these spawners need to be broken versus the normal fizzle spawners that just disappear in front of your eyes
[3:56:47] imthesidekick11: It was a big change but it helped push people away from the super passive play style that never broke a spawner
[3:56:48] Lutzio: I hate silverfish with a passion
[3:56:49] MaraudingBacon: fizzle spawners was such a good change. and i like that are place where they dont fizzle
[3:56:51] bumpora1: @LootPuppy that a good idea ngl
[3:56:53] iPassiive: ngl changing them to fizzle spawners might be one of if not the best change for VH ever
[3:56:54] tcgaming5527: 2 minutes remain
[3:56:56] pursued__toast: what’s the trinket count?
[3:57:05] doctor_pan30: fizzle spawners was a great change

[3:57:08] proshooter27_: @Knew_It_Owl how many did he get until now?
[3:57:08] jenn_jennnn: @iPassiive 1000000 percent agree
[3:57:09] itsthenathan: i love that change, its where I gained so much more respect for you and the team for development
[3:57:12] kinghingle: one of my favourite was accessable instana mining chests, such a great way to experience the game with low amounts of UI looting
[3:57:12] pursued__toast: Ty!

[4:21:08] eXQyu_: why is bonus chests not in positive modifier but instead in other modifiers??
[4:21:09] itsjonathanjones: wouldn’t this be so nice with an xp shower?
[4:21:10] imthesidekick11: @rachjoe77 curseforge is what I play vault hunters on. Think most do
[4:21:18] hazcanteatthis: does everyone have to be level 100 to get into the final vault or are you guys just trying to get them there for fun?

[4:21:43] gaymersalsa: @Garnail20 theyre really annoying, like mining fatigue, weakness, etc
[4:21:44] NakeZast: @thetiger711 nahhhh
[4:21:45] ShelobsLair_: @gaymersalsa remind me what the difference is between cascading and bonus?
[4:21:46] itsjonathanjones: is it possible to get a bonus with no wild?
[4:21:58] boss_siebe: 11 though
[4:21:59] eXQyu_: spicyyyy
[4:22:01] sabrina1202r: ouch
[4:22:01] Garnail20: okay, so like omega debuffs -- gotcha salsa
[4:22:03] gaymersalsa: @ShelobsLair_ bonus doesnt care about POIs, cascading only adds chests around pois
[4:22:04] Lutzio: Random modifiers could be more wild right?
[4:22:07] tcgaming5527: yes. yes! YES! hahaha the best looter vault!
[4:22:07] gaymersalsa: @Garnail20 YEPERS

[4:22:29] Z0eff: @gaymersalsa achtually cascading also cascades bonus chests
[4:22:30] mihea13: any good fruit or just kiwis?
[4:22:30] iPassiive: sir iskall do you listen to music in the background whenever you stream
[4:22:30] Pineapple0nPizza: @ShelobsLair_ bonus = new chests in random spots, cascading = extra chests spawn around each chest
[4:22:35] gaymersalsa:  same trinki gamba up again ok
[4:22:36] 19Null7: 9x shortened
[4:22:43] gaymersalsa: will close gamba before he enters the vault !!

[4:22:46] pepa1d: same trinkets?
[4:22:47] jenn_jennnn: i always do reveal just to see what it is xD
[4:22:48] imthesidekick11: @shelobslair_ bonus is a set amount of extra that can spawn anywhere in the room. While cascading can just make any chest (of that type) spawn spawn extras
[4:22:54] tcgaming5527: yep

[4:23:37] jenn_jennnn: i like the idea of the catalyst system change ONLY if the slots are for guaranteed modifiers then you COULD still add more but it THEN would have a chance to exhaust the crystal
[4:23:40] sharkyteeth101: No the catalyst thing

[4:34:52] GrimBirb: nvm that answered my question
[4:35:10] chrisvirus124: @iskall85 why do you not improve your alchemy/tools midst making your min maxed armor?
[4:35:26] ShelobsLair_: Is there a wiki where information like that is available?
[4:35:29] k1_setae: why that logic? they are still as good as normal chests you find and they are all clumped in that one dungeon?
[4:35:29] 64_Bit_Cake: @rektarina1594 with hundreds of mining speed yes, but probably not possible in survival

[4:37:47] tcgaming5527: vendoor
[4:37:51] sabrina1202r: runskall
[4:37:59] gaymersalsa: KEKW
[4:38:02] gaymersalsa: BUT WE CARE
[4:38:03] Z0eff: I feel like you barely get ANY mana back from proccing
[4:38:04] tcgaming5527: :(
[4:38:04] smash7711: Mayne you can buy a trinket
[4:38:11] smash7711: That counts
[4:38:14] TomAlJar: @TAxels that affects it?
[4:38:15] danslaying: true you don't care about us 😫
[4:38:16] gaymersalsa: "funny" json
[4:38:18] GrimBirb: @TomAlJar from my understanding it could be: A wooden chest which can't instabreak, or a mojang bug, or its a reinforced chest which takes longer to mine
[4:38:22] sabrina1202r: again we care iskall
[4:38:24] tcgaming5527: oh crap
[4:38:26] TEONYco: i dont care smadge

[4:38:46] danslaying: @shelobslair_ True
[4:38:50] HarcosMalac: KEKW probably didnt see the ones burning in lava
[4:38:52] GrimBirb: @TomAlJar These 3 are reasons if a chest cant be instamined, most of the time its the mojang bug
[4:38:54] angrrrrydad: if etho was in this vault he would be up to 6 trinkies by now
[4:39:00] jw_ice: how much RAM has this server?
[4:39:02] TAxels: @TomAlJar yeah if you are mining and jump/fall/go down a slab/etc... it  has a chance of being slow
[4:39:13] ShelobsLair_: sir that's just their hair
[4:39:13] TomAlJar: @GrimBirb oh it'll be the mojang bug then, was wondering since i've seen the bug since the start of the modpack
[4:39:19] 64_Bit_Cake: @tomaljar if you start mining something while in mid air it won't mine properly, so you have to break something else first
[4:39:19] megafrox: You need aoe, that's why you're going stompa build, right?
[4:39:26] tcgaming5527: i think that needs to change soon
[4:39:37] tcgaming5527: just a hunch
[4:39:39] danslaying: deserved LOLW
[4:39:45] Simon04090: what is the U shape symbol modifier
[4:39:51] ShelobsLair_: concilidate -> consolidate

[4:39:59] tcgaming5527: the u shape is lucky
[4:40:02] 64_Bit_Cake: @simon04090 lucky - +item rarity
[4:40:04] gaymersalsa: oh thats a way better word
[4:40:13] floppypidgen: Did one if your armor pieces break?

[5:01:39] imthesidekick11: Some one here would have used that in a poison nova build
[5:01:42] eXQyu_: yea the axe is not “cutting” it
[5:01:42] judgywudgy: @axolotine You can bring charged snowballs into the vault and make them at creepers to make them charged creepers btw
[5:01:45] rad_ju: @Attackeight does it matter if desht doesn't want to update 1.18 anymore?
[5:01:48] sack_of_smiles: @yellow_calx he just can't figure out how to use them well
[5:01:49] ithreymesh86: very funny that gave me tingles lol
[5:01:57] profesorpineaple: Craft gear
[5:02:01] CyanMystic_: I really thought I would get the BING(O) "Epic or Legendary Omega" here. Alas, no.
[5:02:05] 0mango1: @sack_of_smiles whats the difference between axe and sword
[5:02:08] rad_ju: it took half year to convince him to add the bulk filter ghost
[5:02:13] Attackeight: @Attackeight Wouldn't be the first time I asked him to update 1.18 again
[5:02:13] gaymersalsa: STOMPA
[5:02:30] bumpora1: what is stompa lmao
[5:02:31] akii2390: you should change armor for now
[5:02:32] axolotine: @judgywudgy doing this and bringing flint and steel into a desert theme to clear mobs super quick
[5:02:34] sack_of_smiles: @yellow_calx mainly its the attackspeed, swords hit much faster. you need to time it much more with an axe
[5:02:41] 64_Bit_Cake: So is stompa happening?
[5:02:42] Tjidobo: Save your current build if you haven't
[5:02:55] jackfrost9879: Can you unlock anything else with knowledge?
[5:03:05] SrgMuffinz: thegre563Fuel

[5:03:56] angrrrrydad: nah ruin it
[5:03:57] sack_of_smiles: @yellow_calx usually yes, but when you look at DPS (damage per second), it evens more out, because you can get more hits with a sword
[5:03:57] Pineapple0nPizza: no, it's good, stop lol
[5:04:03] k1_setae: Just craft rengen now
[5:04:04] gaymersalsa: BROKE time incokming

[5:04:06] imthesidekick11: I liked it when axes had longer reach. Was great for a safer play style and just makes sense over all
[5:04:08] k1_setae: you dont need heal on every piece
[5:04:11] eXQyu_: why dont you have wireless rs
[5:04:16] Stanbroek: is there still gold in the chest down stairs?

[5:24:42] ramnite_tv: With the amount of lucky hit on gear you have I would argue that you don't need more than 2 points in lucky cry (the surplus stacks used are usually wasted, they would be more useful on a second hit)
[5:24:42] gaymersalsa: berserking could be better for you?
[5:24:44] Edetnak: Yeah last stand sounds really good here

[5:36:05] AngelBunVT: angelf7Wiggle i love running thorns
[5:36:05] imthesidekick11: Thorns logically should scale on armor. Like rammus
[5:36:07] boss_siebe: Dont want to get nerfed
[5:36:08] Mooseberg_: usually thorns takes up a lot of durability
[5:36:09] krux702: Thorns is great. I ran one of those for awhile and could almost ignore the mobs
[5:36:09] jammanty: not much of a pasifist if they die...
[5:36:09] smash7711: Now you can run with a block in hand
[5:36:10] hamisharms: @gaymersalsa Just got back. Has he got the armour yet ??
[5:36:10] minipax84: youre using almost my main build, I only get sword out for champs
[5:36:11] mrjackal85: Do not nerf thorns
[5:36:11] yo_itstim_duke: I remember what you were going to say, You're gonna complete this vault.
[5:36:12] bumpora1: but durability...
[5:36:13] 60wattlightbulb: I love thorns! I use it all the time LUL
[5:36:15] Mooseberg_: not worth it in vanilla at least
[5:36:15] etheerprom: Because nerf will be comment then
[5:36:15] masterjetter: lots of durability damage in that build though
[5:36:17] zerogiven: Does Thorns damage the armor?
[5:36:17] Stormtalon42: @iskall85 some of us know about this already -- it's so good.  Pairs very well with Mana Shield: Retribution

[5:36:26] grynd3rfl: I have a heavy thorns build and 1/3 of mob I don't have to hit
[5:36:27] wpoc1234: getting rid of javelins and focusing on mana regeneration and rampage may be good
[5:36:28] ShelobsLair_: @gaymersalsa gamba on what timer Iskall will leave vault?
[5:36:29] aniketop123: Do rampage and work with thorns??
[5:36:30] cladmi: Is it really pacifist if you have thorns?
[5:36:31] minipax84: if we told you you would all do it
[5:36:34] judgywudgy: I've been using thorns with quill + archon my entire playthrough
[5:36:34] gaymersalsa: @ShelobsLair_ thats a bit boring
[5:36:35] masterjetter: archon saves durability too
[5:36:35] avian946: so it scales from increased armour on your gear?
[5:36:36] SammJ85: nope it doest
[5:36:37] alexsolm: Thay afraid you ll nerf
[5:36:37] BunnyInnaJar: hellooooo

[5:36:58] ramnite_tv: @toomuchinertia Invest in one of the thorns skill that gives dura damage reduction and youre good, even archon if it's cheaper KEKW
[5:36:58] noninja5: ye
[5:36:58] the_great_tan: Uhe has become thorn prince 😀😀
[5:36:59] gaymersalsa: binoba

[5:37:02] supermarcus11: Wasn't there one on top of last room?
[5:37:04] Zinoba: balsa
[5:37:05] 999nightmare999: Wait it doesn't take durability!?
[5:37:07] 64_Bit_Cake: It works like that for archon
[5:37:09] toomuchinertia: um my bad
[5:37:15] digikrynary: Gn gn gn
[5:37:17] toby8998: so satisfying
[5:37:18] gaymersalsa: pag
[5:37:18] FaeAura: it's them hitting you more though that takes the dura
[5:37:18] yo_itstim_duke: Nice build!
[5:37:25] slashyamael: it should be clear that it doesn't I ask the questio many and enver had a clear answer before now
[5:37:26] masterjetter: well you have to take a hit to proc thorns. which is extra durability
[5:37:29] ShelobsLair_: yeah that's how it works in vanilla, at least how it used to work
[5:37:32] Xenixx01: But you still get hit more with this build than let's say standard one, so the durability goes quicker
[5:37:32] smash7711: Modify work bench for damage %
[5:37:33] gaymersalsa: its alright.
[5:37:34] Mooseberg_: Invinaskal
[5:37:37] danslaying: yay
[5:37:37] smash7711: Let's go
[5:37:38] LaplaceDemon2k: that should also be like leech 500 health, no? 100 seems pretty low
[5:37:39] Inferior_Moe: Inferior_Moe subscribed with Prime. 
[5:37:42] Ruemis: Isn't there a transmog for thorns too?
[5:37:42] AceK1n9: just got back how has iskall got so many hearts now?
[5:37:47] Baab83: The more mobs you tank the stronger the build is
[5:37:49] masterjetter: trinkit
[5:37:49] 64_Bit_Cake: Tbh that transmognis too easy I got it with 1 in leech lucky hit and basically no lucky hit chance
[5:37:55] gaymersalsa: tbh you could use the potion for something else
[5:37:55] buny1p_: but there is no need for it if you dont take dmg
[5:37:59] mrjackal85: You don't need javelins
[5:38:04] nipla13: Hi chat. I had a work meeting and lost the last two hours. Did iskall make new gear ?
[5:38:09] gaymersalsa: oh oh oh imagine taunt on the potion!!!

[5:42:47] cobswicked: iskall i have 4 legendary damage armore peaces, just one in lusky lifeleach + lucky cleave for hord and lucky added damage for champs. No rampage and base battle cry for even more damage for champs. No need for anything else
[5:42:50] shubhu321mj: is it impossible
[5:42:52] jack_o_nightwolf: its need more mana regen and luck hit?

[5:43:03] Lutzio: That was intense

[5:43:11] ruby_realist: need so much more mana for rampage
[5:43:15] MikeyPi_: You can survive for sure but you don't do enough damage back
[5:43:16] gaymersalsa: StoryTimeWithDylan

[5:44:00] mahik750: yeah but you drink 3-4 times at the same time from your potion with gluttony
[5:44:00] Bneney: I think using Vamparic for heals and Fatal Strike for more damage would be better
[5:44:02] smash7711: Need the potion for rampage
[5:44:03] pushyb123: Never
[5:44:05] supermarcus11: Actually good for once
