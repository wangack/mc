[2:11:20] inburnout: eating to many cheese
[2:11:23] V01t45: I finally finished the game only after I put in the mod that removes level restrictions in the game. Having to grind and level is really immersion breaking as you just cant explore shit and have to make spreadsheets on where to go next based on arbitrary levels
[2:11:27] Elogain: the rounded part of the armor is where you'd put food for quick access
