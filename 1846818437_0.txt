[0:15:54] JaffaMod: We're now going for an ad break that will last up to 5 minutes. Make sure you subscribe ( twitch.tv/yogscast/subscribe ) to not see them anymore!
[0:19:12] maybe_emmy: Wish they did more of this game I really enjoyed it

[0:23:35] HappyWulf: happyw5Hello happyw5Hello happyw5Hello happyw5Hello
[0:25:08] HappyWulf: Hey, @Nightjar if I wanted to bring a game to the Naut's attention, and beg them to play it, whomst would I tell?
[0:25:39] Nightjar: @HappyWulf Email them, probably
[0:27:06] HappyWulf: Hmmm. K. o7
[0:27:38] Nightjar: But I doubt they'd play something suggested unless they're either interested or being sponsored. You can try suggesting it to streamers within the network if it's their sort of thing, but otherwise unless it's something they'd like regardless, I doubt they'd do it
[0:29:13] HappyWulf: I'm pretty sure they'd like it. It's a new hidden role style game with some neat twists on the genre. It just cam eout yeterday and I think they'd eat it up, which is why I asked.
