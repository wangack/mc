[0:50:56] Eliddinn: i've not had an admirals pie for ages
[0:51:07] RonnyC2: Listen, we don't know what happened to the Shepherd, he was gone and a pie was left behind.

[0:55:39] the_g_meister: I've heard other sites are better for finding dates
[0:55:43] niki_the_pirate: the mast needs some love
[0:55:51] the_g_meister: People recommend bumble here
[0:56:23] cuddlebudy: He would probably get a family dog 🤔
[0:56:27] Melongenes: Hinge way better
[0:56:28] RonnyC2: Keanu saying good job about your artwork and putting it on the fridge
[0:56:32] ThePingMachine: The last time I downloaded the apps, the first profile I came across had a prompt of "What's your most controversial opinion". She had answered "The rise to power of Adolf Hitler in Germany was inspiring"
[0:56:40] ThePingMachine: Closed the app and went to uninstall
[0:56:56] jimbothejimbothejimbo: Keanu on bring your father to work day
[0:57:02] topendbuzza: Imagine dating, couldn't be me    AsexualPride

[0:57:07] Melongenes: Yeah but that's every app
[0:57:10] themadone68: I tried Bumble - far too many women on it don't know how it works and still expect the guy to message first micromadsBonk
[0:57:29] Melongenes: micromadsClown
[0:57:37] the_g_meister: Madone LUL
[0:58:46] tetarchus: Except neither of them can message first, so it goes nowhere
[0:59:10] TheJok3r95: i heard tinder brought out a platinum subscription that allows to match with who ever kinda defeating the purpose of it...

[1:09:55] Beni_boy00: micromadsHey
[1:11:00] OlivierUbachs: Solo life style LUL
[1:11:15] FeralGenocide: ah, it said you reached 5
[1:11:56] FeralGenocide: skelly ships are actually harder for me to fight than people for some reason. they always put their glasses on when they fight me.
[1:12:50] FeralGenocide: Aye. I agree with that.
[1:13:01] OlivierUbachs: Never thought of it, but it would make sense all of a sudden
[1:13:12] FeralGenocide: like how newer players run into ancient skelly's more often than older players.
[1:13:38] deckspest: They definitely seem to vary in sweat level
[1:14:05] FeralGenocide: oh. Ya learn something new every day XD
[1:14:10] FeralGenocide: gonna have to do some more island runs then.
[1:14:19] OlivierUbachs: I'm most likely no longer than 10min on an island yeah
[1:14:40] Bunisher: Ancient skellies should spawn on my boat.
[1:14:48] GazJrpg: I see them every so often but I enjoy questing on islands and stuff
[1:15:02] jon2219852: They should add an athena kraken voyage similar to the veil
[1:15:13] FeralGenocide: Gold hoarders grade 5 voyages.
[1:15:26] camerong20085: I had 2 ancient skellies the other day when we were doing fotd
[1:15:35] FeralGenocide: they give a lot of digs enough to reach grade 5 again.
[1:15:36] OlivierUbachs: @Bunisher You know what should spawn on your boat to make it make sense, ocean crawlers. Even thought it'd be quite annoying
[1:16:13] FeralGenocide: Like in the SOT preview that sadly never happened.
[1:16:27] OlivierUbachs: It would one great fun with newer players KEKW all their panic screams
[1:17:03] jimbothejimbothejimbo: why is it skipped?
[1:17:10] GazJrpg: I'm guessing because I looks like a 1
[1:17:14] GazJrpg: yup
[1:17:20] jimbothejimbothejimbo: ah
[1:17:36] Bunisher: @OlivierUbachs Ancient Ocean Crawlers! We've figured it out! We smart!
[1:17:40] jimbothejimbothejimbo: I learned a new factoid today ty
[1:18:30] Bunisher: Ancient phantoms spawns on spanish forts, gives ancient coins. Ancient ocean crawlers can spawn on your boat, gives ancient coins. Ancient sirens, spawns in shrines and treasuries, gives coins.
[1:19:27] FeralGenocide: Did ya know sailors would knock on thier ship twice to see if it sounded solid in fears that it would fall apart at sea? hense "knock on wood"

[1:52:05] TheJok3r95: lets try again
[1:52:27] Lunaz_xo: Are you excited for the new seasons? anything ur hoping will come?
[1:53:06] p4nzerblitz: What about the new guns on the front deck of that new ship on the pic? LUL
[1:53:08] DaDoinkster: tHiS iSnT tHe EnD
[1:53:23] Stick0o0: im guessing either on a monday or thursday next week theyll release a trailer
[1:54:18] p4nzerblitz: The ship Lantern is a bit confusing...
[1:54:35] p4nzerblitz: on the main menu pic
[1:55:10] p4nzerblitz: the way the guns are set near hapoons are also confusing
[1:55:27] p4nzerblitz: you clearly see a front deck of some sort a galeon? Man O waR?
[1:55:59] p4nzerblitz: Give me soem knowledge here LUL
[1:56:13] ItzRazzleDazzle: time to crush dreams
[1:56:26] Stick0o0: its a sloop, just modified for a starting screen
[1:56:37] GazJrpg: its clearly a sloop
[1:56:39] p4nzerblitz: yes
[1:56:57] p4nzerblitz: so the pic doesn't reflect the actual game?
[1:57:03] cuddlebudy: The gold horder doll is adorable though
[1:57:03] p4nzerblitz: its a montgae?
[1:57:08] p4nzerblitz: ok
[1:57:13] themadone68: if you stand further back on your ship so you're lower down, would it make it more obvious?
[1:57:18] p4nzerblitz: *montage
[1:57:38] Stick0o0: im so happy they turned the gold horder into a marketable plus
[1:57:39] Lunaz_xo: do u know if all inventory voyages will go away, or just one's from events ect?
[1:57:41] p4nzerblitz: nope
[1:57:50] p4nzerblitz: its not an actual existing ship in game
[1:57:59] p4nzerblitz: if its a montage, ok, then, i fold.
[1:58:28] themadone68: eat a hat made out of sour gummies?
[1:58:50] ItzRazzleDazzle: gallys have enough cannons
[1:58:55] XUM4N: it’s a stitched together boat, you’re right
[1:59:11] p4nzerblitz: You confess its still confusing then ;)
[1:59:13] Lunaz_xo: seen a lot of speculations about ship remakes and map expansion ect but feels too big to be just yet
[1:59:24] p4nzerblitz: iam all ears :D
[1:59:35] p4nzerblitz: yep
[1:59:39] XUM4N: instead of the stairs it’s the galleon steps, and the masts removed
[2:00:10] cuddlebudy: Pfftt I'd probably be ok with a front mid deck cannon on the gally but with no window. Make it take coms to hit shots
[2:00:28] cuddlebudy: Not saying that's what it is, just a random thought
[2:00:38] Grayhound55: What if you look through the window above the quest table.
[2:01:11] p4nzerblitz: just take a look of hapoons é guns placements on the menu page... after if its a montage, yep, forget about it.
[2:01:15] ItzRazzleDazzle: if gallys got more guns they would have to balance the other ships anyway somehow
[2:01:24] GazJrpg: dooes this mean we get a new ship thats a sloop, brig and gallean stitched into one?
[2:01:37] XUM4N: no railings on the boom
[2:01:55] p4nzerblitz: take a look on the plank of the front wooden whatever stick
[2:02:17] Quadiam: hey friends, hows the high seas today?
[2:02:26] p4nzerblitz: there's no planks on the sloop
[2:02:26] StreamElements: <3 MADDIE'S SOCIALS <3 https://allmylinks.com/micromads <3
[2:02:37] Lundherr: whats the athena thing beneath the 11
[2:02:37] DemonNoises: I like how they removed the mast
[2:02:46] DemonNoises: wait no
[2:02:49] DemonNoises: they moved the table?
[2:02:56] Lunaz_xo: yeah i thinks deffo the sloop
[2:02:59] p4nzerblitz: further
[2:02:59] Nafffo: SoT hidden object minigame
[2:03:14] DemonNoises: yeyeye
[2:03:19] p4nzerblitz: youu have 2 nailes planks
[2:03:24] red_raseby: Who knows how much artistic licence was used, right?...
[2:03:45] Lunaz_xo: omg now thar u pointed it out.....
[2:03:49] DemonNoises: I feel like they composited the cannons in to like, troll people
[2:03:54] themadone68: how can you tell the cannon is loaded?
[2:04:08] pnpthedea1er: MORNING ALL!!!! Dang I overslept big time! How are we all this fine day? Beautiful sunshine to enjoy over my Saturday morning cappuccino to get my day started!
[2:04:13] themadone68: Oh - couldn't spot that fuse at all
[2:04:16] Bunisher: Isnt there a fuse on the left one? Zoom in again.
[2:04:19] DemonNoises: I saw multiple people going "CHASE CANNONS?!" and like no I think they just moved them forward on a sloop for this shot
[2:04:26] p4nzerblitz: how do u call the wooden thingy in front on a ship, in French its called beaupré but don't know in English
[2:04:32] TheChiefVarro: How else are you supposed to trigger the OCD pirates? Kappa
[2:04:50] p4nzerblitz: ok thx
[2:05:06] Quadiam: thought you had all the season 11 secrets, i had faith in you
[2:05:08] TheChiefVarro: @p4nzerblitz Bowsprit. micromadsLove
[2:05:14] Lunaz_xo: im gonna go make myself an iced coffe, yum
[2:05:22] tetarchus: Season 10 screen confirms Mast table?!!
[2:05:23] p4nzerblitz: @TheChiefVarro micromadsBongo
[2:05:33] Quadiam: same, i was just talking about some friends about it last night, i like the surprise
[2:05:35] Bunisher: Does even Rare know whats coming in season 11?
[2:05:40] themadone68: birthdays do suck
[2:05:47] ItzRazzleDazzle: i think if the gally ever did get chase cannons the sloop would require a flee cannon at the back somewhere
[2:05:52] lightlane34: Some of my friends said it could be an update to tribute peak because of the little gold hoarder
[2:06:11] Stick0o0: im just happy season 10 is ending when its expected too
[2:06:16] pnpthedea1er: This is the first season i've actually not tried to find anything about it beforehand.
[2:06:20] ItzRazzleDazzle: yeah exactly but chase cannon would also be as OP
[2:06:21] Bunisher: If they add back cannons they need to add front cannons as well. All of a sudden every ship have a million cannons.
[2:06:30] pnpthedea1er: Even on Insiders they don't seem to have given anything away
[2:06:39] DemonNoises: gold hoarder is so plush and marketable
[2:06:54] the_g_meister: Harpoons didn't exist at launch right?
[2:07:00] pnpthedea1er: Belle Plush for the win!
[2:07:01] themadone68: Brigsy plush?
[2:07:03] Quadiam: Ok, so im not going crazy.  I thought it was 6 weeks left, then the other day it was 3 all of a sudden
[2:07:06] DemonNoises: give me the belle plush, I am normal and can be trusted
[2:07:10] ItzRazzleDazzle: the plush surly is just a trinket
[2:07:16] the_g_meister: It's funny bc I basically added them to the ship I made for a sot-style rpg
[2:07:19] cuddlebudy: They clearly messed up not doing a pink cat plush
[2:07:23] DemonNoises: micromadsHype micromadsHype micromadsHype
[2:07:24] Stick0o0: if you look at the bottom right of teh season 11 starting scrren, i think those are more plushies
[2:07:34] p4nzerblitz: doesn't fit
[2:07:35] the_g_meister: I also put a mine launcher out the back so maybe that's coming season 11
[2:07:47] p4nzerblitz: you have a deck, big one in front.
[2:07:58] DemonNoises: literally chopped the back half of the sloop yeah, then put the table in
[2:08:10] LarsFL: That's a big deck you've got there
[2:08:18] DemonNoises: 100 percent
[2:08:19] the_g_meister: Can you break your own mast for effect?
[2:08:21] DemonNoises: sneaky rare

[3:09:05] Bunisher: I mean... Down is easy. Just dig the blocks you've placed... or jump.
[3:09:07] Bunisher: Up is harder.
[3:09:07] angelaachan: Getting down after getting an elytra will never be an issue anymore
[3:09:09] Talimbur: once you're up there is no more worry about getting down :3
[3:09:17] LarsFL: It is quite a legendary item
[3:09:40] FreddieMcBob: legs become useless once the elytra is found

[3:11:59] LarsFL: Now you don't have rockets, but you can glide
[3:12:00] Bunisher: Good luck learning how it works. It can be a bit tricky :D
[3:12:00] KarlAbj: KEKW
[3:12:01] OhNotFunny_: u cant use it without fireworks
[3:12:01] FreddieMcBob: woohoo
[3:12:01] Bunisher: Dont die.
[3:12:04] Talimbur: sweet
[3:12:05] OhNotFunny_: and it breaks fast
[3:12:07] FreddieMcBob: be careful hehe
[3:12:08] Jammer4hyvz: jump back down
[3:12:21] Talimbur: you can use it without fireworks.... it just wont fly up

[3:13:01] Jammer4hyvz: fly dummy
[3:13:07] Talimbur: don't worry you can glide now :3
[3:13:12] Sn0wyCat: you can fly with your elytra
[3:13:13] LarsFL: You can glide down
[3:13:15] Jammer4hyvz: you have wings
[3:13:17] Sn0wyCat: press jump
[3:13:17] LarsFL: Press space while falling
[3:13:21] DaDoinkster: not like that
[3:13:24] angelaachan: press space while falling down
[3:13:26] emilskyv5: water buget mlg
[3:13:27] Jammer4hyvz: spacebar
[3:13:42] angelaachan: and look forward, not down
[3:13:46] n4tbleda: you can hit this little things too
[3:13:46] Jammer4hyvz: olé
[3:13:47] LarsFL: You glide to where you aim, so don't aim straight down
[3:13:51] angelaachan: it glides in the direction you're looking
[3:13:55] DaDoinkster: just jump off and try it...
[3:14:13] LarsFL: Yay flight
[3:14:15] Jammer4hyvz: make sure its health is t low
[3:14:18] angelaachan: WEEEEEE
[3:14:24] Jammer4hyvz: isnt
[3:14:26] KarlAbj: there you go
[3:14:26] StreamElements: <3 MADDIE'S SOCIALS <3 https://allmylinks.com/micromads <3
[3:14:27] RagingPhoenix33: wooooo!!
[3:14:29] KarlAbj: natural
[3:14:29] DaDoinkster: now you gotta get mending for it cuz that thing eats durability
[3:14:32] Bunisher: It doesnt fly up unless you have momentum. Keep that in mind. So you might need to go down before you can go up.
[3:14:36] FreddieMcBob: Sorry for backseat driving but u should collect shulker shells so you can make a shulker box. it’s basically a chest you can carry in your inventory
[3:14:50] Talimbur: you can block the shot with your shield
[3:14:58] Talimbur: so you won't float
[3:15:14] LarsFL: Who needs stairs when you have floating balls
[3:15:14] KarlAbj: yes if you hit a wall/ground full speed you die
[3:15:19] Jammer4hyvz: she got one!
[3:15:22] angelaachan: yeeee
[3:15:29] FreddieMcBob: very useful item
[3:15:32] Jammer4hyvz: yipeee
[3:15:58] LarsFL: You're a natural
[3:16:07] FreddieMcBob: wait til u get some fireworks haha
[3:16:17] angelaachan: blblblb
[3:16:38] Jammer4hyvz: just make sure to check the elytras health because THEY DO BREAK
[3:16:46] Jammer4hyvz: QUICKLY
[3:16:48] camerong20085: You can craft a shulker box with 2 shulker shells and 1 chest
[3:17:22] LarsFL: You'll want to enchant the wings eventually but you're fine
[3:17:32] TheJok3r95: mending on the elytra comes in clutch big time
[3:17:38] FreddieMcBob: can elytra’s still be repaired with phantom membranes if u don’t have mending?
[3:17:50] angelaachan: yes
[3:18:04] FreddieMcBob: coolio
[3:18:34] FreddieMcBob: cheeky bugger

[3:19:42] RiddlerStreams: you can also grab those rods and use them as lights
[3:20:06] Jammer4hyvz: fuuuuuuuu
[3:20:13] LarsFL: This is a pretty small village tbf
[3:20:30] FreddieMcBob: go back through the portal
[3:20:51] FreddieMcBob: and then the portal that spawned where the dragon died and you’ll spawn back at your bed
[3:20:59] LarsFL: They can have chests with goodies, but no luck with this one
[3:21:01] angelaachan: The floaties are annoying af but also useful haha
[3:21:10] Jammer4hyvz: go back to the ship
[3:21:16] Jammer4hyvz: dragon head
[3:21:25] LarsFL: Glide time
[3:21:52] FreddieMcBob: wtf was that
[3:21:55] Jammer4hyvz: dragon head
[3:22:00] LarsFL: That was not a minecraft sound
[3:22:06] Jammer4hyvz: go to ship
[3:22:25] actualyipreferchristopher: to infinity and beyond
[3:22:39] FreddieMcBob: don’t hit the ground too hard

[3:26:01] LarsFL: The wither is a boss that you summon with wither skeleton skulls
[3:26:04] FreddieMcBob: ^
[3:26:07] ItzRazzleDazzle: you need 3 wither skulls from the nether then you make a totem to spawn it

[3:26:56] ItzRazzleDazzle: and soul sand
[3:27:04] FreddieMcBob: the torch breaks the gravel that falls on it
[3:27:10] Slimothy_Jimbles: ya been to the end already?
[3:27:31] LarsFL: How deep down are you?
[3:27:40] Slimothy_Jimbles: oh well done
[3:27:47] LarsFL: That's aways up
[3:27:59] Jammer4hyvz: finally all the useless Minecraft knowledge I have is actually working
[3:28:24] FreddieMcBob: no such thing as useless minecraft knowledge it’s all useful
[3:28:33] LarsFL: You can find a pretty place to build by flying around
[3:29:07] Slimothy_Jimbles: time for a paper and gunpowder farm
[3:29:09] Jammer4hyvz: wait mads have you found a nametag yet?
[3:29:26] StreamElements: If you like the stream, don't forget to drop a follow!
[3:29:36] Jammer4hyvz: we shouldn’t tell her what dinnerbone does
[3:29:49] Jammer4hyvz: just tell her to do it
[3:30:03] bashattack: are we winning son?
[3:31:12] LarsFL: I'd definitely be up for a server tho
[3:31:16] TheJok3r95: micromadsClown
[3:31:20] the_g_meister: Wait micromads is bashson???? micromadsGalaxy micromadsGalaxy micromadsGalaxy micromadsGalaxy
[3:31:45] FreddieMcBob: how did you end up getting your ender pearls did the cleric help?
[3:32:05] LarsFL: Could be digging up into a mountain for all we know
[3:32:10] Jammer4hyvz: name a mob dinnerbone with an anvil and nametag
[3:32:23] LarsFL: Usually the surface is at like 40-60 iirc
[3:32:26] StreamElements: <3 MADDIE'S SOCIALS <3 https://allmylinks.com/micromads <3
[3:32:51] LarsFL: micromadsBongo i'm in the mainframe
[3:32:52] the_g_meister: Nah 60 and below is filled with water
[3:32:58] the_g_meister: Usually anyway
[3:33:04] Nafffo: "i'm in"
[3:33:32] the_g_meister: Wish I was in something micromadsGazm
[3:33:47] Slimothy_Jimbles: dosnt hack menu tell you your biome
[3:34:01] topendbuzza: micromadsBonk
[3:34:09] LarsFL: This staircase is gonna be so awful to go down and up KEKW
[3:34:12] LarsFL: You're in forest
[3:34:15] themadone68: forest...
[3:34:24] themadone68: OG biome
[3:34:43] themadone68: that means there is a cave nearby
[3:34:50] LarsFL: I'm getting dizzy
[3:34:51] Croompy: Greetings croompWave
[3:35:01] ItzRazzleDazzle: you have a diamond one
[3:35:26] LarsFL: Fresh air!
[3:35:31] actualyipreferchristopher: wooooooooooooooooooooooooo
[3:35:37] Jammer4hyvz: sulighy
[3:35:38] actualyipreferchristopher: sunlight
[3:35:53] Jammer4hyvz: !wheel
[3:35:54] StreamElements: If you Tier 3 sub, cheer 1500+ bits, tip €10+ or gift 5 subs, Mads will spin the wheel. There are prizes! You can make me wear uwu cat ears or try gross candy! SPIN TO WIN :D
[3:35:58] LarsFL: Maybe make a big ol pillar to mark it
[3:36:16] Croompy: Mobs can spawn with random armor on
[3:36:21] Talimbur: you just killed a dragon, now afraid of skeletons ?
[3:36:48] LarsFL: Okay not so big that you die going down KEKW
[3:37:01] Talimbur: she has an elytra now
[3:37:02] ItzRazzleDazzle: she has wings
[3:37:09] LarsFL: True
[3:37:17] ItzRazzleDazzle: super mads
[3:37:17] Slimothy_Jimbles: gotta out mending on the elytra quick
[3:37:18] Croompy: Could use the water bucket to get down as well
[3:37:32] jimboyung: mads is gaming
[3:37:43] BestSecretPhoenix: Don't be Icarus now LUL
[3:38:12] LarsFL: Means you can't take it off
[3:38:16] Jammer4hyvz: DONT
[3:38:18] Slimothy_Jimbles: cant take it off
[3:38:19] themadone68: a cursed helmet
[3:38:21] Jammer4hyvz: DONT PIT IT ON
[3:38:22] LarsFL: Not unless you die
[3:38:22] Jammer4hyvz: PIT
[3:38:23] Croompy: If you put it on you wont be able to take it off
[3:38:26] KarlAbj: you could die
[3:38:26] Jammer4hyvz: PUT
[3:38:27] Croompy: Unless you die
[3:38:31] KarlAbj: KEKW
[3:38:50] LarsFL: It do be a curse
[3:38:54] LordSupremeKara: Good for pranking people
[3:38:56] Croompy: People use it to prank other people who are afk on servers
[3:38:59] KarlAbj: thats what a curse is
[3:39:01] KarlAbj: :)
[3:39:02] Croompy: Usually using punpkins
[3:39:14] themadone68: could always smelt it down or remove the curse
[3:39:21] tetarchus: Endless staircase micromadsWiggle
[3:39:36] KarlAbj: yea
[3:39:37] LarsFL: Yay dizzyness
[3:39:52] Sarioah: my brain is herokeSPIN
[3:40:23] supertroopcoop24: if you accidentally wear it you can just wear the durability down, and yes for one nugget
[3:40:26] Sarioah: ooooh did you beat the dragon tijkaOmg
[3:40:26] Croompy: Open to tips, or pref doing your own thing?
[3:40:30] Slimothy_Jimbles: you got the portal co-ords written down?
[3:40:36] Sarioah: noice caaYAY
[3:40:40] Croompy: ok
[3:41:11] LarsFL: You have the stuff to make shulker boxes now
[3:42:09] Jammer4hyvz: you can only pick up shulkers with silk touch iirc
[3:42:12] Croompy: its just a regular furnace
[3:42:16] LarsFL: Every minecraft hoarder is screaming
[3:42:33] LarsFL: You don't need silk touch for shulker boxes, only ender chests
[3:42:33] Sarioah: herokeSPIN
[3:42:36] jimboyung: you can use anything for s shulker
[3:42:47] themadone68: @LarsFL I've been doing that all week :)
[3:42:53] LarsFL: You can use your bare hands for shulker boxes if you please
[3:42:59] LarsFL: @themadone68 I feel you
[3:43:02] Croompy: Need silk touch for ender chests
[3:43:32] LarsFL: Vertical travel technology would be beneficial for this staircase
[3:44:31] LarsFL: Is your home base near spawn?
[3:44:32] Croompy: btw you could change the gui scale so it wont cover your entire screen like that
[3:44:37] Croompy: If you pref ofc
[3:45:03] LarsFL: If you break the bed, travel to the end and back, you'll end up at spawn
[3:45:05] Croompy: Like the F3 screen
[3:45:07] LarsFL: So you dont'have to run
[3:45:18] Croompy: Options -> video settings -> GUI
[3:45:23] ItzRazzleDazzle: i think a modded minecraft adventure would be good like the twilight forest or something
[3:45:24] Croompy: I usually keep it at 2
[3:46:36] Croompy: Modded can be overwhelming to people who are not familiar with vanilla
[3:47:01] ItzRazzleDazzle: yeah but twilight forest isnt that confusing tbh
[3:47:17] Croompy: Not as overwhelming, huh?
[3:47:20] Croompy: LUL
[3:47:56] Nafffo: still looks kinda hackerman
[3:47:58] Croompy: Cool. glad i was helpful
[3:48:27] Croompy: I usually type the cords in the in game chat, stays there for the session
[3:48:48] LarsFL: Want to fast travel home?
[3:49:12] Croompy: Not sure why they do the auto to be 4 all the time, its just way too big
[3:49:17] themadone68: she isn't that far away
[3:49:54] Croompy: paper + gunpowder could make you rockets to fly at will
[3:49:56] LarsFL: Towards 0,0
[3:49:58] themadone68: easier just to boat it back
[3:50:16] LarsFL: So many methods of transporation
[3:50:59] Croompy: cave spider king?
[3:51:01] LarsFL: Once you have rockets, exploring is so easy and fun
[3:51:22] ItzRazzleDazzle: fireworks
[3:51:24] naughtynuke: rockets = fireworks LUL
[3:51:27] LarsFL: Not the unalive kind
[3:51:34] ScaredieCrow: this game is too scary
[3:51:43] Croompy: A firework is essentially a rocket
[3:51:48] Sarioah: LUL
[3:51:50] naughtynuke: you use fireworks to take off with the elytra
[3:52:13] LarsFL: It's powered flight, instead of just gliding
[3:52:21] naughtynuke: you go so fast
[3:52:53] naughtynuke: thus why people make creeper farms, so they can make tons of fireworks from the gunpowder
[3:53:24] LarsFL: I do like this hole you've made
[3:53:33] Croompy: Also sugarcane farms for paper
[3:53:35] LarsFL: Nice decorations
[3:53:37] LarsFL: Spacious
[3:53:48] Croompy: You can make a pot to keep it as decoration
[3:53:58] LarsFL: Surely no three trees tho, that'd be crazy
[3:54:24] naughtynuke: true, making flower pots and putting saplings in them look so cool
[3:54:26] LarsFL: D: she's done it
[3:54:45] ItzRazzleDazzle: 3 trees b&b
[3:54:59] naughtynuke: what difficulty are you playing on btw
[3:55:43] naughtynuke: just started my first hardcore run and holy crap is it nerve racking
[3:55:53] LarsFL: O definitely bring some bamboo if you haven't yet
[3:56:16] Croompy: Its biome specific
[3:56:16] naughtynuke: yep
[3:56:21] Croompy: Could be useful
[3:56:32] naughtynuke: bamboo makes scaffolding for big projects
[3:56:40] LarsFL: Makes handy things
[3:56:42] Croompy: Can turn to wood planks
[3:56:44] themadone68: and it is the best fuel source in the game
[3:56:45] Croompy: Or sticks
[3:56:58] LarsFL: Try your sword
[3:56:59] TheJok3r95: not going to lie usually i have killed myself 1-2 times with the elytra by now
[3:57:02] Croompy: 1 is enough to make a farm
[3:57:04] naughtynuke: just get a good stack and you can grow it yourself
[3:57:28] LarsFL: You can just slash around you, it's great fun
[3:57:35] themadone68: it is super fast growing and easily auto-farmed :)
[3:58:05] Croompy: uhhhh
[3:58:09] LarsFL: If you want a goal, sure
[3:58:11] naughtynuke: but yeah it makes scaffolding which makes building big projects a lot less stressfull
[3:58:13] Croompy: Wither is pretty deadly
[3:58:19] Croompy: Could be, but need prep
[3:58:21] renlikekylo: I beg you to summon the wither
[3:58:23] Croompy: Or cheese it
[3:58:26] LarsFL: At this point the world is your oyster
[3:58:32] renlikekylo: just do it faaar far away from your village 💀
[3:58:44] ItzRazzleDazzle: the wither is not straight forward to beat ngl
[3:58:46] Slimothy_Jimbles: need seeds for birb
[3:58:54] themadone68: wither sounds a lot easier than dealing with an ocean monument
[3:59:05] Croompy: take em as pets
[3:59:10] Croompy: They sit on shoulder
[3:59:13] renlikekylo: wither is an icon xo
[3:59:31] Slimothy_Jimbles: just break grass for seeds
[4:00:05] Slimothy_Jimbles: be careful not to break the elytra before you can put mending on it
[4:00:54] LarsFL: Panda!
[4:01:05] Sarioah: it clumsy bear doroAWow
[4:01:22] LarsFL: He should do
[4:01:23] Croompy: drop it  at it
[4:01:37] Croompy: They are rather derpy
[4:01:39] Sarioah: tijkaOmg
[4:01:39] TheJok3r95: hes my fav
[4:01:47] Bunisher: What does a panda do? They eat bamboo. Thats their whole life. Else they die.
[4:01:49] SubZerotd: micromadsShock
[4:01:52] LarsFL: Just a lil guy
[4:01:58] themadone68: could try breeding them?
[4:02:09] tetarchus: @themadone68 Don't be silly LuL
[4:02:10] Croompy: There are different types of pandas
[4:02:21] Croompy: some roll around
[4:02:26] StreamElements: If you like the stream, don't forget to drop a follow!
[4:03:09] LarsFL: I bet those pants smell
[4:03:47] LarsFL: Oooo a coral reef
[4:04:14] Slimothy_Jimbles: which was 0, 0
[4:04:36] LarsFL: I bet your villagers miss you
[4:05:00] LarsFL: And the cats
[4:05:25] ItzRazzleDazzle: sea crimes?
[4:06:03] LarsFL: Minecraft of thieves
[4:07:00] LarsFL: Yea they're stuck in time over there
[4:08:48] LarsFL: It is definitely one of the games
[4:09:16] ItzRazzleDazzle: it is the ultimate sandbox
[4:09:42] LarsFL: It definitely is for me, i've spent hundreds of hours on this
[4:09:46] angelaachan: okay I finally managed to drag myself out of bed and make some food angela89Comfy
[4:09:50] angelaachan: PANDAS
[4:10:06] angelaachan: BABY
[4:10:34] LarsFL: That tree means there's a special underground biome under there
[4:10:40] LarsFL: A very pretty one
[4:10:54] LarsFL: The Lush Caves
[4:11:44] ItzRazzleDazzle: you can cure a zombie villager btw
[4:12:21] Sarioah: stand back tijkaAhh she's got levels
[4:12:21] ItzRazzleDazzle: can you enchant an elytra
[4:12:29] LarsFL: Yea you can put mending and unbreaking on it
[4:12:36] ItzRazzleDazzle: like unbreaking or whatever for example
[4:12:47] ItzRazzleDazzle: nice lars
[4:12:48] TheJok3r95: yes
[4:13:46] LarsFL: Home sweet home!
[4:13:49] angelaachan: home!!
[4:14:01] LarsFL: Are we allowed to call this your base now
[4:14:24] LarsFL: Yay
[4:14:37] Sarioah: did she accidentally base? tijkaLol
[4:14:44] angelaachan: like a real cat
[4:15:19] LarsFL: I'm off to fetch some tea, be back later
