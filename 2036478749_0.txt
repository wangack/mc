[0:25:11] Firefly6985: oh no....
[0:25:14] R2RHIN0: whaaat that crazy
[0:25:15] SylverSword_: 9 chunks only is kinda crazy ngl
[0:25:15] MandaLin: mandal3NOTES they're shrinking the default spawn chunks - there will be a gamerule to adjust it, but hopefully it doesn't mess with yours on update.
[0:25:17] Lekerstein: that's odd. You'd think as time goes on, processing power goes up, so spawn chucks could increase
[0:25:18] Amandroid: @Firefly6985 HypeStress
[0:25:21] R2RHIN0: I don‚Äôt like that change
[0:25:27] lovely_beez: oh snap
[0:25:29] Wickednush: I think your iron farm will be ok... I remember your sand fell on the roof of it so seems centered
[0:25:35] Firefly6985: I usually build my iron farm on the edge...
[0:25:38] MrLanny: To be fair though, it is only really the iron farm that works in spawn chunks right?
[0:25:41] Amandroid: @Wickednush linkzzeyNod
[0:25:45] R2RHIN0: ahh ok that‚Äôs totally fair
[0:25:46] SylverSword_: I feel like older worlds will simply change the gamerule
[0:25:52] Trevski127: honestly i don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs a bad change ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
[0:25:55] Amandroid: ellyyBearGasp yeah, that would mess with a lot of things
[0:26:00] R2RHIN0: agreed. At least they give us the option. props to them
[0:26:03] Daphness: Bummer. My crops won't grow while I am chilling in the area.

[0:27:25] Amandroid: @jjjoe linkzzeyHii
[0:27:29] MandaLin: @moiira_cst gamerules are able to set in world creation now mandal3YES so if you're making a new world you can set it without cheats turned on
[0:27:46] RHC_Frank: but if you want to update your world to a newer version, you have to cheat and go into the lan mode to make the old spawn chunks work
[0:27:47] lovely_beez: i mean sounds like they have good intentions behind it YesYes cant be too upset
[0:27:49] mxkeal_: hello everyone linkzzeyBits
[0:27:49] MrLanny: crops don't grow in spawn chunks
[0:27:52] Firefly6985: They dont... crops need player ticks.
[0:27:54] Amandroid: @mxkeal_ linkzzeyHii
[0:27:57] lovely_beez: @mxkeal_ linkzzeyHii
[0:28:04] its_mr_chickens: hi
[0:28:26] Wickednush: I personally like the change; its a lot of wasted loaded space imo; at least with what I do
[0:28:34] its_mr_chickens: Im 2 days away from following for 1000 days
[0:28:38] lovely_beez: @Wickednush very true YesYes
[0:28:45] R2RHIN0: big fan of player choice. so glad they are giving us a choice
[0:28:56] MrLanny: The reason minecraft is such a good game is because people can play it the way they want to.
[0:28:59] Daphness: Okay, so doesn't affect my crops. Cool. What exactly do they affect, then?
[0:29:19] Abrakaidabra_: spawn chunk cities are gonna become spawn chunk villages linkzzeyGig
[0:29:30] mansketball: so it would be "cheating" if you wanted to change the spawn chunks then?
[0:29:32] its_mr_chickens: i lost it
[0:29:47] SylverSword_: imo the space is big enough with the new 3x3, if you need more farms you can always build vertically
[0:29:50] Firefly6985: @Daphness Mostly just iron farms. Some shulker farms use spawn chunks too.
[0:29:50] R2RHIN0: what all works in spawn chunks a ways? iron farm and bees are the only ones I can think of. possibly turtles?
[0:30:10] MrLanny: Minecraft is so subjective though, it's a sandbox game so people can play the way they want
[0:30:11] MandaLin: @mansketball it will depend on how they make it work on old worlds - if it adjusts it & you have to change it back or if they leave it at the previous default
[0:30:11] Firefly6985: @R2RHIN0 Shulker too
[0:30:12] Wickednush: it might not be cheating when starting a new world; they may do something similar to what they did with fire spread and give you options
[0:30:25] Amandroid: @Wickednush linkzzeyNod and vine spread with the last update
[0:30:38] ChronicSquid: Do you keep backups of the world in case of corruption?
[0:30:38] Wickednush: @Amandroid true Amanda
[0:30:41] Daphness: What does Lan make sketchy?  Sorry, I am still learning stuff.

[0:31:14] steein92: @lovely_beez @Amandroid <3
[0:31:18] Amandroid: @Daphness sketchy for him, because it could call into question the validity of his work
[0:31:23] MandaLin: @Daphness opening to LAN just makes it so you can enable cheats - which then makes anyone question what all you might do with commands/cheats turned on & Link won't do that in his world
[0:31:25] steein92: I am good. How is the Linkzzey Link? :D
[0:31:28] Firefly6985: @Daphness Opening to LAN allows you to turn cheats on, then your HC world is "suspect"

[0:33:57] Daphness: lol  It doesn't bother me. But I set cheats on at the beginning, so don't have to open to Lan.  Did that in the first world, which was a pain in the neck!
[0:34:13] Amandroid: linkzzeyNod that's what I do in my worlds, too
[0:34:16] Firefly6985: streaming is a slightly different beast, but for us normies as long as youre willing to admit that you do it, its not cheating.
[0:34:45] lovely_beez: i mean its called cheats for a reason linkzzeyGig

[0:47:29] mansketball: that's super lucky
[0:47:33] Daphness: This will mean only part of some of my villages will be active. Is it going to mess up my villagers?
[0:47:34] lovely_beez: @dacoolkid2328  welcome in! linkzzeyHug
[0:47:37] Wickednush: and same with the moss farm in it too... good stuff

[0:47:57] billboein: you can just make it bigger if need to anyway taneeshaElf
[0:48:29] MandaLin: I'm reading the notes mandal3NOTES sorry - looks like the setting of 2 that they list makes it 3 chunks by 3 chunks like you said - because each chunk is 16
[0:48:29] Amandroid: linkzzeyGig you've got loads of moss, you should be fine
[0:48:49] ramabamajama: That means all of my villagers will not be good. Uh oh linkzzeyPout

[0:49:17] Firefly6985: @rammomma I dont think you want villagers in your spawn chunks anyway...
[0:49:18] MandaLin: no a chunk is 16 blocks - so if it's 48 across that's 3 chunks included in the default
[0:49:18] lovely_beez: @ItChili linkzzeyHii
[0:49:19] Amandroid: @ItChili linkzzeyHii

[5:59:42] BlitzzeyMC: Cheer50  So, my wife works in real estate. Couple nights ago at dinner I told her I was in love with a building and she jumped right on it, asking where it was and if I knew it was for sale, because adding estate to their portfolios is a major part of the job, right? You should've seen the look on her face when I said "it's my ascension on Link's world, and I believe it's not, nor will it ever be, for sale!". My oldest kid found it pretty funny. I didn't get dessert.
