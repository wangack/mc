[0:45:19] StandaSK: I prefer AMD, but honestly they're not that different
[0:45:22] gingerninja143: depends on multiple factors
[0:45:23] Justrepsaj: Yea
[0:45:23] gaymersalsa: Applecatrun
[0:45:24] Stanbroek: more like fanboys
[0:45:24] willsly123: It used to be a bigger difference but they're quite similar now
[0:45:25] FearMyLittlePony: yep
[0:45:25] Attackeight: yea
[0:45:25] TaxxEvader: yes
[0:45:27] EVO_Gaming6000: Intel is better if ur streaming while gaming
[0:45:27] MP_Hazard: just solder the amd on top of the nvidia
[0:45:29] PiTo_27_: YEP
[0:45:30] khanngi: AMD is cheaper init?
[0:45:30] schambagaming: normally AMD stays on the same socket for longer
[0:45:30] Mynestyne: Whatever you can get for your budget tbh
[0:45:31] ido_katz: etho
[0:45:31] ViciTheTenorOon: I like Intel cause AMD seems like AND spelled wrong
[0:45:31] kinghingle: ehhh,, AMD atm in general for gaming is stronger
[0:45:33] Feddy84: Intel is a more stable system, so if gaming is your business then go Intel, for a regular consumer go amd
[0:45:33] Wako110: yep all preference
[0:45:35] ChapDawg_: In straight up gaming AMD price to performance is way better
[0:45:37] r3dhead97: Etho!

[0:45:44] EVO_Gaming6000: AMD is just gaming
[0:45:44] gaymersalsa: ethoMAN
[0:45:49] xkyrax010: amd has more upgrade path

[0:45:55] sharkastic_shark: Amd can be better at multitasking but with enough money either are fine
[0:45:56] N8JUMPER: amd has better price per component ratios on average for performance, and intel has stated they’re changing to a new socket soon
[0:45:57] notTheRealHelmis: it’s like apples and oranges - they’re completely different but let’s be real they’re both fruit you ignore in the fruit bowl
[0:45:59] Garnail20: some professional progams like one or the other better. So it mostly depends on the programs you use.
[0:46:00] schm0li: Amd is better performance/prize i think
[0:46:05] PiTo_27_: ethoMAN
[0:46:10] EVO_Gaming6000: Intel is better for multitasking like gaming while streaming
[0:46:11] GetAWarrant: I like AMD, but when I built my current computer Intel was the better option for what I was building.
[0:46:17] kinghingle: well in 5 years u'l be able to just drop in a new CPU rather than do 'the lot' again with AMD more than likely
[0:46:25] RobUrHood: How often do you upgrade your cell phone?

[0:46:54] wendymoto: oof
[0:46:55] EVO_Gaming6000: Lol

[0:46:59] mahik750: Maybe it overheated
[0:46:59] rosashaywire333: Noo!! I got 4 ad's in a row!

[1:11:30] Niko_993: if you play a lot, you pick up on these.

[1:12:25] LaplaceDemon2k: Don't want to spam, could one of the mods, maybe salsa share it with iskall later on DMs that he can talk to life series folks (Grian/Etho/Scar/others?) about merch since they did a drop?   Also, if he needs a supplier in India, I can get my corporate one since I do a lot of t-shirts and other merch for my work events.
[1:12:28] Baab83: Would be cool you get a challange that fits the theme
[1:12:29] pazkooda: Chat, iskall85: if I were to start a Vault Hunter journey where I could fine a good, comprehensive Guide for most useful mechanics? Best in form of video tutorials (for my kids).
[1:12:31] brentos777: I don't think I ever would have thought about there being thematic differences, but once you think about it you can see it and its cool
[1:12:35] impossible_321: get the wrong challange and u can just give up

[1:12:57] kinghingle: will there ever be a resource to record/find out all this information about mob rates or vault charateristics?
[1:12:58] ChapDawg_: A bestiary for themes in game like a book would be helpful, like it reveals what their specifications are (as such) once you've been in one, like they start of as unknown
[1:13:02] ShelobsLair_: @LaplaceDemon2k Thanks for the gift sub!
[1:13:02] gaymersalsa: @laplace i can remind him in dms later today, thanks!

[1:13:05] Niko_993: there is
[1:13:10] Permarin1: @iskall85 hey there. i just wanted to ask you about the vault time. would it be possible to add a command, like how you do the arcade mode style, to increase the time from 25 min to more? (asking because of disability. recently a family member and i played this together, but they struggled because of their limitations within just the 25 min, and it took some of the fun out of it for them)
[1:13:16] PiTo_27_: @pazkooda it's not video but you can find the community docs on discord
[1:13:17] Niko_993: you kill slimes for that objective

[1:14:01] breadbust: So, while difference are nice and all, I do feel cheated even focusing them sometimes, this being a good example of why

[2:41:35] TheDeluxe98: So why was the factory changed? It used to be so amazing with the puzzle in the middle
[2:41:40] j1nnnxxx: do we  get some gold back if i reset?
[2:41:44] InterPlay02: Aren't you afraid that your armor set might break? The durability is low.
[2:41:44] Lakosius2: @Lakosius2 its also super relaxing to turn on music and mindlessly Mine the overworld for a few hours
[2:41:46] zebrainap: do the rooms stay the same if you reset it???

[2:42:01] redstonedad: Good morning Iskall and Dylans
[2:42:08] Permarin1: @iskall85 on that paradox map, cant you add the "border" as the non opened rooms? if its always going to be the same god, then you always know what the "next" room god is and where it will be in the vault?
[2:42:08] Nightbot: Everything in VH 1.18 is very under development & things might change.. Just Trust the Process-- iskall & Devs
[2:42:09] nystadt: Will you run it now?

[3:06:09] buny1p_: I thought the armor was gonna look more knightly but didnt imagine it would be like an Angel Durid
[3:06:10] LaplaceDemon2k: @ShelobsLair_ he meant his lair

[3:06:48] Oo_rjit: u good at chess ???
[3:06:49] Garnail20: are the robot and boogie coming back for bosses?
[3:06:50] ChapDawg_: @baka_raion_hato_31 Yeah sure the reward could be changed for sure, maybe random would be best for the excitement on not knowing the reward
[3:06:51] Lakosius2: ahh , more Progression Breakpoints is good
[3:06:52] 999nightmare999: Boogeyman comes back wooooo
[3:06:53] elgreki: the return of the boogeyman!!
[3:06:56] linx80: @Lakosius2 Ok, that I get, but is leveling up the only thing to get to platinum trophy or is the amount of vaults you loot?
[3:06:56] lavacandy1: iskall
[3:07:02] costalboy: @nija0dragon life leach
[3:07:03] Luxi86: Conversing chambers
[3:07:07] nija0dragon: tyyy
[3:07:10] siriusmarks: Can you auto feed the sweets cake?
[3:07:16] plantcraftie: what does telegraphed combat mean?
[3:07:19] lwt1: when you end stream why dont you go raid coconut tim ?
[3:07:19] costalboy: All g
[3:07:20] sobhan1771: dark souls? boring?
[3:07:22] Marknu: "learn the mechanic" combat
[3:07:26] Lakosius2: @linx80 the Platinum Trophy is if you get to lv 100 and fight the End Boss
[3:07:33] Luxi86: hryYimmy raid me
[3:07:34] Lakosius2: And do it fast

[3:07:34] buny1p_: @iskall85 I thought the armor was gonna look more knightly but didnt imagine it would be like an Angel Durid
[3:07:37] witherguyofdoom: What if you make boss rooms have certain advantages for players and bosses
[3:07:37] redstonedad: Time pffft you don't need sleep just create free content for us lol jk jk
[3:07:38] plantcraftie: @Marknu thanks! yeah i don't like that
[3:07:38] Ferdster02: @siriusmarks You can auto feed the small sweets, not the blocks since you need to interact with them to eat them
[3:07:56] linx80: @Lakosius2 Ok, thanks! But is the game finished after that?
[3:08:01] Glossah: I have a memory of a goldfish, I don’t like telegraphed combat games KPOPTT
[3:08:04] andyketogymi: Love it
[3:08:04] baka_raion_hato_31: @ChapDawg_  in any casse i trust iskal to  play but when it come to déving he's  with a wonsderfull team ;.... i gess time is off the essence
[3:08:07] Night2315: telegraphed combat isnt bad in games designed around it, but as a partial design its a bit awkward
[3:08:12] milanvdzanden: Love all but the sword honestly
[3:08:12] PiggyKillerQ: telegraphed fights are good, but in a lower animation style of minecraft its way less good
[3:08:14] cozmo42: Dairy Princess
[3:08:15] buny1p_: it looks good
[3:08:17] jk6006: What do other ones look like?
[3:08:19] k_62256: looks really cool but it more yellow than green
[3:08:20] kibaz_x: It's wonderful
[3:08:20] lickingwolf: I havent seen the other one's
[3:08:22] Lakosius2: @linx80 Nope beating the Boss opens up the Post Game content
[3:08:22] AdenMck: it looks nothing like I expected either, but love it, looks awesome
[3:08:22] pepa1d: you can try black rune on the armor
[3:08:24] Ferdster02: Did you flex your armor at XB yet
[3:08:30] banditben: wendarr is more like a knight, my personal favorite

[3:10:12] nitchipa: How does Dylans feel today
[3:10:16] MarkDatter: @mossycomet cdr = cooldown reduction

[3:10:46] chuckleslaughed: run braziers and look for the dungeon modifier
[3:10:47] noninja5: 230 daily wow
[3:10:47] 64_Bit_Cake: @mossycomet is someone unconscious sir?!
[3:10:49] stizzet: You need a new hammer

[3:11:33] BaldBover: He expressed a lot of guilt/regret about his performance on this HC VH season on his latest podcast.
[3:11:35] Zaraca90: Iskall there was a error with your gold
[3:11:44] cozmo42: I’m focused on their buttocks
[3:11:50] basman333: 404
[3:11:51] greiff13: is there a plan for when the update could be released?

[3:11:56] Tjidobo: Only 2 not making it is pag!
[3:11:57] Therank2100: Oh jesus is that the Velara armour transmog?
[3:12:00] kibaz_x: Ooo
[3:12:04] LaplaceDemon2k: i'm also focused on everyone's buttocks
[3:12:06] baka_raion_hato_31: yep
[3:12:07] Glossah: I wonder if Iskall is going to make it to the Finale hmmm
[3:12:10] knightrali: As a die hard impulse viewer, I am proud of what he was able to do as his first real modded series. He will feel bad enough not making it to the final, just celebrate the ones that made it and maybe try not to obsess over waht he did/didn't do. He's a guy thats super hard on himself for no reason. Be Kind Dylans.
[3:12:13] Lakosius2: @phillykd11 That is planned
[3:12:15] andyketogymi: ofcourse
[3:12:20] 0laz_: i have loved all the streams in prep of the final vault!
[3:12:30] 64_Bit_Cake: disagree strongly

[3:12:47] sambhavsam: We need a stompa build for fun
[3:12:51] KJAERB0: Will there be a video with the build?
[3:12:54] cozmo42: chat what is a stompa build?

[3:13:43] andyketogymi: @empcatligula iDunno
[3:13:46] thatfunnyyt: where did he go
[3:13:52] Oo_rjit: @jatt_desi woww chill man
[3:13:53] lynx6008: Nobody is going for the healer build that's the most interesting builds
[3:14:02] Glossah: vodskall has been keeping my sanity in check. Thank you for committing to another channel! @iskall85

[3:14:04] Kasszi_: yeah i always have to quit what im doing to pay attention lol
[3:14:09] knightrali: I only mention because of the constant questions asking if he will make it. I know his mindset and he hates letting people down. No ones been not nice, just food for thought.
[3:14:11] Luxi86: peepoLeave
[3:14:13] buny1p_: @iskall85  Shouldnt you put green runes on the armor

[3:14:21] andyketogymi: Iskall leaving us stopbeingMean
[3:14:21] littlepepperbutt: iskHeart iskHeart iskHeart
[3:14:28] zivziv5: Cheer100 Idea, what if when you stuck a god affinity over 100% you would get more time to do the quest
[3:14:34] basman333: vodskall has made me obssessed with VH and youtube
[3:14:38] Klinten__: byeskall
[3:14:40] yeeoldenvelope: Thanks so much for the stream iskall.
[3:14:42] 64_Bit_Cake: is that not bonne's mod

[3:14:48] javi123vega: iskHeart
[3:14:48] Ferdster02: @lynx6008 What would that look like? max group heal + Regen totem + spirit Totem on potion or something? Maybe Empower for a speed boost for the rest?

[3:15:20] novanay88: lmao
[3:15:21] jatt_desi: @oo_rjit what happened brother i m just curious about armour vod.
[3:15:21] dcstophy: Hey Whant Is This mod or modpack
[3:15:23] eXQyu_: isnt that already in the game?
[3:15:26] PiggyKillerQ: another idea, fruits could extend the time to complete god quests and vault time, giving a tradeoff of health for more time, a mini greed
[3:15:26] xoMommySiren: I’m good iskall as always fighting MS. but loving this series as always. iskHeart iskHeart iskHeart
[3:15:26] jmommers98: @Ferdster02 bwooo
