[0:28:32] Larklen: Contract being contested doesnt change much for SpaceX since they developing outta their own funds, just likely gonna push back the Lunar schedule....which likely was gonna get pushed back anyways

[0:38:58] deathlover22: Steve has all the knowledge of the world and is able to rebuild civilization. Villagers are just the primitive species that need to learn to do what he can do

[1:15:27] ticket2hell88: @Warkless i have that as well and i just stand up and take the one on my desk back to bad and turn it off
[1:15:31] SnoLys: @Warkless i needed to start doing that for important things
[1:15:33] Apparentthreat: I have to get out of bed to turn off two alarms. When I get up to turn off the first, I turn off the second before it even goes off bc I don’t want to deal with it going off KEKW
[1:15:39] Adayics: Thats why i place my phone on the other side of the room when I have an alarm so I physically have to get up xD

[1:16:00] scumbag_pigeon: i always wake up 5 to 10 mins b4 my alarm goes off
[1:16:05] Stickster42: you should get one of those alarms that drop eggs or balls on the floor and you have to go hunting for them before you can switch it off
[1:16:07] scumbag_pigeon: even if i dont try to
[1:16:13] Apparentthreat: change the times for your alarms by a few minutes. It’ll fuck you up

[1:17:08] n8level: @ttocsified put a light on a timer in your room to go off 5 or 10min before youre normal alarm, will work like a charm
[1:17:18] Warkless: NODDERS 🤏 Little power
[1:17:27] CallofDuty_Monster: maybe add 1 tier upgrades on them?
[1:17:27] omega_prime__: I got one of those programable coffee makers that has a cup ready every day at 7:30 when my alarms go off. Good way to ensure when I stand up to turn them off I stay standing
[1:17:38] hankthedoggamer: @giantwaffle do you think people would enjoy streams of Gamecube games?

[1:24:29] PureSpider: what
[1:24:31] Nexhunter: you are just being dumb KEKW
[1:24:33] Idez: There are strings in Java
[1:24:35] aledantee: you are dumb
[1:24:37] Akiron_rafa: why not?
[1:24:38] BurnedAether: You can use strings. They are just a bit weirder than c#
[1:24:38] PureSpider: very dumb
[1:24:41] BurnedAether: in some ways
[1:24:42] Apparentthreat: v dumb
[1:24:50] WGG25: there are strings in java
[1:24:54] Apparentthreat: @Giantwaffle do you know what semaphores are yet
[1:24:56] kaeedo: in java there's a difference between int and Integer
[1:24:58] Apparentthreat: KEKW
[1:25:01] n8level: where did you hear you cant use strings?
[1:25:02] xfrozev2: When is your modpack coming out @Giantwaffle
[1:25:03] DigitallyAdmiringHumanity: @Giantwaffle is that an actual fireplace behind you or is that a monitor with a fireplace screensaver?
[1:25:06] Nexhunter: java is just a bullshit language that needs to die cause FUCK ORACLE uhnRee
[1:25:08] ecnerw4l: i think u gotta use string.equals and shit
[1:25:11] ecnerw4l: == doesn't work or whatever
[1:25:14] xfrozev2: @dpmarag0ni monitor lol
[1:25:16] Flobu_: is there a language where strings a not weird?

[1:25:23] Royal_TRC: how does no strings ever make sense
[1:25:24] TelRehiad: strings are an actual class rather than a base type in java so stuff gets strange
[1:25:24] Apparentthreat: Nexhunter openjdk YEP
[1:25:28] Nexhunter: @PureSpider Oracle allows it to exist still fuck java
[1:25:33] PureSpider: igaSus
[1:25:35] DigitallyAdmiringHumanity: @xfrozev2 but why?
[1:25:40] Nexhunter: also AdoptOpenJDK
[1:25:48] BodyshotsAllDay: theres a string class in c# too
[1:25:48] PureSpider: java puts food on my table and pays for my mortgage, Nexhunter lewSmile
[1:25:55] jegkanikkelidetwitch: yea its an array of char's
[1:25:55] TelRehiad: because java
[1:25:57] xfrozev2: @xfrozev2 its comfy ? idk
[1:26:00] BurnedAether: Strings are just arrays of characters and java doesn't do anything to help that. so you can't do `string x = "hi"; if (x == "hi")
[1:26:08] Apparentthreat: strings are literally just char arrays so...
[1:26:08] PureSpider: no
[1:26:08] ecnerw4l: like mystring.equals(yourstring) or some shit
[1:26:08] thuniffe: in java == compares the references not the content of the strings
[1:26:10] BurnedAether: No
[1:26:13] ExcelsiorVFX: Yeah you can't
[1:26:14] TelRehiad: nope
[1:26:14] Nexhunter: @PureSpider java makes me want to die dealing with bullshit from the devs in india for my work
[1:26:16] Nexhunter: danBlank
[1:26:17] Apparentthreat: no. you have to make a copy function
[1:26:18] BurnedAether: string1.Equals(string2);
[1:26:19] kaeedo: strings in C# are also a reference type, but the compiler treats them differently
[1:26:19] LinearLayer: Theyre diff objects
[1:26:21] Flobu_: isnt it ===
[1:26:22] PureSpider: Nexhunter LOL
[1:26:23] Igneous3: double knot bunny ears

[1:26:36] Nexhunter: @PureSpider like they just make giant try catch blocks danBlank
[1:26:37] aledantee: chat stop making shit up, strings are singletons
[1:26:41] ecnerw4l: ye like i said earlier xD that u were confused
[1:26:42] sliderspy: use .equal()
[1:26:45] BurnedAether: Yup. Otherwise it does an address comparison. And strings are kind of weird.
[1:26:46] Idez: === is JS
[1:26:47] PureSpider: no, === is js
[1:26:48] BurnedAether: === is JS
[1:26:50] ExcelsiorVFX: No, === is a JS thing
[1:26:51] Nexhunter: triple equal is javascript stuff
[1:27:05] Nexhunter: and that is strict equality
[1:27:09] Nexhunter: in JS
[1:27:10] CocoScruff: Java !== JavaScript

[1:29:49] JacobSolo: bearded dev checking in ;) Can confirm
[1:29:50] trevh5: That's because a lot of them moved away to work remotely

[1:30:03] andthrax: correlation does not equal causation
[1:30:04] Cozmo300: as a company i would want people to work from home. less office space needed
[1:30:04] Larklen: My company has pretty much said we'll stick with WFH after COVID PogChamp
[1:30:05] Aurielli: my company already said we're going into 3D WFH after covid

[1:30:22] SpiderQueen7202: The commute and the cost of living near campuses
[1:30:23] TelRehiad: my work is allowing people to work 1/2 from home now which was a complete 180 from before.
[1:30:28] WGG25: commute is long, and it's not paid. fuck that

[1:30:40] Nobody0532: Nexhunter I see

[3:29:11] daemonaedryn: Doomp it
[3:29:19] pppiks: Did you succeed with reactor?
[3:29:24] MiraPacku: dümp it?
[3:29:51] Valentin_PV: Have you seen Creaks? It's a new puzzle game by the devs of Machinarium and it's really well made
[3:30:26] Trucker_Torpedo: nullifiers will help
[3:30:27] babyaddalyn: if tanks is full pipe will get stuck
[3:30:28] daemonaedryn: Cant you upgrade the tank? or is it max upgraded?
[3:30:42] daemonaedryn: On jungle wood
[3:30:45] R_U_S1rius: on jungle trees
[3:30:52] Igneous3: looked like helium in that soup pipe
[3:30:54] daemonaedryn: Log* sorry
[3:30:56] StOrMy1100: Not even minecraft
[3:31:04] Trucker_Torpedo: i think you need the filters tho, cause you have helium in the pipe between the neutron soup tank and the neutron electrolyzer
[3:31:20] R_U_S1rius: KEKW
[3:31:21] daemonaedryn: LUL
[3:31:26] kisudawisu: i played a really good puzzle game called superliminal on epic games its very well made
[3:31:31] MrBubbahut: does the reactor not produce enough power to run the arc thingy?
[3:31:35] MiraPacku: what's the dümp it emote called?
[3:31:45] R_U_S1rius: can you drag from JEI?
[3:31:49] Allmostdone: Allmostdone subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 14 months, currently on a 11 month streak! This is legal stalking
[3:32:11] daemonaedryn: waffleD it worked in manufactio, maybe its fucky because its technically a gas?
[3:32:17] Trucker_Torpedo: its reversed, you get helium out of the left and neutrium out of the right
[3:32:39] Kuhlnoggin: it was fine the first time but your pipes still had residual gas causing them to break I believe
[3:32:39] Trucker_Torpedo: thats why the filters dont work
[3:32:47] babyaddalyn: bucket should work but the gas might have gotten stuck in pipe, also you can use one output and use nearest first setting on servo
[3:32:56] Trucker_Torpedo: switch and bait the whitelists
[3:33:01] babyaddalyn: wait better idea use retrievers
[3:33:44] SjetCraft: I always thought buckets worked as well
[3:33:48] MiraPacku: BigBrain
[3:33:55] MiraPacku: 5Head
[3:34:05] Trucker_Torpedo: you also have helium between the neutron soup tank and the electrolyzer

[3:34:36] RodriCraft93: neutron fluid
[3:34:39] Evoti: why dont you use fluit conduit (old ender io)
[3:34:45] babyaddalyn: disconect in the middle
[3:35:14] Trucker_Torpedo: you also have helium between the neutron soup tank and the electrolyzer
[3:35:51] Evoti: why dont you use fluid conduit (old ender io)??
[3:35:58] LittleAddictions: are there other tanks you can use?
[3:36:02] Sander20011: there is helium in the pipe
[3:36:15] RodriCraft93: helium in pipe
[3:36:29] airforce9000: 5Head
[3:36:59] Sander20011: Ah, okey. now I get it
[3:37:01] Soul_Synergy: Is there some sort of fluid trashcan?
[3:37:06] Evoti: easy to fix with fluid conduit
[3:37:14] boomerbrown: make them in a line and it will put the right fluid in each
[3:37:17] DecoyOcelot: could build a nullifier
[3:37:27] boltzmanC: @Giantwaffle pretty sure you can shift right click the face of the tanks to lock them
[3:37:29] daemonaedryn: Are there any gas-specfic pipes? Might work better
[3:37:29] SjetCraft: Ended IO conduit filters allow you to drag from JEI
[3:37:31] babyaddalyn: ya cause proberly the other retriever is taking it
[3:37:37] babyaddalyn: but if that tank is full... :p
[3:37:41] SjetCraft: *Ender IO
[3:37:46] Slumpking14: I haven’t been on your stream for like 4 years and just wanted to say that your beard looks amazing
[3:37:57] R_U_S1rius: use a nullifier to void the helium
[3:38:06] WoofWoofDude: are you sure it's not working properly but dince you had helium in the pipe already it felt like it didn't filter
[3:38:12] Kyrogenicc: Finally saved up enough to buy another pc since I had to get rid of mine can’t wait to try this mod pack out looks like so much fun
[3:38:15] CallofDuty_Monster: Giantwaffle why not put a tank down then filter from there???

[4:43:24] Honeth: Waffle depends on what you are trying to create, you could use Scala instead of java if you'd want
[4:43:26] subfin: kotlin is java__
[4:43:27] Ladon_Dragon: You can use Kotlin
[4:43:28] subfin: java++
[4:43:29] AtchTwoOh: learn c to develop for bedrock KEKW
[4:43:33] Ladon_Dragon: cause it combiles to Java bytecode
[4:43:34] kaeedo: kotlin runs on the JVM just like java. there's a nunch of mods written in kotlin
[4:43:35] MrHashbrowns: KEKLEO
[4:43:35] Aurielli: maybe allocate the first two hours of stream for coding?
[4:43:36] mitsuki_11: enable emote only chat. KEKW
[4:43:38] Overkrow: Kotlin is better java, which is interoperable with java
[4:43:41] LayWastedd: just use a ferrari 4Head
[4:43:59] InTheLittlePro: just change .cpp to .java KEKW
[4:44:01] lange__: Personally i think its very entertaining to watch you program. But if u is getting burned out i get that aswell
[4:44:02] FroZenThai: Brainstorm a modpack, and start by making small parts of it?
[4:44:03] Warkless: research gachiBASS
[4:44:05] MisterZero_: Yeah, Kotlin is a great language
[4:44:07] Ladon_Dragon: and yeah it's SO much better than java lol
[4:44:11] Honeth: has a computer infront of him and uses pen and paper what a guy
[4:44:15] MisterZero_: With all the support for Java libraries
[4:44:26] d0peinc: If you know c#, java is easy af its oop @giantwaffle
[4:44:27] Arimil: JetBrains makes Kotlin.
[4:44:27] KekMannetje: kotlin is made by jetbrains
[4:44:28] Riddixdan: intallij
[4:44:30] Sanduckchan: net beans?
[4:44:33] EZL1190: IntelIj
[4:44:33] MisterZero_: Jetbrains is the maker of Kotlin
[4:44:34] Sevrene: You know he's serious when he gets real paper instead of his notepad
[4:44:34] KekMannetje: intellij is the IDE
[4:44:36] Ladon_Dragon: Jetbrains MADE Kotlin
[4:44:37] Zunderz: jetbrains intellij Idea
[4:44:38] Ladon_Dragon: so yes
[4:44:38] kaeedo: jetbrains is the company behind itelliJ as well as kotlin
[4:44:39] QuesoBad0nga: netbeans, eclipse
[4:44:43] Arimil: yes
[4:44:44] thepolaroidbear: IntelliJ is v nice
[4:44:44] EZL1190: yeah
[4:44:49] n8level: is there a performance hit for using kotlin for mod dev compared to just java?
[4:44:51] Arimil: and intellij idea works with kotlin
[4:45:17] Ladon_Dragon: yup
[4:45:17] MisterZero_: Yes
[4:45:20] KekMannetje: no kotlin spits out JVM bytecode
[4:45:28] Ladon_Dragon: no performance hit no
[4:45:30] Zunderz: super viable, performance is the same, because java and kotlin goes to bytcode
[4:45:53] lange__: There are just a lot of rules when making a mod for minecraft, i got burned out from it becuz of that
[4:46:02] Aurielli: thats pretty good
[4:46:03] Melinkie: what tutorials/programs did you use to first get into coding?
[4:46:14] Arimil: Kotlin just has a bunch of nice syntax that makes it so you can write less code to do the same thing.
[4:46:26] Warkless: PogChamp 8RF! efen your reactor can handle that PogChamp Clap
[4:46:44] Wozatron256: you have snow
[4:46:51] Wozatron256: next to blizz stuff

[4:47:31] Arimil: It's not less efficient.
[4:47:31] babyaddalyn: cryotium room has snowbals
[4:47:41] MisterZero_: The language is better
[4:47:41] Arimil: It's more efficient if anything.
[4:47:45] mechoriet: i think it the same but compiled different with the same outcome
[4:47:45] Ladon_Dragon: It's better tbh, cause for one Kotlin is null safe
[4:47:47] kaeedo: You know how C# has properties? Java doesn't
[4:47:48] MisterZero_: Faster to write in kotlin than in Java
[4:47:50] Overkrow: Kotlin is just less boilerplate
[4:47:50] kaeedo: kotlin does
[4:47:50] Ladon_Dragon: so no null pointers :p
[4:47:53] Zunderz: i think you can call java classes no problem
[4:48:04] MisterZero_: And generated code is still compiled to jar files
[4:48:18] mechoriet: @Ladon_Dragon yeah but minecraft is not null safe
[4:48:45] Ladon_Dragon: true, but your own code is, so you can't accidentally fuck that up

[4:52:32] daemonaedryn: waffleSad
[4:52:33] subfin: kotlin is fundamentally better than java, but honestly will be harder since its newer so there are less guides. its also debatably a less attractive skill for getting a job (if you care) because few companies have adopted it
[4:52:55] daemonaedryn: Sounds like a rabbit hole.

[5:09:09] metalwrath22222: worst part of my life is my twenties
[5:09:36] Graemett_: the weird thing about stocks is the money you gain isn't really yours, you made a bet, and won. you didn't produce or add any value to the system
[5:09:43] Xeno43: if you save 1k a year from 20-30, and never save another dollar, you will at 65 have more money than someone who starting at 30 put in 1k a year until 65
[5:09:58] katiepearson13: I🤗🤗
[5:10:09] Xeno43: due to compounding interest
[5:10:13] mihil99: idk the pressure to make money is pretty high as well, first years in college have linkedik and start networking already, we just want to buy a house some day lol
[5:10:31] SauceHCCD: whats your power source for your machinery in this world?
[5:10:32] KekMannetje: that's assuming interest is not 0% like we have in europe
[5:10:34] Xeno43: (assuming 7% gains a year) on yes etfs
[5:10:36] DDelve: yeah pure interests
[5:10:52] OverclockedPC: compound interest is crazy
[5:11:00] Xeno43: 4% is withdrawal rate
[5:11:01] OverclockedPC: 6% is average?
[5:11:05] MisterZero_: 4-6% max
[5:11:09] boowoo: ^^^
[5:11:10] Aurielli: can you make charcoal into coal?
[5:11:11] boowoo: what they said
[5:11:11] Ladon_Dragon: 6 to 7 is about average
[5:11:12] OverclockedPC: 4% is conservative but what i would use
[5:11:13] Solitude411: 4-6% is normal
[5:11:16] boowoo: 7 is like
[5:11:18] Xeno43: since 1910 stock market has averaged 10%
[5:11:20] boowoo: benchmark but its usually not there
[5:11:43] kisudawisu: are coal blocks faster in the coke ovens?
[5:11:45] SauceHCCD: whats your power source for your machinery in this world?
[5:11:45] BrewCat1215: SamJam1215 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 60 months! 
[5:11:58] n8level: to be real, most of us will be working well into "retirement age"
[5:12:04] boowoo: and usually it starts losing momentum after bout 3-6 years
[5:12:05] OverclockedPC: our markets are so different now
[5:12:16] boowoo: so true
[5:12:20] barbsfury: it depends
[5:12:20] mittensthekillerbunny: monkaS
[5:12:23] OverclockedPC: markets also do not indicate economic health at all
[5:12:27] kaos4666: they keep printing money man
[5:12:42] savageshanks: I think the opportunity cost of enjoying my 20's is not worth just having that money making me more. I play games which are free seeing as I bought them as a teen, but as soon as you understand finances why not take control?
[5:12:43] ItsOnMax: You dont have to worry about the flash floods?
[5:12:49] n8level: advancement of medicine -- if you can afford it
[5:13:00] TheMeowstardCat: stock market will crash another depression is coming within 10-15 years I say.
[5:13:04] KekMannetje: if 'regular' currencies devaluate your investments get worth more right?
[5:13:16] boowoo: "economics since the 1970s are consumers getting credits without wages increasing"
[5:13:18] TheMeowstardCat: I do not follow stocks or anything just a huge ass eco bubble that is going to pop
[5:13:20] boowoo: :P
[5:13:32] M1k3D3l7a: The house bubble is insane
[5:13:38] Unkn0wn_Nam3: For real a house up the street sold before it went on the  market
[5:13:42] n8level: as the realestate people say, you can make more people, you cant make more land
[5:13:58] kaos4666: 2008 was partialy a hause bubble
[5:13:59] DarkKirara: I am currently trying to sell my house before the bubble pops
[5:14:00] boowoo: yeah... dude but honestly... if you get eons to pay back your debt... is it even a debt anymore??? lol
[5:14:04] katiepearson13: 🖕
[5:14:05] theplummer92: bought a house in november 2020 and it was a pain multiple offers we got lucky they picked ours really.
[5:14:05] DrHax_: I read today that theyre insanely overvaluing houses in flood regions in NA, which doesnt sound great when it comes to global warming etc
[5:14:10] OverclockedPC: lumber is literally 3 times the cost
[5:14:11] barbsfury: not in belgium
[5:14:12] boowoo: bidens plans bails out home owners, doesnt help w housing prices
[5:14:15] M1k3D3l7a: prices here up like 20%-50% because of rona
[5:14:21] mechoriet: just make another useless reactor KEKW
[5:14:24] Doomwyte: @Giantwaffle every house in my neighborhood that has gone up for sale int he last 10 years has been turned into a rental its stupid
[5:14:32] Unkn0wn_Nam3: true lumber and concrete is insane atm too
[5:14:35] Nilau: YEP
[5:14:38] Solitude411: parents bought a house and in the past 4 months they have been getting offers of like 60
[5:14:42] d0peinc: I just bought a house in june 2020 my house is already « worth » a 100k more
[5:14:44] Solitude411: % over what they paid
[5:14:45] OverclockedPC: houses around us have 2 to 3 times in the last 3 years
[5:14:54] boowoo: bidens trying to encourage money flow with renovated houses, increased neighborhood values, more property purchases...
[5:14:55] savageshanks: the rich get richer
[5:15:03] boowoo: yepppp
[5:15:10] boowoo: its fucked up
[5:15:16] OverclockedPC: damnnnn
[5:15:17] boowoo: the card youre dealt matters so much lol
[5:15:22] OverclockedPC: fixed?
[5:15:22] TheMeowstardCat: @Giantwaffle I think COVID with the whole Economy was the first start of it. A lot of places lost money and people are literally not able to afford jack crap and even took major credits out during it. A lot tapped into their savings as well.
[5:15:22] sonorantoad: The housing market is mafia. Sad part is that it’s not going anywhere. Speculative investing and the influx of rental properties has ruined the market. Take the land pill it’s never too late to go innawoods
[5:15:23] n8level: buying your second house is the hardest, it gets easy after that -- but most of us cant even afford to buy a condo
[5:15:27] mittensthekillerbunny: House pricing going up but salaries are staying the same largely.
[5:15:29] savageshanks: get yoself an inhertiance or your SOL
[5:15:32] OverclockedPC: fixed vs variable tho
[5:15:34] Amraki: I got 2.62 myself
[5:15:35] StOrMy1100: Here you can get 20 years for 1%
[5:15:45] boowoo: @sonorantoad thats literally my plan lol, find a place in the woods with GREAT wifi.
[5:15:46] boowoo: :P
[5:15:49] Crashkt90: I’m right at 3 for mine
[5:15:57] nAZAr1uS: oh shit, I refinanced at 3% for 15 last July, thought it was low
[5:16:02] OverclockedPC: thats why we have a bubble
[5:16:04] TyulSK: I wanted to build a vacation home last year. The builder quote was double what I was planning, and that was last year
[5:16:04] OverclockedPC: money is free to borrow rn
[5:16:10] sonorantoad: @boowoo don’t forget to buy an SKS and Alex Jones survival food
[5:16:11] FlyingVillage: In the Netherlands I have 1.3%
[5:16:18] savageshanks: that IS low which is why even lower rates are mind numbing
[5:16:18] boowoo: and then loan credits get boosted by property ownership...
[5:16:25] ItsNodens: Less than 1% seems to be pretty normal in Finland. I have 0,6 and 0,5
[5:16:35] boowoo: its such a funny feedback loop
[5:16:42] mittensthekillerbunny: Yep! ~6ish months ago was prime time to buy. Low interest rates, housing still same since nobady movin. Too late to get in now :(
[5:16:48] boowoo: @sonorantoad oh maybe not an SKS... but alex jones? of course.
[5:16:52] ThatWeirdoGuy: Last summer I got 1% locked 30 year mortgage in Denmark.
[5:16:59] ItsNodens: I mean the margin
[5:17:16] ItsNodens: But 12 month interest is under 0%
[5:17:17] sliderspy: they create it out of thin air
[5:17:19] ZukuuTV: It's probably partially financed by the state
[5:17:21] boowoo: lets all move to europe
[5:17:24] wsd7: central banks take the hit
[5:17:31] MisterMOONDog: it is great as a homeowner though. I just refi for 1% less than what it was, took five years off the loan, and still paying less than I was
[5:17:32] savageshanks: doesnt even touch inflations devaluation of the currency that is crazy
[5:17:34] ZukuuTV: I think so, and only for the house you live in
[5:17:35] NerdKensel: Its tax write off profit as an expense?

[5:17:53] kaeedo: but the healthcare
[5:17:56] KnickKen: some speculate, that either the customer fcks up and/or the rate increases and they kick the customer out of the low rate (which they can)
[5:18:08] MiraPacku: because our countrys aren't as indebt and corrupt KEKW
[5:18:11] boowoo: true

[6:18:16] Mordenak: Damn, Crash Landing was a great pack
[6:18:36] aman36000: @Giantwaffle Blightfall is a neat pack, the goal is to clear the world of taint and you are just in the last dome of actual nature
[6:19:00] masztufa: oooh, then i would 100% recommend that pack (blightfall). It's kinda like crash landing, but with taint, and it also has lore and whatnot

[6:39:46] Nexhunter: but it was falling inwards

[6:42:11] Nexhunter: @johnny_dan nah not worth when you can just listen in
[6:42:21] johnny_dan: fair point
[6:42:23] Myekos: I wonder what would happen is a satellite target test "failed" and on purpose took out another govt spy satellite
[6:42:24] Nickynewark1: @johnny_dan im sure but no need for that can just fire a missile at other sats

[6:45:02] Nexhunter: but for the US-193 shoot down the missile brain was trained to target that satellite profile specifically so at least unless we build a new system outside of Aegis then will be hard with the current limitations from aegis which has hard guides to not target above a certain height
[6:45:03] NextPlayerI: @NextPlayerI KEKW
[6:45:08] CardboardBoaner: what are we talking about?

[6:46:00] CardboardBoaner: @masztufa country*
[6:46:05] Nexhunter: wait hold up is that the stunt double for Thor KEKW
[6:46:06] Kuroiorb: it's about the rods of god
[6:46:18] masztufa: how would you even get that much mass into orbit?
[6:46:20] CleofisTV: They’re the size of telephone poles
[6:46:29] DigitallyAdmiringHumanity: when you get off stream you need to walk gi joe
[6:46:31] officialhunterx: if that happens just screen elon
[6:46:36] Kuroiorb: that's the only issue, it's expensive to bring them up there @masztufa
[6:46:36] DigitallyAdmiringHumanity: watch*
[6:46:48] silenthunterx_x: @giantwaffle at what age did you start streaming.?
[6:47:02] MrHashbrowns: the tungsten rod thing was a thing in one of the GI h=joe movies
[6:47:03] Myekos: mass X velocity
[6:47:06] mechoriet: thats gonna perforate a human body
[6:47:06] YOhodges: except it would go through you like a buller
[6:47:27] LtCol_Carter: Is it similar to the EM railguns? They don't have explosives, but have mad speed
[6:47:36] fat_larz: ke =1/2 mv^2
[6:47:42] CardboardBoaner: wouldnt it burn up in reentry or does the tungsten just like not
[6:47:45] Myekos: a paint fleck at orbital speeds would leave a paint fleck sized hole straight through
[6:47:53] Zoltac27: Same idea but instead of having a railgun with a couple meters of accelerating it accelerates the entire way down
[6:47:58] kappathirteen: but this has to enter the atmosphere, a lot of kinetic energy lost through drag
[6:48:02] Nexhunter: @LtCol_Carter well that is the sabot round
[6:48:16] DigitallyAdmiringHumanity: whiplash?
[6:48:19] MrHashbrowns: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=22bHxTTLcdc clip of a kinetic weapon in GI joe: retaliation
[6:48:24] isfil: Call of Duty Ghost have a "good" demonstration what that weapon can do!
[6:48:35] Nexhunter: @MrHashbrowns you're late that was already posted KEKW
[6:48:40] MrHashbrowns: oh
[6:48:50] MrHashbrowns: only half listening hahhaa
[6:48:54] CardboardBoaner: RIP KEKW
[6:48:54] grimmn: @kappathirteen not much (relatively speaking) drag on an arrow shaped rod
[6:48:56] kappathirteen: dissipation of energy
[6:48:56] LtCol_Carter: Sabot round? Yeah, didn't mean for the kinetic bombardment is the exact same thing, talking of the KE being insane
[6:48:58] Mondgottheit: Isn't it cloth?
[6:49:07] Nexhunter: @LtCol_Carter ahhhhhhhh
[6:49:08] resarFelyK: wont there be a time where we weaponize high amounts of power like a beam of lightening monkaHmm
[6:49:08] Moobot: You can find Waffle's Youtube channel here - https://youtube.com/giantwaffle
[6:49:29] Myekos: depends on the size and mass
[6:49:38] FroZenThai: I think it depends on size too
[6:49:43] kappathirteen: already in use
[6:49:58] Nexhunter: naaah
[6:49:58] CardboardBoaner: @Giantwaffle have you seen that movie or whatever on the mini drones
[6:49:58] LtCol_Carter: @Nexhunter it's all pretty cool stuff
[6:50:01] saltyspitoon73: sounds terrifying
[6:50:03] Myekos: Geneva Convention
[6:50:04] kappathirteen: Geneva convention LUL
[6:50:05] Nexhunter: we aren't signatories to that pepeLaugh
[6:50:06] fortheloot: i just imagined a brownie of my sister dropping out of space, it would probably wipe out entire europe, thats how dens an hard they are LUL
[6:50:06] obtoe_: wtf did i join into lol
[6:50:07] aman36000: @Giantwaffle Keep in mind, Everything we have seen, is just whats Declassified lol
[6:50:12] obtoe_: im scared
[6:50:20] Nexhunter: @Giantwaffle remember the US isn't signatory to most weapon bans sooo pepeLaugh
[6:50:27] grimmn: there's an agreement prohibiting the use of lasers specifically used to intentionally blind humans
[6:50:28] Moobot: Play Waffle's entry for Ludum Dare 48, Dig Deep, at giantwaffle.itch.io/digdeep | Check out the other entries at ldjam.com/games | Looking for the github? Visit: https://github.com/GiantWaffleCode/DigDeep
[6:50:29] Kenchava: @Giantwaffle company called dynetics (sounds like a villian company) makes laser turrets for humvees they came to our college trying to recruit us...
[6:50:35] lazycdog: there's a similar agreement to not use rods from god as weapons.
[6:50:41] Spirevipp: fuck it, imma watch avatar
[6:50:49] Nexhunter: dynetics is just a government general contractor @Kenchava
[6:50:53] navalship55: The laser that can shoot a coke can off off of a boat from like 3 miles a way
[6:50:56] Nexhunter: so they do nasa work also KEKW @Kenchava
[6:50:56] CardboardBoaner: My brother works for the navy as a contractor and he like cant play games on his computer cause it would reveal shit like that
[6:50:57] masztufa: those tungsten rods only have about terajoule scale energy. That's in the range of the first couple test nuclear bombs tested
[6:51:00] StOrMy1100: Well mass destruction weapons such as nerve gas isn't allowed to use against humans, but they are used
[6:51:10] Kenchava: @Nexhunter yeah they did a bunch of contract stuff for DOD and nasa.
[6:51:19] Hykisho: whats your favorite metal
[6:51:39] aman36000: same thing
[6:51:42] Kenchava: @Nexhunter they also had a drone recovery program with C-130s they were explaining to us. (Keep in mind we were CS kids so they wanted us to program stuff...
[6:51:59] CardboardBoaner: @Giantwaffle have you seen that video from like 3 years ago about "slaughter bots"
[6:52:05] LtCol_Carter: Boron is mixed with it, I think?
[6:52:08] Deflate__: yea it can be used for doping
[6:52:09] masztufa: like a tungsten rod of 20cm diameter and 10m length dropped from orbit has like 12 TJ energy; the first ever test of a nuclear bomb was about 20 kilotons of TNT, that's 80-something TJ
[6:52:13] grimmn: boron and phosphorus can be used for doping silicon
[6:52:17] kappathirteen: B2
[6:52:17] Asphoron: What about the guy who hit by the laser in a particle collider? That story was crazy
[6:52:19] Deflate__: for p type doping that is
[6:52:21] Nexhunter: @Kenchava ya i got raytheon that tried to poach me also pepeLaugh
[6:52:34] ChadTBiggums: "Diborane is used in rocket propellants, as a reducing agent, as a rubber vulcanizer, as a catalyst for hydrocarbon polymerization, as a flame-speed accelerator, and as a doping agent. It is also used in electronics to impart electrical properties in pure crystals."
[6:52:48] LtCol_Carter: Ahh yeh yeh it's hydrogen
[6:52:51] Nexhunter: but the real scary part is if you ever see the NASA nerds meeting up with the Aegis folks at lockheed monkaX
[6:53:03] Kenchava: Them the scary meetings.
[6:53:21] CardboardBoaner: have you seen styro pyro's videos shits so funny yet terrifying
[6:53:27] Aurielli: i thought that was vibranoum KEKW
[6:53:33] Aurielli: vibranium*
[6:53:38] masztufa: styropyro is the chaotic neutral of science youtube
[6:53:43] CardboardBoaner: ^
[6:53:45] Kenchava: mfw when you gotta bring the expert on geneva conventions to the weekly meetings monkaS
[6:53:50] ChadTBiggums: styro is a godsend
[6:53:56] jachred: You'll need the setup to make diamonds easier.. So a seperate setup is better
[6:54:04] Nexhunter: @Kenchava that only for international sales pepeLaugh
[6:54:07] ItsOnMax: Yeah, thieves are stealing catalyst from vehicles because they contain some
[6:54:17] Kenchava: @Nexhunter pepeLaugh
[6:54:28] CleofisTV: @giantwaffle what mods are you using this shit is crazy lol
[6:54:37] masztufa: "the first red flag is that the first result is this cursed thing *shows a circuit diagram made in mspaint with cyrilic text*
[6:54:45] kappathirteen: Hows your Nuclear reactor doing?
[6:54:56] Nexhunter: @Kenchava but still not as scary as the NASA nerds meeting up with Lockheed to unlock the aegis system to satellite targeting monkaX
[6:55:06] Dagmoo: Finally Clap
[6:55:21] masztufa: this is compact claustrophobia, a whole modpack
[6:55:26] Nexhunter: !modpacks
[6:55:28] Nexhunter: !modpack
[6:55:29] Moobot: Waffle is playing the Compact Claustrophobia modpack (on v1.12.2) via CurseForge! The modlist: modpackindex.com/modpack/5547/compact-claustrophobia
[6:55:35] gamabunt: if i did the Math right a tungsten rood wit mass 5000 newton and a speed of 30 000 m/s has a impact energy of 489 Tons of TNT
[6:55:35] Nexhunter: timmacDERP eventually I'll get it right
[6:55:49] Dagmoo: and chat was telling you its see-rilic last time NotLikeThis
[6:55:54] Nexhunter: that nothing KEKW
[6:55:55] masztufa: 30 km/s is earth's speed around the sun
[6:56:00] masztufa: it's wrong
[6:56:09] CardboardBoaner: "like a tungsten rod of 20cm diameter and 10m length dropped from orbit has like 12 TJ energy; the first ever test of a nuclear bomb was about 20 kilotons of TNT, that's 80-something TJ "
[6:56:10] Taov_: cyodillic
[6:56:24] fat_larz: but newtons isnt a mass
[6:56:24] srgp2015: 500N
[6:56:59] masztufa: they made much bigger nukes tho
[6:57:07] masztufa: and it doesn't scale well
[6:57:14] jkhappyday: yooooooo when you think you startin dyson? how much longer you think you have on this pack?
[6:57:14] Moobot: Come join the Waffle House discord https://discord.gg/G5FeeveP3c and chat with the community! Remember to link your Twitch account in the Settings (gear) > Connections for subscriber channels.
[6:57:20] MiraPacku: the first nukes were tiny compared to later ones, and especially H bombs
[6:57:38] masztufa: a nuke doesn't give a shit what others are doing 1000 km away in the direction of wind
[6:57:39] Igneous3: so just a few city blocks
[6:57:39] ChadTBiggums: about to start to gather items to craft the creative EU in enigmatica, wish me luck >(
[6:57:40] jkhappyday: pogggguuuuuuuuuu
[6:57:41] CardboardBoaner: do you think they will add multiplayer to dyson, im waiting until they do to buy it
[6:57:41] obtoe_: oO love those types of games
[6:57:43] Myekos: a near miss hit won't destroy the electronics on a tungsten rod
[6:57:47] Nexhunter: oh wait yo chat did THAAD-ER ever start development or did congress kill that one and just go with THAAD only kylieHmm
[6:57:50] obtoe_: do those games have a genre?
[6:57:54] aman36000: They arnt meant for massive yield tho, they were made for the ability to strike anywhere in the world with a a bunker buster in just a few minutes
[6:57:55] drew_gcs: so do we know when any new zombies EE
[6:57:56] TuskenSithLOL: !followage
[6:58:03] drew_gcs: are coming out?
[6:58:20] jkhappyday: yeah you were talking about it last night and would love to see a playthrough by you on it
[6:58:31] Dagmoo: yeah this past one OMEGALUL
[6:58:38] ValmarD: Random Fact, There used to be a Lake Mega Chad
[6:58:40] ChadTBiggums: we need some new maps like origins
[6:58:50] Dagmoo: early access + EE hunt = ?????
[6:58:52] siwdo: yeah zombies has been very disappointing Sadge
[6:58:58] Kuroiorb: yep
[6:59:04] kappathirteen: Tungsten is brittle though
[6:59:30] masztufa: nobody cares about material properties if you can't do shit about it dropping on you
[6:59:34] Myekos: titanium is brittle, tungsten not so much
[6:59:40] masztufa: you don't care if it shatters on impact
[6:59:57] aman36000: yea
[6:59:57] Kuroiorb: yep
[6:59:59] kappathirteen: 3422C
[7:00:00] grimmn: yes
