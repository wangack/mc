[1:29:56] Feinberg: brackets let you get through lots of players in a short time but systems like a swiss pairing / round robin are potentially better for truly determining the best player with as little rng as possible
[1:30:05] isabelcoolaf: 4th place match PauseManSit
[1:30:18] kittykat2626: round robin is where everyone plays everyone..?
[1:30:21] PacManMVC: 4th place match is just the loser of the 3rd place match
