[7:11:41] Cyprisssss: i think it’s an endstone one ?
[7:12:37] deathlyvt: @whitesoul__ I can see why yeah. But the intended purpose for it is to not get caught by it
[7:13:23] Whitesoul__: @deathlyvt Lets be honest here KEKW Sure, but at the same time since it exists in Minecraft now, there will always be people who are willing to try lol
[7:13:42] deathlyvt: @whitesoul__ REAL KEKW
[7:14:02] Whitesoul__: But oh well, I don't expect much from Mojang when they clearly could add in all of the mobs instead of doing a freaking rigged mob poll peepoGiggles
[7:14:30] deathlyvt: @whitesoul__ apparently they'll eventually add all the loosing mods eventually when the time is right
[7:14:35] Whitesoul__: idk, that's just my prefersence KEKW
