[2:00:17] Dizz1227: The reason most games have lackluster battle passes is that they allow you to earn back to credits to rebuy the next one, this after one purchase, so long as you finish the battlepass you don't have to respend 10 dollars
[2:00:25] Joshuapetch: @ThatOnneGuy pepeLaugh

[2:02:09] AtheonBarcota: I always weigh it out as would I rather spend $50 for a nice meal that I'll enjoy for 30 minutes or $50 on in game stuff that I'll enjoy for months potentially.
[2:02:10] shinysimbe: guess rich ppl call it fuckit money cause they dont need them
[2:02:26] wackle: I justify it by spending equal or more on something that is a good investment to offset the bad investment
[2:02:27] Peeeeeeeeeep: and it depends. say you go out to dinner and have a couple drinks--easily $100 for a couple hours. Or $100/mo on a game for tons of entertainment time
[2:02:38] ThatOnneGuy: I spend less than $40/week on food

[2:39:09] PureSpider: @simoncs past a certain point, yea
[2:39:14] StardustDragon08: @simoncs at leastv with IRL art I actually own something KEKW
[2:39:17] CreepiePie: making a contract on eth us typicly around 100x the cost of a transaction, depending on the size of the contract ofc. and an NFT is just a "contract"
