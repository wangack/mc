[1:24:39] apparycja: @phenoix_boo btmc and greninja
[1:25:11] Maddy674: @vadskamanta if you want we could probably use the room in the basement of my current abode that is just labeled "The Omen"
[1:25:37] justastrayferri_: now.... i am a bit scared of you two... ranbooScared
[1:25:57] vadskamanta: @Maddy674 monkaHmm it's almost like it's meant to be!! Although, maybe a bit close to 'home'?? We don't want the demon to accidentally possess someone around us
[1:26:06] ohheyitsfi: If your team happens to win, you should go in and crash Kara's stream PepeLaugh

[1:26:26] cranman95: each team is only allowed to have one good quality and Hannah takes up your teams LUL
[1:26:29] callalillity: they only lost a round because 5ups internet died...

[1:29:02] cranman95: party mode? more like destroy your eardrums mode
[1:29:04] Maddy674: @vadskamanta honestly, probably. They'd likely make.... less noise in the room above me and be far less idiotic than the people who were approaching the bear and her cubs
[1:29:16] gaymersalsa: good idea
[1:29:31] greendrag0n0568: I had to leave who won?
[1:29:35] adultingsucks2021: he did have a netherite sword
[1:29:47] vadskamanta: @Maddy674 depends on the demon I suppose, but if it only makes you read and being nice to chat then I guess it's okay to be around, just as long as it's not our streamer
[1:29:48] gaymersalsa: @greendrag0n0568 H's team 2-0

[1:32:16] justastrayferri_: sam, there's a scary old man living under us. the demon could scare him away
[1:32:20] vadskamanta: @Maddy674 ok, it's settled then! We're doing the exorcism in the omen basement and allowing the demon to possess you in order for you to do your reading at 3 am!!!
[1:32:21] CaptainBinkles: Haha right doesn't matter if you just win LUL
[1:32:31] Maddy674: @vadskamanta WOOOO!!!

[1:49:56] cranman95: your team is like medium stacked at PvP, but you have great strats
[1:50:16] gaymersalsa: @Lagoles66 iskall said there might be plans for him

[1:55:31] Lagoles66: I believe nobody of sneegsnag ever played or watched this game
[1:55:44] gaymersalsa: they did catch em off guard 🤷
[1:55:45] mariibrynn: watching punz pov, you could tell captain and iskall had no idea how the game even worked :(

[1:57:28] vadskamanta: @thatbrianagirl so far yes, but it all depends on how well other teams does
[1:57:30] cranman95: I feel like that team is unlikely to come together with a concrete strat imo
[1:57:32] thatbrianagirl: awesome GG
[1:57:52] gaymersalsa: how is the leaderboard looking rn?

[1:59:23] cranman95: the problem with some teams is that they're coming into this event like it's a random Minecraft event when it's really a different game

[2:05:40] gaymersalsa: yeah the ults popping up on the side bar dont last long enough
[2:05:43] Gokimster: Ults i think they show when they have the overhead cam view
[2:05:53] vadskamanta: @victoriateooo greninjas team has 3 points, BTMC's 0 - we want BTMC's team to win at least one round so Greninja team only get 1 point this game
[2:06:26] victoriateooo: I seeeeee thanks
[2:06:43] gaymersalsa: 2.17 K/D monkaSHAKE
[2:06:45] okgeographyjoke: also cause BTMC's team includes seakeepay and dave woot

[2:08:29] actual_supernova: @ohheyfiona or when they showed all at the same time, no clue what happened then KEKW
[2:09:19] gaymersalsa: god dave's dmg
[2:09:30] gaymersalsa: oooh
[2:09:53] victoriateooo: sams alt is OP
[2:10:01] gaymersalsa: nooooo the crystal was at 1
[2:10:06] ohheyitsfi: @actual_supernova, exactly! like even if it said "team x" and the team member under, it took me a while to work out that was what was showing it - especially cause like, i was trying to pay attention to the actual game rather than the TR banner lmao
[2:10:14] okbloo: They ulted each other LULW

[2:13:08] Lagoles66: imagine if this game had sand
[2:13:19] the_mexicun: hi H
[2:13:58] Lagoles66: iskall and captain both only ulted once each game
[2:14:02] Rasphaz: yeah agree
[2:14:04] gaymersalsa: yeah for sure
[2:14:26] haggleslag: should they change axel before next week's game or should they just leave it until if they do this rivals series again?
[2:14:26] gaymersalsa: :)
[2:14:33] Izzie114: yeah you used or ALTs on attacks and not in defense. that is better
[2:14:35] Gokimster: Yeah i think whenever you make the other team use Ults defensively, it's a good trade, because their counter push potental gets hindered so much
[2:14:46] gaymersalsa: FURTHERMORE OMEGALUL
[2:14:50] idlo09: LUL
[2:15:03] gaymersalsa: you just need to dodge better smile

[2:18:23] Lagoles66: captain was only a head, ofcourse he was not having a good time
[2:18:39] Lagoles66: he was decapitated
[2:18:43] thatbrianagirl: is there a point where you won't respawn, if you're unalived a certain amount of times?
[2:18:52] lilybluexx: axel was so strong its crazy
[2:19:02] vadskamanta: @thatbrianagirl no
[2:19:10] lilybluexx: @thatbrianagirl respawn just takes longer further into the game i think
[2:19:20] haggleslag: seekypay

[2:22:20] okgeographyjoke: Dave got 23 kills in each of the first two rounds he's cracked
[2:22:34] JoyceTheTuffPuff: @vadskamanta it's gonna go well when I get a phone that's compatible. I've been thinking of replacing my old one for a while now and winning pushed me to make that decision so hopefully soon hbomb94LUL

[2:24:50] Grebliw: 300 gold and 50 gold to each member
[2:25:18] adultingsucks2021: In San Diego, Smajor's team always stole the mid mob last second to get the boost
[2:25:32] itsMorrigan: can you only ult once per game?
[2:25:46] gaymersalsa: pepoG
[2:25:49] okgeographyjoke: @itsMorrigan can use ult when the blue xp bar above hotbar is filled up
[2:26:04] vadskamanta: @JoyceTheTuffPuff I can imagine!! I'm hoping my phone doesn't give up soon, but it's been doing random restarts more and more often now so I'm guessing I will have to start looking for a new one
[2:26:06] JoyceTheTuffPuff: can't wait to spend channel points on vault hunters again. And my real money on the merch hbomb94LUL

[2:29:41] vadskamanta: @JoyceTheTuffPuff it's so annoying because I have two sim cards (one private, one company) and since I have free data on my company one I need that one to be active, but for some reason it always defaults to my private one and it's a whole ordeal to get that working again after restarts
[2:29:46] vadskamanta: Bye Sam phinasHeart
