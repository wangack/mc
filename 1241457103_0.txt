[0:43:32] 7hat: @Falrahch Same and then I relaunched and it worked
[0:43:32] 514484: this was JEI/NEI that did the F7 thing, now it's alsoa  standalone mod
[0:43:34] Miestro: I'm the same way Apparentthreat , but look into MX blacks because the springs are stiffer
[0:43:34] stone_sage: Xaeros Minimap mod shows light level
[0:43:39] Calhai: I use cherry mx blacks for that reason, higher resistance NODDERS
[0:43:47] Falrahch: @Falrahch Oh really? I relaunched and reinstalled but no luck
[0:43:52] Apparentthreat: Miestro i have a keyboard i like already. clicky tactiles YEP
[0:43:52] ca8l: I'm a huge fan of dark chocolate
[0:43:53] retrogamewizard: cherry blacks SS 7g !
[0:44:05] aundros: btw are we hyped for james web launch? its soo close. Can't believe it
[0:44:05] 7hat: @Falrahch weird
[0:44:20] Goldps1: @Giantwaffle we should have a house building showcase of some sort
[0:44:21] Falrahch: @Falrahch But good to know, thanks, I'll try again
[0:44:23] Miestro: same, I use kailh clear switches that I've self lubed. @Apparentthreat but it's still nice to swap them out and try something else every once in a while
[0:44:25] Apparentthreat: Falrahch you're using forge and not fabric, right?
[0:44:28] 514484: for performance, i suggest the Fabulously Optimised modpack
[0:44:29] ca8l: I enjoy talking shop with a bunch of like-minded individuals
[0:44:33] Miestro: kahil*
[0:44:36] DjinN_SS: @aundros what day is it launching again?

[0:44:52] Í∞êÏûêÌÉÄÏù∏: @DjinN_SS 25th
[0:44:54] Falrahch: @Apparentthreat I just used the optifine jar on the standard installation of MC
[0:45:17] ca8l: I found an eggnog recipe that calls for a dozen eggs and has three different types of alcohol in it and you have to let it ferment for a week and a cold place LOL
[0:45:34] Miestro: sodium?
[0:45:34] ca8l: did you know the reason why you add alcohol to eggnog is to preserve it
[0:45:39] onbc: lithium is pog I use it rn
[0:45:47] ca8l: because back in the day your chickens never stopped laying eggs
[0:45:48] kaos4666: yo yo
[0:45:51] Gh3ttoboy: @falrahch yeah you will need either forge or the lithium modloader
[0:45:51] mechoriet: lithium + sodium + starlight + iris YEP
[0:45:52] DjinN_SS: @Í∞êÏûêÌÉÄÏù∏ nice ty

[0:46:40] ca8l: I heard another hack this week. store your avocados in the fridge submerged in tap water. it will keep them from turning black
[0:46:54] chadica12345: Lithium can be put on a server and the people on the server dont need to install it
[0:47:00] onbc: Lithium isn't lighting @chadica12345
[0:47:10] ca8l: also never pop the pit out of your avocado until it's time to eat it because the pit helps keep the avocado fresh
[0:47:13] Gh3ttoboy: @falrahch you got lucky i never had it working without a modloader
[0:47:14] onbc: it is

[4:27:18] madscientist_72: I don't understand why people that lose taste with Covid don't eat super healthy for a month and lose a bunch of weight.
[4:27:23] ba_nanananananana: DrHax_ it's not _the worst_, it's just cheap and has the "beer for alcoholics" stigma. Stuttgarter Hofbr√§u is bad.
[4:27:41] WhiskeyLeif: WhiskeyLeif subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 5 months!

[7:22:47] TheGeekPeek: so watching you throw what you want to work on is learn to hold the entire body still besides your throwing arm. focusing on consistency as far as sway, movement, and wrist will make a huge long term difference.
