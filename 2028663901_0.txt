[2:41:08] zugrwow: peepoCute omg those lock sprites!
[2:41:11] CurtisDN_: like across any speedgame ive been a part of, they just get shit on for no reason
[2:41:13] rileyonosu: @castlebeki yeah you can make a request to be put onto the team if all the mods are inactive/gone
[2:41:15] laybr2: laybr2Jamgie
[2:41:24] dandelions_2210: Jamgie
[2:41:33] cupeidei: its such a shame too bc its only gonna result in nobody wanting to mod and then wtf the community gonna do ?? like be grateful ppl volunteer lol
[2:41:39] castlebeki: thanks @rileyonosu
[2:41:44] m4th154fun: and teams can protect players form being stolen too

[2:42:13] IronGubber: floating grass

[2:42:21] laybr2: probably
[2:42:24] Jaaxful: leaderboard isnt real change my mind
[2:42:24] Kaelan_F: ohhh that
[2:43:00] laybr2: nod
[2:43:04] chaitea04: love this song RainbowPls
[2:43:04] Fossabot: RainbowPls
[2:43:04] POJOGA3: MHM
[2:43:08] Fyroah: it can be considered wr but the fact is its unverifiable according to the rules
[2:43:27] LNXSeus: Yeah
[2:43:29] prkrGG: ong
[2:43:36] chaitea04: rules are rules for a reason, we cant make exceptions for some when theyre not made for others
[2:43:40] POJOGA3: How you expect a runner who had a 9:5x PB to get a WR after? LOLW
[2:43:45] AntVenom: spittin fax
[2:43:51] cupeidei: I mean the rules are also there for a reason... as a top runner you know what they are, and the consequence for not following them..
[2:43:59] maximus_68: @POJOGA3 i mean a run is a run tbf
[2:44:01] Switchpalacecorner: Yapping
[2:44:09] RubixBeaver1: molly joining vc was kinda clutch ngl
[2:44:09] laybr2: Yapping
[2:44:11] rileyonosu: its like when you are an actor and laws dont apply to you lol
[2:44:13] chaitea04: CatDance
[2:44:17] f1shbutt: f1shbutt subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 16 months! :3
[2:44:23] EzraManning: Yapping
[2:44:23] starlitfires: IMO I feel like the mod in question should be verified given a fix hasn't been made for the original broken mod OMEGALUL but I also recognise the sentiment that it is illegal lmao
[2:44:30] castlebeki: how do you work "so hard" if you didnt even check youw were respecting the rules :/ That's a "absurdely hard" lol
[2:44:31] AceRPx_: my pb is 9:55 too does that mean i get wr next
[2:44:32] POJOGA3: @maximus_68 i dont blame him using the mod tbh if he wasnt expecting to get WR 4Shrug
[2:44:33] laybr2: Jamgie
[2:44:34] cupeidei: @chaitea04 exactly. Like would we really care if a "small" runners PB didnt get verified? no
[2:44:35] zugrwow: Funny thing I don't really get, why does the 2-hour minecraft aa run gets so long to get verified, while a 99 hour Binding of Isaac Deadgod% run takes like a week to verify?
[2:44:39] laybr2: nodding ace
[2:44:39] maximus_68: @POJOGA3 ye
[2:44:47] AceRPx_: surely layla
[2:44:50] laybr2: i believe
[2:44:53] niclasmedq1: what did he do wrong the wr guy. which moch was not allowed
[2:44:56] POJOGA3: forsenCD nice
[2:44:57] xanthous7: i feel like drip wasnt really expecting to get wr so it didnt matter to them at the time that it wasnt going to be verifiable
[2:45:00] Alex20830: Alex20830 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 8 months! Hello
[2:45:00] maximus_68: i guess the hypothesis of most sub 10 runners being able to wr was proven PepeLa
[2:45:17] maximus_68: @xanthous7 i dont doubt that most people understand that side of things tbh
[2:45:17] POJOGA3: Yea true max, literally just roll the seed LULW
[2:45:40] castlebeki: need to check frame by frame too for splicing :/
[2:45:43] CurtisDN_: yea console games have it easier in that regard
[2:45:45] Safph: I assumed  all top runs were verified for essentially any game
[2:45:46] dandelions_2210: Yapping
[2:45:55] Tabspacecrafting: You think there's ever gonna be  moment that the official leaderboard is actually up to date and good?
[2:45:57] starlitfires: is that why you keep the RainbowPls emote for anti splicing OMEGALUL
[2:45:58] Fossabot: RainbowPls
[2:46:01] zugrwow: NOTED Very interesting
[2:46:06] the_mmx: NOTED
[2:46:08] oll1ewatchesstreams: i feel like they would verify a well known runner like you faster right? since youre known to not cheat
[2:46:12] XKon23: NOTED
[2:46:13] Kaelan_F: NOTED
[2:46:16] AceRPx_: @starlitfires could easily still splice with that
[2:46:18] laybr2: @oll1ewatchesstreams nop
[2:46:21] POJOGA3: forsenCD perfect
[2:46:21] germchang: Minecraft is too configurable
[2:46:26] k_anga: what is server side rng
[2:46:27] laybr2: they just go down the list
[2:46:36] HawkEye_028: !aawr
[2:46:36] Fossabot: All Advancements | WR & PB: 2:27:45 FeelsStrongMan | !tracker !progress !coopaa !aaguide
[2:46:45] xanthous7: minecraft is one of the coolest games to speedrun though since its not only about mechanics but also time and rng
[2:46:47] rileyonosu: @oll1ewatchesstreams well known "reliable" runners are some of the most common to cheat since they feel like they "deserve" the god run
[2:46:47] StargamerXD: HELLO TEAM
[2:46:50] RubixBeaver1: what does cheating do like good barters + drops?
[2:46:50] 1velz5: @oll1ewatchesstreams there was some popular "trusted" runners that cheated
[2:46:54] RubixBeaver1: or like seed?
[2:47:01] chaitea04: would it be possible to create a closed source game launcher that makes it easier to search for files and stuff for cheating, and it has all allowed mods already in place?
[2:47:02] plate___: hai :3
[2:47:21] fox_four4: it would prob be easier to moderate in the last version
[2:47:32] fox_four4: since rates are tied to seed
[2:47:34] Fyroah: that sounds so based
[2:47:37] starlitfires: @acerpx_ true but like... if you're looking at a specific thing And it suddenly shifts I would be shocked if RainbowPls and DinoDance frames exactly add up though
[2:47:37] Fossabot: RainbowPls
[2:47:43] starlitfires: like frame by frame
[2:47:44] GirlyGirl__: !wr
[2:47:44] Fossabot: rsg any% 1.16: 7:01 by drip120 | rsg aa 1.16: 2:27:45 by me FeelsStrongMan
[2:47:46] blobserr: the poor sheeps
[2:47:47] dandelions_2210: Erm
[2:47:49] POJOGA3: So getting rods is predetermined when you enter a seed?
[2:47:50] oll1ewatchesstreams: god apple temple watch
[2:47:53] madsenvy: back from dinner feinNom
[2:47:56] the_mmx: does this make sense only for 1.16 cause in newer versions rng is tied to seed?
[2:47:57] blobserr: wb mads
[2:47:58] Fyroah: hi mads Pag
[2:47:58] DiaDlamonds: wb mads feinNom
[2:48:01] the_mmx: TEMPLE CLOSED
[2:48:02] Tylouw: is there a mod that verifies that you are not cheating, so when you have the mod installed and submit the run with the verification mod they know you didnt cheat. Could that work?
[2:48:06] bruno_n1f: how does the mod team prevent ppl from scouting seeds?
[2:48:06] laybr2: mads BunnyHugs madsCute
[2:48:11] zugrwow: Now I feel like The Binding of Isaac speedrun mod team might not be giving the 99-hour DeadGod%  runs their due diligence LUL
[2:48:14] madsenvy: HUGGIES
[2:48:16] Fyroah: OMEGALUL
[2:48:17] the_mmx: OMEGALUL
[2:48:18] Creeeper: OMEGALUL
[2:48:19] Switchpalacecorner: WTF
[2:48:21] AceRPx_: @starlitfires thats true yea. still might be able to but itd be hard
[2:48:22] dandelions_2210: OMEGALUL
[2:48:25] nicey_y: OMEGALUL
[2:48:25] AntVenom: gapple in every chest?
[2:48:28] bogusWasHere: was that 3 gapples
[2:48:40] SirIronOW2: I return LOCKIN
[2:48:42] BurperFish: 3 gapp
[2:48:46] Tylouw: aight
[2:48:50] POJOGA3: LOCKIN
[2:48:54] geewyn: do we still use server side rng?
[2:48:58] Kaelan_F: going to prejack the code for the end portal
[2:49:02] knawk: i mean in general you can't verify what code is running on a computer, not just minecraft or java or whatever
[2:49:02] laybr2: fyroah how did your randomizer go
[2:49:09] Tylouw: right yeah thats true
[2:49:12] dandelions_2210: WAYTOODANK
[2:49:19] happymortal999: only real way is to provide the computer, software and watch over their shoulder
[2:49:22] dandelions_2210: too smart for me donk
[2:49:35] POJOGA3: Would it also check like flint rates and everything else RNG wise?
[2:49:39] Fyroah: @laybr2 killed like 15 bosses today EZ
[2:49:39] Kaelan_F: oh is this the ender pearl lore
[2:49:40] Appleplectic: could do like checksums and hashes and only allow specific files so its practically impossible to inject anything but splicing is still a problem
[2:49:40] Skidamarinkk: Is it harder to cheat in newer versions where your seed affects drops
[2:49:48] DangerDeaner: could you just have a RNG drop seed?
[2:49:56] Jresseh: :0
[2:50:00] the_mmx: NOTED
[2:50:05] Creeeper: :0
[2:50:20] DangerDeaner: Oh true plant a seed ur right
[2:50:25] T0mmyV01: whats the most absurd fake run you had to review?
[2:50:33] CurtisDN_: i love how they made that snapshot and all the youtubers were like "this is gonna be big for speedruns", as if 1) anyone runs set seed, and 2) anyone runs versions past 1.16
[2:50:35] laybr2: @fyroah W
[2:50:42] bruno_n1f: unrelated but how does the mod team monitor like scouting seeds?
[2:50:50] RammasunW: YEP
[2:50:50] the_mmx: paus
[2:50:50] SirIronOW2: AHHHHHHHH
[2:50:51] Switchpalacecorner: WTF
[2:50:52] Fyroah: wasnt there a speedrun client that mod team was working on
[2:50:54] zugrwow: WTF
[2:50:57] nicey_y: WTF
[2:51:00] chaitea04: is it possible to create an actual closed source launcher version that people couldnt edit, like .LOCK files or something that only the game and mods with the key can access?
[2:51:01] laybr2: @bruno_n1f it has to do with the way the world loads in at the beginning
[2:51:21] blobserr: speedrun client coming soon - late 2020
[2:51:23] Kaelan_F: 160000 moment
[2:51:23] kot7k: was the thing you got scammed for a 1 time payment only? or would it require like X Money per month?
[2:51:28] Fyroah: @blobserr AINTNOWAY
[2:51:29] SirIronOW2: still an igloo technically Nerdge
[2:51:30] zugrwow: Still kinda cool LUL
[2:51:32] POJOGA3: paus
[2:51:36] BurperFish: in my book thats an igloo
[2:51:39] Tabspacecrafting: Could a person cheat a ranked run?
[2:51:40] Appleplectic: @chaitea04 closed source is worse than open source for this kinda stuff imo cuz no one will know if a vulnerability is found
[2:51:54] POJOGA3: eeeh
[2:51:54] AceRPx_: isnt igloo impossible bc its not grass
[2:51:56] chaitea04: thats fair, didnt think of that
[2:51:58] WordSmith123: FOSS is based
[2:52:04] SirIronOW2: Happy Meal%
[2:52:09] DangerDeaner: in my mind best way to cheat is to vary distribution of drops per run so across many runs it looks normal but individual runs are more likely to to be fully swagged out and some runs will be absolute dog
[2:52:10] the_mmx: feinFries
[2:52:11] CurtisDN_: could you not have used the lava to cook the baked potato lol
[2:52:15] Fyroah: paus
[2:52:19] theNoobyDragClicker: hot wr
[2:52:24] geewyn: need 2 bread?
[2:52:24] Tabspacecrafting: You need 2 bread right?
[2:52:29] Fyroah: wheres the toy
[2:52:38] theNoobyDragClicker: no chicken NoBitches
[2:52:38] POJOGA3: forsenLaughingAtYou
[2:52:43] elliot_ke: yeah 2 bread
[2:52:49] the_mmx: 2 bread and an apple
[2:52:49] Fyroah: why do they call it happy meal if theres no fucking toy
[2:52:56] plate___: happy meal run what
[2:52:58] cyborgmast3r: what category lmao
[2:52:59] PacManMVC: why you fucking the toy Susge
[2:53:00] CurtisDN_: what would the toy even be
[2:53:00] ItzzMatt84: Binoculars AlienPls10 GYAAAAAAAT
[2:53:02] plate___: explain maybe
[2:53:03] chaitea04: what would the toy be fyroah
[2:53:04] WordSmith123: They call it a happy meal cause it's not a sad meal
[2:53:06] yamp4_: I LOVE AA
[2:53:07] grifferthrydwy: a happy meal without a toy is a sad mea
[2:53:09] grifferthrydwy: l
[2:53:10] PacManMVC: hi matt Drake
[2:53:12] dandelions_2210: @PacManMVC Erm
[2:53:14] ItzzMatt84: hey pac
[2:53:14] grifferthrydwy: EXACTLY @WordSmith123

[2:53:21] grifferthrydwy: hey doc
[2:53:21] PacManMVC: NOPERS
[2:53:27] Fyroah: pac the fact that you thought of that first is kind of sus Hmmm
[2:53:30] Kaelan_F: happy meal when you get the mcdonalds story book toy
[2:53:32] PacManMVC: Hmmm
[2:53:33] xanthous7: is there vids on what minecravenger did explained?
[2:53:37] PacManMVC: yes
[2:53:39] DangerDeaner: there are tons
[2:53:39] WordSmith123: @xanthous7 TWT has one
[2:53:39] dandelions_2210: Susge
[2:53:43] chaitea04: @WordSmith123 *LOUD INCORRECT BUZZER SOUND*
[2:53:44] cupeidei: did minecavenger ever come out and properly apologize? I didnt follow that story closely
[2:53:45] Fyroah: i think totem is a good toy look-alike
[2:53:48] SirIronOW2: The Weekly Thing has one
[2:53:50] the_mmx: lebronJAM
[2:53:55] CurtisDN_: yea just get a fucking totem real quick
[2:53:56] WordSmith123: @chaitea04 That was correct wym
[2:54:03] Appleplectic: is twt edited by biggest bee

[2:56:09] DangerDeaner: yeah his chest organization was impossible to generate
[2:56:10] WordSmith123: Wasnt it orders of magnitute more unlikely than dreams?
[2:56:13] DangerDeaner: karl jobst did a good video on it
[2:56:20] Switchpalacecorner: @WordSmith123 it wasnt a matter of likelihood
[2:56:21] Switchpalacecorner: it was 0%
[2:56:28] WordSmith123: @Switchpalacecorner ignoring that part
[2:56:31] chopchunk: who are we talking about?
[2:56:32] castlebeki: Impossible yup
[2:56:34] lumin_s: the proof by exhaustion was really something
[2:56:35] zugrwow: I feel like the hardest thing about getting away with cheating is that people just continue cheating until they are caught

[2:57:38] POJOGA3: :tf: Reveal
[2:57:52] DangerDeaner: I think the problem is how much luck there is in minecraft, so there will always be people trying to take that out of it. AA is way more skill based though so even a really lucky run will only get you so far

[3:00:29] AntVenom: That's legit af ngl
[3:00:33] germchang: Honestly that's not even that scuffed
[3:00:35] DangerDeaner: Have you seen those hand cams that just go on regular and its like a fisheye lens and it warps the video to look normal
