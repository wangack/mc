[0:21:55] marconvey: @BTMC Azur3Dream : your beds arent doing as much damage during perch practice because you're placing them in the wrong direction

[0:24:02] MrDutchBoi: Pogpega
[0:24:04] MrQuackalotUwU: The correct side
[0:24:07] Azur3Dream: to the left or right
[0:24:13] Azur3Dream: yes
[0:24:16] Azur3Dream: your beds do more damage that way

[0:24:41] akamru13: Do you have the crampties at least ?
[0:24:54] ZnxTech: pepeDS
[0:24:54] Azur3Dream: technically you can place the obby from the direction you're coming from, but that would mean you need to also run in only that axis
[0:24:54] kajodenn: @btmc after placing obsidian run to the side opposite from the dragon
[0:25:03] MrDutchBoi: WHAT he's hitting the easy stream
[0:25:08] Azur3Dream: but we don't do it that way because the dragon takes longer to perch because of the obsidian towers
[0:25:11] MaHy_9: bwwaaa
[0:25:15] xdrkek: WHAT
[0:25:20] xrossXD: WHAT
[0:25:28] Kexiv_: the front/back is always wrong unless you run perpendicular to how you have been, which isnt optimal because the dragon will start perching from higher and lose a lot of time

[0:26:51] Kexiv_: 4 is the least you can do it
[0:26:55] benchbotch: nah
[0:26:59] benchbotch: 3+axe is a thing
[0:27:04] MrAsianman_0: naur
[0:27:06] Azur3Dream: you can do 3 beds but you need to use a weapon

[0:27:42] benchbotch: ed you could try halfbow ?
[0:27:48] tapLing: don't wanna launch the game Chatting
[0:27:48] ZnxTech: just use your mind to flip bits in memory and kill the dragon OfCourse
[0:27:59] EsquivaIience: no way the dragon doesn't perch right away like in wr speedruns Chatting
[0:28:01] Kexiv_: also you can kill the dragon in 0 beds and just use anchors Tomfoolery

[0:28:31] Kexiv_: might be better for Ed to not use force perch so he can see what to look for and react
[0:28:38] MrAsianman_0: OMEGA
[0:28:42] Kexiv_: Joever
[0:28:44] Enyoti: i figured he doing it manually on purpose
[0:28:50] Enyoti: LULE
[0:28:55] eirik1907: KEK
[0:28:56] nothingsinger: @enyoti late reply, his name is "k4yfour" because his irl name is kaya and has 4 letters so it's a play on words. he mentioned this on his forsenE RSG watch party w/ nymn psp1g yabbe chnyVeryPog

[0:30:20] Kexiv_: yeah i have no idea why hes been saying key lol
[0:30:24] Azur3Dream: yeah the 4 has something to do with the fours replacing a's in his username
[0:30:25] benchbotch: it's much easier to do damage that way

[0:54:07] Yumenexa: !np
[0:54:09] benchbotch: it's okay the run was already dead because the inside of the gold room was entirely lava
[0:54:11] Azur3Dream: that's insanely unlucky too because that guy had NOWHERE else to go since that entire area is flooded
[0:54:17] Azur3Dream: so he was there to begin with

[0:55:05] KingoverlorderV2: @yumenexa do u want the song Chatting
[0:55:09] benchbotch: one of the staircase goons probably walked in there and then got trapped
[0:55:10] Yumenexa: yesh
[0:55:17] KingoverlorderV2: pyrrhic by ne obliviscaris
[0:55:20] Azur3Dream: you maybe correct; piglin spawns inside bastions is something i never really considered
[0:55:31] benchbotch: their spawn locations are always fixed
[0:55:39] Yumenexa: I knew it was ne obliviscaris but couldn't be bothered to go through the entire discography on the FA listing LULW
[0:55:40] nothingsinger: @torturingduck69 mapless not needed considering he's not gonna get a sub 10 anytime soon
