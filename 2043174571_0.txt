[0:58:24] enderkilla101: That combo for magical rocks sounds top notch
[0:58:54] enderkilla101: Maybe some amethyst blocks thrown in for that magical touch
[0:59:17] Burninator57: Did the ship crash on the rocks before or after the "island" started floating?
[0:59:41] TiniSpicy: that makes sence you say, while doing magical confusing good building

[1:04:26] LadyHespeth: any terraforming under the island? or letting it be
[1:04:29] littlepeephead: Today I built a creeper farm in the spawn chunks, only realising after I was done the loading of spawn chunks don't count for mobs lol

[1:06:39] TheWormbo: @littlepeephead you don't get random ticks (for e.g. crop farms) either, and in the upcoming update, spawn chunks are even reduced to 3x3 entity-processing chunks

[1:07:30] Burninator57: I've made some worlds and just explore until I find a good place to build, its a huge pain to not build close to spawn.
[1:07:32] hexi40: Long shot, but does anyone watch flatPixel? They're on a superflat world and it's very interesting how differently he has to play
[1:07:50] littlepeephead: @TheWormbo 3x3 even, wow! Well at least the farm will be out of the spawn chunks then
[1:08:12] yourlocalcheeselover: i might have to sneak into the kitchen to get one of my mountfranklin sparkling water
[1:08:17] FazuBattlecaster: question about the mob switch... I think in SG Season 2 you built the one near the spawn chunks.  Does the switch activate when the mobs are in the active chunk or outside?
[1:08:17] arjun1913: why are you not in twitch rivals
[1:08:30] prettygoodiguess: @TiniSpicy ooh sounds lovely! candyland misty mountains
[1:08:50] gryphonjq1: I usually make a starter base at spawn then look for a cool area to build in

[1:11:16] chaylee: my stomach just made a noise that was eerily similar to when your phone gets too close to speakers or something and interferes with it and I was so thrown for a second there trying to figure out what speaker was freaking out but no.... snack time I guess

[1:16:50] voxplays_1884: @gopsalem build using the warped or crimson logs. They are fire resistant
[1:16:53] littlepeephead: Are you going to do something inside the ship like a villager trading hall or something? Or is it for decoration mostly?

[1:17:36] littlepeephead: It's great fpr the build theory episodes! Been loving those
[1:17:45] annabellekins: Hi Pix This is such a cool build. I made a pirate ship in my single player and it was so fun.
[1:17:51] voxplays_1884: @gopsalem oh you gotta get better at bow sniping then
[1:17:53] npbeans: You could put some villagers on the deck with fisherman professions for asthetics.
[1:17:56] mpsteel95_: One heck of a land mark for that old mine underneath it
[1:17:58] GingerTheLily: @annabellekins That does sound like fun!

[1:36:51] birbwkinfe: @athena08012 On bedrock you don‚Äôt need a zombie. Don‚Äôt follow a Java guide, they don‚Äôt work for bedrock
[1:36:53] alexblackhole: @athena08012 or find a zombie that can wear or hold something
[1:37:03] GingerTheLily: appreciates the thanks
[1:37:13] mitchmethinks: @voxplays_1884 bedrock iron farms dont have a scare tactic. They use villagers working
[1:37:20] AnarchyEvolution: I saw your video and thought of an alternative for the mast: a log in the middle and complementing with fences @Pixlriffs
[1:37:21] grizzlemacthornbody: that would be a good place for a beacon beam if you wanted to do that.
[1:37:27] mgoldsmith41: now I want to build the Silent Mary from Pirates of the Caribbean

[1:38:18] TiniSpicy: LUL
[1:38:31] Axynim: Nether fence?
[1:38:35] zsigmons1: On bedrock any village with ten or more villagers that have beds and worked the day before have a chance of spawning an iron golem near the village center (the pillow part of a bed)
[1:38:52] littlepeephead: Twitch-con seems such a good opportunity to meet your favourite creators, but then I found out tickets here are 150 euro's!
[1:39:04] enderkilla101: So the back half of the ship sorta has skelly face vibes. I think you should lean into that a bit harder

[1:42:23] Axynim: Cherry doors have a great lattice texture. Though tbf, it and the copper grates are really just transparent noteblocks

[1:42:34] GingerTheLily: Are You Not Entertained??
[1:42:48] 6ProUp4: that's why I don't go on twitch, I feel that if I'm not getting something done I'm failing

[1:43:03] 6ProUp4: so today I shall only procastinate
[1:43:08] zerav4: the refined tuff blocks are so great though and the copper grates

[2:11:43] ApollosDagger: ahh that makes sense
[2:11:44] prettygoodiguess: "splice" also used to describe film editing
[2:11:48] Valois_Fulcanelli: I love the definition of freezing the balls off a brass monkey. The brass monkey was the frame that held cannonballs, so when it was really cold the metal would contract and the cannonballs would go everywhere.
[2:12:06] dumdum_mister: Most if not all deaths in minecraft are silly mistakes.
[2:12:06] canada_raz: thicker too?
[2:12:08] poisso3: Splice the mainbrace...repairing the rigging or an extra ration of rum...
[2:12:20] GingerTheLily: @Valois_Fulcanelli Yes thats a really interesting one!
[2:12:58] TiniSpicy: ohh interesting
[2:13:05] headstandingpenguin: @dumdum_mister about 90% of my deaths is falling into my own holes or down my own buildings though... (mostly down the giant treeholes that are R6 cicrles going 34 blocks down ...

[2:14:50] thepcnerd2023: Very cool!
[2:14:57] sionnach46: The ship got very lost.
[2:15:10] dab2014: My deaths are usually creepers or the evil witch
[2:15:15] poisso3: the German Navy has a similar tradition, but they say "Besanschot an!" - "Splice the main brace!"
[2:15:15] uloncl: oh thats so cool
