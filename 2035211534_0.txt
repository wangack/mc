The vods of raw vault runs are great entertainment. I never knew false was so sarcastic / ruthless before watching here run vaults with you all. It's pretty funny. You guys seem to be having a lot of fun together It's great. Cheers my dude.

[0:20:10] jmommers98: I would switch to my laptop, but it's running VH...
[0:20:15] gaymersalsa: 2?
[0:20:15] iljalz: what did we miss?
[0:20:16] nib__rl: This is just an idea?
[0:20:16] Cychadopi: Oooo baaaack
[0:20:17] cineeleo: All good now I think
[0:20:17] avian946: can we please have a gem from treasure rooms that adds extra capacity for omega crystals of doom
[0:20:26] damnsecci: i blame the ads kek
[0:20:27] EVO_Gaming6000: Vault hunters require more than two brain cells!!!
[0:20:31] sh4dow_d3mon: Yup this is sounding much better
[0:20:31] biggie83t: Jeej, we're back!
[0:20:34] Arqae: Sadge
[0:20:35] phillykd11: Why do I feel like I‚Äôve heard you talk about sockets on the crystal before
[0:20:38] Kriskiki89: @avian946 no
[0:20:40] juxtaposed39: @avian946 pog idea
[0:20:41] ohc_69: This gets better - we‚Äôve needed this for a long time
[0:20:46] Sassykitkit: Ooooo
[0:20:48] PrismaticPixieDust: what about mystic and infuser?
[0:20:48] Waliyounas: But if to many inscription is in refine storage will the chunk be affected like jewels
[0:20:50] Arqae: Not a big fan of that hoenstly KEKW
[0:20:51] hygenhund: hygenhund subscribed at Tier 2. They've subscribed for 19 months! Holy Velara, 19 months already!
[0:20:53] the3rdpilot1015: this is quite the leveling right now
[0:20:55] Ice_DBH: will there still be expertises?
[0:20:55] xerhys: I love puzzles <3
[0:20:57] fit_solution04: Interesting
[0:20:57] avian946: @kriskiki89 get tae sir, I win all that jazz
[0:20:57] TobyButt89: That sounds really strong!!
[0:20:58] khanngi: ok
[0:21:00] jetlius: @Chandler86_ hallo!
[0:21:01] chezzmcmeat5: does that mean inscriptions will be more common
[0:21:03] GooseLeeMague: this system seems a lot more understandable than the current, makes it more approachable
[0:21:04] adsu203: What about curses ???
[0:21:05] LalaDiable: @damnsecci How are you gettting ads?
[0:21:06] GyroscopeX: sounds like good change currently crystal management is a bit too complex
[0:21:07] gaymersalsa: @avian946 cope
[0:21:08] xpcju: you could make "random negative effect" increase the size of the crystal
[0:21:10] rupov777: hallo just 12h between stream ?
[0:21:13] hunspartacus10: iskDab
[0:21:15] nija0dragon: iskall streammm
[0:21:16] Cychadopi: well see you on vodskall for dylans that missed all of what iskall was talking about xD
[0:21:17] Captain3Bottles: ive tried explaining crystals to friends and no one understood hahha
[0:21:17] BingusMcGuffin: this will make me cwant to use them now
[0:21:19] Logicholly: I never did a catalyst vault bc it was too much lol but always liked the idea - I think this is a good change
[0:21:23] Jbslim: Less RNG, more finding the META for best combo of rooms/catalysts
[0:21:23] rupov777: <3
[0:21:24] RavingHazard: @Kriskiki89 KRIS :D <3
[0:21:25] khanngi: I will just watch the vod

[0:21:32] Kriskiki89: @RavingHazard hallo sir <3
[0:21:32] nija0dragon: just funished watching your last episode
[0:21:32] Chandler86_: @jetlius hallo cptHeart
[0:21:32] TakeMyBigbysHand: Iskall save your team and use the Fletching table for making these catalysts lol
[0:21:36] MaximumLiberty: Catalysts have been confusing
[0:21:37] mrPhilipJones: did i miss anything important while twitch was borked
[0:21:41] VeraldOsu: but this means we cant do 18x plentiful anymore
[0:21:42] Logicholly: ads for me :(
[0:21:43] iljalz: ad :/
[0:21:43] MarkDatter: peepoAds

[0:21:51] bu1dak: Chatting ading
[0:21:53] nomadshelp: i think this will significantly increase the amount of crystal modification i do early game
[0:21:54] kaasappel1: You should make vault gold allot better like that you can purchase a negative modifier remover
[0:21:54] Captain3Bottles: ads :(
[0:21:56] Colebot17: adadadadada
[0:21:58] 60wattlightbulb: Good morning

[0:22:12] xerhys: Oh god the ad was so loud, scared me
[0:22:21] mydogsnameissus: what if positives are +2 and negatives are -1
[0:22:24] mtunny27: what biome is pacific in?
[0:22:26] PrismaticPixieDust: Mystic/infuser??

[0:22:36] Oh_No_Its_Kat: I didn't get a notification BibleThump so sdageee
[0:22:38] Pineapple0nPizza: i got too confused by the current catalysts and especially inscriptions to really use them so I'm on board
[0:22:42] vaulthunteraddict: Love listening to iskall as an podcast while playing vaulthunters

[0:23:23] melonhunt: !stress
[0:23:24] nomadshelp: @gaymersalsa how to get that transmog tho?
[0:23:25] Nightbot: Stress has been hugged 17964 times! Gotta luv ‚Äòer!, ya monsta!
[0:23:25] thestupidtrooper: Refresh if your stream is frozen
[0:23:26] dcptcncrescendo: @khalin1212 I'm coming downstairs to save you from ads don't worry
[0:23:27] MarkDatter: cant wait to catch what i missed bc of those ads on vodskall
[0:23:29] batt3ryac1d: @iskall85 running like 30 woodens is totally pointless but very fun mega cata vaults are good
[0:23:32] Nightbot: To add your alias to VHSMP-- Go to the official VH Discord https://discord.gg/vaulthunters  & add in the alias-request channel found in the VHSMP Category.  shorturl.at/ekxLX
[0:23:34] GyroscopeX: it'll average out
[0:23:37] sharkastic_shark: Was frozen
[0:23:37] gaymersalsa: @nomadshelp randomly from rolling a rare sword
[0:23:43] RhianKristen: ever thought about adding lore?
[0:23:44] RavingHazard: Jardoon could never Kappa
[0:23:55] Nightbot: Watch iskall85‚Äôs VOD‚Äôs at https://youtube.com/@vodskall85
[0:23:55] 60wattlightbulb: That's great, but only for theose, who have time to play a lot
[0:23:55] notTheRealHelmis: RNG = Redditor‚Äôs Nskill Gissue
[0:24:01] sh4dow_d3mon: But you need the *** be enjoyable enough to have that sample size
[0:24:04] AyushJind: how expenisve is mine inscription?
[0:24:08] kaasappel1: People always quite before winning big
[0:24:08] CyberGeiger: Love it!
[0:24:09] Ito_Kyoshiro: why not call it Capacity instead of Sockets?
[0:24:12] PyderMandy: Gmgmgm iskHeart
[0:24:15] Nightbot: Support the devs & the pack.  https://www.patreon.com/VaultHunters
[0:24:21] natfink13: natfink13 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 6 months! I can never put more than 3 things on crystals so this change sounds wonderful iskHeart
[0:24:23] BONNe1704: But getting kekt after 2 catalist was awesome game experience
[0:24:23] tijmi18: yeah but if you never have luck you won't have motivation to play more to maybe get more loot
[0:24:25] sh4dow_d3mon: I think this is a really great change
[0:24:26] hLip3: @iskall85 is there any change with -70 and 70+ lvl treasure chests?
[0:24:28] magdaluo66: hello
[0:24:29] PrismaticPixieDust: yeah capacity to relate it back to how jewels work
[0:24:32] Nightbot: Everything in VH 1.18 is very under development & things might change.. Just Trust the Process-- iskall & Devs
[0:24:35] ASmoothCr1minal: yesssssss
[0:24:38] nomadshelp: but what about the super lucky 25 living mushroom crystal
[0:24:47] 10Robbo10: @logicholly I found the playlist on YT. The videos in it are recently uploaded but don‚Äôt appear in the normal videos feed. strange. I like it, doesn‚Äôt clog up the main feed of shorter videos, but I didn‚Äôt know it would work like that
[0:24:52] k1_setae: So its no longer possible to get that +35x plentiful void anymore?
[0:24:53] ASmoothCr1minal: could even tie that into greed levels somewhere down the line
[0:24:55] cannatonic29: I love the idea I just had a 1000% 8 Bonus living crystal that netted 2500 chests, no need for living anymore‚Ä¶
[0:25:06] cannatonic29: that‚Äôs just too much in my opinion.
[0:25:09] lemonpi2186: lemonpi2186 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 39 months! Whooohooo #neverleaving
[0:25:11] Jbslim: no more stacking crystals in drawers
[0:25:15] Pineapple0nPizza: i liek it!
[0:25:16] faefair: hmmm not sure about this idea
[0:25:21] CallumPO6: CallumPO6 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 13 months! Will augments and seals take up space?
[0:25:25] snaptin5643: i have a quest suggestion for you. can the spirit extractor be move to before lvl 20 as me being a noob i died and didnot have the black steal for the extrcator as i did see it was needed till after lvl 20
[0:25:28] 60wattlightbulb: That tree outside the window, has a yoyo
[0:25:30] batt3ryac1d: as long as you can still mote them that sounds ok to me
[0:25:33] bobsens3: hello @iskall85
[0:25:36] Rauhaa: now that sounds like a interesting twist on the lvl 100 endgame
[0:25:39] myster_ious_iroh: its good
[0:25:42] gaymersalsa: new workbench pag
[0:25:43] the3rdpilot1015: i love it
[0:25:44] myster_ious_iroh: i like it
[0:25:44] fultiaan: i love this idea
[0:25:44] Cosmovoli: I'm listening
[0:25:45] Chandler86_: Sounds good
[0:25:48] PrismaticPixieDust: mystic/infuser?
[0:25:50] sh4dow_d3mon: This sounds like my favourite change in the game so far
[0:25:51] ColeKaro: im sure it'll be fine
[0:25:53] jujurehehe1347: jeez dude
[0:25:54] masterprzecin: yess thats good idea <3
[0:25:54] Danymaddox: What abput expertises @iskall85 ?
[0:25:54] Pineapple0nPizza: i like it - inscriiptions confused me to the point I have never used them
[0:25:56] Ice_DBH: what about expertises
[0:25:56] dcptcncrescendo: i think this will make it so much easier to modify
[0:25:57] RavingHazard: I only heared half of it so ill watch the vod to get the rest KEKW
[0:25:57] BingOyuncu: Makes sense but there are things that should be considered.
[0:25:57] Arqae: Buffing is not always prefered tho
[0:25:58] phillykd11: I love this idea‚Ä¶it sounds really good
[0:25:59] Rozz161: maybe you can have a crystal spawn with a slot taken by a catalyst already
[0:25:59] kinghingle: i love it honestly, just smooth the curve out and give the late game more economy to play with
[0:26:00] Jbslim: WorkBenchSkall
[0:26:02] miatilamia: Sound good to me
[0:26:02] GyroscopeX: sounds like good change to me. currently crystal management is a bit too complex
[0:26:02] nomadshelp: but what about those 35* plentifuls
[0:26:03] thatmfdes: I like the idea, I think it can go well if players are willing to give it a chance
[0:26:03] jdubbs211: this is a good change.  don‚Äôt cave to the haters
[0:26:04] kaasappel1: Removing rng is always good in my opinion
[0:26:05] ali7899000: Sounds great, what happens to the crystal expertises?
[0:26:05] nib__rl: It definitely nerfs the power of crystals lol
[0:26:06] jujurehehe1347: I hope
[0:26:06] l___Nick___l: It sounds really clean
[0:26:06] gmark5: ive been watching vodskall, the discussion is nice
[0:26:06] jmize9: When is update 13 dropping
[0:26:07] weewolfg: y would i use a 10 socket crystal if i could reroll for 30 soxkets
[0:26:07] ensalys: Sounds like a nice thing
[0:26:07] Sassykitkit: I like the idea
[0:26:08] mcpeking18: i think its good
[0:26:10] NikitaNik_of: it removes RNG, and convert it to strategy/some emta
[0:26:11] mrbunk9: Removing every RNG is a good thing? I have serious doubts
[0:26:11] Waliyounas: Will it will be ok with refine storage
[0:26:11] slashyamael: never really use catalyst, seems more clear and clean mechanics
[0:26:13] Tinokk85: I trust the process and generally love your changes.
[0:26:14] TomMakes1318: you could have it cut more sockets.
[0:26:14] oryanhorizon: I think "end game" starts at level 80 though
[0:26:15] VeraldOsu: bit sad that we wont have 20x plentiful but its ok
[0:26:15] PyreoftheLiving: I like this, but I bet people are getting their shovel jewels ready to make pitchforks.
[0:26:16] Sassykitkit: Gives you more options
[0:26:17] Logicholly: @10Robbo10 Yeah they are unlisted - I think partly because iskall is doing shorter clips from the vods so all content in clips will be in the vod so its duplicate content and may be confusing
[0:26:17] faefair: good idea, just not sure about the range
[0:26:19] angrrrrydad: chat we are idjits , we know nothing but comment on everything
[0:26:21] notTheRealHelmis: i missed the beginning -> i‚Äôll rewatch and have a think to play devil‚Äôs avocado
[0:26:22] Ribery931: i like it. good reason to craft cystalls to find a good one to make a catalyst run and not be unlucky getting a +2 plentiful 3x mine room
[0:26:24] SwimStyle: it's  a shared kind of design as other things in the pack, so it shares logic for players
[0:26:25] therealpacolabean_: this is my frist stream I‚Äôm watching pls notice me
[0:26:25] Vlazmanian_Devil: This is a great change! The range for 100 would be good, but maybe not super low crystals?
[0:26:26] phoenix_king_01: will the soket size increase with level ..??
[0:26:27] minipax84: I enjoy the RNG of messing with crystals as they are now but I trust you!
[0:26:27] TobyButt89: Iskall hits us in the gut with the "we're removing this feature" but then softens the blow with the explanation. New system sounds good, possibly strong but good
[0:26:27] freddyb8: What about the skills that you use to make crystals cursed or unmodified? What will happen to the skill?
[0:26:31] elio_saratsis: Then we will have the hunt for omega crystals we had on legacy vh
[0:26:33] batt3ryac1d: knowing how many slots you have feels nicer than getting rekt by RNG tbh
[0:26:36] sh4dow_d3mon: I don't make crystals cuz the system sucks.. now this is really user friendly
[0:26:41] gharmonica: I'd like to backlash sir
[0:26:42] AyushJind: lol
[0:26:42] nomadshelp: @therealpacolabean_ consider yourself noticed
[0:26:46] Pineapple0nPizza: the current system is too complicated for me so I like the change
[0:26:46] nib__rl: What
[0:26:47] CallumPO6: Does this affect augments and seals?
[0:26:48] ramnite_tv: Is it really that difficult? What
[0:26:50] cannatonic29: Had 40x living 8 bonus and that‚Äôs just too much in my opinion would rather it be limited I like the change.
[0:26:50] kaefer67: kaefer67 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 8 months! 
[0:26:50] megafrox: Maybe make it so that the maximum and minimum "sockets" increase every 10 levels?
[0:26:52] nib__rl: No LOO
[0:26:53] elio_saratsis: If there are variety in the amount of slots in the same level
[0:26:53] lordeclipse01: is this for 13 or 14?
[0:26:54] the3rdpilot1015: totally agree
[0:26:54] InflatablePanda: love it, I was wishing a crystal table would exist a while back to visualise what I was adding to it then realised it couldn't because they relied on instability so this will be good for that!
[0:26:54] damnsecci: hmmm no lol
[0:26:55] KJAERB0: Its too complicated IMO
[0:26:57] mydogsnameissus: what if negative modifiers are a -1 and positive are +3 or something
[0:26:57] shaydeejay: i stopped questioning your decisions a long time ago, in iskall we trust
[0:27:00] pomi2137: you need degree to play this mod pack tbh
[0:27:01] sp0rsk: i always have my calculator out no lie
[0:27:03] Ribery931: its a bit complicated ye
[0:27:03] coffeebot13: I dont think so
[0:27:03] noxe_jkl: Yeah, i agree
[0:27:03] ASmoothCr1minal: nahhhh its just maths

[0:27:04] lordeclipse01: is for update 13 or 14
[0:27:05] Tinokk85: How are these changes going to affect mystic/infuser?
[0:27:05] nib__rl: It is nowhere near that complicated
[0:27:06] PrismaticPixieDust: I agree. Knowing the order to add things etc.
[0:27:14] slashyamael: i would enver found out if not watching your video for csire
[0:27:14] noxe_jkl: It does make sense
[0:27:15] phoenix_king_01: will no of socket increase per level or level group ..??
[0:27:16] Thirdeyechakra69: my wife will be very excited about this. she currently loves tool crafting with the jewels and this sound like maybe a similar vibe?

[0:27:23] BrassDonkeyy: Just tuned in
[0:27:23] Logicholly: Sorry if this was covered but what is the difference between an architect crystal and a normal one - will they have the same 'sockets'?
[0:27:23] 60wattlightbulb: More RNG, less maths
[0:27:24] m0dzer0: i'm lvl 92 now and havent messed with uber crystals yet.  too complicated.
[0:27:25] Cosmovoli: I need to go to Reddit to make leddit about changes, so stupid that people will be happy about the change
[0:27:26] SammJ85: what about the mystic / crystal expertise? will that disappear?
[0:27:27] samsam21amb: I haven‚Äôt touched architect vaults their too confusing and I can only play a couple of times a week.
[0:27:27] oryanhorizon: Early on I really struggled with catching onto the completion percent on modified vaults
[0:27:31] Nightbot: Stream uptime: 27 minutes 28 seconds
[0:27:31] YaGa_10: Make catalysts so that there is a chance that you will get say 2x plentiful on the same catalyst
[0:27:32] kstack_1020: I love that idea since myself and a friend that I'm on a server with just hit level 100 the other day.
[0:27:36] Monatae: how will this change catalyst expertises?
[0:27:37] Arqae: @iskall85 AS long as the new type of vault feature stay RNG i'm good :D
[0:27:40] Knew_It_Owl: @iskall85  Would you ever be able to finalize Vault Hunters? Like completely "finish" the game? Or would it be a work in progress forever?
[0:27:41] Rauhaa: i like your thoughts on the matter, i do approve
[0:27:45] lordeclipse01: is this for update 13 or update 14

[0:28:45] 20_ryan_02: Please run a vault
[0:28:47] 60wattlightbulb: I want someone to draw a picture of an architect seal
[0:28:49] Cosmovoli: Wait did I miss it ? Socket will be for catalyst AND inscription?
[0:28:49] dcptcncrescendo: @ShelobsLair_ hallo
[0:28:49] kaasappel1: You can also move rng after you have a minimum guaranteed and after that rng but the crystal can crack an not be used
[0:28:50] gaymersalsa: LOOOOL

[0:29:01] BONNe1704: CAN we remove random completely?
[0:29:05] Hydrargyrbar: Would the expertise be changed to give more sockets instead of reduced unmodifiable chance?
[0:29:06] jetlius: ballo, bood merning @gaymersalsa
[0:29:10] Arqae: That sounds more confusing tho
[0:29:13] ramnite_tv: I feel a bit crazy reading the architect vault comments, I always thought it was a pretty straight-forward feature hryM

[0:32:01] CasualTeaGames: @gaymersalsa  ah ok thanks for that
[0:32:01] basman333: eskall
[0:32:02] freddyb8: Will the cata we have be grandfathered in or will they be changed or just good for soul shards.
[0:32:03] fit_solution04: Update 13 when?
[0:32:04] Ice_DBH: why not get altar automation?
[0:32:05] Knew_It_Owl: When season 4? lol
[0:32:06] follar00: Make a skill for packing in more than the sockets allow

[0:32:10] basman333: does VH work on Mac?
[0:32:11] Therank2100: Will this not discourage players to use them to build vaults until lvl 100 for the omega vault chance?

[0:32:34] maxxam230: I think i missed something xD
[0:32:35] elio_saratsis: Careful not to return to a state like the omega crystal hunt we had on legacy vh
[0:32:39] ramnite_tv: Will you make another vodskall video on that, similar to the  ascension one?
[0:32:40] Colebot17: Having a dedicated table would give a better reason to actually catalyze crystals and serve as a better entry point to the system
[0:32:41] gaymersalsa: @basman333 you can get it to work, theres a guide on vh discord

[0:33:21] YaGa_10: Why not make a catalyst have multiple modifiers like jewels
[0:33:22] Rozz161: can a crystal spawn with a catalyst already on so theres more reasons to craft mid game
[0:33:34] gaymersalsa: @hamisharms theres usually a "streamed live at twitch" in description

[0:33:39] zugzugaxebro: there should be a vault modifier that makes the floor bouncy, i feel itd be funny
[0:33:42] ActivatedApple__: Could be something like random vaults until level 20, catalyst and/or random vaults with crystal capacity up until level 50, then add room inscriptions for a definite room of that type, and then at level 100 architect vaults.
[0:33:43] actualmooncore: i think most of these features should share the same workflow. for example implement the way jewels work on everything else. As a new player it gets overwhelming real quick
[0:33:44] Nightbot: Vault Hunters Reddit for you to check out! https://www.reddit.com/r/VaultHuntersMinecraft/

[0:33:46] gaymersalsa: @hamisharms behind the scenes vids are done off stream i think
[0:33:47] fluxrabbit: What if the table has a separate slot for a finisher catalyst? Then catalysts with unmodifiable can only go in there and then you guarantee only one of them in the table

[0:35:26] gaymersalsa: @Mynestyne he leaked something about crystal modifying, i think we are getting a new workbench and architect seals are being removed
[0:35:27] EnslavedMoist: Yup, I feel that, happend on my second crystal as well
[0:35:29] RhianKristen: that‚Äôs kinda normal for me lol

[0:35:32] CyberGeiger: Happened to me three times in a row :D
[0:35:35] LunaticGoneMad: nrg can be fun but its not fun when it can change the out come heavily like applying 3 catalyst vs 15x catalyst
[0:35:36] KJAERB0: To me it sounds like RNG cant be at the expence of control and being able to decide what happens is great! And as it is there is a little too much RNG .. I support change in this regard :)
[0:35:37] Logicholly: just get good guys SKILLISSUE
[0:35:38] penzouille: what??? it always happens around there for me lol

[0:59:35] pancake_lover_333: i want stream but also vodakall‚Ä¶ so one or the other

[1:00:49] ruby_realist: vodskall is great
[1:00:49] Angeliqa_Arain: Those unedited vault runs on vodskall85 are some of the more interesting videos I watch on YT these days. Prefer that format over the edited inclusions in regular videos.

[1:01:12] the_whtvr: vanilla exhausts me in a few hours, it's so boring...
[1:01:12] Therank2100: Instead of a subathon you should do the 'Iskall's Omega Vault-athon of Doom'
[1:01:13] ruby_realist: i love long form content
[1:01:14] birtrim: I love those videos, it feels like old youtube without the fancy pants editing
[1:01:16] sp0rsk: a lot of opening shulkers
[1:01:16] ItzHarpie: What mod is this?
[1:01:16] 20egemen04: @zebrainap saaaaand?

[1:02:17] the_weerdo: Anything is more fun with friends
[1:02:19] zebrainap: create?

[1:02:24] the3rdpilot1015: @yourleftliver its ‚ÄúVault Hunters 3rd Edition‚Äù

[1:02:25] damnsecci: @nomadshelp iskalls butler
[1:02:25] jetlius: Yes pls
[1:02:28] ruby_realist: anything modded i know is from you
[1:02:29] RavenclawNatsfan: I feel like create is a middle ground between modded and vanilla
[1:02:30] Gr8rSpy: reason why I stopped play Minecraft including modded
[1:02:33] jetlius: And better inventoried
[1:02:34] valkojam: Hard to Rupert for you from far away but if you need something just yell.
[1:02:35] lynx6008: There is the crafter in 1.21
[1:02:36] PRIPYAT715: storage is so bad on vanilla
[1:02:38] the_great_tan: drawer are great too
[1:02:38] ItzHarpie: Thanks @the3rdpilot
[1:02:40] Mercutio42: auto crafting is coming
[1:02:44] damnsecci: @valkojam <3

[1:02:46] da_hyun0615: Heyo, 1hour late again lol
[1:02:47] EVO_Gaming6000: The mobs were brutal in that chaos vault
[1:02:47] RavingHazard: Autocrafting hmmm Kappa
[1:02:48] RebelliousUno: Mod pack fun mostly is on questing packs in my mind ATM that's where I find most interest rather than kitchen sink packs
[1:02:49] Upuauta2: For me vanilla is boring af and I never watch pure vanilla MC. Mods make MC fun.
[1:02:51] Marknu: Wish peppers 2 storage mods where part of vanilla
[1:02:51] k1_setae: storage and filtering is the reason i dont touch vanilla anymore
[1:02:51] Gr8rSpy: I love playing but I have no friends and therefore Minecraft and modded Minecraft aren‚Äôt as fun
[1:02:54] Blade_xeon: yeah, I wish vanilla storage was better
[1:02:55] JackMCOfficial: I think we all wish that. I mean... how long have we screamed for an inventory update?
[1:02:57] Poe_thirteen: @valkojam DOUWSKYYYYY!(rings bell for tea)
[1:02:58] shockwave_60: So vinnila+ huh
[1:02:59] saxymatt: I just wish drawers would be in vanilla

[1:03:19] umbral_sage: you want compact and quick stuff
[1:03:20] ijulia24: Yeah there are alot of mods that can be implemented in vanilla
[1:03:23] ruby_realist: lightly modded would be good NODDERS
[1:03:23] TheAmateurQueen: Totally agree
[1:03:23] maty02msu: storage drawers could be a vanilla feature
[1:03:23] ahmadhafez21: Iskallman is that your 2nd vault?
[1:03:25] damnsecci: how do we have less than 5 min of vault time
[1:03:27] natfink13: If vanilla had better storage, better inventory management, and vein mine, I'd play vanilla more until then, vault hunters has my heart iskHeart
[1:03:28] Lv94Gyarados: Modded > vanilla
[1:03:30] krzysiek3_0: speed upgrades for hoppers
[1:03:32] antoine310000: why did vodskall just upload xD

[1:03:48] Nightbot: Watch iskall85‚Äôs VOD‚Äôs at https://youtube.com/@vodskall85
[1:03:48] CharredGibson: Drawers could be vanilla for sure

[1:03:51] freddyb8: He's easily got over 300 living
[1:03:54] AyushJind: @damnsecci time flies in iskalls vaults
[1:03:54] saxymatt: I also don't like having to watch a youtube video and pausing every 3 seconds to make sure Im building storage things correctly
[1:03:58] rayceland: I do not look forward to the QOL changes when I go back to playing vanilla üòÇ
[1:04:00] pendelluft: ty @damnsecci iskHeart iskHeart iskHeart

[1:04:05] gaymersalsa: dylans do we think he's close to 300 living chests?
[1:04:06] RavingHazard: @Marknu Same LUL
[1:04:09] ghost_ivar132: after playing VH i keep spamming R to heal....
[1:04:12] MicroMelone: Oh hey there! First live livestream i think :D
[1:04:12] TheLilMay: Same. Every time I play vanilla I miss speed
[1:04:18] kibaz_x: I need dash in vanilla
[1:04:20] ItzElixsis: I have a hard time playing.. not in creative..
[1:04:21] ladyvaporeon99: Yeah a auto storage with most items takes up so much space
[1:04:21] CeleiteStreams: I'm super excited for VH vanilla
[1:04:30] ItzHarpie: I have school in 9 minutes
[1:04:36] thiccmilkguy: he won't last more than 1 month I guarantee
[1:04:38] gaymersalsa: @MicroMelone welcome in! hryAdmire
[1:04:39] Dadel2400: I miss stonefall, dash and heal in vanilla

[1:04:46] MicroMelone: @gaymersalsa <3
[1:04:48] Marknu: Sand will be a problem ish
[1:04:49] notTheRealHelmis: no way stones?
[1:04:52] chrisw333: I'm always excited for all things VH :)
[1:04:53] ItzHarpie: TwitchUnity
[1:04:57] angrrrrydad: Hbomb has done it for the last 2 seasons.. he hates mods
[1:04:57] pup_polydon: i tried playing vaulthunters but my pc didn't want to load the vault
[1:04:58] Attackeight: no please don‚Äôt, vhsmp is a modded series!!
[1:04:58] Xarallon: try feel out the "vanilla" VH?
[1:05:00] thiccmilkguy: in vanilla. not vaults. iskall
[1:05:05] xerhys: I'm curious how crystal scaling will work with a vanilla VH
[1:05:08] GytisBruhh: In vanilla
[1:05:13] mpastor_25: episode 1 - no extra mods. episode 10- I need the super furnace because reasons
[1:05:16] AbsolutelyNafin: they said vanilla not vaults
[1:05:17] Mercutio42: iskall stealing materials from everyone because he doesn't want to build a farm, doesn't want to mine for redstone
[1:05:22] the3rdpilot1015: you talk about getting bored than you decide to ignore game features
[1:05:22] 20egemen04: his eyes can't see anything besides vaults
[1:05:22] saxymatt: Would you ever try to do a fragged difficulty vault playthrough?
[1:05:22] ItzHarpie: Mods are fun but vanilla just hits different
[1:05:23] RavingHazard: Oh yeah i had to help some friends in vanilla a few days ago, not having dash in vanilla sucks LUL!
[1:05:23] Purple_Wolf24: Purple_Wolf24 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 22 months! coming up on 2 years subscribtion i have watched vault hunters since the beginning and love what you have done with the pack keep it going
[1:05:26] krzysiek3_0: green particless -> neural activation xDD
[1:05:26] suptrace: I was playing a vanilla sky block with my son last night, and I went to dash üòÇüò•
[1:05:28] muppification: this guy
[1:05:32] AyushJind: confuesdskall
[1:05:35] Danymaddox: a chest breaker guide?!?!?!
[1:05:41] kinghingle: i think it doesnt need create neither honestly
[1:05:41] KJAERB0: He says he misses dash when playing vanilla
[1:05:43] actualmooncore: i was trying to find a mod emulating the dash feature cause its so good
[1:05:43] famousp: vanilla would be way better if it had better inventory management that‚Äôs the only thing that stops me from playing vanilla over modded
[1:05:44] ghost_ivar132: create is the best lagg machine
[1:05:46] Kasszi_: vh without modular routers tho..... Sadge
[1:05:46] GytisBruhh: Missing dash in vanilla
[1:05:47] Attackeight: @iskall85 can you talk more about VH4 vanilla?
[1:05:50] ladyvaporeon99: In vanilla i always have just lived out of chest monsters unless someone else builds a system for me
[1:05:51] DanaFabulous: DanaFabulous subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 9 months! The vanilla purests are missing out on a lot of really great gameplay. I think most people are always looking for new ways to play a game they love. Great job with VH. Im learning VH from watching you play.
[1:05:51] Thirdeyechakra69: I feel like iskall would love hakari if he watched jjk
[1:05:54] AbsolutelyNafin: they miss heal, dash and stone fall in vanilla not in vaults like you said
[1:05:58] soalsoll: Etho or Mumbo
[1:06:03] gaymersalsa: Chadding with etho
[1:06:06] justcallmethomas5: I would love a builders wand
[1:06:06] Upuauta2: Playing VH without Backpacks would be pure horror
[1:06:07] Blade_xeon: I‚Äôm assuming you will still have abilities in vanilla VH
[1:06:11] damnsecci: im here for perimiter digging
[1:06:12] kinghingle: i reall ythink Vh can stand on its own nigh on (with backpacks)
[1:06:13] zifster: might be fun with create in the mix, but not one block solutions
[1:06:15] pendelluft: Either Iskall is confused or he gets 300 Living Chests. Not both falseLOL
[1:06:16] thiccmilkguy: you haven't got 1k items yet I think. so it would be fine
[1:06:17] ItzHarpie: Mumbo hasn't been on for a hot minute
[1:06:17] 2KayDee: That would be a lot of AFKing imo
[1:06:20] VioletZex: I always wanna play vault hunters but i dont feel like playing without friends tbh so ill have to wait till one of us start doing something
[1:06:22] TobyButt89: Smelting and pulverising tools can do a lot of the heavy lifting for block creation
[1:06:23] Jbslim: Challenge with vanilla farms is LAG
[1:06:27] jaruzicpark: I think do a single player series for that.
[1:06:36] Attackeight: @yourleftliver this is not Hermitcraft lol
[1:06:37] corneelis0: I watched somebody's stream yesterday and thought why the slimes didn't drop poison. Then I understood it was vanilla, not vault hunters. ü§£ü§£
[1:06:38] bunLunaa: @YourLeftLiver season 9 has been over for a few weeks
[1:06:44] rektarina1594: 1 minute remaining
[1:06:48] Codeman750: Only trians for long distance travel for the smp lol
[1:06:52] hellnohd: time
[1:06:58] EllieSwann114: I currently have only rs, drawers backpacks and potions researched and am lvl 72. Never a problem with crystals
[1:06:59] notTheRealHelmis: So who has signed up for VHSMP s4? Besides Grian ofc
[1:07:02] ghost_ivar132: overworld hunters...
[1:07:06] rayceland: and then you need 86 chorus plants to start your vault
[1:07:07] sp0rsk: same
[1:07:10] eonzcarr: greedskall
[1:07:13] da_hyun0615: Compass?
[1:07:16] melonhunt: skyvault SP series with limited mods would be fun, to make you go in raw vaults
[1:07:19] ItzHarpie: I've missed a lot in the 7 months ive been grounded
[1:07:20] Marknu: Dont step in Liquid hehe
[1:07:21] thiccmilkguy: alter doesnt need that much items yet. So it seems doable to just play with vanilla farm
[1:07:22] pixelcrack_: greedskall strikes back
[1:07:27] RavingHazard: I never knew the compas did that LUL
[1:07:27] suptrace: I like the vault content too. first time I was able to catch a live stream. I‚Äôve been watching on vodskal
[1:07:30] cheesebutt2302: how do you set the compass
[1:07:30] Colebot17: that pillar just gave me flashbacks to vh2 when you had to pillar up to fight every single group of mobs
[1:07:34] xerhys: greed time
[1:07:36] ghost_ivar132: dont worry about the time iskall just GREED
[1:07:36] gaymersalsa: you should take a bath iskall YEP
[1:07:39] umbral_sage: oh, i haven't seen that feature of the vault compass
[1:07:40] iljalz: greedskall!
[1:07:40] eselpgagHD: GREED
[1:07:41] gaymersalsa: iskKiwi
[1:07:48] da_hyun0615: Just dont dash in void liquid
[1:07:50] queenchazzy_: twitch intergration for VH would be epic
[1:07:54] ItzHarpie: Iskfall
[1:07:55] notTheRealHelmis: bathSkall? u might be smelly from the vault
[1:07:55] Mercutio42: i wish the armory had your vault tools as well,
[1:07:55] thiccmilkguy: so greedy
[1:08:01] MD20M: I didn't have time to watch any vault hunters for the last couple of months but as I see Greedskall is still Greedskall LUL
[1:08:02] SincerelyAuri: greed is good
[1:08:03] kibaz_x: Just a little dip LUL
[1:08:04] pixelcrack_: tippy toe in the void liquid
[1:08:10] HerrTopf: I think 3 rooms are doable, maybe 10!
[1:08:15] thiccmilkguy: (-_-)
[1:08:18] Attackeight: 1 east
[1:08:18] corneelis0: Kiwi, greed, run

[1:31:07] thiccmilkguy: doubters getting an ounce of happiness
[1:31:10] gaymersalsa: @PaperJewel he wasnt gonna do a machete for this tool but its useful for trap doors etc. there was just released a vid on vodskall where he crafted it!

Piercing Javelin should be renamed Penetrating Javelin. I cheese dungeons. When Iskall streams hermitcraft VH the first thing I type in chat is ‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs Grian?‚Äù RNG stands for Really Not Good. Why are deaths so expensive? ABE

[1:33:05] notTheRealHelmis: nini Kasszi
[1:33:05] trendel03: quick thought on the elixir bubbles....would it make sense to have them different colors depending on the value?  coordinate them with the rarity colors (omega, epic rare, etc).  Would make it easier to identify what is good to loot in the elixir challenge
[1:33:08] eonzcarr: Night Kasszi

[1:45:13] Nauhar: I juste explored every single room of a ressource vault and didn't find any nether room. How rare are they supposed to be ?
[1:45:14] Jay_Avalos: i think it's easier to get a decent tv and a decent laptop and just use the TV as a display thru the HDMI. and have either a wireless mouse or remote to sit back n use with it
[1:45:17] headlessx: A couple of years = stoneage tho :D
[1:45:17] HerrTopf: I wouldn't buy a new tv just because of the not so smart part
[1:45:18] AyushJind: 1 in 10 yr is crazy tho
[1:45:19] JackMCOfficial: AppleTV has generally been the most stable when it comes to apps, but the Nvidia Shield might be worth looking into! It's more of a "turn your dumb TV into a smart TV", and you get better upscaling etc. Works fantastic for i.e. old shows
[1:45:20] Ribery931: im use the fire tv stick. no issues here tho
[1:45:21] vegzard: New chrome cast with Google TV does the same as Apple TV at a fraction of the cost
[1:45:22] Parziival03: Laptop and HDMI
[1:45:24] NakeZast: one main thing with AppleTV is: you need to already be in their ecosystem...
[1:45:24] damnsecci: i literally bought my tv less than 2 years ago and we got a new one bc further away from couch LOL

[1:45:37] CyberGeiger: Yeah SmartTV makes no sense
[1:45:38] HerrTopf: I have mine over 10y now and dont see a reason to upgrade
[1:45:41] xoMommySiren: I have a 65‚Äù Samsung and I hate it
[1:45:42] angrrrrydad: buy a dedicated laptop and use a tv as monitor and wireless keyboard with mouse is far better than any smart tv
[1:45:42] AlloftheMoon_: use ***
[1:45:43] arcaneauto055: Rokus are great but I don‚Äôt like tvs as much as just using my ipad

[1:45:58] JarnoZZTV: personally i just bought an ipad
[1:45:58] bu1dak: yea that's why I like the NVIDIA shield. you can link remotes
[1:45:59] tygo720: just by a big monitor and only watch streams. LOL
[1:46:00] slashyamael: i think the lack of optimisation in apps is a big parts of the problem
[1:46:00] DannySnowPaw: Apple TV remote is universal

[1:46:00] pixelcrack_: best thing is to buy a hdmi cable and connect your pc to the tv lol
[1:46:00] AyushJind: I use phone for tv
[1:46:01] DevilDead13: Don't bother getting a TV for its "smart" features. Buy it for the actual panel, then use anything external on it. Because you can upgrade in the future at least
[1:46:02] parsec63: You can buy a programmable for one single remote
[1:46:03] damnsecci: yes sir lol
[1:46:03] am_andrew: with some tvs u can yes

[1:46:04] antegravity: Samsung smart TV's work great imo
[1:46:04] skye_ns: I just stream YouTube to my phone...
[1:46:04] iljalz: most remotes you wont even know where they are for LUL LUL
[1:46:04] HerrTopf: should I buy a new tv the smart part would be the least important for me now
[1:46:06] privatejoh: Again, use s0undTV on your TV for twitch
[1:46:07] AlloftheMoon_: get a projector and use ur pc
[1:46:07] h2ikco: the Apple TV Remote works for powering on and off the tv
[1:46:07] DannySnowPaw: yes
[1:46:08] ohc_69: Apple will control the tv
[1:46:09] codtronx: yes you def can

[1:46:16] tim661811: Didnt hdmi CEC solve the multiple remotes years ago
[1:46:16] phoenix_king_01: you can

[1:46:16] MicroMelone: On my TV it was a popup and i had to click 'yes" for it to work
[1:46:17] PikaPikaFail: it did it without me trying to do it lol
[1:46:17] rytional: Appletv remote is Iskall safe
[1:46:22] famousp: Rokus are great cause they have a mobile app for the remote
[1:46:24] NakeZast: built-in with FireTV -> works with normal TV Remote.
[1:46:24] JackMCOfficial: Also, if Altibox gets established in Sweden, their box also got twitch etc - which works extremely well!

[2:08:13] caIImePeter: is it on purpose, that multiple exp multipliers multiply?
[2:08:15] KyokudaiZero: the instability doesn't make much sense.  just allow the negatives to do their job, you don't need instability plus negatives
[2:08:15] Niko_993: do you think clumsy is at a good spot?
[2:08:17] notTheRealHelmis: burger trinket either slot?

[2:08:25] mahik750: How are you chat?
[2:08:31] pandaboy1651: KEKW
[2:08:42] ramnite_tv: @Glossah With each new added thing instabiolity affects chance for crystal to exhaust or for curse to be added, so over 100% instability means youre either guaranteed a curse or you will exhaust the crystal
[2:08:45] gaymersalsa: lol

[2:25:03] winricheichinger: Stress‚Ä¶
[2:25:04] gaymersalsa: @jimitiethedude unfortunately not since there is a lot of dependency across vh and other mods
[2:25:06] mahik750: that one treasure door will be my reason for losing gamba, I am sure
[2:25:10] quadrotti: less reach as a negative modifier?

[2:25:38] gaymersalsa: @gaymersalsa hmm you alreayd have the glhf badge so it might override, there is a setting to change that though
[2:25:47] mahik750: @dragonslayerx453 I think the rarer chests give more xp
[2:25:48] fenixcrafter05: @Galejo927 it breaks in one time instead of drops items for each break
[2:25:55] jimitiethedude: Coz wooden be affected by mining speed
[2:26:00] charlesjhnfrtz: @galejo927 mining speed jewels are needed
[2:26:01] AyushJind: everyone left you Sadge

[2:27:47] supersonicyam: Canada has 5 time zones
[2:27:55] jimitiethedude: @galejo927 nono the thing is mining speed affects wooden chests, so if you have higher mining speed then the chests are broken faster, this only works for wooden and strong boxes tho

[2:35:13] gaymersalsa: @greenmonkey333 looting braziers for modifiers and loot
[2:35:16] jtthegreat2020: I love playing vault hunters however I am horrible past level 20 so I was wondering if you will add the casual mode you used to talk about
[2:35:16] moshner: How do you know you are quite far?

[2:35:31] mahik750: Or lost bounties
[2:35:34] pendelluft: I love Stress calling Etho a noob for clicking a lodestone and then watching her tutorial about not clicking a lodestone back to back
[2:35:42] gaymersalsa: @pendelluft LUL
[2:35:44] zlazkz: is it better than a normal chest?=
[2:35:50] c5r1a5z0y: ye
[2:35:53] moshner: yes!!
[2:35:54] gaymersalsa: it doesnt??
[2:35:57] gaymersalsa: Hmm
[2:35:57] quadrotti: i agree
[2:35:59] gaymersalsa: absolutely
[2:36:00] Colebot17: oh yes that's such a good idea
[2:36:11] OneTrueSpry: Would you ever add enigma chests to vaults?
[2:36:11] actualmooncore: yea like the cake vaults
[2:36:11] sleepysalp89: run iskall run
[2:36:13] gaymersalsa: oooh true
[2:36:16] mahik750: I am curious about brazier vault objective. Just by looking, I am not particularly excited about it, but I am curious how it will feel to run them.
[2:36:18] BeastyBoy5000: powercreep?
[2:36:20] gaymersalsa: maybe better as a positive modifier?
[2:36:21] VogelVrouw: Ohh yeah that'd be fun
[2:36:21] nystadt: And a better crate
[2:36:22] marvelprincess2000: That be cool
[2:36:25] Mercutio42: i think a pillaging counter at the top would be nice. then co-op vaults with 50 pillaged or something
[2:36:26] k1_setae: Noo please no, we dont need to go back to running trough every room meta
[2:36:29] bunLunaa: would that scale with levels though?
[2:36:30] SunflowerMead0w: the constant timer sound is so stressful
[2:36:32] crazyshezy: @iskall85 how about a small percentage in getting +ve modifier when pillageing
[2:36:35] sleepysalp89: down
[2:36:38] the_great_tan: For average players how many hrs you will need atleast to complete the game???
[2:36:43] IceSpice12: goodnight too all my studs and studettes

[2:36:58] marvelprincess2000: iskGg iskGg
[2:36:59] dmarsed: @iskall85 I think the "Pillage, or Exit to Complete" is misleading. because don't you need to exit to complete the vault, pillaging is just optional to get loot? there isnt a requirement to pillage a certain amount before completion

[2:39:25] mahik750: @freddyb8 If you mean the pillaging, you get loot when you click the brazier. Can be regular like driftwood but rare like treasure keys or lost bounties too.
[2:39:27] freddyb8: Did you get a treasure scroll?

[3:21:10] itach1uchiha__: mobs are juice for elixer
[3:21:13] BingOyuncu: Yay, the stream is still going on.
[3:21:17] VogelVrouw: So much loot you start lagging the server
[3:21:20] AyushJind: @maciejrox no way

[3:23:13] umbral_sage: Yeh
[3:23:15] itach1uchiha__: mobs are juice, dont worry
[3:23:19] theachup: I saw someone in impulse‚Äôs chat talking bout a pinata? whats that about?
[3:23:21] Mercutio42: need gold for rerolling
[3:23:23] antegravity: @VogelVrouw Yeah I was there lol. Iskall is too passionate

[3:25:19] Kalwei_: @falsesymmetry IMP
[3:25:19] AyushJind: @falsesymmetry impulse
[3:25:22] chunka_vision: Iskall, He needs to use the Anchor Trinket and it shouldnt crash the server. We have done it multiple times with massive chests runs on our server. It causes a lag spike for a few seconds but doesnt crash the servers.
[3:25:23] Mooseberg_: @ProbablyNotDaniel_ I know it is! but i like more basic modded mc. VH is a whole other level
[3:25:24] gizko: he is streaming now, you can tell him through his chat ^^

[3:25:39] Z0eff: @chunka_vision thats a really good idea actually
[3:25:45] moshner: where your gear is so good that you can loot while standing on a cactus...
[3:25:46] fenixcrafter05: but maby a twinkie
[3:25:47] killerdayve: @chunka_vision oh that‚Äôs a great shout! use the anchor!
[3:25:47] realmanaical: I often think about wether or not I‚Äôm rude

[3:26:16] RMZing: Blunt? Direct? Not necessarily rude
[3:26:17] VogelVrouw: I have the same thing as you, I sometimes come across blunt and rude but never mean to

[3:26:27] rubayethbo: perfectly understandable considering you think in Swedish and have to translate to English
[3:26:28] Zaraca90: I come from Impulse stream, why is he crying saying Iskall is mean to me
[3:26:29] ramnite_tv: @chunka_vision Oooh that's a good choice. I tried vacuum routers with fast pickup in the past and it wasnt a very good solution, but the trinket... hmmm
[3:26:30] gizko: American people are a bit susceptibles ... sometimes
[3:26:34] rektarina1594: Chests dont cascade in dungeons, right?
[3:26:34] dia__hi: I think some people don't understand Sarcasm
[3:26:40] Mercutio42: i think the things people think are "rude" are maybe swedish cultural or tonal differences
[3:26:54] Zinoba: This series will surely never end copium
