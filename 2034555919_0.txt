[0:59:51] darknessbladers: Spawned underground?
[0:59:52] rosette_prism: bell
[0:59:53] veryrealandrew: oh no… scary
[0:59:53] Rialgar: Pride100 the bell echoed, so it DID hihghlight them, ring it again and look all around, including up and down
[0:59:55] Another_JT: They can't spawn underground
[0:59:55] SimplySuvi: could be
[0:59:56] Liamblie: too many caves
[0:59:56] LycanThe1st: bring the bell with you
[0:59:57] just_a_hopeless_tomato: maybe the other side of the village?

[1:00:31] Rialgar: no echo, nothing here
[1:00:32] mcLeslie13: wow i almost missed all the fun
[1:00:32] w0bbelb0b: Terrible or lava bucket?
[1:00:34] Z3R0TR0N: nope
[1:00:35] stormageddon07: otherside
[1:00:36] bandybc: no noise from bell, can’t be there
[1:00:37] BelleDracoArt: Then make a raid farm, so it's controlled. XD
[1:00:38] kamitsu_jaffa: now i understand why raid farms are above ground lol
[1:00:41] touch_of_improv: if there isn't an echo they aren't close to the bell
[1:00:42] xittttta: noooo not there bell didn't echo
[1:00:43] bandybc: you would hear them light up
[1:00:46] PhilHallBio: no return sound
[1:00:47] DiamondMinerMom: diamon359LOVE lark2bHello
[1:00:47] liamin3craft_fan: use free cam
[1:00:49] kill_dolores: Echo if raiders
[1:01:00] Another_JT: Raid waves have to spawn on the surface. listen for the bell to echo
[1:01:06] sofiywhite: Bell sound?
[1:01:19] mcLeslie13: what round are we on chat?
[1:01:26] greystone83: Listen to the sound of the bell.
[1:01:35] upsidedownmeloncake: @mcLeslie13 3 i think
[1:01:36] SimplySuvi: Round 3 i think
[1:01:36] dabananananana: Taco bell ad. Someone keep me filled in?
[1:01:37] Another_JT: Bell only works for 32 block radius
[1:01:38] YoMummaClaire: 3 i think
[1:01:38] TheLifeofL: 4 I think @mcLeslie13
[1:01:48] mcLeslie13: @TheLifeofL ok tyvm
[1:01:50] shunaya: Maybe
[1:01:51] Z3R0TR0N: bell again?
[1:02:06] mschrank77777: They like to spawn in caves sometimes.
[1:02:07] titanac: They probably in a cave quite low
[1:02:09] rosette_prism: none nearby
[1:02:09] freddystrawberry: i think there in the caves
[1:02:11] tueddelich: on your left
[1:02:11] upsidedownmeloncake: it echoed on the glass right?
[1:02:15] cherrypie_84: They must be underground
[1:02:17] SimplySuvi: not if they fell down a hole while charging XD
[1:02:17] kamitsu_jaffa: try listening for return sound ig
[1:02:19] darknessbladers: According to redit posts of people having the same issue its because they spawned underground.
[1:02:21] ivorycricketcap: this is weird whys ren's luck the worst lol
[1:02:27] tueddelich: seen them
[1:02:35] queenchazzy_: bell found them when in the middle
[1:02:36] ivorycricketcap: waas that an echo?
[1:02:36] dfox288: maybe you can check random holes around the village?
[1:02:39] Another_JT: Bell makes an echo if it finds them, they can't spawn in caves, but they can fall into them
[1:02:39] tueddelich: near the base, cave
[1:02:39] Z3R0TR0N: hmmm I’m not sure
[1:02:43] Z3R0TR0N: I don’t hear them
[1:02:53] Z3R0TR0N: too far I think
[1:02:57] beouwolfe: this is also why people build mini-raid farms for advancement worlds
[1:02:59] YoMummaClaire: I quit a world for this reason. couldnt find the last one
[1:03:02] Z3R0TR0N: ring bell?
[1:03:06] SmokedEnderMite: would directional caption subtitles help
[1:03:06] Mirasol_Daisy: maybe check near the houses
[1:03:07] fufie_32: You should be able to hear them if that's the case. What's your hostile mob sounds at
[1:03:08] KarinJ00: be careful
[1:03:08] Nuno_the_kitter: turn in the subtitles maybe??
[1:03:15] Liamblie: a witch!
[1:03:15] freddystrawberry: bell
[1:03:18] KarinJ00: omg
[1:03:19] mcsallie: ring the bell
[1:03:21] darknessbladers: LAVA
[1:03:21] Another_JT: try the bell
[1:03:22] TheLifeofL: put the bell down now
[1:03:22] thewillowthing: bell
[1:03:22] Z3R0TR0N: ring bell in cave
[1:03:22] touch_of_improv: bell!
[1:03:25] w0bbelb0b: Lava bucket
[1:03:28] SimplySuvi: witch sound then but could just be a normal witch
[1:03:29] c4r8_uk: bucket o' lava?
[1:03:29] underscoredwhale: bell
[1:03:34] itsJENNAreally: subtitles and hit boxes always help me
[1:03:37] okiedokiecrisco: oh no
[1:03:38] darknessbladers: Use lava to burn them out
[1:03:38] ivorycricketcap: omg lol
[1:03:40] kamitsu_jaffa: yep!
[1:03:41] thewillowthing: dang
[1:03:41] seven848: lava bucket
[1:03:42] ivorycricketcap: insane
[1:03:42] EvaRock08: oh yikes, great location
[1:03:43] PhilHallBio: torches or lava
[1:03:43] liamin3craft_fan: fatlity
[1:03:55] summerflower1234: probably
[1:03:57] tueddelich: there is another entrance near the trap
[1:03:58] Another_JT: lava does destroy totems
[1:03:59] summerflower1234: we could start a new raid
[1:04:00] fufie_32: Put it down/pick it up
[1:04:00] tral911: witches drink fire resist anyway
[1:04:02] ivorycricketcap: ya probs :/
[1:04:03] beouwolfe: totems burn in lava
[1:04:04] c4r8_uk: they'll be another round
[1:04:06] dampishwheat430: would it drop if its not a player kill?
[1:04:08] AmperSandworm: there will be more tho
[1:04:11] VogelVrouw: oh yeah we dont want that
[1:04:11] kamitsu_jaffa: can witches drop totems?
[1:04:14] veryrealandrew: might be worth just skipping this raid
[1:04:21] monsieur_limpet: @kamitsu_jaffa no
[1:04:22] Another_JT: @kamitsu_jaffa no, but evokers do
[1:04:23] thewillowthing: gotta cover all caves next time
[1:04:24] ivorycricketcap: could use water to funnel them to one spot at least?
[1:04:28] castlebeki: losing the totem is better than dying
[1:04:30] sofiywhite: Why?
[1:04:34] fufie_32: Won't it depend as well if there are evokers down there
[1:04:41] c4r8_uk: run away, let them win
[1:04:41] fufie_32: Nope I don't think so
[1:04:41] qwerties93: should be more raids - need evokers
[1:04:43] Another_JT: you can fail the raid
[1:04:44] freddystrawberry: you dont get totems from witches
[1:04:45] doxisontwitchnow: what's your simulation distance
[1:04:46] PengiSWE: move out 128 blocks from raid center (the villager keeping it up)
[1:04:48] ladynthread: I think raids time out?
[1:04:48] corvoidae: is there an evoker down there? i don’t think witches spawn totems
[1:04:49] PeanutGallery76: Do they time out after a while?
[1:04:54] SimplySuvi: I don’t think you can skip it can you?
[1:04:55] kamitsu_jaffa: @Another_JT i didnt see it but heard ren say witch
[1:04:56] xittttta: will time out eventually I think
[1:05:02] beouwolfe: they time out after 20 minutes
[1:05:03] corvoidae: witches don’t do totems
[1:05:06] kuruasu: turn on hitboxes?
[1:05:16] beouwolfe: you have to be away from the village, but i dont remember how far you have to go
[1:05:20] fufie_32: Does ren have torches
[1:05:23] tueddelich: check straight ahead walking towards the tower
[1:05:26] fufie_32: Oh good he does
[1:05:29] Another_JT: they might be down there, a naturally spawned witch may have joined the raid
[1:05:32] c4r8_uk: it's only evoker that drop totoem, you may have a max of one this round
[1:05:36] fufie_32: It does it a lot so no worries
[1:05:39] darknessbladers: This glitch makes for good content
[1:05:41] sapphire2626: could the bell be used to bait them out?
[1:05:58] ivorycricketcap: its ok :)
[1:05:59] thewillowthing: wow
[1:06:00] freddystrawberry: im off to bed guys
[1:06:02] rosette_prism: witch party
[1:06:05] corvoidae: witches don’t drop totems at least
[1:06:06] SmokedEnderMite: at least they are happy
[1:06:09] fufie_32: Better for you though really
[1:06:13] thewillowthing: they wander down
[1:06:18] kamitsu_jaffa: oh wow it was the whole wave
[1:06:22] Another_JT: They have to spawn on a spot with daylight, but they can fall into holes
[1:06:24] TheRooPlace: Maybe make an infinate water source and flood the cave
[1:06:25] scribofelidae: Witches are the woooorst
[1:06:25] PengiSWE: fetch milk
[1:06:27] castlebeki: milk?
[1:06:29] LisaOconnell1975: milk

[1:06:33] mcLeslie13: witches are the worst
[1:06:41] stormageddon07: dig in
[1:06:47] PhilHallBio: bucket of milk?
[1:06:48] VarioVant: They only should spawn on surface, maybe those are naturally spawned witches that joined the raid
[1:06:50] pipettipete: Tehy spawned on the fround, they just walked to the wrong place ;) MC AI..
[1:06:50] VogelVrouw: milk bucket would be good yeah

[1:06:54] art_by_sam: uh oh
[1:06:58] KarinJ00: oh god
[1:07:08] Panoplyx: poison noise is the worst
[1:07:08] KarinJ00: i hate witches
[1:07:08] corvoidae: you’re not poisoned anymore at least
[1:07:09] DOSGamerMan: according to tango they can only spawn on the highest block and it has to be a spawnable block. should not be underground .
[1:07:10] KarinJ00: eat some more
[1:07:15] KarinJ00: dont forget your golden apples
[1:07:16] Another_JT: Raid waves always spawn on the top-most air block, but they do sometimes fall into holes
[1:07:20] DareDevinX: I just joined and almost saw you die. incredible timing
[1:07:20] EvaRock08: all that planning and prep, eh.

[1:08:50] foxinatorz: Ravager behind you Kappa
[1:08:52] Raynj12: Turning up sim distance did nothing lol
[1:08:55] corvoidae: this is just silly
[1:09:00] darknessbladers: @doxisontwitchnow NO then the bar would decrease, ravenger might be deeper down

[1:09:48] Another_JT: listen for the horn, tells you where they spawn
[1:09:49] hippobessie: When cub does raids I think he lowers his sim distance a lot whole standing in the village
