[1:01:57] JustWD: just be glad blocks dont fall down when suspended too far
[1:02:02] DemonicHell3: I can do the unstable ingots if we need to
[1:02:08] Qbertman: everything in GT should come with an inherent "by comparison"
[1:02:10] Mandorake: really good
[1:02:10] david_boonty: not playing
[1:02:12] 514484: how do you make them? i can't remember

[1:02:24] LegacyOfPain: it got boring fast
[1:02:24] TogglesLore: Its been fun
[1:02:26] Senrian: D4 didn't look too fun tbh
[1:02:30] Mandorake: @Giantwaffle im doing side quests and its fun
[1:02:36] 2Flip: pretty boring 60+
[1:02:37] zPanda: the side quests actually have better story then the main game
[1:02:39] Warkless: RENOWN FARM IS SO Unaware
[1:02:42] zPanda: not even joking
[1:02:42] BattleRedHTX: you can skip campaign on all characters after you finish
[1:02:43] Enforcerr_: I am destroying content on barb  so the nerf did nothing lol
[1:02:48] Thezeekeal2: do mine eyes deceive me? Is the Great @Giantwaffle playing the Minecraft again?!?! Man it's been a while since I've been here but, I remember some of your coolest bases! 'member when you drained that !HUGE! section of ocean for the base?
[1:02:48] Mandorake: poe with 10 years of end game
[1:02:52] Beltorz: only have 3 dungeons left and a few side quests left for all renown.
[1:03:06] SawyerStreamsStuff: yeahhhhh i see that
[1:03:07] Dibbsu: Oh I really enjoy the low entry cost for crafting though compared to PoE.
[1:03:11] Thezeekeal2: !following
[1:03:17] Valseki: As someone that has never played POE, I am super intimidated by it
[1:03:17] Mandorake: i hate currency
[1:03:20] rell3k: poes maps are just so much rng on top of rng with all the seasonal stuff, the layouts, affixes.. thats whats kept the game going for over 10y
[1:03:21] kotwin: mob density feels off in diablo, maybe they'll fix it
[1:03:27] Valseki: Feels like its too complicated
[1:03:28] kenshin2666: it is certainly simplified
[1:03:29] Mandorake: im glad there is no trading honestly
[1:03:35] Mandorake: SSF by default
[1:03:37] DemonicHell3: At least D4 doesn't have the crazy amount of systems that PoE does.
[1:03:37] joewillrob: good, ssf all the way
[1:03:38] Warkless: we don't know shit yet NODDERS
[1:03:44] Dibbsu: I only play SSF so what is trading.
[1:03:47] StardustDragon08: Base building? PauseChamp
[1:03:48] Mandorake: i rather play the game than play an AH

[1:03:55] zPanda: not being able to trade crafting stuff
[1:03:56] zPanda: is cringe
[1:04:19] joewillrob: @zPanda ye but rmt is also pretty cringe
[1:04:33] Mandorake: @Giantwaffle i like that you're rewarded for playing the game and getting drops instead of just sitting and watching auction houses
[1:04:34] zPanda: people are already RMTing gold anyway
[1:04:42] Valseki: d3 was like that
[1:04:54] pwrreset: it's a lazy solution
[1:05:08] Zyie: I prefer being able to trade, that's part of why I think D2 is the best diablo game so far, especially D2R. If you want to play self found, you can do that even if others can trade.
[1:05:11] aundros: Waffle, please. thats off center I think
[1:05:14] Qbertman: as a mostly ssf player i have zero issues
[1:05:42] 2Flip: @aundros let him cook, and find out later Kappa
[1:05:52] kotwin: @Giantwaffle what do you pay for items though? Just gold?
[1:05:52] aundros: oh my bad. Its centered
[1:05:54] SawyerStreamsStuff: can you even DO that? i thought trading items were limited to having been there when it dropped or something like that
[1:06:00] Dibbsu: When are they releasing an idle style game for diablo that'd slap.
[1:06:01] TheDanishGuy1: waffleAYAYO

[3:04:07] Valseki: PS Gamers: I wish I had more options for hardware. Also PC gamers: OMG LOL MAC GAMES
[3:04:09] Nexhunter: @0x4273 cause they supported opengl and got burned by it KEKW
[3:04:09] Penca53: Does it help with running MC on Mac? Currently it's all Rosetta.
[3:04:14] MaIlchad: @Tech oh it's like that? that's cool. wonder if they pulled off the work on MoltenVK
[3:04:18] Valseki: PC*
[3:04:26] noxiiiouse: compat layer means bad performance no ?@Tech
[3:04:28] Nexhunter: @0x4273 so they're not gonna rely upon a 3rd party when they can develop their own layer KEKW
[3:04:32] Tech: @mahoraz It's basically a patch on top of wine
[3:04:34] SailorWS: Apple is the king of reinventing major breakthroughs from 5 years ago
[3:04:38] Tech: it's not brand new from scratch
[3:04:55] Valseki: @noxiiiouse It can transcompile shaders and gives devs options for more fine tuning
[3:05:01] Tech: @Tech NODDERS
[3:05:01] SailorWS: and the world goes crazy for it
[3:05:06] Valseki: Its really great for gaming, but people are just shitting on it
[3:05:19] MaIlchad: GregTech needs even more chemical reactors lul
[3:05:24] Tech: @SailorWS I mean it's not reinventing?
[3:05:24] Tech: LUL
[3:05:25] maccabeus: the DML room was chefsKiss
[3:05:29] SailorWS: Soon™
[3:05:46] FREEZE_ball: @Valseki as a linux user i agree - the less exclusivity, the better
[3:05:46] Speedglass: vr is great because im near sighted and when i use vr or mobile my eyes get stronger
[3:05:49] MaIlchad: @SailorWS Nah. Just reselling as "new and innovative" and having people slurp up the marketing :)
[3:05:57] Ensign: did Pati beat GTNH?
[3:06:00] SailorWS: chat I have haircut now. Don't let Waffle make any new progress while I am gone
[3:06:03] Speedglass: i dont need glasses because the screen is close enough
[3:06:03] SimonSez: We talking about the DX12 layer that someone is working on for MacS?
[3:06:04] maccabeus: @Ensign Stare

[3:06:14] Nexhunter: @SimonSez no
[3:06:21] punkgeek: laceKnife
[3:06:22] MaIlchad: It will be good to have games on mac but I have worries about developers actually wanting to maintain their games on mac. apple keeps breaking apps.
[3:06:44] lava4o4: yalls thoughts on messi going to miami??
[3:06:45] MaIlchad: @Ensign no. got to about EV and AE2 and then the server got nuked
[3:06:51] Valseki: @MaIlchad outside of the hardware layer, breaking changes shouldn't matter
[3:06:54] Stragmol: lube
[3:06:54] DaddyDiddy: lubricant cell
[3:07:04] Speedglass: im sure well see apps just for the apple vr
[3:07:06] kane1941: creosote
[3:07:06] KuramaTheF0X: use creosote
[3:07:22] arkun_: They’re probably be more concerned making it compatible with actual Proton and Steam Deck @mailchad
[3:07:29] Speedglass: a bunch of apple tv shows ive missed out on
[3:07:40] mainG__: Pog
[3:07:43] maccabeus: YEP Lube
[3:08:04] KuramaTheF0X: you can also use creosote oil @Giantwaffle im pretty sure you got plenty of that
[3:08:15] Stragmol: skele on wall

[3:09:17] Nexhunter: @Tech did you see that folks already got CP2077 and D4 running on M1s
[3:09:18] daemonaedryn: the base bitch Pog

[3:09:29] Dr_McCarthy: @xxLatte cells within cells interlinked NODDERS
[3:09:34] Immp: You need to make another funny noise Waffle, then Nino will have something to do KEKW
[3:09:44] That_Lurker: @Nexhunter How was the performance?
[3:10:05] MaIlchad: MV is a bit ambitious, but you can probably get some parts for it
[3:10:15] Nexhunter: @That_Lurker for D4 they are running on medium settings they didn't have the fps window up sadly
[3:11:11] Nexhunter: for CP2077 @That_Lurker like 10 to 30fps depending upon what looking at on ultra preset
[3:11:23] maccabeus: just turn down the AC 4Head
[3:11:29] sambuchota: i think if you do enough minesweepers you can do al of MV
[3:11:33] That_Lurker: @ninopanda Ok. Sound like with little optimization they will be quite playable
[3:11:41] Nexhunter: @That_Lurker D4 was on a M1 max and CP2077 regular M1
[3:12:15] ninopanda: @That_Lurker huh?
[3:12:20] Mick_: dont you have LV pumps in storage?
[3:12:28] ninopanda: D4 has not had any issues
[3:12:31] 0omkins: just fully on Low now, it's fucked.
[3:12:33] Nexhunter: i haven't turned it down cause my issue is the ping
[3:12:42] KadMan04: @Giantwaffle its nvidia refflex causing it turn it off
[3:12:44] ObsceneSanity: Im on full low now
[3:12:44] noxiiiouse: for me game is really laggy with 3070 @ 1440p
[3:12:46] spicebroth: i have the same problem ahhh ok
[3:12:48] Linkitch: I had big lag spikes when loading new zones with Ultra textures. Turned the down to High and the problem went away
[3:12:49] Xev_00: Yeah I had to turn mine way down, my laptop sounded like it wanted to melt
[3:12:53] Nexhunter: the surprising thing is just the fact they're having to go through two translation layers with the x86 and dx api calls @That_Lurker
[3:12:55] That_Lurker: @ninopanda hmmm aparently twitch decide to tab complete you
[3:13:01] KC_GingerSnapz: nah ultra that shit

[3:13:14] goldenwerewolf: But how will you feel immersed in the gibs hitting your $20k monitor?
[3:13:18] Beufff: yeah. my fps would drop from like 60 to 8 when moving into different areas
[3:13:25] Changeturn1: it probably wants too
[3:13:27] KC_GingerSnapz: are you on a 4090?
[3:13:28] b_hotel: Update gfx drivers too, that fixed my lag spikes @Giantwaffle
[3:13:29] myKunami: limit FPS on nvidia settings
[3:13:40] Nexhunter: @That_Lurker ~60fps  for D4 on the medium settings
[3:13:45] AviNex_: we were talking about it yesterday so came back to hear your thoughts on twitch apologizing today for their policy change

[3:26:32] pixfix2k2: Don't need dust just alloy smelter

[3:26:34] shumily: alloy smelter
[3:26:39] CowofJustice: SURELY
[3:26:46] restfulblue: @Giantwaffle check last recipe in alloy smetler, you could make it from two ingots
[3:26:48] goldenwerewolf: Wrong, correct.
[3:26:58] Champdemain: Called coppernickle no? KEKW
[3:27:00] StOrMy1100: Just use a green screen for ads behind you as a streamer

[3:27:14] DaddyDiddy: steam one doesn't work i don't think
[3:27:15] 0x4273: :tf:

[3:28:36] DaddyDiddy: oh waffle pati probably didn't mention this to you but if you click "ctrl + shift + a" on the recipe for something, it'll pull up all the components in your NEI, and then you can see how many exactly you need without having to do the math @Giantwaffle
[3:28:58] ZeDukeofFlies: i can't move away from steam, all my games are there...

[3:29:38] ZeDukeofFlies: it was just a joke.
[3:29:57] PMM67899: haha. xD
[3:29:59] Doomwyte: @Wetware im not an ad person so I don't know the options, but I doubt the possibility of losing 600k viewers is worth getting a few dollars in ads going excluslty to youtube, and who knows there might be exceptinos for that kind of event /shrug
[3:30:12] helisus: @drummernerd tier?

[4:59:50] maccabeus: adding one panda made the factory go 20x faster
[4:59:56] MetalBBA: more ppl lets you blast through the manual collection phases
[4:59:57] Solitude411: or like the black melter thing
[5:00:02] DaddyDiddy: well if you had like 15 people and each person was sent to mine out a different vein, you could gather resources a lot lot faster
[5:00:26] Tekbot: Brute force it by having everyone make their own factories and consolidate
[5:00:27] punkgeek: Some things would be faster, some wouldn't be
[5:00:28] hisdue: PridePog ORB

[5:00:35] TheMeowstardCat: Mine the entire world
[5:00:36] Provision_: @metalbba well you still need to process the resources. Which is slow.
[5:00:42] earthtowers: more people will have diminishing returns
[5:00:53] Tekbot: Not 70x faster at least
[5:00:54] mildlysalted: dedicated minesweeper guys for progression skipping?
[5:00:54] CPUfreezer: just dudes gathering resources so you can focus on crafting could help quite a bit
[5:00:59] earthtowers: 2 will probably be 2x as fast as one, but 3 people is probably not 3x as fast
[5:01:00] kane1941: put the Steam macerator in use

[5:29:36] Gorlocker: i added the guy that has my name and someone already offered him $500 for it
[5:29:38] OddsTV: @simenad discord is slowly rolling out changes to names. you select a unique name, like a twitter handle
[5:29:46] KuramaTheF0X: what annoyed me is that 2h before i was able to take mine, i checked the ones i wanted and they were all not taken yet .. and boom they were once i was able to choose Madge
[5:29:50] GFQPR1882: @giantwaffle can u change ur name easily after u’ve picked ur name ? Jw
[5:29:52] HarbingerNo9: how do you know when its available to change?
[5:29:56] Jolle450: kappathirteen
[5:29:59] simenad: Ok, but do i loose what i already have @OddsTV ?
[5:29:59] kenshin2666: good to know, ty <3
[5:30:00] daemonaedryn: monkaHmm
[5:30:04] KiloJoel: that means right click on that item is disabled to prevent a bug
[5:30:23] Dagmoo: Also if you were a 2015 account and didnt get your name but someone from 2017 got it that kinda sucks. I get prio for Nitro but thats a bummer.
[5:30:25] kappathirteen: You rang @Jolle450 monkaHmm
[5:30:32] AIex_0: yeah you can
[5:30:55] deadgolfer: 2 output buses...
[5:31:00] Jolle450: @kappathirteen I was looking for someone named "Kappa". Wrong address, my bad.
[5:31:14] deadgolfer: you scrolled over 2 to get to 1
[5:31:15] DaddyDiddy: use a screwdriver
[5:31:19] deadgolfer: processed as a 2
[5:31:19] daemonaedryn: LUL
[5:31:20] chochi314: You did both with "2"
[5:31:26] daemonaedryn: you can probably laternate them rigfht
[5:31:28] daemonaedryn: alternate&*
[5:31:44] daemonaedryn: maybe in crafting menu?
[5:31:47] EmotePerMessage: disassemble machine, but its must be later
[5:31:47] DragonApoc: I think crafting it reverses it
[5:31:50] TheIrishGuy: put in alt hand?
[5:31:53] mikwitty: chat any recommendations for a GPU upgrade from a 1070 ?
[5:32:03] OddsTV: just turn it 180 degrees 4Head
[5:32:03] deadgolfer: crafting grid with screwdriver

[5:32:12] urh111: put in hand crafting it works for sure

[5:33:58] TheMeowstardCat: Anyone have an update on Discord name year? Still nothing for me
[5:34:00] cosmicblip: I wonder if  streamers are going to take less vacations knowing that twitch can now cancel inactive accounts under the contracts shortyHMM
[5:34:47] silv: https://i.imgur.com/DdbB8IL.png pepeSmoke lets goo
[5:35:00] mrkaszkeit: hey waffle and chat

[5:35:04] KuramaTheF0X: @silv Clap
[5:35:06] cosmicblip: Affiliate contract doesn't exist anymore they're merging contracts together now with the recent news
[5:35:16] That_Lurker: @silv @silv Go touch some grass Clap
[5:35:17] TheMeowstardCat: Wait Twitch can deactive my account if I do not stream?
[5:35:34] TheMeowstardCat: deactivate *
[5:35:43] mrkaszkeit: damn, a lot happened on the server in a day
[5:35:45] ninopanda: @Giantwaffle did you give me back my hammer?
[5:35:47] SimonSez: no
[5:35:57] ninopanda: ok keep it
[5:36:04] ninopanda: ill make me a new one tonight
[5:36:05] DaddyDiddy: waffle look at chat and buy some tin cable

[5:36:18] AnesthesiaFC: i say the same thing everyday
[5:36:25] DaddyDiddy: yeah but its a cooldown
[5:36:27] kane1941: it is limited per player
[5:36:32] MetalBBA: there is a cooldown on buying
[5:37:03] DaddyDiddy: 20 min
[5:37:21] sisterbeth: momma pati feeds his kids :3
[5:37:41] cosmicblip: Some streamers are being forced to sign new contracts and if they don't twitch will demote them down to affiliate until they sign a new contract that's so dumb
[5:38:06] mrkaszkeit: yet
[5:38:09] deadgolfer: twitch is dead
[5:38:09] omar_i_: COPIUM
[5:38:14] HarbingerNo9: its easy internet points
[5:38:14] TheMeowstardCat: Yea no reason, They are going to go into porno site....
[5:38:21] TheRackster: No, we riot peepoRiot
[5:38:23] usernameNull: I dunno, twitter and reddit are trying too pretty hard
[5:38:24] DrHax_: as usual, change bad, internet mad ReallyMad
[5:38:26] Linkitch: I can't relax anymore, or I'll poop my pants
[5:38:27] Oodeanoo: Waffle confirmed shareholder
[5:38:27] AIex_0: im so surprised how many viewers are trying to defend more ads just directly from streamer KEKW
[5:38:29] xxLatte: swear?
[5:38:30] peacockbarista: its ok until its not, just relax chat
[5:38:32] IronGajeel: trust in amazon Kappa
[5:38:33] StardustDragon08: Wait I thought Twitch was dying what do you mean calm down?? KEKW
[5:38:34] Schb3rg: twitch already died, you are not here. This is not reality
[5:38:34] OddsTV: my torch stays unlit, but ready. ever ready.
[5:38:37] deadgolfer: i heard they are rumored to merge with OF
[5:38:38] meller127: yepp twitch is out, now we have to stream on skype
[5:38:38] Al_Kappaccino: jk
[5:38:40] AnesthesiaFC: how many times have people said "RIP Twitch" in the past 5 years LUL
[5:38:44] Provision_: @deadgolfer if twitch is dead. Then streaming does not exist LUL
[5:38:47] Rhink: @Giantwaffle Remember that one time you said this was going to take like a month to get to?
[5:38:58] OddsTV: lets all go stream on Aol Instant Messenger
[5:39:00] SimonSez: Also. People saying "just go to another platform" forgets that this is the only platform with Twitch Prime
[5:39:06] hackett33: I spend 0 time thinking about any TOS, if im ok with not owning any of my games in Steam I pretty numb to anything else
[5:39:09] rajahgold: yo that glass be THICC
[5:39:13] StardustDragon08: @SimonSez also what other platform lol
[5:39:17] arkun_: This is pretty standard contact/TOS stuff, as bad as it sounds
[5:39:22] FREEZE_ball: you are welcome
[5:39:27] robtwitch7777: this is day 3 wtf lol
[5:39:41] HarbingerNo9: @Rhink they are like 1% thru GTNH
[5:39:42] arkun_: Contract *
[5:39:57] Oodeanoo: @Giantwaffle Are the rest of the server in a call or something? How do you all work simultaneously so well
[5:39:59] Beufff: of course not. its twitch chat
[5:40:06] CPUfreezer: drue
[5:40:13] Obliviron: Every single professional contract fucks over the non-corporate party sooooo hard. Every time. So if you think a contract is "good", you haven't read it
[5:40:15] LidlFrog: They just want the option to use that as a reason Kappa
[5:40:30] DaddyDiddy: you do not need that waffle
[5:40:31] OddsTV: when I got affiliate and read through, they said if you didnt hit a threshold over 12 months youd lose it. that never ever happened, to me or anyone i know
[5:40:32] DaddyDiddy: wrong recipe
[5:40:34] Rhink: @HarbingerNo9 Yeah, but he was worried it would take a month to get to AE systems. The rate they are currently going, they could probably have small autocrafting set up by Saturday.
[5:40:34] Beufff: even most people in a career job never see contract terminology
[5:40:36] OddsTV: their contracts are loosey goosey
[5:40:39] Wazix11: I've been a Twitch affiliate for the last like 5 years and haven't streamed in something like 4 years lmao
[5:40:39] DaddyDiddy: that one
[5:40:48] DaddyDiddy: with all the tools is the one we use for now
[5:40:49] marcay2: Naive is the word.
[5:41:05] daemonaedryn: Daddy chill
[5:41:19] StardustDragon08: Let the hatred flow through you
[5:41:31] AIex_0: just some streamers blowing it up tbh cause they need to profit more LUL
[5:41:33] OddsTV: me and Bezos golf on thursdays so were chill on the contract clauses
[5:41:45] arkun_: I told my coworkers about our non compete clause in our contracts, and my coworkers were "WTF" while I was like an I the only one who actually reads this stuff
[5:42:24] OddsTV: to be fair, streamers freaking out is warranted bc its legit their entire livelihood. they see red flags and freak, usually knee jerk reactions
[5:42:25] usernameNull: non-compete are hard to enforce, but non-solicit for managers is pretty easy to enforce
[5:42:27] subfin: its not so much that theyre illegal, as much as theyre hard to enforce
[5:42:28] TheRackster: @Giantwaffle You seen that Mick did 152 laps in the W14?
[5:42:30] 0x4273: They have no legal weight in the US but theyre still pretty common
[5:42:32] mark_steele: ya non-compete aren't enforceable in most places now unless you're doing shady things like poaching clients when you leave
[5:42:33] Krystalchan: its because a lot of non-compete tend to be hard to enforce or too broad
[5:42:38] Duckaerobics: They still end up in a lot of contracts, but they are mostly uneforcable
[5:42:42] Obliviron: Every contract is very anti-employee @Giantwaffle
[5:42:46] Wazix11: Not competes have to be very specific to be able to hold up in court
[5:42:50] Smithii: Dosn't a non-compete require the company to pay you in the periode?
[5:42:50] dominusdunlap: Non-competes enforcement is more state to state...my industry uses them
[5:43:07] Wolfgreg93: I have 9ne and they pay me extra 1000 bucks
[5:43:07] Moobot: You can find Waffle's Youtube channel here - https://youtube.com/giantwaffle
[5:43:10] boltzmanC: non-compete are illegal in California
[5:43:14] usernameNull: non-solicit means you can't hire other people from the company, I had to wait an extra 6 months to change jobs because of the guy hiring me
[5:43:15] Rhink: I signed a non-compete when I worked for Jimmy Johns. Believe the time period was 1 year.
[5:43:22] arkun_: Not dox myself, but I think my state didn't give a crap about non-competes
[5:43:24] marcay2: Is there any Minecraft music.
[5:43:25] dpkoz: yeah depends on the state
[5:43:27] Great_Briton42: I had one for my consulting job.
[5:43:29] arkun_: To dox*
[5:43:37] BilusTheTiny: if it's the exact same service, sure but same domain I doubt it's applicable
[5:43:37] orionebt: orionebt subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 19 months! hi
[5:43:38] DorkManTV: I think the bigger problem is when government employees go to private companies
[5:43:38] burimmm: I have mine 2years

[5:43:41] Helo_KiX: Does Waffle follow soccer at all?
[5:43:42] TheRackster: My company tried to do that and got slammed in court cus it didnt hold up with the laws in Sweden
[5:43:44] arkun_: On mobile btw

[5:44:05] GRAWLICKz: Sup @Rhink , it's PencePrime LUL
[5:44:08] Great_Briton42: prevented being poached by my client by just meeting in middle (pay me more than my firm pays me, but less than what my firm was charging the client)
[5:44:12] yorkzOG: I have a 18month
[5:44:37] drees1210: Messi to the MLS!! UNREAL

[5:45:34] omar_i_: chainsaw
[5:45:37] staccatone: Does anybody know where to get crushed bones in diablo?
[5:45:37] DaddyDiddy: actually i don't think it works in the crafting station @Giantwaffle
[5:45:43] Rhink: @GRAWLICKz How's it going man?
[5:45:52] DaddyDiddy: oh you also put the hammer and file in the wrong place
[5:45:58] Krystalchan: what kind of saw are you using though?
[5:46:02] Frooonti: These maintenance hatches are weird to craft
[5:46:02] L707644: @unknowndrees that's kinda sad.. Seems like his career is over now. Seemed like he had few years more of pro football
[5:46:13] Comis19: Wrench
[5:46:14] Etwas77: @staccatone go into material and hover over it it says where you get it

[5:46:28] Grug16: Is this an automation mod?
[5:46:30] MetalBBA: hand tools are always just what ever hand tool you have. The different tiers are solely for what materials they're made from for durability
[5:46:59] Rhink: @GRAWLICKz That's good... Still using those emotes btw. rhinkHey rhinkWay

[5:48:12] GRAWLICKz: @GRAWLICKz Wow I completely forgot about that LUL that monkey could use some work lmao
[5:48:17] BattleRedHTX: sounds like an awful mod lol
[5:48:31] 0x4273: GTNH is more strict about placement in multiblocks than nomifactory
[5:48:34] timbit123: @Neb666 yes you couldn't go in a competing company and redo your work. normally you have contract that doesn't allow you to do that. I don't think that would apply to giantwaffle
[5:48:40] MetalBBA: now you gotta fix it
[5:48:40] pixfix2k2: Incomplete structure
[5:48:48] k1n3c7x: Incomplete structure
[5:48:50] Rhink: @GRAWLICKz Definitely. I have been checking Fiverr for the past month or so but I havent really liked people's style

[5:56:30] Melinkie: hows d4 going, you playing off stream?
[5:56:56] CarriedNeko: twitter overreacts heavily
[5:56:57] Krystalchan: Twitch... Deleted... Reduced to packets
[5:57:03] OishiisDelicious: its the streamers who are gaslighting their viewers.  i for one think that 3% screen space for their ads is a great upgrade
[5:57:08] Rhink: There is a claim all button on the left side... 3rd one down
[5:57:21] AIex_0: they're the ones who blew it out of proportion LUL
[5:57:32] MaxWeeman: TLDR of what twitch did?
[5:57:35] 514484: the era of panic and outrage
[5:57:37] BADboiz_TV: Base is looking good! waffleAYAYA
[5:57:38] phoss2k: how long will you be joining the gtnh grind? missed the MC streams VoHiYo
[5:57:40] AIex_0: any signs of losing money they lose their shit KEKW
[5:57:50] Krystalchan: @MaxWeeman new promoted content/ad policies for creators

[5:57:51] DaddyDiddy: waffle check game chat
[5:57:57] IronGajeel: tbh i kinda blame OTK for that exaggerated drama
[5:58:04] drummernerd: Wokege
[5:58:13] Krystalchan: jump inside :)
[5:58:13] pixfix2k2: Buy an egg
[5:58:23] cosmicblip: Since when did they add a new graphics option to Minecraft the new version has fast fancy and now fabulous unless it's been in previous versions of Java Minecraft
[5:58:38] LennokTheFirst: poor guy
[5:58:41] clumsykoala: yo rigght, but the majority wants to make this as living and dont like gambling no?
[5:58:42] pixfix2k2: Hope for a regenerating endurance for infinite pearls

[5:58:45] drummernerd: Sadge
[5:58:46] WetDonutHole: smoke liquid ender pepeSmoke
[5:58:51] Bored______________: feels like only the rich streamers seem to care... LUL cries in millions
[5:58:55] ShireaTV: feels like the relationship between streamer and the platform administration was muddied by the bloat of just time and the "growth" of the platform
[5:58:57] IronGajeel: asmon came from a break to shit on twitch for 4 hours
[5:58:59] whatthe_craft: It just "Twitter Brain" I think
[5:59:00] Grav1s: pepeSmoke
[5:59:03] AnesthesiaFC: jump in and save the ender pearl, then ender peral out
[5:59:04] GFQPR1882: ? are the ads that twitch show now gonna be 3% of my screen KEKW
[5:59:09] liquidmoonlight: graveyard keeper moment here
[5:59:09] daZonk: Biggest issue with twitch changes is it presents a potential goal to begin your only option for brand deals. It’s not that today, but this “could
[5:59:15] AIex_0: the changes weren't even that bad its actually better for the viewers
[5:59:17] BADboiz_TV: Things were bound to change once Amazon purchased Twitch
[5:59:19] daZonk: “This could be a framework to get there.
[5:59:20] HoloJr: 2 pearls inside now
[5:59:26] clumsykoala: i guess. but the ads. they want to be the "Midlemand" on ads
[5:59:35] AIex_0: i dunno why viewers wanna see more ads burned in on streams LUL
[5:59:35] Moobot: You can sub to Waffle by clicking this neat link -> twitch.tv/giantwaffle/subscribe SUBprise
[5:59:39] A_BroHam_Lincoln: makes liquid waffle!
[5:59:42] drummernerd: HUH
[5:59:44] xrader858: i watch streamers who are affected by it
[5:59:51] IronGajeel: @Drudo not at all, do you think twitch will ban esports events? sponsors can still advertise but in smaller ads
[5:59:58] siebharrin: I'm never happy
[6:00:00] peacockbarista: COPIUM
[6:00:01] Krystalchan: monkaS Why is there a sphere in your minecraft world?
[6:00:08] BattleRedHTX: twitch is just a company that wants money lets be real
[6:00:12] Opsidill: i prefer sponsored content over twitch ads lol
[6:00:13] AGuyHighInTheSky: Haven't seen any ads in the last 2 years LUL
[6:00:14] clumsykoala: its about twicth be profitable
[6:00:16] HoloJr: Rather have that than forced ad’s from twitch
[6:00:16] LastWarriorKing: I hate how ads mute the streams
[6:00:20] liquidmoonlight: @Giantwaffle fireplace went mad
[6:00:20] OrangeW2: they spilled paint by communicating like dumbasses, really, they just followed what YouTube did, which already works fine
[6:00:22] AIex_0: @Opsidill its still an ad tho
[6:00:22] ShireaTV: if they keep jacking up turbo prices then ill stop being happy
[6:00:23] That_Lurker: the heck happened to the fireplace
[6:00:24] Bleu_Forge: I'd rather an ad take up 10% of the screen than 90 seconds of full screen ads Okayge
[6:00:25] kane1941: @Krystalchan they are invading this dimension from theirs
[6:00:30] OddsTV: onscreen ads dont bother me. interrupt my entire viewing experience with 8 30 second ads makes me angry
[6:00:33] Bbluess: @Giantwaffle fireplace is running an ad
[6:00:37] daZonk: YouTube has many of the items twitch mentioned, it’s just not really enforced.
[6:00:39] Kardiiac: everything was so very specific too, so idk why their reaction was it was overly broadly vague
[6:00:40] Aldizzert: I'm not a Yawl.  I identify as a Ketch
[6:00:41] mark_steele: they outright stated they were trying to crack down on people running full on advertisements from third party ad networks
[6:00:43] 0x4273: classic LuL
[6:00:45] AIex_0: people literally run sponsor block on youtube to avoid this stuff KEKW
[6:00:50] MUHFUGGIN: because Bud Light
[6:00:52] Anwedie: Bud Light needs new buyers? LUL
[6:00:53] GFQPR1882: My big ? Is why they don’t just advertise the shit out of turbo ?
[6:00:54] TheWumbologist101: That’s a pretty generous interpretation
[6:00:57] Greased315: They don't want a My Pillow ad popping up LUL
[6:00:59] drummernerd: KEKW
[6:00:59] TheMeowstardCat: Yes idk why the alcohol is allowed but not weed....
[6:01:02] Krystalchan: They dont want the pot sponsorships because federally it would cause issues around the money
[6:01:02] GFQPR1882: I’ve not seen one
[6:01:03] liquidmoonlight: fireplace has ads?
[6:01:07] kappathirteen: I dont understand the no tobacco products when alcohol is allowed? FeelsWeirdMan
[6:01:07] liquidmoonlight: har
[6:01:11] StOrMy1100: Streamers already came up with fullscreen green screen ads
[6:01:12] StardustDragon08: @Greased315 or Bud Light KEKW
[6:01:15] 0x4273: no weed but alcoholism is cool
[6:01:16] Helo_KiX: Is the fireplace less than 3% of the screen? KEKW
[6:01:17] luthal_: @GFQPR1882 turbo makes them less money
[6:01:17] Bleu_Forge: because alcohol is federally legal but weed is not TheMeowstardCat ....
[6:01:19] LastWarriorKing: i wouldnt mind a small banner ad but full screen is annoying
[6:01:24] drummernerd: yea, that’s where the screwed up big
[6:01:25] Hippopothomas: They don't want cannabis but they let just chatting be the wild west while minors watch? You can't have both. Twitch can't care about people while not caring about them.
[6:01:27] ShireaTV: im pretty sure Skybilz and Sequisha had no clue yea
[6:01:30] clumsykoala: The current Ad blog they made. esports cant happens. streamers like LTT cant make wan show
[6:01:41] GFQPR1882: @luthal_ Oh that makes sense them KEKW
[6:01:42] TechNaOkami: apparently asmongold and some others did and they didnt listen to them
[6:01:44] AGuyHighInTheSky: Honestly, the entire 'shotgun' ad industry needs to just go away :)
[6:01:45] Rhink: What about RAID shadow legends?
[6:01:47] IronGajeel: @Giantwaffle dexerto says the one ring MTG card is at 1mil
[6:01:49] GFQPR1882: Then*
[6:01:54] StOrMy1100: @Hippopothomas Probably has to do with laws
[6:01:55] MUHFUGGIN: F for GDQ as well
[6:02:03] luthal_: @GFQPR1882 yeah, they even just raised the price on it too
[6:02:06] SimonSez: It says unless you have an agreement with Twitch

[6:02:59] Ataiu: Will i be able to buy those packs in germany? thinking about local stores or do i need to buy them online in english?
[6:03:00] Krystalchan: so would you say, its the one ring to rule them all?
[6:03:07] Giantsfan981: The portion where they say you can’t show your own created ad for a sponsor has to be a hit to the Critical Role stream. A lot of their ads are amazingly roleplayed.
[6:03:09] maccabeus: paper nft KEKW
[6:03:10] HeyAFrozenZebra: Post Malone has an artist proof Black Lotus, he's gonna end up with this right for sure
[6:03:12] YukiBloodbornGaming: im speculating the bounty will be 10 million by the end of it
[6:03:12] officialhunterx: i thought it was 10 million
[6:03:13] MushuTushu: sell it for more at auction probably
[6:03:15] Stretford_Sean: Imagine creasing it when you open the pack
[6:03:19] 514484: i'll draw a shitty ring on a piece of paper, that'll be unique too EZ
[6:03:20] FREEZE_ball: "cool"
[6:03:22] peacockbarista: KEKW so dumb

[6:03:23] IronGajeel: Elon musk claims Twitter could compete with Twitch streaming
[6:03:29] Aldizzert: Is it insanely powerful in-game?
[6:03:33] mattitu: The card is only unique with the art, a different art with the same card will be more common.
[6:03:33] mark_steele: They explicitly said you could do that
[6:03:33] kappathirteen: Lets go buy some MTG cards boys LETSGO
[6:03:34] AIex_0: yeah things on stream were fine
[6:03:38] StardustDragon08: @IronGajeel at this point it wouldn't surprise me
[6:03:42] HeyAFrozenZebra: Best Part about the One Ring is that the card is already curled
[6:03:44] FairePlaie: does is the same as mac donnald monopoly game ?
[6:03:45] AIex_0: its just the full screen videos that werent
[6:03:48] orgapaap: no it sucks
[6:03:49] daZonk: In before someone just prints and makes it that works in the factory and claims bounty and dips
[6:03:50] OishiisDelicious: its not OP
[6:03:50] Krystalchan: KEKW People would proxy the shit out of it

[6:04:02] hoghad: There was a factorio update today ?!?!
[6:04:05] IronGajeel: @Beufff KEKW
[6:04:06] Tyler10325: the holos bend so damn easy
[6:04:08] Helo_KiX: I'm pretty sure that is an alternate art, there will be a normal playable version.
[6:04:09] mattitu: yes there is
[6:04:12] IronGajeel: yeah
[6:04:16] HeyAFrozenZebra: The Ring is a set mechanic, there's all sorts of different variations that are based in Book lore
[6:04:16] Belgarath81: that's how you know its a real card
[6:04:18] YukiBloodbornGaming: mythicspoiler is the best site

[6:04:37] broseph_larz: wasn't it so that the 3rd party ads were scrutinized?
[6:04:38] HeyAFrozenZebra: It's one of the sets in recent memory that I'm wanting to spend money on

[6:05:14] LittleNukey21: 4
[6:05:18] daZonk: If it is a one of one no way to know if the one claimed is real

[6:06:15] KuramaTheF0X: they had a special machine to shuffle it @Giantwaffle
[6:06:15] HeyAFrozenZebra: the internet becomes real
[6:06:16] Rolymole09: That is badASS
[6:06:17] GeneralSpoon12: oh right that yugioh deck
[6:06:19] bexderr: Did he win?
[6:06:20] Stragmol: penultimate geek photo
[6:06:20] maccabeus: actual anime villains
[6:06:20] Fastless: time to shuffle
[6:06:21] LegacyOfPain: @HeyAFrozenZebra 1995 lol
[6:06:22] VanDomand: They build that holder per hand btw
[6:06:23] RenatsMC: but the deck can only have 35 or somerhing cards
[6:06:25] A_BroHam_Lincoln: ICANT
[6:06:26] drummernerd: and the fedoras KEKW
[6:06:26] Krystalchan: KEKW the deck sheet was like 3 or 4 pages long. it was full of shuffle cards
[6:06:27] Jodeatre: big deck energy
[6:06:28] StardustDragon08: The deck was made to stall and wait out the opponent KEKW
[6:06:28] xxLatte: The fedoras KEKW
[6:06:33] BattleRedHTX: this is amazing lol
[6:06:34] LordPrime7: Heart of the Cards
[6:06:39] omar_i_: thats dedication
[6:06:41] Larklen: KEKW
[6:06:42] WookashPL: @GenerlKat It is, you must be able to shuffle it to be legal :p
[6:06:45] GeneralSpoon12: I enjoy protests like that
[6:06:53] YukiBloodbornGaming: it was the delinquent duo deck
[6:06:54] GFQPR1882: Is that a young Tom Cruise at the front?
[6:06:55] RenatsMC: its just for fun for memes
[6:06:57] A_BroHam_Lincoln: ICANT make the enemy surrender because it takes 2 hours to get started ICANT
[6:06:58] GFQPR1882: KEKW
[6:07:09] Stragmol: be funny to claim "I'm the reason they have that rule now"
[6:07:11] GenerlKat: Well technically you could shuffle 1000 cards
[6:07:12] ShireaTV: ICANT
[6:07:12] Myekos: he went down in history as causing a rule
[6:07:19] GuardMoony: and then you get 5 books 2inch thick of rules
[6:07:21] Egrassa22: Did he win?)
[6:07:33] robtwitch7777: back to work KEKW
[6:07:38] Larklen: he died of old age first from shuffling deck
[6:07:39] Moobot: You can find Waffle's Youtube channel here - https://youtube.com/giantwaffle
[6:07:40] StardustDragon08: @Stragmol I mean that has to be the reason someone does that right KEKW
[6:07:42] itsIffy: imagine have some spells that cause you to search a specific card in your deck, and then shuffle YEP
[6:07:43] Krystalchan: I wonder if the One Ring Card will be beaten out by Black Lotus in value down the line KEKW
[6:07:45] officialhunterx: that also happened in pokemon a guy was so unlucky they changed the game
[6:07:47] omar_i_: KEKW
[6:07:48] YukiBloodbornGaming: he was asked to drop from the tournament fun fact
[6:08:19] Yizzles: Yeah, lemme play one round and then I'll drop out KEKW
[6:08:19] broseph_larz: It would be the right thing to do obviously
[6:08:21] siebharrin: "C'mon man.. I just want to play some cards"
[6:08:22] The_Holas: i think they are still playing Waiting Kappa
[6:08:33] KuramaTheF0X: letMeCi
[6:08:38] NightsAngels: They are still shuffling that deck to this day.
[6:08:42] Krystalchan: @Giantwaffle did you ever see the value of the MTG Black Lotus?
[6:08:58] Zyie: @Krystalchan It's a 1/1 card, and it's a lotr card which will attract a lot of rich fans, I would be very surprised if it doesn't pretty much instantly.
[6:09:15] HeyAFrozenZebra: The lotus Post Malone has is worth like $800000
[6:09:16] wakm: wakm subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 12 months! 
[6:09:24] Dr_McCarthy: SURELY
[6:09:29] YukiBloodbornGaming: original power nine cards from alpha are worth around 250k
[6:09:36] DareDeFlug: It's insane
[6:09:57] siebharrin: should I play the lotto or should I buy MTG cards?
[6:09:58] ShireaTV: ever watch the video documentary on VIN WIKI about Smokey Eunuch who essentially is why half the nascar rules exist?
[6:10:04] LegacyOfPain: @YukiBloodbornGaming I started in Revised - rip me lol
[6:10:10] YukiBloodbornGaming: in mp
[6:10:11] kappathirteen: because its 1 of 1. Their also not allowed in gameplay either
[6:10:11] Myekos: alpha are different size, they can't be used in tournements
[6:10:19] AnesthesiaFC: 1
[6:10:40] Thills_: @Giantwaffle  chris wilson from ggg has a whole deck of misprinted magic cards
[6:10:41] A_BroHam_Lincoln: 1 of 1
[6:10:44] YukiBloodbornGaming: alpha have squarish corners
[6:10:47] Thills_: theres avideo on all of his cards
[6:10:48] Grimstar_: even after college research testing, p9 cards werent balanced
[6:10:49] Akunin_EQ: Alpha are rouded edges, and can be used in tourney if all cards are alpha
[6:10:49] HeyAFrozenZebra: All the serialized cards will never be reprinted, the set I think will get reprinted until there's no demand for it
[6:10:55] YukiBloodbornGaming: beta has rounded corners
[6:11:01] FREEZE_ball: devCheck what chris willson from ggg?
[6:11:05] Myekos: Thills_ he also has multiple black lotus
[6:11:11] mattitu: kappathirteen why would it not be allowed? Theres a normal version, only the art is unique on the 1 of 1 version.
[6:11:15] Thills_: @Myekos ya his collection is actually wild
[6:11:21] HeyAFrozenZebra: Oh yeah Chris Wilson does have a Black Lotur I forgot
[6:11:24] YukiBloodbornGaming: the play test alpha cards (Gamma) are worth far more than alpha lotus
[6:11:25] HeyAFrozenZebra: Lotus
[6:11:32] GFQPR1882: Whoever gets the card should say no I don’t want the 1 million il take 2 thanks KEKW
[6:11:43] DareDeFlug: Since he has his card
[6:11:46] TogglesLore: He plays apex alot
[6:11:47] Krystalchan: Time Walk is such a banger Power of 9 card: "Take another turn"
[6:11:48] kappathirteen: @mattitu I was speaking of the Black lotus card not being allowed in tournament play
[6:11:52] DareDeFlug: Dude really didicated
[6:11:57] Battal10n: the set with the serialized cards has a finite number printings, there will be another set with the same cards without the serialized version so they can keep selling the set
[6:12:04] mattitu: @kappathirteen ah, sorry, my bad.
[6:12:09] ninopanda: i have met post malone at a magic even here in salt lake
[6:12:10] YukiBloodbornGaming: but im thinking the one ring bounty will be around 10 million at the end of this
[6:12:16] deraj412: the first time i ever saw dude he was playing guitar on the background of a skydoesminecraft stream like 10 years ago lol
[6:12:23] YukiBloodbornGaming: ancestral recall is a good one too
[6:12:30] HeyAFrozenZebra: Lotus and Time Walk are my favorite
[6:12:34] deraj412: he was friends w him before either was famous ig
[6:12:36] Akunin_EQ: Alpha wording on time was "Opponent loses next turn" we thought it meant they lost the game next turn.
[6:12:43] dpkoz: ancestral recall: draw 3 for one blue mana
[6:12:47] Bulltank: I love the art on Time Walk
[6:12:47] YukiBloodbornGaming: my favorite of the power nine would have to be the moxen
[6:12:48] CelesteTier: @deraj420 their content house they had yeah lol
[6:12:52] usernameNull: no way the 1 ring sells privately and not through some huge auction house
[6:12:56] kappathirteen: Probably one of the most down to earth famous people you'll ever meet
[6:12:59] YukiBloodbornGaming: love the artwork for mox emerald
[6:12:59] DareDeFlug: Ancestrall recall was about to say this card
[6:13:02] Kr0nosTV: ancestral recall draws 3 for one Blue
[6:13:03] DareDeFlug: is absurd
[6:13:11] deraj412: @deraj420 haha right. years later i was like yo this dudes mad familair lol
[6:13:11] Moobot: New here? Welcome! You can usually catch Waffle Mon-Fri at ~1400 UTC, and Sat at Soon™. Feel free to hang out in chat before the stream and/or join the !discord. waffleEgg
[6:13:19] YukiBloodbornGaming: it most likely will be sold privately
[6:13:24] DareDeFlug: 1 land 3 cards

[6:13:29] MushuTushu: auction for like 2M
[6:13:34] Belgarath81: I sell that shit immediately
[6:13:42] Dishonest_abe: Eyy slc homies represent! That pink raising cain’s looks real weird
[6:13:42] HeyAFrozenZebra: That big auction house in NYC
[6:13:46] Zyie: @usernameNull It really depends on who gets it. Some would put it into an auction house, some would sell it to first big offer they get, some would hold on to it hoping to get more for it in a few years.
[6:13:50] That_Lurker: I would burn it KEKW
[6:13:51] Billy7heKid: Straight to the safe deposit box in Switzerland
[6:13:58] Bulltank: I dont sell immediately, but I start a bidding war with intention to sell lol
[6:14:06] HeyAFrozenZebra: Throw it into a Volcano
[6:14:06] ProtazLV: @Giantwaffle do you use prism launcher?
[6:14:07] Jeraa122: lets be honest its probably never going to be seen and one of the workers on the factory line has it
[6:14:08] Thee_Buddha: What are the chances of no one pulling the card because someone bought a box and never opened it but it contained the card?
[6:14:11] Billy7heKid: Imagine some kid just poops on it
[6:14:20] Aldizzert: Lost in the mail.KEKW
[6:14:27] ThatOnneGuy: damaged
[6:14:28] daemonaedryn: Put through the paper shredder KEKW
[6:14:31] Krystalchan: KEKW imagine its thrown out in a pallet at a landfill
[6:14:35] Dagmoo: Or someone buys a pack and never opens the pack
[6:14:36] Yizzles: It also depends on where it's opened up. If it gets opened in Europe, Us americans never had a chance to begin with.
[6:14:45] Zerephyre: how much is it worth now?
[6:14:46] Rhink: Or someone keeps a pack for potential pack value at a later date?
[6:14:51] Ernie_41: wow messi going to inter miami
[6:14:51] deraj412: do you think anyone knows what package its in when it leaves the factory
[6:14:53] MeZorZ: Those people who Cut packs Then see what they lost
[6:14:53] chemicole: what if someone opens it and is oblivious to its value
[6:14:54] skaboss101: I wonder how you even fairly package that
[6:14:55] Zyie: Oh yeah, what about people buying lots of packs, but doesn't open them, saving them to sell for more later? It might be found 30 years from now LUL
[6:14:57] madman66666: what about those streams that cut packs in half before opening them
[6:15:00] Jeraa122: someone tears it up lol
[6:15:00] Belgarath81: what about the camp of folks who want it thrown into a volcano
[6:15:00] GuardMoony: imagen doing a draft and drawing that out of the package
[6:15:02] Yizzles: somebody does a flip or rip and then rips it in half
[6:15:05] thepolaroidbear: I remember my first Pokemon card pack ever was a holo Charizard. Had no idea it was good - just thought it looked cool.
[6:15:05] 0x4273: theres absolutely no way they printed only 1. The same way ferarri always lies about the number of cars they produce
[6:15:09] Krystalchan: @Zerephyre the highest bounty for a 'The One Ring' foil 1 of 1 is 1mil
[6:15:12] Billy7heKid: @zerephyre bounty is at $1M
[6:15:24] Zerephyre: jesus christ
[6:15:26] Dr_McCarthy: Isnt a hollow always second to last card? peepoHmm
[6:15:30] A_BroHam_Lincoln: its gana be like willy wonka

[6:15:46] Ditch_Doctor: What website was I supposed to use for d4 builds. I caved and bought the game @giantwaffle
[6:15:47] A_BroHam_Lincoln: the rich will have factories of people opening MTG cards
[6:15:47] ThatWeirdoGuy: How are they gonna make it truly random who gets it?
[6:15:49] YukiBloodbornGaming: the one ring to rule them all
[6:15:55] orgapaap: no there is printet more, if the original is damaged
[6:15:58] Belgarath81: correct
[6:16:02] Krystalchan: I would assume that card pack is gonna have Pinkerton detail trailing it KEKW
[6:16:06] dpkoz: there's like 4 different artworks
[6:16:15] TogglesLore: It was rigged
[6:16:17] Wetware: They'll use that company that did McDonalds

[6:16:27] AndyHayes: got all the light blues and got an xbox
[6:16:32] Jeraa122: there was only 1 boardwalk
[6:16:37] Dr_McCarthy: Is it gonna be Murica? DansGame KEKW
[6:16:37] Zyie: @0x4273 They'd be found out right away... There's $1m bounty on the card. If two of them were found, there'd be huge drama. It's not going to happen.
[6:16:37] Jeraa122: an no one ever saw it

[6:17:02] YukiBloodbornGaming: it turned into a class action
[6:17:06] Myekos: it was the head of McD's security
[6:17:26] GFQPR1882: I’d be smart , I’d tell the card makers i won’t let people know I have it for a year . so they sell more cards only if I get a nice cash offer ! Then sell the card after that 5Head :)
[6:17:27] Grav1s: sorry @Ditch_Doctor its !d4

[6:17:32] agentg1303: no security of the company that made the pieces
[6:17:36] Rhink: Wait, imagine being McDonalds security.
[6:17:38] drummernerd: tin motors I have the rotors
[6:17:43] Feist_: He would go to the bathroom, take the pieces, re-seal the envelope
[6:17:47] xxLatte: weren’t they distributing the winning pieces to friends and family and that’s how they got caught
[6:17:48] Frankenstain: There is a HBO documentary series called McMillions
[6:17:50] Bweggar: mcdonalds has security?
[6:17:51] daweedmonkey: @Dr_McCarthy 🫂
[6:17:52] N0ns3ns: you could say that he "secured" those wins
[6:17:54] Allmostdone: what you think they were amunie
[6:17:55] MJ711: wait, McD has security ???
[6:18:01] atamala: yeah it was mcdonalds itself, it was a vendor

[6:18:51] palagrim_: Kinda strange to me that friends/family werent inegible for the win from the start. Seems like that would be the default
[6:19:00] DryBug: Thaaanks

[8:02:39] mopp789: The new is r22

[8:19:40] Shadoow_LoL: the one you clicked was not safe lol
[8:19:44] enki1337: @Grimstar_ each number says how many mines are adjacent
[8:19:45] daemonaedryn: @Grimstar_ the number on a square represents the amount of mines adjacent to it
[8:19:59] 2Flip: @Grimstar_ 1 = field is touching a bomb, can also be diagonal, 2 touching 2 fields, rest is counting :D
[8:20:05] Grimstar_: in each direction?

[8:20:17] Grimstar_: or all directions collectively
[8:20:17] GFQPR1882: monkaS
[8:20:18] Appel_3: if it has to be one of those two, then you got two more that cant have on in them
[8:20:20] PxlSauce: if a number has all flags set ofr it it's super safew to shift click the number

[8:23:40] Silver_Skeeter: IF your flags are right
[8:23:43] TheWonderLlama: Any number with that many flags already next to it
[8:23:54] PxlSauce: it's safer

[8:24:47] enki1337: you can do stuff at the top
[8:24:47] EZL1190: Bomb count

[8:26:34] N11cK____: Third 1 is always safe
[8:26:36] INFR_Darkfire: Oh my tip for the game of light loot game waffle is you use a numpad to correspond to the 3x3 of the game and you type the solution in chat
[8:26:40] AGGRO___: yolo
[8:26:42] FlammAlpha: the 1 from the edge is solvable

[8:27:46] 冷凍スイカ: seqPause
[8:27:48] UnCrazed: above the bottom 2 is safe
[8:27:48] PxlSauce: look at the top three 1 and check how the bombs would be placed, it will guarantee the 3rd 1 to be safe
[8:27:51] fauxbos: 3 is satisfied
[8:27:52] LegacyOfPain: the ? by the 3 has to be correc tnow

[8:32:00] MrSilverMatch: Top left of 4 has to be

[8:32:07] WellPlayedSC: 4 and 3

[8:32:11] Cretlin: one one of the other 2 can be one
[8:32:12] AleXanDreMau: @Giantwaffle Because 3 and 2
[8:32:12] enki1337: because there is one bomb in the other 2
[8:32:12] undeniablyrexer: the two next is 50/50
[8:32:12] grid_space: because the 2
[8:32:13] MrSilverMatch: To have 1 more than the 3 on the right
[8:32:14] RyanKile: because 3 only needs 1
[8:32:15] earthtowers: only one of the two touching the 3 can be
[8:32:16] ThatOnneGuy: I wasn't trying to tell him the solution I just wanted him to look at the 2 lol
[8:32:17] LuciferSpirt: YEP cock
[8:32:17] qbear079: Above 3 is bomb
[8:32:17] fauxbos: the real bomb was the friends we made along the way

[8:32:32] skaboss101: only one way to satisfy the 3
[8:32:32] RyanKile: no because of the 3 not 2
[8:32:33] zzzDai: Because theres a 3 there that has exactly one above it being a bomb.
[8:32:33] Bogadisa: because the 4 needs 2 more bombs, but the 3 next to it has two already
[8:32:35] Jodeatre: its a 50/50 either its a bomb or its not
[8:32:36] LeBeauTV: The flag has to be next to the 2
[8:32:36] Smelly_Badger: KEKW
[8:32:38] ThatOnneGuy: The 4 and the 3 on the other side already solved waffle
[8:32:40] Eidokan: 3 requires exactly one of the right 2 to be a bomb 4 requires another shifted by one @Giantwaffle
[8:32:41] snorrow92: The 3 can only have 1 more of the 2 connected
[8:32:41] Gkz_Suh: because dthe 3 can only get 1 more bomb
[8:32:42] Shiirouken: you need 4 bombs around the 4 and you cant have 2 at the 3
[8:32:42] sabernosefish: working hard at the waffle factory
[8:32:43] bismarcksd: because the 3
[8:32:43] Cretlin: There can only be one in those 2 spots
[8:32:43] WellPlayedSC: 2 bomb in 3 cell
[8:32:44] RyanKile: because 3 only needs 1
[8:32:45] Rhicas: the 4 needs 2 more bombs to be correct the 3 next to it only needs 1

[8:33:00] RyanKile: yes
[8:33:01] jeff_is_cool_24: yes'
[8:33:02] earthtowers: top left of the 4 HAS to be one
[8:33:04] Larklen: KEKW
[8:33:04] xxLatte: yes
[8:33:06] RyanKile: the 4 is right
[8:33:07] LeBeauTV: Above the 3 is confirmed
[8:33:09] Gorgetto: yeah Waffle you are right
[8:33:11] Larklen: chat being chat
[8:33:12] N11cK____: Top left of 4 is gaurenteed
[8:33:14] cjthedjdolphin: They're saying top left HAS to have one since both above and left can't
[8:33:14] Tahnal: There can only be one above the 4 or above right of 4. So above left of 4 has to be one
[8:33:14] timbit123: click on top right, should be safe
[8:33:14] N11cK____: Other one isnt
[8:33:14] jeff_is_cool_24: ur rioght
[8:33:16] RyanKile: yes
[8:33:16] Moobot: You can find Waffle's Youtube channel here - https://youtube.com/giantwaffle
[8:33:17] EZL1190: Mark all options for the 3 then 4 would be satisfied in all options
[8:33:17] Mandorake: you're right
[8:33:19] snorrow92: Top left of 4 is always a bomb
[8:33:19] enki1337: it is
[8:33:20] Shiirouken: It is
[8:33:22] Rhicas: the 4 needs 2 more bombs to be correct the 3 next to it only needs 1
[8:33:22] BMYGRLFRND: the only two solutions for the 4 include the top left
[8:33:22] qbear079: You are Correct
[8:33:22] N11cK____: It is
[8:33:22] aventu: I take my comment 1 at the edge back LUL idk
[8:33:23] RyanKile: because 3 only needs 1
[8:33:23] undeniablyrexer: it is
[8:33:24] TheHappySocks: it is
[8:33:25] zzzDai: We dont know which of the two above the three is one, but ONE of them have to be
[8:33:26] Apocalypto07: it is
[8:33:26] RyanKile: it is
[8:33:26] wizizman: it is
[8:33:26] Aatesh: try it
[8:33:28] Cretlin: Because the other 2 spots to the right have to only have 1
[8:33:28] Shiirouken: you can't
[8:33:28] Robbsnor: 50/50 wing it
[8:33:28] Tompop23: But the 3 could be be satisfied I’m the middle square. But would still need the one above the 3
[8:33:29] Tarigin: its Not
[8:33:29] QuickSixx: 3 guarantees one spot of the two available to 4. therefore the other available has to be bomb
[8:33:29] x1xamen: it is
[8:33:29] NetAssetz: never trust someone that gaurentees something
[8:33:30] Obliviron: it is
[8:33:32] MasterKraft: 3 needs 1 bomb, but shares 2 blocks with 4.  4 needs 2 out of 3.  so the one block 4 is always is above the flag
[8:33:33] WellPlayedSC: No
[8:33:34] JayseeTTV: It's 100% guaranteed lol
[8:33:36] waylory: top left of four is a bomb and the three to the left of it is solved
[8:33:38] custus: just go 2 up at the 4
[8:33:40] sabernosefish: now that 3 is a 4
[8:33:42] ThatFrostyBear: it is Kappa
[8:33:42] xxLatte: then that 3 would be 4
[8:33:43] ThatOnneGuy: it's clicking
[8:33:44] enki1337: Pepega MathTime
[8:33:44] TheWonderLlama: Top left has to be, because only one of the other two can be bombs
[8:33:45] JayseeTTV: Top left of 4 is a bomb
[8:33:46] Flyer_Soul: It has to be since the 3 is there
[8:33:47] RyanKile: waffle 4 only needs 1 the 4 needs 2
[8:33:48] ThatOnneGuy: maybe not
[8:33:49] Tahnal: Top left of 4 is, because of the 3, only one that is connected to 3 can be one, both can't be
[8:33:52] MaxWeeman: Above 3 has to be bomb
[8:33:52] earthtowers: because the top left of the 4 IS one
[8:33:52] JayseeTTV: it's either 1 and 2 or 1 and 3
[8:33:54] bismarcksd: 3 not valid,
[8:33:54] Ged3: chat is right
[8:33:55] Cretlin: Hence why that one has to have 1
[8:33:55] KrunkleDunk: top left needs to be a bomb
[8:33:55] N11cK____: Trust me top left of 4 is gaurenteed bomb
[8:33:56] MrSilverMatch: Yup always one top left
[8:33:57] Neomancer: top left of four is guaranteed because of the three, the four can't have one above and top right
[8:33:57] EZL1190: Marl the options for the 3, then look at the 4, the top left of 4 would be clear in all cases
[8:33:57] enki1337: YEP
[8:33:59] RyanKile: waffle 3 only needs 1 the 4 needs 2
[8:34:01] Cretlin: yes
[8:34:02] PxlSauce: that's why
[8:34:02] Johnhugem: No chat is wrong
[8:34:02] Apocalypto07: YEP

[8:34:08] MasterKraft: yeah!
[8:34:08] ThatWeirdoGuy: Above 4 is safe
[8:34:09] Mandorake: do it moon2DOIT
[8:34:10] GamingGoggs: Above the 3 to satisfy 1 and 2
[8:34:11] homer8253: that clears a 3 to the left there
[8:34:11] MrSilverMatch: Now 3 left is satisfied
[8:34:12] 2Flip: i dont know about that LUL
[8:34:12] enki1337: @Johnhugem OneGuy
[8:34:13] WellPlayedSC: 3 to left
[8:34:14] kappathirteen: 3 on the left
[8:34:14] wizizman: like teaching a toddler
[8:34:14] CoZie: no you don't
[8:34:14] EZL1190: Mark the options for the 3, then look at the 4, the top left of 4 would be clear in all cases
[8:34:15] Smelly_Badger: if that is bomb the 3 left of 4 is solvable
[8:34:15] Tripleniple333: which satisfys the left three
[8:34:15] RyanKile: no
[8:34:16] Tompop23: So now the 3 the other side is done
[8:34:17] Gkz_Suh: and then the 3 on the left is solved
[8:34:18] snorrow92: 3 left of 4 is clear
[8:34:21] KuramaTheF0X: we know above 3 is a bomb
[8:34:24] GFQPR1882: “Guarantee I think “
[8:34:25] Bogadisa: what you have now is correct, you cant tell more yet
[8:34:26] Askjong: 2 above 4 is safe
[8:34:31] jeff_is_cool_24: above 3
[8:34:32] Gorgetto: yes it's 50 50
[8:34:32] biggerginger: it has  to be above the 3 on the right
[8:34:33] 2Flip: "fuck it" KEKW
[8:34:35] randoe_: Top of 3 is bomb
[8:34:35] xxLatte: above 4 is safe right
[8:34:36] Apocalypto07: YEP 󠀀
[8:34:37] SailorWS: its always above 3
[8:34:39] EZL1190: Top left of 4 is wrong. Mark the options for the 3, then look at the 4, the top left of 4 would be clear in all cases
[8:34:42] enki1337: Susge
[8:34:45] MrSilverMatch: No
[8:34:46] Tripleniple333: nothing safe yet

[8:35:20] bismarcksd: 2 not sat
[8:35:20] N11cK____: Work your way in
[8:35:22] xxLatte: not possible bc of right side 2
[8:35:25] RyanKile: work the 2 3's
[8:35:27] Gorgetto: don't try yet
[8:35:28] WellPlayedSC: Its 50/50
[8:35:31] enki1337: don't do it yet
[8:35:32] timbit123: nah
[8:35:33] HunterOfMost: 2 up from 4 should be safe
[8:35:35] Cretlin: Work from left side
[8:35:36] Robbsnor: Gotta wing it man
[8:35:37] aventu: we are missing something at the edge yeah
[8:35:43] RyanKile: you can work out the 2 3's
[8:35:44] GamingGoggs: Bomb count strats
[8:35:45] TogglesLore: 19 bombs
[8:35:47] strangelovejr: Look at the two 3s
[8:35:47] lakinator: 19 bombs lmao
[8:35:48] enki1337: you can def solve more stuff
[8:35:48] razagul1: the same area, above the 3 is a bomb
[8:35:48] daemonaedryn: KEKW
[8:35:51] KuramaTheF0X: ICANT
[8:35:51] Miguelrara: click the 2 tiles up the 4 lul
[8:35:52] Catdaddyneff: bottom left wall i thought there was an easy one
[8:35:53] TheWonderLlama: Time to start clicking corners
[8:35:54] Yizzles: Despairge
[8:35:59] magdaz_: @Giantwaffle the 2 3 at bottom you can solve
[8:35:59] Cretlin: There is still many not 50/50
[8:36:01] Gorgetto: Those new 3s what you opened, look them
[8:36:02] Tripleniple333: 2112 is solvable
[8:36:03] xxLatte: u haven’t lost yet
[8:36:04] enki1337: 2 - 1 - 1, below the 2nd 1
[8:36:04] WellPlayedSC: 3rd is safe
[8:36:04] Shiirouken: below 2nd 1 is safe
[8:36:04] SailorWS: you havent messed this one up yet?
[8:36:05] bustiiee: you can click above the 2 flags above the 4
[8:36:05] Cretlin: Just gotta see the patterns
[8:36:06] Johnhugem: you have all livs
[8:36:08] EZL1190: All of them, that was the one before
[8:36:11] shnaitz: right 1 is safe
[8:36:14] N11cK____: Under the 3 is a bomb, the right 3
[8:36:21] Bogadisa: No 󠀀
[8:36:21] Cretlin: no
[8:36:24] Shiirouken: no
[8:36:24] enki1337: no
[8:36:24] Gorgetto: no
[8:36:26] chadaccountant: bottom right of "2" in 23
[8:36:27] Gorgetto: it can be
[8:36:31] EZL1190: You have all 3 life? it was the previous one you lost
[8:36:31] earthtowers: no, thats a 50/50
[8:36:34] Cretlin: 2nd one is safe
[8:36:34] RyanKile: the one bellow the 2nd 1 is clear
[8:36:36] strangelovejr: Under the second 1 is safe
[8:36:38] Shiirouken: below 2nd 1 is safe
[8:36:40] Tripleniple333: not solvable but you can get a free space
[8:36:42] chadaccountant: or below 3
[8:36:42] A_BroHam_Lincoln: no it could be of to the side since you don't know whats below that 3
[8:36:47] MaIlchad: is there not another side you can work on?
[8:36:47] LuciferSpirt: YEP
[8:36:50] enki1337: both the 2's have a bomb already, so it's 1 1 1 1
[8:36:51] chadaccountant: thats a bomb
[8:36:53] chadaccountant: lmfao
[8:36:56] Bogadisa: There is 100% not a bomb below the second 1, counting from the left
[8:36:57] Tripleniple333: cant be on the second one of 2112
[8:36:57] earthtowers: that whole row isnt safe
[8:37:03] A_BroHam_Lincoln: Because the numbers
[8:37:04] NetAssetz: can use the 1 - 2 - 3 into the corner to solve
[8:37:05] Cretlin: Look at the 2 in the corner. Only 1 can be bomb. The second 1 to the right makes that safe from the 1 to the left
[8:37:10] GummiKu: it cannot be the 3rd from the left under the 1. It would block the 2
[8:37:11] whysoserious15: go all the way forward, its solvable with the 2
[8:37:13] alienwombat: theres guaranteed to be more bombs
[8:37:15] Obliviron: he's right waffle
[8:37:18] Obliviron: its 1 1 1
[8:37:19] Cretlin: left corner here
[8:37:21] earthtowers: yeah, thats the way to think of it, you mentally subtract to how many are left for each one
[8:37:24] WellPlayedSC: Below second 1 safe
[8:37:29] RyanKile: the one bellow the 2nd 1 is clear
[8:37:29] earthtowers: so that whole row is currently 1s
[8:37:30] Oodeanoo: The 2 far right, one above is hard cleared?
[8:37:33] enki1337: NODDERS
[8:37:33] Cretlin: yes
[8:37:34] chadaccountant: Below 3 is a bomb which satisfies two. Spaces around 3 must not be bombs to satisfy the 2 and 3 at the same time
[8:37:38] Cretlin: so the one to the right is safe
[8:37:38] BallForceOne: Then look at the 1
[8:37:39] A_BroHam_Lincoln: below second one is safe thats true
[8:37:41] aventu: monkaS the 1, you know the one
[8:37:42] A_BroHam_Lincoln: I think
[8:37:42] Obliviron: its 4 1s in a row
[8:37:42] Bogadisa: yes, now look at the second 1
[8:37:43] A_BroHam_Lincoln: KEKW
[8:37:46] brightcandle: Yes
[8:37:46] Tompop23: So the next is safe regardless
[8:37:47] 2Flip: "wich one" "yes"
[8:37:47] enki1337: so now think about the 1
[8:37:47] Mandorake: just mark em all as red and start clicking
[8:37:47] zzzDai: the one below the right 1 is safe
[8:37:47] strangelovejr: Yes
[8:37:48] N11cK____: Under the right 1 is safe
[8:37:48] Gorgetto: ah now i understand
[8:37:49] Cretlin: safe
[8:37:49] PxlSauce: now look around the 1 next to it
[8:37:52] Eidokan: @Giantwaffle check the top left. two and one are covered by the same bomb next field in line is safe
[8:37:52] xxLatte: just click
[8:37:53] GummiKu: it 100% cannot be the next after those 2 questionmarks
[8:37:54] Larklen: just click one pepeLaugh
[8:37:54] Apocalypto07: right of the 2 questionmarks is safe
[8:37:55] Larklen: there ya go
[8:37:56] magdaz_: 3 3 at bottom is solvable
[8:37:57] PxlSauce: and the 3rd space is safe
[8:37:58] enki1337: xD YEP
[8:37:58] Davemathews: Under 5 above 1 left of 2 right of 3 is clear. Jk
[8:37:58] Cristi__: right of 3 is safe place i think
[8:37:58] daemonaedryn: KEKW 󠀀
[8:38:05] timbit123: right side of 3 is safe
[8:38:06] Gorgetto: look new that 2
[8:38:09] WellPlayedSC: Now 2 and 3
[8:38:11] brightcandle: That wasn't a guess
[8:38:11] LeBeauTV: Next to the 2 is safe
[8:38:13] fauxbos: you do now that's a corner
[8:38:13] ConduitCane: bottom right of 3 is safe
[8:38:13] Gorgetto: those are bombs under the 2
[8:38:17] Gorgetto: oh nvm
[8:38:17] hmmvee: time to hit an edge
[8:38:18] MasterKraft: why couldnt that new 2 be a 5? ha
[8:38:18] xxLatte: corner 1 now
[8:38:19] N11cK____: That was facts haha not a guess
[8:38:20] LeBeauTV: Left of 2 is safe
[8:38:21] chadaccountant: Below 3 is bomb
[8:38:21] fauxbos: that question is a bomb
[8:38:22] enki1337: the 2 on the right are safe
[8:38:23] Shiirouken: right side of 3 is safe
[8:38:26] fauxbos: it's a corner now
[8:38:26] Obliviron: the one under the 2 is safe
[8:38:28] strangelovejr: Left of 3 safe
[8:38:30] brightcandle: The 2 and 3 MUST be

[8:50:27] enki1337: it's not below the 1
[8:50:34] lakinator: so left of 5 is safe?
[8:50:34] aod_rywo: so left of 5 is safe
[8:50:34] blizzardmagic: 8's can only be found last because of how many bombs are left if there are any
[8:50:34] ThatWeirdoGuy: If the bomb is below the 1 then next to 5 is also bomb.
[8:50:37] HeyAFrozenZebra: I think there can be 3 on the left side
[8:50:37] chaoskub: Left of 5 and above are safe
[8:50:39] Sam_1443: so what about left of 5
[8:50:39] Bogadisa: The 5 made it solvable
