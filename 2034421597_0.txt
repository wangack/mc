[0:03:46] samwich1991: hey izzzie!
[0:03:46] BigFlameWolf: You did a few Deadly runs on, like, Day 2, then decided to go back a level because it was too difficult with no cards.
[0:03:51] Renegade578: do you have to use a mod to spawn tangocam?
[0:03:58] Monday_from_M: Maybe it was hard difficulty, but level 3 compass
[0:04:03] BigFlameWolf: *Tier 3 difficulty
[0:04:07] samwich1991: yep, carpet mod
[0:04:23] Izzie114: and you also switched to difficult and hard because you needed more cards

[0:07:32] itsMorrigan: @IcyVulpixie some solid (be)bops?
[0:07:58] BigFlameWolf: "Spirit Inspiration" by Nothing's Carved in Stone is the OP I have in mind (had to look it up). Note: the original is in English even though it's an anime OP.
[0:08:12] IcyVulpixie: @itsMorrigan exactly lol
[0:08:24] actual_supernova: that reminds me its my annual listening to spider dance time
[0:08:32] AyushJind: randomly trigger
[0:08:48] beeboo909: They are global
[0:08:49] Izzie114: random trigger and also some trigger when the dungeons is started i think?
[0:08:51] gamingnscience: Hazard triggers randomly over time, yes. a lot can trigger early or very little until later
[0:08:52] IcyVulpixie: hazard is a global system
[0:09:04] factorization4: Hazard attempts to trigger every 30 seconds, but there is a chance that nothing happens
[0:09:11] AyushJind: yup
[0:09:27] celinabena: oh my
[0:09:38] AyushJind: hazzard is based on tree sapling growing so random

[0:11:16] cptcinnabunny: I’ve missed a lot of streams recently cause of work. what’s h’s success/fail ratio?
[0:11:41] wrench422: The saplings are actually to randomize which shriekers are active
[0:11:51] AyushJind: @cptcinnabunny he hasnt kept a record of it i think

[0:27:05] starbaker77: All the bops

[0:27:14] factorization4: Probably dripstone spiders or dripstone pearl's room chain if with bounding?
[0:27:26] BigFlameWolf: Gamba finish?
[0:28:04] AyushJind: 38 for top lvl is pretty good
[0:28:20] shakescrafty: Nyoom
[0:28:49] shanesunil: That's not an issue if the door is still open
[0:30:15] factorization4: Some of the 392 entities are armour stands
[0:30:31] BigFlameWolf: The gamba's still from the first run.
[0:31:51] itsMorrigan: twoots

[0:45:50] factorization4: Maxing swagger KEKW
[0:45:51] shanesunil: ohh
[0:45:54] Kush_06: first 2 rares are absolutely necessary for L4
[0:46:00] BigFlameWolf: The game really wants you to have Swagger.
[0:46:13] beeboo909: Nimble looting op
[0:46:16] Kush_06: nimble is very very op
[0:46:17] starbaker77: What is wrong with swagger???
[0:46:18] cptcinnabunny: so much swag
[0:46:32] starbaker77: Ahhh
[0:46:36] shanesunil: 2 Ethereal Cards drop on the front part of the deck when pirate's booty is played
[0:46:37] starbaker77: Got it
[0:46:37] ErisLair: how many swaggers can you have in your deck
[0:46:45] brian_of_farce: Go nimble
[0:46:48] factorization4: @ErisLair 3
[0:46:51] Kush_06: Tango: 'Nimble looting is quite powerful, if the game ran on longer, it'd probably be rebalanced'
[0:47:02] shanesunil: At this point nimble is better than swagger
[0:47:12] Alergies: I gtg for a bit, cya all later chat hbomb94OwO
[0:47:27] Kush_06: every time you BLOCK a clank, you get 2 treasure
[0:47:30] lordlethis: it ends when *clank* increases => if clank block runs out
[0:47:31] beeboo909: Nimble looting is in effect until you run out of clank block
[0:47:40] lostcoltgame: Nimble looting is good if played late-ish in a round and you have lots of clank block accumulated.
[0:47:54] shanesunil: no it stops only when your clank block runs out
[0:47:57] Sydni_Heiss: if you have a build up of clank block itll give you lots of treasure other wise itll just do that one thing
[0:47:59] Kush_06: so if you have 10 clank block, triggering 10 clank will give 20 treasure
[0:48:11] Izzie114: Nimble NODDERS
[0:48:12] AyushJind: nimble looting ?

[0:48:22] starbaker77: Yay
[0:48:28] Izzie114: that is fair
[0:48:32] AyushJind: too much clank
[0:48:41] shanesunil: 3 Swagger is so not worth it for Deepfrost runs
[0:49:07] lostcoltgame: If you want to do deepfrost, you need more clank blocks.
[0:49:09] brian_of_farce: Need that Eerie Silence
[0:49:31] shanesunil: hmm that makes sense
[0:49:34] itsMorrigan: that makes sense NODDERS
[0:49:35] AyushJind: clank is high in these runs already
[0:49:38] w_wn_n: Hello!
[0:50:12] shanesunil: eerie silence, dungeon repairs and fuzzy bunny slippers are the ones you really need
[0:50:17] AyushJind: eerie silence and dungeon rerpairs\
[0:50:34] factorization4: If you hear nimble looting play, you should probably prevent any extra clank generated until you need treasure. Also, stumbles also helps nimble looting

[0:54:53] clairebearstare: singlehandedly keeping my decked out addiction alive, ty ty
[0:55:07] factorization4: Why does HBomb always recycles sprint
[0:55:16] itsMorrigan: the h in hbomb stands for goated ← sleep deprived
[0:55:32] BigFlameWolf: @factorization4 Because a looter boy is a speedy boy.
[0:55:36] shanesunil: @factorization4 At least it wasn't stumble this time
[0:56:07] AyushJind: nice lvl1
[0:56:20] itsMorrigan: hell yeah
[0:56:22] shanesunil: Pearl would be proud of you H

[1:04:29] samwich1991: @actual_supernova yeah but tbf you have nothing to spend them on
[1:04:39] shanesunil: maybe wait at one spot till treasure goes down and then loop the top floor?
[1:04:41] actual_supernova: @bigflamewolf frfr
[1:04:58] actual_supernova: @samwich1991 some day the duck song will return im sure of it

[1:08:07] factorization4: Good luck
[1:08:35] shanesunil: Does H know the exit from Level 4 chat?
[1:08:50] factorization4: Soul sand under slab
[1:08:55] BigFlameWolf: @shanesunil He knows where it is, but not how to get there. He also wants to figure it out on his own.
[1:09:03] AyushJind: @shanesunil i think he saw while fixing lava trap
[1:09:10] shanesunil: Ok thanks
[1:09:42] factorization4: 52 is very high

[1:10:44] itsMorrigan: that's what we call the H factor
[1:11:07] factorization4: I think no one figured out that strat
[1:11:12] looorenam: omg he's doing it
[1:11:18] shanesunil: Even Pearl doesn't know that parkour path, she only does it with Jump Boost that area
[1:11:29] itsMorrigan: i have never wanted to lose channel points more badly
[1:11:36] haggleslag: josoLAUGH
[1:11:38] BigFlameWolf: You've been there a few times.
[1:11:41] factorization4: You can parkour that hazard
[1:11:46] jackdeus42: tango tried so hard, but cannot block every cheese path
[1:12:03] looorenam: you can cheese that stair
[1:12:06] AyushJind: nvm lol

[1:12:38] AyushJind: back of lvl3 bottom
[1:12:38] factorization4: You were at the very back of level 3
[1:12:42] shanesunil: Gg
[1:12:56] AyushJind: opp of that
[1:13:12] factorization4: The staircase that you normally go up is at the front of level 3
[1:13:26] BigFlameWolf: You also found how to get out of Level 4.
[1:13:31] AyushJind: at least knowledge gained
[1:13:38] Teeldove: You made it out of level four.
[1:13:50] cptcinnabunny: any way is the right way if it works
[1:13:53] Izzie114: it was the way
[1:14:04] AyushJind: it wasnt but games the game
[1:14:11] factorization4: I think no hermit figured that you can do that parkour
[1:14:39] shanesunil: Let's just say that way is the Jump Boost way out
[1:14:43] Izzie114: i mean you got onto the stircase out of level 4

[1:23:39] shanesunil: Thursday for you or for Pearl?
[1:24:02] Izzie114: i mean you can look at it that she is 5 hours behind LuL
[1:24:05] looorenam: she's in melbourne, but I think it's the same time zone
[1:24:27] ohheyitsfi: australia has 3 timezones lol
[1:24:27] ellieelectro: If she'd in Melbourne it's 6am
[1:24:38] shanesunil: It is AET timezone for Melbourne right?
[1:25:02] ellieelectro: AEDT we're in summer
[1:25:15] shanesunil: @ellieelectro ohh ok
[1:25:20] BigFlameWolf: Daylight time.

[1:32:07] fronskeNL: the drops in the water and the boat are actually level 1 drops, so they drop sooner, and can despawn

[1:34:57] ohheyitsfi: is only game
[1:35:12] shanesunil: Finally a good time for Stumble
[1:35:22] factorization4: We talk about nimble looting on level 3 if you are going to level 4
[1:36:52] fronskeNL: it was a slime ball :P
[1:36:59] shanesunil: Seriously, Pocket Watch is the Knight's Helm of Level 3

[1:42:59] factorization4: Yes  2

[1:43:48] tyto13alba: ty
[1:43:55] TheFishingPole: 2 clank
[1:44:06] shanesunil: @dragonhealergamer 2 clank
[1:44:13] itsMorrigan: it wants u to get 42 so damn bad
[1:44:19] factorization4: Hopefully not getting eerie as a choice

[1:47:04] factorization4: Could have grabbed 5 tomes
[1:47:22] shanesunil: I knew this would happen because this has happened to Etho at least 3 times where he couldn't buy Swagger but had Swagger as one of the options

[1:48:04] snowief0x: heyooooo whats goin on gamer
[1:48:16] seibaby: Beast sense is not worth a slot, too bad because the effect is useful sometimes esp in L2
[1:48:18] dragonhealergamer: Have you tried dungeon maintenance with DOM (decked out manager) (datapack)

[1:48:31] Streamlabs: Decked Out is a deck-building, dungeon crawler game created by TangoTek on Hermitcraft. The objective is to build your deck, run vaults and find the artifact the compass is pointing towards, all while fighting sneaking past mobs and not making any sound. You can play it yourself by downloading the Hermitcraft Season 9 world. You can find the download in the description of Xisuma's video where he explains how to set it up: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7QXFbBHCX4&t=1s
[1:48:54] ParadoxError_: ooh ok
[1:48:57] shanesunil: Honestly, it is shocking to see Beast Sense be not so op in Decked Out 2, when it was huge in Decked Out
[1:49:14] factorization4: Maybe try getting 42 or 44 every time
[1:49:20] ParadoxError_: ahh gotta love it
[1:49:44] ParadoxError_: oh H im back at the dorm now, if you want my help with predictions
[1:49:50] shanesunil: Terrible artifact luck honestly... Not your fault H
[1:49:58] factorization4: Decked Out 1 had so few cards, also there were only ravangers back then
[1:50:04] itsMorrigan: wb paradox!
[1:50:12] ParadoxError_: ty morri
[1:50:56] seibaby: tbh beast sense was mid in DO1 as well, and would have been bottom tier if Resistance didn't exist
[1:51:09] shanesunil: @factorization4 yup, I recently watched Hypno's Decked Out Supercut and was reminded how scary the original Decked Out was.
[1:51:16] seibaby: stealth and treasure reigned supreme in DO1
[1:51:40] seibaby: (in my experience from playing - I didn't watch much of the hermits playing DO1)
[1:51:43] ParadoxError_: oooh its pretty much 50/50 for the gamba
[1:51:51] ParadoxError_: oh shoot sorry i forgot to ping it
[1:51:53] ParadoxError_: XD
[1:52:05] ParadoxError_: i miss vads
[1:52:19] ItsAMeMattyO: have you considered pruning your deck to <40 cards?
[1:52:29] B4n4n4zrgood: I gambled in time woo, can’t wait to lose my imaginary coins :)
[1:53:03] factorization4: Bounding strides is best saved for level 2 and 4
[1:53:17] rere8585: you got alot of card slots inverted too
[1:53:33] shanesunil: Chat, did any Hermit try to run with a smaller deck of cards when they had 40 cards? I don't remember anyone not running with 40 cards
[1:53:38] sparkie1904: is stumble just like purely bad?
[1:54:00] shanesunil: Oh H has no idea how huge Bounding Strides is on Level 4
[1:54:08] seibaby: I don't think a deck <40 makes sense unless you're running some well optimized speedrunner strat
[1:54:21] Izzie114: Hw does Shane, just let him play.
[1:54:32] sparkie1904: ohhhhhh ive been watching decked out for a month now and stumble always confused me
[1:54:36] ItsAMeMattyO: lmao I just saw the last run, H runs so efficiently he could probably do it
[1:54:45] tyto13alba: do you think ravagers like berries?
[1:54:48] seibaby: and I don't think farming embers with speedrunner is even comparable to just going L4 bomb
[1:54:59] B4n4n4zrgood: ….

[2:09:39] Alergies: frost focus peepoClap
[2:09:50] tyto13alba: modCheck embers
[2:09:52] dragonhealergamer: i believe there is a toggle but you would still hear the shrieker even if it doesnt trrigger clank, cause its a game sounf
[2:10:23] Alergies: the fact that you cant see the amount you have on the map kinda sucks as well
[2:10:43] Alergies: boing boing
[2:11:41] Izzie114: Can the embers even spawn? Is there a max number?
[2:12:00] dragonhealergamer: you should get decked out manager for dungeon reset you would need to worry about that stuff
[2:12:10] rere8585: @Izzie114 no max on embers

[2:29:25] factorization4: Now +6 treasure from 1 clank 1 stumble

[2:34:54] extracheddar: swagger not adding to map?
[2:35:05] Izzie114: Is the map broken or is the dungeon broken with the embers?
[2:35:08] factorization4: Going for a 66 ember run?
[2:35:12] looorenam: come on embers

[2:37:17] Kush_06: dont count eggs b4 they hatch i think
[2:37:17] samwich1991: count your chickens before they hatch but close enough peepoGiggles
[2:37:19] sparkie1904: hypothetically how would one count unlaid eggs?

[2:39:02] factorization4: 4 more?!
[2:39:05] vadskamanta: Did H just jump over embers or was it a soul lantern?
[2:39:10] extracheddar: swagger worked that time for sure
[2:39:11] Kush_06: whoa
[2:39:11] sparkie1904: omg my streamer so good
[2:39:14] shanesunil: Yup
[2:39:19] JibbleJT: @vadskamanta It was an ember
[2:39:22] Kush_06: 66 ember run incoming?
[2:39:31] factorization4: 3 more to go
[2:39:31] extracheddar: probably hitting max treasure/embers if that's still a thing
[2:39:31] Kush_06: 63 now
[2:39:55] haggleslag: monkaS
[2:39:56] Kush_06: @extracheddar i think it is, it got removed for lvl2 tho
[2:40:34] factorization4: Hope 2 more in the circle room?
[2:41:03] Kush_06: check the spots on the way home?
[2:41:08] extracheddar: what's the most floor embers H has collected?
[2:41:20] vadskamanta: @extracheddar and lived is 58
[2:41:23] OverLordUpChuck: OverLordUpChuck subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months, currently on a 1 month streak! hope the day's going well! thanks for all the content!!

[2:42:43] vadskamanta: NODDERS
[2:42:45] shanesunil: Hoping for ANY card except Brilliance
[2:42:55] factorization4: Brilliance :3
[2:43:06] Kush_06: brilliance is quite powerful
[2:43:12] vadskamanta: GGs
[2:43:19] Izzie114: GGs
[2:43:19] idlo09: GG
[2:43:20] factorization4: GG

[2:44:20] samwich1991: NOOO
[2:44:20] extracheddar: has he considered getting the card that lets him get another card in shop?
[2:44:21] rere8585: dungeon 2, H 0
[2:44:21] Kush_06: told you!
[2:44:22] looorenam: ofc
[2:44:22] ItsSoutien: OH NO LOL
[2:44:24] B4n4n4zrgood: lol
[2:44:25] OverLordUpChuck: DAAAAANG
[2:44:27] welpedruide16: NOOO
[2:44:28] SerenityUwU99: hbomb94LUL
[2:44:31] Kush_06: we told ya
[2:44:32] dragonhealergamer: this luck ... or well lack of it is something else
[2:44:36] sparkie1904: LOLLLLLLLL
[2:44:40] looorenam: the epic highs and lows of decked out 2
[2:45:20] shanesunil: Silent Runner is great for you
[2:45:23] Kush_06: it is good
[2:45:31] GhostyClay: take ITTT
[2:45:36] welpedruide16: Take it
[2:45:39] sparkie1904: first perma card?
[2:45:39] Kush_06: cold snap kinda underwhelming
[2:45:42] Zarey_z: always stumbles
[2:46:00] shanesunil: And Silent Runner is Permanent, so it plays right away
[2:46:18] shanesunil: Yes correct
[2:46:25] Kush_06: fuzzy bunny slippers is also kinda nice
[2:46:25] Izzie114: Ooooo. That sounds amazing then
[2:46:29] extracheddar: speed deck here we come
[2:46:47] vadskamanta: NODDERS
[2:46:57] Kush_06: i called out brilliance too!
[2:47:08] cptcinnabunny: So will that one be played automatically every run then?
[2:47:26] factorization4: You missed a crown?
[2:47:28] Izzie114: The coin NOOO
[2:47:38] extracheddar: goodby worm
[2:47:43] shanesunil: Crown missing?
[2:47:46] vadskamanta: You had one in your inventory NODDERS
[2:47:56] vadskamanta: When you jumped down
[2:48:03] shanesunil: Just add 1 crown then
[2:48:07] skepoozle: you put in 11 coins NotLikeThis
[2:48:19] Streamlabs: Have you followed yet? If not, make sure you hit that follow button to get notified every time H starts streaming! It's very helpful to the channel and we really appreciate it! hbomb94Love
[2:48:25] extracheddar: cold snap did something with embers
[2:48:27] vadskamanta: It was the other card that doubled embers
[2:48:45] Kush_06: it does not give clank block, it blocks clank
[2:48:55] sparkie1904: what does reckless charge do again?
[2:49:18] factorization4: If you always recycle sprint, yeah
[2:49:18] extracheddar: so expected around 7 each run from that card
[2:49:22] vadskamanta: @sparkie1904 If you trigger a shrieker within 8 seconds of the card getting played you get 10 embers
[2:49:31] shanesunil: @sparkie1904 +2 Hazard, activate a shrieker within 8 seconds, +10 embers I think
[2:49:47] sparkie1904: Thx!
[2:50:04] vadskamanta: gambaping
[2:50:12] beeboo909: Silent runner puts you in good stead for deepfrost now
[2:50:19] factorization4: Undated sign?
[2:50:27] vadskamanta: 65
[2:50:35] rere8585: deep frost now?
[2:51:10] samwich1991: no cleo Sadge
[2:51:21] factorization4: Eerie will be crucial for deepfrost
[2:51:43] Kush_06: it must be a chunk thing
[2:51:47] extracheddar: eerie silence is probably my favorite card
[2:51:57] Kush_06: yes, it's actuve
[2:52:02] Kush_06: *active
[2:52:06] shanesunil: Permanent cards don't have an announcer
[2:52:07] TheFishingPole: permanents dont get callouts
[2:52:43] extracheddar: the plunge looks tempting atm
[2:53:11] shanesunil: Wait ... Is it blocking a clank while running? And not adding Clank Block?
[2:53:23] ParadoxError_: dang losing all your 50/50's is a pain, im sorry
[2:53:33] Kush_06: i dont think it actual gives a clank block, i think it just blocks 50% clank for the duration of sprinting (might be wrong but thats how i interpreted the card)
[2:53:39] SerenityUwU99: peepoHey Paradox
[2:53:46] ParadoxError_: hey seren! <3
[2:54:19] name_under_rennovation: unofficial tango raid?
[2:54:24] beeboo909: It worked just then
[2:54:33] extracheddar: @Kush_06 but it says 50% chance to give 1 clank block, not that it blocks 50% clank block
[2:54:39] Neamow: unofficial Tango raid!
[2:54:55] SerenityUwU99: Welcome unofficial Raiders hbomb94Dance
[2:54:57] UniversalShadows: most hermits only streamed this once a week for like 9 weeks so youve streamed more decked out than anyone
[2:54:58] extracheddar: @Neamow welcome to more decked out
[2:55:03] vadskamanta: "Every 15 seconds that a Speed buff is active, 50% chance to block 1 Clank." is the exact wording
[2:55:03] AntNamedNobody: unofficial Tango raid!!
[2:55:06] Kush_06: @extracheddar did it not say 50% chance to block 1 clank?
[2:55:11] vadskamanta: Welcome unofficial raiders
[2:55:15] secret_agent4706: unofficial Tango raid!
[2:55:17] SerenityUwU99: Welcome on in DinoDance
[2:55:19] AntNamedNobody: ttekHeart ttekHeart
[2:55:25] actual_supernova: chat im cold
[2:55:27] Monday_from_M: ttekHeart ttekHeart
[2:55:32] prreston99: jokers B-Day, but we wanted decked out. 😂
[2:55:33] UniversalShadows: the map has gotten so broken without tango maintaining it
[2:55:38] rere8585: raiders just missed a 65 ember run
[2:55:41] name_under_rennovation: how big is this guy
[2:55:48] name_under_rennovation: gah. Typos/early send
[2:55:58] name_under_rennovation: how many cards are in the deck
[2:56:02] vadskamanta: 40
[2:56:04] shanesunil: It says block 1 clank, not add 1 clank block. They don't mean the same, right?
[2:56:19] shanesunil: Why is this card so confusing to understand lol
[2:56:23] Neamow: 65? not bad! now get on Pearl's level! pearlieLOL
[2:56:36] vadskamanta: @shanesunil That's how I interpret it at least, blocks clank, doesn't give clank block (but I'm a DO noobie)
[2:56:43] Kitten_74: Hello Rusty
[2:56:54] factorization4: You can still get some embers, deadly level 4 only gives artifact up to something like 52
[2:56:54] looorenam: hi rusty
[2:56:55] shanesunil: 65 Embers and guess which card showed up in the shop? Brilliance (66)
[2:56:57] secret_agent4706: @neamow yeah just half of Pearl's record lol
[2:57:34] Kitten_74: Fun to see some Decked Out. Thought it was over when Hermitcraft 9 ended
[2:57:37] Neamow: @secret_agent4706 still amazing, my best is just 30 pearlieSad
[2:57:53] vadskamanta: @Kitten_74 H is obsessed!
[2:57:59] shanesunil: @vadskamanta yup, that's what I thought ... The name Silent Runner makes more sense when you are blocking a clank while sprinting -- you're silently running
[2:58:24] Kush_06: @Kitten_74 it mury much isnt, a couple more people have streamed it and then there is also hundreds casually playing
[2:58:25] extracheddar: I was surprised "decked out" wasn't in the stream title
[2:58:45] shanesunil: @kitten_74 this is like, his 117th run or so haha
[2:58:54] Kitten_74: lol
[2:59:14] extracheddar: gem is great gem is great
[2:59:17] TheFishingPole: from the descriptions of other cards it feels more like an adds clank block
[2:59:31] looorenam: gem is great
[2:59:34] Kush_06: have you seen the ultra high detailed decked out map?
[2:59:54] extracheddar: it worked, "gem is great" always breaks the key curse
[3:00:00] secret_agent4706: @neamow I have only done a few runs since I have studies lol, and man lvl 2 just sucks, tried Pearl's deck and lvl 3 and 4 are not that hard
[3:00:07] name_under_rennovation: Wow
[3:00:15] factorization4: Wait for treasure cards
[3:00:16] rere8585: need 1 more key
[3:00:28] TheFishingPole: manifesting new pb 2 runs in a row
[3:00:30] Kush_06: wait about a minute for treasure to play
[3:00:41] Neamow: @secret_agent4706 same! in my save all ravagers on L2 managed to get into all the exit ways, including one wedged in spiders (my favourite way out), and I'm getting wrecked
[3:01:21] adib18h: jump boost from 2nd wind ??
[3:01:35] name_under_rennovation: @adib18h bounding played earlier
[3:01:52] name_under_rennovation: isabat
[3:01:52] ive_h: @secret_agent4706 I added a pillar outside spiders to loop ravagers to make it more fair, and removed some lights inside spiders to balance it
[3:01:52] Kush_06: i feel like it is comparatively more difficult to get a new pb on Deadly Lvl4 runs because there is lesser time to loot and the artefacts are usually not that much better than a Deadly Lvl3
[3:02:01] shanesunil: @secret_agent4706 didn't Pearl mention about the level 2 Ravagers being dezoned? Like there are 3 Ravagers in Lava and 1 in Mushroom, whereas it should be 2 each, in the world download
[3:02:24] looorenam: you shouldn't get hit
[3:02:25] secret_agent4706: @shanesunil Yeah I have fixed it
[3:02:26] name_under_rennovation: Has H tried for the bomb yet
[3:02:26] Kush_06: i could check it out, 1sec
[3:02:31] nepp_ster: what mod is this? CoolCat
[3:02:31] extracheddar: @Kush_06 biggest thing with lvl 4 is honestly the other mechanics like the bomb and such
[3:02:41] ParadoxError_: !do
[3:02:42] Streamlabs: Decked Out is a deck-building, dungeon crawler game created by TangoTek on Hermitcraft. The objective is to build your deck, run vaults and find the artifact the compass is pointing towards, all while fighting sneaking past mobs and not making any sound. You can play it yourself by downloading the Hermitcraft Season 9 world. You can find the download in the description of Xisuma's video where he explains how to set it up: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7QXFbBHCX4&t=1s
[3:02:51] SerenityUwU99: Nerdge
[3:02:54] ive_h: I'm 90% sure that the beam doesn't hit you if it's aimed at another mob
[3:02:54] shanesunil: @name_under_rennovation H doesn't know about it yet
[3:02:56] rere8585: lvl 4 artifacts from a deadly run are almost always in the first section of lvl 4
[3:03:03] nepp_ster: ooo thats cool
[3:03:03] name_under_rennovation: @shanesunil ah
[3:03:04] secret_agent4706: @ive_h I have added a zone there so it doesn't get stuck in spiders
[3:03:21] Streamlabs: Have you followed yet? If not, make sure you hit that follow button to get notified every time H starts streaming! It's very helpful to the channel and we really appreciate it! hbomb94Love
[3:03:37] shanesunil: @secret_agent4706 well now matter how much map knowledge you get, Level 2 will still throw curveballs at you. Levels 1,3 and 4 you can get by.
[3:03:39] Kush_06: @extracheddar yeah ik, but H is probably not gonna be doing any of that yet, probably atleast until he gets eerie and dun repairs
[3:04:03] looorenam: oh the way he looked up at you was creepy
[3:04:07] extracheddar: I think lvl 4 is my favorite vibe
[3:04:30] Kush_06: its gonna be shreeping
[3:04:45] name_under_rennovation: The burning dark is a beautiful level
[3:04:45] extracheddar: hoping for the slab or higher
[3:05:04] name_under_rennovation: o7
[3:05:05] secret_agent4706: @shanesunil well I have studies so only done a few runs, will get better with more practice but I can't play it for another month or two as I have exams coming up lol
[3:05:07] vadskamanta: hbomb94LUL
[3:05:13] looorenam: o7
[3:05:13] SerenityUwU99: hbomb94LUL
[3:05:15] TheFishingPole: big sadge
[3:05:22] Kush_06: lvl4 deadly runs are kinda underwhelming
[3:05:23] Neamow: haha everyone always gets mad with the artifact distribution
[3:05:38] extracheddar: o7 for tfc but 38 is sad on lvl 4
[3:05:42] shanesunil: @secret_agent4706 that's alright. Good luck on your exams
[3:05:47] vadskamanta: We still haven't fixed the lava hazard right?
[3:05:56] ive_h: wait was this a Deadly run?
[3:06:01] Kush_06: @ive_h yes
[3:06:02] name_under_rennovation: yep
[3:06:08] vadskamanta: Deadly NODDERS
[3:06:13] shanesunil: Yes, Deadly Level 4
[3:06:18] rere8585: @ive_h 1/8 chance of lvl 4 artifact on deadly
[3:06:40] UniversalShadows: did he fix the lava hazard track?
[3:06:54] vadskamanta: @UniversalShadows don't think so
[3:06:57] name_under_rennovation: Nice
[3:07:01] looorenam: skillz
[3:07:08] shanesunil: That jump is so unnecessarily risky and scary haha
[3:07:12] ive_h: 40% chance to get this artifact on a Deadly lvl4 run
[3:07:14] Kush_06: those are probably not meant to be, but oh well
[3:07:45] extracheddar: yuh oh
[3:07:53] extracheddar: rut roh raggy
[3:07:55] vadskamanta: NOOO
[3:07:57] secret_agent4706: Rip
[3:07:57] name_under_rennovation: oof
[3:08:00] UniversalShadows: RIP
[3:08:01] Kush_06: you are on their hit list, thats for sure lmao
[3:08:02] ive_h: you sure did panic LUL
[3:08:03] looorenam: f
[3:08:05] Neamow: pearlieDed
[3:08:06] shanesunil: Died with the pickaxe again
[3:08:10] Rasphaz: nt
[3:08:13] SerenityUwU99: rosspalSad
[3:08:35] Kush_06: it might be the pick curse
[3:08:41] shanesunil: I think the bottom of the vine is safe for eating rather than on the vine
[3:08:49] extracheddar: I think tango put a bunch of wool between lvl 3 and 4 so they shouldn;t be able to hear you on lvl 3 as you are exiting lvl 4
[3:08:52] ive_h: there's wool between lvl3 and 4, so the lvl3 wardens don't hear you coming up
[3:09:10] extracheddar: that's possible
[3:09:22] ive_h: they could still sniff you though, since it's a 20 block vertical range
[3:09:26] factorization4: Maybe the play was to wait for bounding in level 4?
