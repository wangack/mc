Hi Philza, You raided a good streamer friend of mine 5 years ago, and they lost their followers 1004 days ago from a mishap with the commander root bot. They have been streaming every day since.

But discovered on a trip to Japan in 2019, that thanks to my Scottish mum, who was convinced she lost her Scottish accent when she was 5 years old, I have just enough of a twang that a random Irish Guy in a Bar in Kyoto picked out that I was Scottish after all of a minute of hearing me talk.
