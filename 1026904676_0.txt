[0:21:05] Moobot: You can sub to Waffle by clicking this neat link -> twitch.tv/giantwaffle/subscribe

[0:22:03] Frosty206: @Giantwaffle I work as an SDE3 in a a fortune 20 company, and interview people all the time, and purposely dont ask questions like this because they're so irrelevant in practice.

[0:22:29] Frosty206: Yea fuck FAANG
[0:22:57] UltraScientism: Some of these problems are for advanced mathematics knowledge. If you don't know some theorem, you basically can't provide a fast solution.
[0:23:10] Chronoes: You can
[0:23:11] LtCol_Carter: Once you get into it more, try and consider the time complexity, it's good to know so show you understand the program you've written
[0:23:38] Tabakhase: id go as far as "this exercise is not rly about "how to find primes" - the interesting part is how you sum up those lists and structures to hold this data"....

[0:24:34] germanmikrowave: dic vs tuple
[0:24:36] Kenji_QQ: you dont need to find all factors if you do it like you have now, just find all primes and sum all numbers that have that as a factor
[0:24:40] ZyianDev: dicts, map, hashmap, same idea, though slightly different
[0:24:49] Apparentthreat: you can do the same for dicts
[0:24:52] Egrassa22: you can do this in any language
[0:24:53] Apparentthreat: for entry in dict:
[0:25:02] benzit0: you guys having weird audio?
[0:25:10] mattertater: you can look through jus tthe keys or just the values or both in a dict
[0:25:12] Apparentthreat: for keys, values in dict
[0:25:27] UltraScientism: most modern languages can do that. Even C++
[0:25:31] Tabakhase: its basically a "you are free to google the prime code" - its just a while... ;-)
[0:25:52] ZyianDev: but sometimes you need the original way
[0:26:07] Vovosunt: foreach is in pretty much any modern programming language
[0:26:07] LtCol_Carter: Dict = {2:0, 3:0}
[0:26:15] mattertater: formatted the same as a json
[0:26:27] Ebonmourn: nah its key:value,
[0:26:37] Apparentthreat: does key have to be a string or can it be an int?
[0:26:47] Mike190Twitch: Dict rays3c
[0:26:47] UltraScientism: C# has foreach statement
[0:26:52] LtCol_Carter: Think it can be an int
[0:26:54] Chronoes: nah, normal iteration is over keys only
[0:26:56] Ebonmourn: The key just has to be hashable
[0:27:13] Chronoes: primeDict.entries() would give you (key, value) pairs
[0:27:19] Apparentthreat: end quote
[0:27:19] mechoriet: never closed the "
[0:27:24] mattertater: ive always used .items()
[0:27:28] Tabakhase: "list of primes" is certainly not a scalable approach ;-)
[0:27:35] Schnoodle147: yep ^^
[0:27:36] joaofcmb: I think it's .entries(), returns a tuple of key, value
[0:27:43] Chronoes: or yeah, .items() not entries
[0:27:55] joaofcmb: There's also .keys() and . values() if you want to iterate one of them
[0:27:59] Tabakhase: "not nothing"
[0:27:59] Chronoes: normal iteration is for keys only @Giantwaffle
[0:28:04] toapsi: dict.items()
[0:28:25] Sander20011: Well, apparently you don't remember it XD
[0:28:26] HartvigN: just use the key to get value from the dict
[0:28:28] Tabakhase: key, value is fine
[0:28:31] Chronoes: for key, value in primeDict.items():
[0:28:32] Tabakhase: change the right side
[0:28:39] Egrassa22: primeDict[key]
[0:28:55] Ebonmourn: you need to grab the key:value pairs from the dict the 'for' only does keys by default

[0:30:03] Apparentthreat: yeah b/c dict[key] = # will either create it or overwrite existing value. Don't need to check first
[0:30:07] Tiggaboo: I am trying to work, why are you making me work
[0:30:11] Vovosunt: BTW guys how often is VIM actually used in the industry?
[0:30:18] MrCoolBlueKid: What's the new minecraft going to be called ? CaveBuild ? Kappa
[0:30:32] Apparentthreat: and checking if dict[key] exists before using it is also easy
[0:30:36] Chronoes: @Vovosunt usually up to preference
[0:30:43] dasmako: nah ppl just wack
[0:30:50] Mike190Twitch: IDE is love IDE is life
[0:30:51] mattertater: vim isnt a necessity, just really convenient to know
[0:30:52] Schnoodle147: people just wanna be different
[0:30:52] Deadfox74: I’m currently coding an arduino for work
[0:30:53] camerenisonfire: No, they just want to see like a "better" brogrammer
[0:30:59] dasmako: people dislike convenience
[0:31:00] dasmako: elitism
[0:31:01] Mike190Twitch: Brogrammer raysL
[0:31:16] DigitallyAdmiringHumanity: @Giantwaffle when are you going to play subnautica below zeero again
[0:31:26] Ebonmourn: The people who hate ide's often do a shit load of terminal work cause they are doing stuff on servers so they are always SSH'd into something
[0:31:29] Sarktastik: Using a text editor like vim makes people feel superior.
[0:31:29] philipkatis: They're a bloated mess most of the time. KEKW
[0:31:30] Frosty206: vim useful for editing shit when sshed into other nodes. other than that local dev always use IDE.
[0:31:32] Ladon_Dragon: depends on how big the project is tbh
[0:31:35] FatRat_: "Whaaat, you arent using VI???" DansGame
[0:31:39] Chronoes: Realistically nobody writes in just a text editor, vim plugins, VSCode extensions etc still make an IDE in the end
[0:31:40] dasmako: yea i only vim when i have to ssh into servers n shit
[0:31:48] Schnoodle147: terminals feel cooler i guess
[0:31:49] Ladon_Dragon: if you work without an IDE on a big project I'll just assume you are an idiot lol
[0:31:52] Sarktastik: "Oh your software is easy to use, lol I use Nano get on my level,"

[0:32:41] Schnoodle147: some guy used microsoft word as an ide LUL
[0:32:43] dasmako: I started with notepad when i first didnt know wtf i was doing back in   middle school KEKW

[0:32:48] camerenisonfire: oof, only CSC 101 kids use notepad
[0:32:58] Quasky: My world changed forever when I started using Sublime Text rather than Notepad++
[0:33:11] Apparentthreat: Even if your IDE somehow doesn't support remote edit, SCP works over SSH and there are SCP clients w/ GUI that will allow you to edit remote file locally and then just reupload upon saving.
[0:33:24] Allmostdone: Punch cards are they ONLY way to code

[0:36:48] hlidskjalf77708: its html
[0:36:49] camerenisonfire: For more complex web applications, you roll it out to various boxes over time so you don't interrupt service
[0:36:50] Lidl_Username: Then the new one will load the next reload
[0:36:51] JBourden: wouldnt that be client end
[0:36:52] Schnoodle147: they would just have to refresh the page at the worst
[0:36:53] jegkanikkelidetwitch: no http is stateless
[0:36:54] mechoriet: no? if its not broken
[0:36:54] Tabakhase: you can open a website and pull the cable out of your wall @Giantwaffle
[0:36:58] hlidskjalf77708: html is interpreted
[0:37:01] MACFRA98: minecraft music reminds me of runescape music NotLikeThis
[0:37:03] kypudo: they arlready have the file on their side
[0:37:05] drewzerTV: their browser will continue to serve them the cached version for a while unless you cache bust
[0:37:07] kyanpeppaa: levers make it grow faster?
[0:37:09] Sander20011: no, because they have an old version of the index file till it refreshes the file in their cache

[0:37:24] Narcraft_mc: hey waffle & chat, been forever!
[0:37:44] Tabakhase: at the point where a "user" actually sees a website, the server is long done serving it
[0:37:44] Moobot: Support Waffle by using his Epic creator code: Giantwaffle
[0:37:45] Lidl_Username: What do you mean magnets don't exist
[0:37:50] boogerbomb01: Yes you need powergen
[0:37:52] Sentinel1_9: @Apparentthreat please dont use logic here, its forbidden
[0:37:59] Tylerbuell16: why do i find this more confusing than DSP lol
[0:38:10] boogerbomb01: The CEF
[0:38:11] johnny_dan: @Tiggaboo Actually you maintain the cache even after, if you want a clean refresh you need to also hold "ctrl" or tick the "disable cache" in dev tools (and keep the dev tools open)
[0:38:16] CorSPACE: check the energetic infuser
[0:38:18] xfrozev2: Flux Capacitator in the CEF @Giantwaffle

[1:08:15] Tiggaboo: my house is appraised at like 250k, valued at 475k
[1:08:16] Larklen: yeah sell value can differ on the appraised value depending on market demand
[1:08:16] Venxuri: did property value skyrocket in the states during the pandemic?
[1:08:18] kellphi: tax appraisal is different than mortgage appraisal.
[1:08:19] Joshuapetch: @Nexhunter no, that's not allowed
[1:08:19] DoPlusSee: pepeSmoke
[1:08:20] boogerbomb01: In Austin it would probably sell for WAY more than its value
[1:08:20] JoeCrow: that's how they determine property taxes and such
[1:08:24] Havoks085: @Giantwaffle usually apprisal value is the value that a bank approve the loan towards your house for
[1:08:24] Ender410: pepeSmoke
[1:08:30] Yolo_Andthenagain: Appraisal value is for property taxes. You want them to be as low as possible
[1:08:30] Tomthegamer: Appraisal is not sell value
[1:08:31] Tiggaboo: it isn't always
[1:08:31] Poant: Based on the assessed value of the land and building
[1:08:34] usernameNull: in texas appraisals go up every year so taxes go up
[1:08:34] Larklen: You want a low appraisal until you actually want to sell :)
[1:08:37] JoeCrow: its not
[1:08:39] Scojan: Appraisal is not the same as sell value
[1:08:46] Scojan: Your sell value is typically higher than appraisal
[1:08:56] Tiggaboo: we have houses up in Montreal, appraised at like 300k, selling for 550k
[1:08:59] Scojan: No
[1:09:01] boatnutsAL: taxas are based off the appraised value
[1:09:02] Keoonik: its made of wood

[1:09:21] Allmostdone: Isn’t getting appraisal once a year a bit much?
[1:09:26] Scojan: If you sell your house for 100K more just because the market is up the appraisal won't be affected
[1:09:27] Larklen: No, appraisal and sell value are separate. Even if its sold for $2million, appraisal wont be that either
[1:09:29] Vizion_TV: Shiba Inu Farm? Kappa
[1:09:33] kyanpeppaa: got that oil under your house ez money
[1:09:36] srgp2015: an oil field xd
[1:09:39] Yolo_Andthenagain: It trues up after purchases because a willing seller/buyer is the best indication of value of the property/house
[1:09:40] imShnaz: A bitmine
[1:09:40] boogerbomb01: The appraisals come from the county not Waffle lol
[1:09:40] Poant: It's based off the assessed value of the building and the land, then you could have exemptions and it could also be a new purchase as well
[1:09:50] usernameNull: county appraisals arent real appraisals, they can only go up a certain percent a year from county
[1:10:06] boogerbomb01: Every homeowner usually fights it to get it lowered
[1:10:06] Moobot: Support Waffle by using his Epic creator code: Giantwaffle
[1:10:08] Havoks085: @Giantwaffle Example: if your appraisal says 2 zillion, then a bank only will be willing to finance someone for 2 zillion, even IF if a prospective buyer wants to buy it for 3 zillion.

[3:53:42] jawnythompson: rust was big for like 2 weeks this year
[3:53:44] Salico: is the listing metas the next meta? KEKW
[3:53:51] dadish: If vtubers go meta im done with twitch
[3:54:00] Joshuapetch: The waffle meta
[3:54:02] PxlSauce: I don't think vtubers are gonna be a real meta. it's just another category

[3:54:39] Goodmangammering: the "not interested" button dosent actually work is the problem
[3:54:42] M1k3D3l7a: mkoFace1 mkoMouthOh mkoFace3
[3:54:42] DemonicHell3: Time to mark 90% of twitch as not interested
[3:54:46] Geegum: I honestly don't even know what a vtuber is
[3:54:47] pupupuputter: there is vtubers on cbate and 1000s of people watch it
[3:54:49] lazermage24: Use the 'not interested" unless they are sponsored then "we dont care about your preferences"

[3:55:46] Triz08: now he just calls someone else
[3:55:47] decentfarts: just don't mix up his cables
[3:56:06] KonShika: to be fair, audio is a fucked thing to work with. but yeah a large portion of streamers dont even bother with good audio, just a plug and play mic

[3:58:38] dadish: I rather have the oreveins that was in Sevtech then these that are "spread out"
[3:58:50] PxlSauce: one thing I find annonying is that people, seem to have their ffz audio compression on and expect that to be normal. sometimes seomthing on stream I find way to quiet, but I never change my audio
[3:58:50] Azafure: What happened to snow runner?
[3:58:52] Hyduss_: Or build a tesla battery in the headphones Kappa
