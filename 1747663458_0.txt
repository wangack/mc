[2:21:02] tom98784: arghhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
[2:21:07] RufusTheHairyCatWrangler: circles? In Minecraft?
[2:21:14] DarQuing: you can also lock the rotation so north is always at the top
[2:21:17] voltsurfer037: All these squares make a circle
[2:21:37] SaltyMorbs: About 400 million years ago the Earth was dominated by giant mushrooms over 8 metres tall!
[2:21:50] RufusTheHairyCatWrangler: I prefer 'noob tower'
[2:22:07] AureliaaX: just never look down at the shape of your shadows

[2:22:50] theactualdeer: Wait it is definitely a thing
[2:22:58] AureliaaX: I think you need to move a couple villagers in first, and they'll start multiplying if there's appropriate homes
[2:22:59] SpaceShipRat: it's a thing
[2:22:59] lofi_tofuu: If you have villagers and beds you can spawn golems
[2:23:00] UnderwurldChris: Sounds like Terraria
[2:23:00] tom98784: You can breed them but they won't spawn naturally
[2:23:00] Psithief: It's lies

[2:23:13] Notaro_: You need to kidnap an Adam and Steve villager to get the village started.
[2:23:17] SpaceShipRat: but you need some villagers to breed
[2:23:18] voltsurfer037: You can make them have speshal cuddles, but don't think they can free spawn
[2:23:18] Psithief: Villagers BREED, but don't SPAWN.
[2:23:20] Purple_Chewbacca: i tried doing it once and it didn't go well...requires sooo much patience
[2:23:21] SaltyMorbs: There's such a thing as too much birthday cake?
[2:23:27] AureliaaX: yea you gotta rehome natural villagers first into your artificial one
[2:23:30] AureliaaX: but they adopt it eventually
[2:23:30] Z0eff: chat, they're asking if villagers spawn when you make a house
[2:23:32] DarQuing: @Z0eff is today your birthday?
[2:23:33] theactualdeer: I think also you feed them bread to breed
[2:23:43] Gold__Kai: only works with the Minecraft Comes Alive mod if from scratch
[2:23:45] Z0eff: even if you build a roof with a door, they wont spawn :p
[2:23:47] AlexWojtak: If yoou got one mistake on your birthday, what mistake would you make?
[2:23:59] Darineth: Briony - The Bristol Abductor
[2:24:07] Psithief: Yah zoof, but look beyond the wrong thing they're saying and tell them the right thing!
[2:24:14] voltsurfer037: Barry knows the ways of villager breeding
[2:24:19] Maxwell_Bloodfencer: That was either Terraria or a mod
[2:24:31] Maxwell_Bloodfencer: it has never been a thing in MC outside of mods
[2:24:46] AureliaaX: the early xbox versions always had different QoL things from the PC versions I think
[2:24:55] Wittlock: Morning yogP yogHey VIBE
[2:24:57] Purple_Chewbacca: Also you can't breed the green ones
[2:25:19] Psithief: Your memory failed over the years, sadly.
[2:25:22] RufusTheHairyCatWrangler: If you have a village with villagers then iron golems will spawn in
[2:25:22] Purple_Chewbacca: yeah that would have been bedrock edition, which is different
[2:25:30] Z0eff: this is why that mod that allows you to literally pickup villagers and bring them with you is so amazing. Means you don't have to build near a village just to use the villager mechanic
[2:25:40] Purple_Chewbacca: bedrock and java have some weird differences
[2:25:49] Purple_Chewbacca: @Z0eff that's soooo good, i've used that
[2:26:04] lofi_tofuu: Easy villages i such a nice mod for that
[2:26:11] lofi_tofuu: Villagers*
[2:26:36] AureliaaX: a recipe mod to make your own saddles and nametags could be handy too
[2:26:44] Purple_Chewbacca: deserts and savanna are good for villages - you seem to be in cooler biomes like taiga
[2:26:47] AureliaaX: at least so Briony can name an enderman and keep him around in a boat
[2:26:49] Juravil: swamp
[2:26:54] RufusTheHairyCatWrangler: It never rains in the desert
[2:26:55] DarQuing: i vote in the dark oak forest with the tall mushroom that Briony found
[2:26:59] rossibo: ideally somewhere with either ground or sky
[2:27:02] voltsurfer037: Flower meadows are pretty + open places
[2:27:02] lofi_tofuu: It’s just no moon but there’s mesa biomes
[2:27:03] Notaro_: In front of somewhere that looks cool.
[2:27:09] AlexWojtak: I always go for a plains or flower fields biome
[2:27:10] drakegard: swamp for slimes or desert for no rain
[2:27:18] theactualdeer: Whichever biome is your favorite
[2:27:27] AlexWojtak: Somewhere nice and flat is good if you're a first-timer.
[2:27:29] lofi_tofuu: Mesa or above a mush cavern
[2:27:34] AureliaaX: I like savanahs
[2:27:34] Purple_Chewbacca: i like savanna
[2:27:35] Psithief: build a floating island in the ocean

[2:27:53] ginjninj: so it did USED to be a thing, but it changed as of java 1.14 "Village detection is now based on beds, job sites, and meeting points instead of doors."
[2:27:55] Purple_Chewbacca: @AureliaaX Savanna buddies brionyBunless
[2:28:01] rossibo: OOOO Jungle
[2:28:02] voltsurfer037: Jungle biome have great mobs to befriend, eg parrots, pandas, cheetahs
[2:28:04] AlexWojtak: Mushroom island is hard to find, but baddies just don't spawn there.
[2:28:05] Idunyken: You can grab some of the vines to grow with some shears
[2:28:06] ginjninj: phew, im not crazy minecraft has just had a lot of changes
[2:28:08] AureliaaX: Yes Chewie kirstUnless
[2:28:15] lofi_tofuu: Do you guys like Wild West?
[2:28:22] rossibo: there's something else you're gonna want from there Briony brionyTap
[2:28:39] RufusTheHairyCatWrangler: I typically go with a plains because they are mostly flat and easy to build on, but that's because I build huge things. No other reason to go to a plains though
[2:28:39] AureliaaX: @rossibo cocoa beans? pcGiggle
[2:28:44] raccon_0w03: Hola 😋🤚🏻

[2:36:02] ReavingDeath: now kill it with fire like the long neck in the movie
[2:36:13] Psithief: Villages and Pillager Outposts have no relationship to one another.
[2:36:28] Psithief: Villages are just common.
[2:36:34] theactualdeer: Pillagers will spawn forever there
[2:36:36] voltsurfer037: Unfortunately you can't clear then out to claim them, I've tried 😔
[2:36:41] ReavingDeath: you cant stop them from spawing
[2:36:50] ginjninj: its only a 30 minute walk Keepo
[2:37:14] Purple_Chewbacca: if you go into a village it is bad
[2:37:16] ReavingDeath: i think you can trap the pillagers tho and they wont spawn more so long as others are near
[2:37:16] AureliaaX: if you enter a village, a raid will start
[2:37:18] joll05: if you enter a village it will start a raid on the village
[2:37:20] Gold__Kai: spawns a raid in a village
[2:37:20] ginjninj: what was the shiny potion you got
[2:37:21] theactualdeer: If you go to a village then a raid starts
[2:37:21] HauntingBird: create a shitton of golems to kill any that spawn LUL
[2:37:21] voltsurfer037: It causes pillagers to invade a village if you go there
[2:38:28] voltsurfer037: Now get a boat and bring him home
[2:38:33] AureliaaX: crossbows are always neat too if you want to make one NODDERS
