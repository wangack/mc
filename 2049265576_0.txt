[0:56:40] dor0203: you should make a shell farm in the start of the aa
[0:56:41] BigLungsDK: surely no dongs
[0:56:48] AwtimalTwitch: @wanuria nod 25% chance of having one
[0:56:49] kittykat2626: lucky

[0:57:12] Nexlation: 2 shells pog
[0:57:13] daiichan_: pog shells
[0:57:13] lautriww: @dor0203 interesting idea
[0:57:27] TheRealZimmShady: dor0203 would take too long
[0:57:29] calm_2803: How much shells do you need?
[0:57:32] sh4dle: 8
[0:57:33] AwtimalTwitch: 8
[0:57:34] TheRealZimmShady: easier to just get them as you go
[0:57:40] caseykits: if mads is here can mads tell the game to give trident before rain ends
[0:57:40] lobito695: 5 more
[0:57:40] kittykat2626: what’s the chance for a shell guy to spawn
[0:57:44] CaptainCashew21: jamm
[0:57:48] TheRealZimmShady: 3% I think
[0:57:51] caseykits: RAIN NOOOO
[0:57:51] dor0203: well isnt it easier to get gold in the nether?
[0:57:53] cannnAvar: catVibe
[0:57:59] splendided: guys where in 7tv do i turn off bad words getting replaced with ***** (I can't think of the word)
[0:58:08] AwtimalTwitch: @dor0203 efficient to do this
[0:58:09] lobito695: @dor0203 but you need ocean for shells and trident
[0:58:10] supitsAmber: !song
[0:58:11] TheRealZimmShady: dor0203 yes but you need other stuff in the ow
[0:58:11] Fossabot: glass beach - glass beach
[0:58:12] Nexlation: youre overlapping shells with looking for biomes, getting a trident, and getting gold, so its just like not worth it
[0:58:15] caseykits: command works pog
[0:58:29] dor0203: yh so i say you make a shell farm in the start of the run and get gold from nether
[0:58:37] CurtisDN_: any way to farm shells requires the player's presence and is way worse than doing this
[0:58:38] Nexlation: its too slow
[0:58:38] laybr2: @splendided isnt it in native twitch chat?
[0:58:40] TheRealZimmShady: its too slow
[0:58:51] splendided: i don't know?

[0:59:10] splendided: it is!!!!
[0:59:13] splendided: thanks layla
[0:59:14] TheRealZimmShady: you'd need to spend the first like hour grinding materials and building a farm instead of just fnding them during the run dor0203

[1:00:18] CurtisDN_: @TheRealZimmShady no your suggestion is just bad for a speedrun. even if you didnt have to build a drowned farm, it would be way worse to do that than to do ocean ruins during the midgame. like idk how else to say it
