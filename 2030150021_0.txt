[0:29:57] divathranir1504: @explodingmayhem949 o/
[0:29:58] stany_d: it's weirder that chickens create babies in 2 ways. They have eggs, but they also breed without eggs
[0:29:59] some1udonotno: You can bread them with cookies
[0:30:07] patapata_pan: Hi Pearl! Hi Chat! pearlieWave pearlieWave the notification was 30 mins late
[0:30:18] antalia_lotus: noooo
[0:30:22] coolpeeledpotatoe: i didnt even get a notification T>T
[0:30:24] ExachixKitsune: cookies does change the number of parrots you have
[0:30:27] GhostGecko8: @smeoneudontknow moment of silence for everyone whose tried that
[0:30:28] lowspecgames_: bahahaha old bait
[0:30:30] MaraudingBacon: @smeoneudontknow you are a horrible person ^_^
[0:30:51] dashmax1214: @smeoneudontknow that dasngerous
[0:30:51] justnormalgoose: Like they already have an egg model!
[0:30:52] antalia_lotus: it is dumm
[0:30:56] lilydeboef: no parrot life creation
[0:31:00] coolpeeledpotatoe: E
[0:31:01] batts_calamity: my brother tricked me into giving the parrot a cookie once, tramuatizing
[0:31:03] sapphicwhimsy: maybe cause baby birds are kinda ugly and dont fly
[0:31:10] tyry95: Did he mispell breed, or is he implying something by saying bread the parrot?
[0:31:15] azrafdaguy: It used to actually breed them but someone tweeted that it kills them or smth like that (correct me if im wrong)
[0:31:21] Nightbot:  Be respectful - No spamming - No advertising - English only
[0:31:21] Lissert271: very ironic that the advancement is caled parrots and bats and you cant breed either xD
[0:31:30] cheesetoastiezss: they could have scaled down the model it cant be that hard
[0:31:38] cupofjasmtea: hi pearl and chat! hope you’re doing okay pearlieHeart
[0:31:39] 19_meg_91: When are we getting frogs?
[0:31:48] lowspecgames_: @azrafdaguy ur correct!.! i think the original concept came from pirate story or smth
[0:31:56] CrusadeyBoi: are the mob nametag redeems turned off rn?
[0:31:57] glitchered: heyó/
[0:31:59] augustasman: what hapens to parrot?
[0:32:01] antalia_lotus: no
[0:32:05] pancake_lover_333: i tried to do trick my friend but it didn’t work so i just looked stupid
[0:32:06] tyry95: f5 so you don't have to keep looking
[0:32:09] gamingnscience: have you ever brought a Ghast to the overworld, Pearl? thinking about my next point redemption here. ;)
[0:32:11] sapphicwhimsy: @CrusadeyBoi yes shes trying to catch up some
[0:32:14] YourieMeow: pearlieHeart
[0:32:16] some1udonotno: And yet they didn't want to add fireflies because there toxic to frogs
[0:32:16] Nightbot:  Reminder to be kind in chat!
[0:32:19] stany_d: @Lissert271 I always thought that was part of the joke. Because it could have actually been "the birds and the bees", where you can breed e.g. chickens and bees
[0:32:21] CrusadeyBoi: @sapphicwhimsy ohh ok that makes sense
[0:32:24] ExachixKitsune: @azrafdaguy According to ***, it looked like the cookies would tame not breed
[0:32:27] kzenmatthias: And the advancement is called "the parrots and the bees"
[0:32:28] bluubuns: Why does the parrot not sit on your shoulder!
[0:32:34] antalia_lotus: no tea party with parrot pearliePepe
[0:32:36] lilydeboef: if they want that logic make it so if you feed cocoa beans to wolves they die
[0:32:39] scythementallic: @azrafdaguy is right. I read that somewhere
[0:32:41] RCMNexus: @gamingnscience I was just writing that down as you messaged that is crazy
[0:32:43] azrafdaguy: @ExachixKitsune ahh okay
[0:32:53] roflwotl: Cookies are toxic to dogs for the same reason: containing chocolate
[0:32:55] Mr13igh: It's also weird that wolves attack baby turtles...Minecraft is full of strange decisions
[0:32:55] ExachixKitsune: yeah, because everything in minecraft is realistic. Like skeletons and creepers at night
[0:32:55] Andromicat_: if i recall correctly, they originally coded it so that they could breed parrots with cookies, but people were upset saying that it would kill them so they changed it to seeds and made it so that cookies killed them
[0:32:55] Shijima_UK: Double standards. Typical of Mojang these days.
[0:32:56] FireUpTommy: Cheer10
[0:32:59] kazriel_: give us fireflies pleeaaaaseee mojang ;o;
[0:33:08] miracleasl: do you usually go swimming in the summer?
[0:33:13] GhostGecko8: @lilydeboef exactly, infact quite alot of animals cant eat chocolate
[0:33:15] Nightbot:  Don't become a french fry, be a good potato, remember to follow the stream!
[0:33:19] justnormalgoose: BUT YOU CAN BREED BEES?!? HOW IS THIS REALISM
[0:33:23] cheesetoastiezss: yeah and why cant you kill a dog with a cookie
[0:33:40] lilydeboef: @ghostgecko8 literally!!
[0:33:41] antalia_lotus: @justnormalgoose YES
[0:33:47] ExachixKitsune: pff the wiki even says "The advancement obtained for breeding two animals is called "The Parrots and the Bats", even though neither parrots nor bats can breed."
[0:33:49] ausmac_: 7 mil points contributed to the warden pearlieHype
[0:33:55] secret_agent4706: 7 mil yay!
[0:34:05] lilydeboef: 7 mil pearl!!
[0:34:06] kdlek89: probably one of the dev lost a parrot due to a kid feedings it
[0:34:10] stany_d: it's silly to include that one specific food for one specific animal to which it is poisonous
[0:34:13] bluubuns: Omg 7 mil!! I’m broke now lol but worth it

[0:35:01] stany_d: like, you can feed dogs rotten flesh - how is that not poisonous?
[0:35:05] RCMNexus: @coolpeeledpotatoe for some odd reason yes you can using nether mushrooms
[0:35:05] Kanavitas: If you're able to take flight without breaking the lead, ocelots don't take fall damage on account of the cat-ness, could be faster?
[0:35:11] divathranir1504: yeah
[0:35:18] dashmax1214: yup
[0:35:18] gg_864: Yes?
[0:35:20] 19_meg_91: I'd say 4 streams away

[0:35:37] coolpeeledpotatoe: @RCMNexus this is new information for me, been awhile since i heard something new. thx!
[0:35:38] GhostGecko8: @stany_d i think wolves just have tougher imune systems than us, that would probably be find for them

[0:36:22] ausmac_: i mean if its surrounded by wool it cant get agro on you
[0:36:22] Lissert271: can the warden sniff through wool?
[0:36:26] midnighteclipsekingrex_90: Hello how are you doing today

[2:21:13] datguccipoochie: hiiiii
[2:21:18] mashferef_wijafkjfa: the issue with the movies is that they're fine on their own, but horrible as an adaptation
[2:21:19] thomashetank: fav cartoon?
[2:21:19] Nightbot:  Be respectful - No spamming - No advertising - English only
[2:21:27] Cezenn: "no!" xD yeah i agree tho haha
[2:21:37] itsthenars: i saw someone didnt like how Ares was repesented in the series
[2:21:39] tishencat: listening to them is good
[2:21:42] Mithramuse: Been too long since I read the books, I thought there were some hints about Percy-in-water being 'better' so maybe she suspected something like that?
[2:21:43] castlebeki: I'm realising I don't remember very well thought.
[2:21:46] daredevil2300: is it like scary movies. in the creepiest of scenarios the idea is always “let me take a bath”
[2:21:47] Cezenn: series is speeding running the book haha
[2:22:07] antalia_lotus: i have them on cd
[2:22:17] Nightbot: Remember to check out the Frequently Asked Questions (#faq) channel on discord!

[2:22:30] Lissert271: holes was good
[2:22:31] Cezenn: hobbit 1,2,3 ?

[2:22:39] Cheesius: I have finally resigned myself to understanding I need to watch the movie before I read the book. I enjoy both a lot more when I do that
[2:22:40] ThatHairyGuyOG: Lord of the rings is great, but definitely not a good book adaptation
[2:22:42] maumiep: eragon hurt
[2:22:42] Elleliteration: howls moving castle
[2:22:42] LunarLumina: Lord of the Rings?

[2:22:49] Neamow: @llamagoat69 you cannot be serious
[2:22:50] hyperfix07: ive heard good about pride and prejudice
[2:22:53] blueguineapig78: Second vote for Good Omens
[2:22:53] preparedman: The first hobbit movie was also pretty good
[2:22:53] lardbucket_: They are doing an Eragon TV show apparently
[2:22:54] gooniekatie: LOTR
[2:22:54] kattituude: Books were definitely better but I still loved the Harry Potter movies
[2:22:56] floyd_is_me: Ready player one.

[2:23:04] jetwizardar: LOTR left out so much
[2:23:04] golddragon597: They are doing a TV series for eragon
[2:23:04] johndrinkwater: Can they keep Avril’s OST track?
[2:23:04] McCloudy7: the last book of eragon sucked though xD
[2:23:08] papa_prose: The Help was a great movie and a good adaptation
[2:23:09] divathranir1504: for sure lotr and narnia
[2:23:10] Code4Coffee: @tyry95 Movie is good but the book is amazing also
[2:23:14] chibiplaysgames: Yeah I don’t like the trend of skipping the slow burn, speed running the big plot moments to keep audiences attention or bait for social media reactions
[2:23:15] Nightbot:  Don't be a dry potato, remember to stay hydrated!
[2:23:17] MorgaNaRanja: thg
[2:23:19] thisjaid3n: the new hunger games just came out
[2:23:19] karasdracion: They made a new book just for the movie
[2:23:19] jenny_b14: @pixelreypup yes it has that kid who played Chekhov in the Star Trek reboot
[2:23:20] giannnovich: hunger games books are much more brutal
[2:23:23] nolemy2800: The Hunger Games are the best books I've ever read honestly
[2:23:23] castlebeki: True The Hobbit is great
[2:23:23] Neamow: The Boys is actually MUCH better than the original comic books
[2:23:26] Cezenn: they could divide, like the HP7 part 1 and part 2, Hobbit 1/2/3 or another divide book series haha
[2:23:26] BertPotato: yep, not the same name, but it was based on a short story afaik
[2:23:27] mashferef_wijafkjfa: does the one piece netflix show count? it's pretty great
[2:23:29] evesteroo: The End of the …… World was a really interesting adaption. The original book is a graphic novel done in quite a ‘basic’ style!
[2:23:30] ZigurdT: U shud read the books before watching
[2:23:33] RattyZee: LotR I'd say is another example of great movies, bad adaptations
[2:23:33] 19_meg_91: Invincible
[2:23:33] daredevil2300: second on Die Hard
[2:23:33] Gargolismc: I recently did, they still aight

[2:23:39] llamagoat69: captain underpants
[2:23:40] tyler_j_kovalskas: Threw up in a box...🤔🤣🤣 Pearlescent Moon, 2024... marrie20ROFL1 carlcraftsLaugh carlcraftsFacePalm
[2:23:40] DolphinJersey: Pride and Prejudice, cut down amount of characters but a good adaptation for the length they have.
[2:23:41] Code4Coffee: Patriots games is much better as the movie than the book
[2:23:41] divathranir1504: @castlebeki that's questionable...
[2:23:42] BertPotato: The Adjustment Bureau was also good
[2:23:44] pixelreypup: @jenny_b14 Thats awesome! ill have to check it out! I love Odd Thomas
[2:23:45] mommoth2: @pixelreypup My Percy expert who is watching and comparing says that she also thought they were making it less violent. Also considering that Percy is read at a young age as compared to Star Wars
[2:23:45] McCloudy7: the last one was such a disapointment
[2:23:47] revaar61: I read about a chapter of the first hunger games book before i decided i didn't want to read about a bunch of kids killing each other
[2:23:50] johndrinkwater: not same genre, but love The Martian film adapt, pretty close.
[2:23:51] papa_prose: @PearlescentMoon The Princess Bride
[2:23:52] joyleaf88: Ender's Game. Imperfect but truly captured the more subtle meanings and substories of the book.
[2:23:53] jenny_b14: what’s eragon about?
[2:23:53] mashferef_wijafkjfa: oh eragon's a great book series dude
[2:23:58] yoho139: wait there's a new book in the inheritance series?
[2:24:02] BazingaBec: the boys is amazing
[2:24:04] Code4Coffee: @jenny_b14 a dragon
[2:24:07] DasAbsoluteDeuteron: I'm currently rewatching The Sopranos
[2:24:09] castlebeki: @divathranir1504 why?
[2:24:12] Bellancia: Watchmen?
[2:24:14] tyler_j_kovalskas: That's ok i think it's hilarious 🤣🤣🤣
[2:24:14] sapphicwhimsy: at least it wasnt like the divergent series...
[2:24:16] Nightbot:  Join the discord: https://discord.gg/pearlescentmoon
[2:24:17] Waverider202: how about The Martian
[2:24:19] RattyZee: Howl's Moving Castle is vastly different from the book but also wonderful
[2:24:20] BertPotato: Die Hard was based on a novel called "Nothing Lasts Forever"
[2:24:30] datguccipoochie: i don’t read enough books or watch enough movies 😔
[2:24:30] preparedman: The John Carter movie was alright
[2:24:34] Gargolismc: Have you ever read anything from Sanderson. Cause that guy is so great hes been ruining every other reading experience for me haha
[2:24:38] thisjaid3n: it’s hard b/c shows are alot of parts in one episode so it’s a lot of episodes in extra scenes or not enough scenes
[2:24:40] pixelreypup: @mommoth2 I do agree that it is less violent, I also love the Percy Jackson series. Im just saying that Disney has made violent stuff before
[2:24:40] chibiplaysgames: Love Howls Moving Castle
[2:24:43] boquma: da Vinci Code
[2:24:46] eshaan: when you are reading a book, you have your imagination to build the visuals. I think it is very difficult to visualise the story as the matches how everyone visualized the story
[2:24:49] Mithramuse: The Martian - main thing I think they changed was the 'fly like Iron Man' bit.
[2:24:50] beariel_: I didn't think anyone else read Eragon aaaa
[2:24:54] patapata_pan: Eragon is apparently a cult classic
[2:24:56] 19_meg_91: Reacher is also good
[2:24:58] Code4Coffee: @datguccipoochie you probably do many other things <3
[2:25:11] giannnovich: @datguccipoochie neither
[2:25:15] mommoth2: @pixelreypup Yes, but not directed toward middle schoolers
[2:25:18] Gargolismc: "finds"
[2:25:26] pixelreypup: @mommoth2 true
[2:25:27] gooniekatie: wasn’t the author of Eragon 13 when he wrote it?
[2:25:30] Gargolismc: "random"
[2:25:43] Verygoodfeel01: Reacher series who like it?
[2:25:44] jenny_b14: I’ll have to check that out after I finish my current series.
[2:25:44] revaar61: I've been reading a lot of Agatha Christie recently, The Poirot novels in particular.  Highly recommend, especially The Murder of Roger Ackroyd
[2:25:45] Gargolismc: @gooniekatie like 16 or 17 i think
[2:25:47] WitheredXT: Hello Pearl and chat!
[2:26:01] giannnovich: @WitheredXT heya
[2:26:01] manish_9213: I remember playing the game eragon
[2:26:06] 19_meg_91: Wasn't eragon a movie with rachel weisz and jeremy irons?
[2:26:08] pixelreypup: @verygoodfeel01 I just watched the first movie and I like it, but I havent read the books
[2:26:12] Gargolismc: nah that was a fitting spoiler free summary
[2:26:16] McCloudy7: a lot of lore, i love a book that has a good index/appenix
[2:26:31] RattyZee: A lot of classics have multiple good adaptations. Agatha Christie, Jane Austen
[2:26:31] papa_prose: The first book of Eragon is essentially a retelling of Star Wars Episode 4. That being said, the full series was a good read when I was younger!
[2:26:38] Gargolismc: I just always hated how Eragon was so painfully close to Aragorn
[2:26:39] hyperfix07: @revaar61 agatha christie! i quite liked and then there were none
[2:26:43] chibiplaysgames: How to train your dragon series and movies were better than the books
[2:26:45] mashferef_wijafkjfa: eragon was one of the first times i literally just found myself teleported to a ficitonal world and didn't emerge until i'd finished the books
[2:26:51] itsthenars: i cry every day for Artemis Fowl.
[2:26:58] 19_meg_91: I've seen the movie once LUL
[2:26:59] manish_9213: Eragon the game was co-op and was so fun. I still remember it
[2:27:01] tyry95: Is the new murtagh book good? I didn't like his scifi one
[2:27:02] daredevil2300: so a dragon movie had a dude with Iron in the name. that’s cool
[2:27:03] pixelreypup: @chibiplaysgames Yes! That was my childhood was the movies and TV show
[2:27:10] i_oblivian: true that, movie is trash compared to the book
[2:27:11] Code4Coffee: @itsthenars that name rings me a Bell. Where is it from?
[2:27:11] beariel_: Don't get me started on the Artemis Fowl movie adaption
[2:27:14] i_oblivian: i read all 4
[2:27:18] jaspercoz: @beariel_ ikr
[2:27:18] castlebeki: Need to sleep, good stream everyone
[2:27:22] FerriaForever: You know, one of the movies that butchered the book was Ella Enchanted.
[2:27:26] 19_meg_91: U love dragons so makes sense
[2:27:29] FerriaForever: The book is amazing, the movie is a joke.
[2:27:31] Gargolismc: I loved it when i was 13 but when i reread it recently it wasnt all that great unfortunately
[2:27:31] Verygoodfeel01: @pixelreypup don't mean the movie they made series i am on season 2
[2:27:32] beariel_: @jaspercoz I never rant but hoboy
[2:27:32] yoho139: I'm glad I usually manage to forget they made Artemis Fowl / Eragon movies
[2:27:38] datguccipoochie: im gonna go back to sleep my head hurts looking at my screen rn, have fun !
[2:27:39] SimplyChase_: I really want to read books but it's so difficult for me to focus. Does anyone possibly have any tips on how to stop my brain from being so ADHD
[2:27:40] i_oblivian: Eragon, Eldest, Brisingr and Inheritance

[2:28:48] McCloudy7: oh wow
[2:28:52] giannnovich: @SimplyChase_ dont use social medias as much, that should do the trick
[2:29:01] chinook_a: naww
[2:29:02] Tinker_it: The list for named stuff must be  long; there's no option to add more.
[2:29:06] i_oblivian: murtagh, eragon's bro
[2:29:18] chibiplaysgames: I loved the redwall series growing up, and glad they haven’t tried to give it the Disney treatment. I didn’t fully realize how much violence there was until I went to read it to my daughter lol
[2:29:21] doxisontwitchnow: yet another Doc connection, right? He knows so many folks

[2:30:30] Tinker_it: smart!
[2:30:30] BertPotato: Given the increasing entity lag, it might be an idea to change the redemption to items only?

[2:31:14] chibiplaysgames: Those woodland creatures were just committing crimes every day between glorious feasts lol
[2:31:18] giannnovich: @SimplyChase_ Discord is fine, Twitter is pretty bad though. But yea avoiding Insta and tiktok is pretty good since those are the two main attention span killers.

[2:34:42] chinook_a: cooking videos are fun, the excessive eating is ugh
[2:34:43] pastel_cottontail: Ramsey is mostly a butt on American shows, on things like his world tour he’s very polite and respectful
[2:34:46] LunarLumina: They make the character Gordon Ramsay seem more harsh that he actually is in real life
[2:34:46] beariel_: I've been watching new Kitchen Nightmares

[2:37:31] stany_d: many farms where the output just needs to be crafted into something else will benefit immediately, but overall the crafter turns minecraft into factorio if you want to
[2:37:35] 999avatar999: oh
[2:37:44] revaar61: Autocrafters will make gold and bartering farms fully automatic and cross the line to completely OP

[2:38:16] Beri: sunday
[2:38:16] Riff_Raff_: @chibiplaysgames Why does everyone focus on spiders in Australia? There aren't many countries that DON'T have spiders
[2:38:18] ElEighty00: The last video I saw from Jazza, he mentioned he was going through a hard time mentally. I hope he is doing better, but I dont' remember when that was.

[2:40:16] vidia21: that’s the quality of the nail polish
[2:40:23] dmreins: My sister says her fingernails can't breathe with nail polish. Probably a similar sensation.
[2:40:25] stany_d: spiders are my favourite animal, I think they always have been. They just look so cool
[2:40:27] sapphicwhimsy: pearl i relate to that SO hard with sensory issues LOL
