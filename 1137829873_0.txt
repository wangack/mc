[2:41:49] itzSimondr98: Guess Zitrone is choking now Sadge
[2:41:52] fluffycow003: oh yeah? Kappa
[2:41:53] SpoonerTheGreat: lol
[2:41:53] Kaomie: The thumbnail for this map looks like a turd, but the race is actually okay
[2:41:53] SupaStevo: especially if you utilize the fallingmod
[2:41:54] Larklen: widePepeLaugh
[2:41:55] Damikiller37: OMEGALUL Do it then
[2:41:58] OMICRON: lets not get carried away now LUL
[2:42:01] onkelkonkel: sURE pepeLaugh
[2:42:02] Drobotic: lol there's no way
[2:42:02] s_DeXTeR_s: Realy KAPPA
[2:42:05] Archelonde: rip that guy
[2:42:10] UltraScientism: why do you think physics is easy? The game uses box2d, a ready made library. Physics is really hard.
[2:42:11] onkelkonkel: Kappa
[2:42:12] fluffycow003: lets see you do it then pepeLaugh
[2:42:16] s_DeXTeR_s: Realy? Kappa
[2:42:17] iArchy: susHmm
[2:42:18] TowerControl: 9.82m/s/s
[2:42:20] Larklen: How long did it take for the maze generation game to get done? widePepeLaugh
[2:42:24] AsHackDM: YEP  its easy
[2:42:25] FoXsTeRDOTA: Totally
[2:42:27] ommi53: Kekw
[2:42:31] TheSavageCoder: Multi-threading? You don't need multi threading for that game
[2:42:31] Kidzjin: for most* tbh
[2:42:41] cooljas19: moon2WOW
[2:42:45] Qygon: Is noita a custom engine ?
[2:42:47] bronzibr: is there another game like noita?
[2:42:51] OMICRON: from css grid boxes to noita Kappa
[2:42:57] Akiron_rafa: There are worst games there KEKW
[2:43:00] Jayouz: @Giantwaffle You should make a Waffle cooking game!
[2:43:01] PolarSlime: We need a WaffleClicker
[2:43:06] SupaStevo: maybe just another card-based roguelike?
[2:43:10] FoXsTeRDOTA: Map 16 of the current campaign is really good dirt practice if you are looking for some
[2:43:12] SupaStevo: those are pretty easy to program
[2:43:15] OMICRON: i believe!
[2:43:15] Jayouz: Like the old Pizza Tycoon but for Waffles!
[2:43:16] Zephhee: Did some clothes physic in c++ with matrix, that was hard
[2:43:16] CanadianLuke: card game would be pog
[2:43:21] Brozach1: That take is hilarious. The reason programming a physics is easy to program is because the physics engine designers already did all the hard work for you.
[2:43:21] daftMOOSE: Have you watched Dani on YT? He has funny videos about game dev
[2:43:30] Mandorake: @Giantwaffle car based rogue lite
[2:43:35] Mageroth: @Giantwaffle do you know p5.js? you could try making noita in it
[2:43:36] iArchy: PepoThink
[2:43:38] Akiron_rafa: Need someone to make some 3D modeling
[2:43:40] aeadon: that's a lot of models
[2:43:48] SupaStevo: edge Kreygasm the lawn
[2:43:58] Jaded_Parrot: Power wash has had an update
[2:43:59] nxusr: call it gardening simulator
[2:43:59] Cracker_wacker4: trim big bushes
[2:44:00] Myekos: create a tanks / worms style game
[2:44:03] quark_Charm: That would be awesome
[2:44:05] iArchy: pool cleaning simulator
[2:44:20] JaxPC: sprites. sprites are always the best way to model anything Kappa
[2:44:20] TowerControl: Sebastian Lague is amazing
[2:44:30] BlainL: vacuum simulator
[2:44:31] SupaStevo: like blades of grass, maybe
[2:44:32] Ghandus: good luck with the shaders :D
[2:44:34] PolarSlime: there is a leaf blowing simulator
[2:44:34] Akiron_rafa: Not that hard to do
[2:44:38] Kaomie: I think he is hiding a bit of the actual code difficulties
[2:44:47] FoXsTeRDOTA: Oh for sure he is
[2:44:55] Onailgam: window cleaner simulator, in vr, highrises
[2:44:57] Shoderra: I got my second covid shot, and the nurse said it would probably feel like i got hit by a baseball bat later. She wasn't lying
[2:45:07] Ghandus: imo shaders are _hard_
[2:45:08] FoXsTeRDOTA: But he also shows some of the more "smart" methods he uses to make certain stuff
[2:45:22] Damikiller37: monkaCrash Shaders learning be like
[2:45:27] MrGuwee: start 2d? search for codemonkey
[2:45:32] Ummon_: a big part of the appeal with powerwashing sim is how the surfaces go from dirty to glistening wet and then dry off
[2:45:33] Jayouz: @Shoderra Feel better soon! I'm glad my 2nd wasn't worse, my first one nearly killed me! :D
[2:45:34] daemonaedryn: Do both, a webgame Kappa
[2:45:36] FoXsTeRDOTA: Game dev in JS Kappa
[2:45:36] Myekos: bonk
[2:45:37] BillNyeTheRoboRussianSpy: this is not minecrap
[2:45:38] MrGuwee: shaders and heavy c# ...also cleancode
[2:45:40] GSBressan: @Giantwaffle do an Idler... Cookie Clicker style! <3
[2:45:55] DocMarrs: javascript game?
[2:45:56] stealthymango1: psh, look at this guy leveraging his situation
[2:45:57] poopchuteprowlr: The pressure is on these top four bonking on easy corners
[2:46:05] Larklen: KEKW
[2:46:06] officialzip: build the game in react
[2:46:06] ChoOyu: Wasting and C# never heard that combo
[2:46:10] FoXsTeRDOTA: ASP.NET though Kreygasm
[2:46:12] qiakgue: oof frontend
[2:46:12] Originalfudge: browser games Pog
[2:46:13] aeadon: plenty of games made for web
[2:46:14] Mandorake: Flutter is the new hotness
[2:46:15] alfa_202: if you learn C# you could use Blazor for your web development
[2:46:16] devyndamonster: There's a C# front-end now with Microsofts Blazor
[2:46:22] YaseenDIY: Do you wanna coding professionally for a company?
[2:46:22] OMICRON: can't go wrong learning any C based language
[2:46:25] SupaStevo: b l a z OMEGALUL r
[2:46:28] Akiron_rafa: Time to learn C++
[2:46:29] DocMarrs: when you get really good with programming, switching languages isn't a very big leap
[2:46:31] Jerod5_: use three . js to make a game
[2:46:33] UltraScientism: There are shaders in your browser -- webgl and webgpu
[2:46:38] aeadon: then you can port your cookie clicker clone to steam for $5 :)
[2:46:45] matdru: 1year and you good :D
[2:46:47] Tech: True
[2:46:47] Akiron_rafa: nahh react is not that hard to learn
[2:46:50] OMICRON: ones you know any C base language the rest come with ease
[2:46:50] mechoriet: well then make big projects :)
[2:46:58] Akiron_rafa: at least to be competent
[2:47:03] TheSavageCoder: React itself isn't very hard. It's generic programming and understanding nuances of web programming that take the time
[2:47:04] FoXsTeRDOTA: I am currently on 3rd semester of Software Engineering. Started on C# course. We are going to be learning Blazor, ASP.NET
[2:47:05] Mageroth: Vue is better than react though PepeFlushed
[2:47:07] Tech: Yeah
[2:47:07] Originalfudge: you can get good at react realtively quickly, ~6 months imo
[2:47:09] fluffycow003: but by the time that what are the chances of something new coming out to over take something liek react?
[2:47:12] defnotblaze: how do you enable that input/gear indicator?
[2:47:15] Chronoes: indie game dev is something you do on the side
[2:47:18] Tech: You'd be crazy to hard swap to indie dev I feel
[2:47:21] CanadianLuke: but you already have a platform like you said
[2:47:24] Dentuca: Why not backend, @Giantwaffle ?
[2:47:24] grumpyfvck: that is how I ended up in corporate hell, because I wanted the sure thing.
[2:47:26] SimonSez: You should take a look at the game Stardeus. It's Rimworld meets Factorio in space. The dev streams here on Twitch and it's written in C#
[2:47:30] ChoOyu: or u make a shitgame and 1 streamer plays it and hype xD
[2:47:33] Akiron_rafa: Yeah thats true I tried :(
[2:47:39] Tech: They do both
[2:47:39] Kaomie: Indie >>>>>> Corporate
[2:47:42] BurnedAether: Among us took 2 years to go big. A large part of Indie dev is luck.
[2:47:48] Aarimous: You already have the following, I would leverage that to try and do indie stuff.
[2:47:53] UltraScientism: While you are developing your React skills, a new faddy framework would gain prominence KEKW
[2:47:55] fafuja: creator of The last night is one of them
[2:47:57] SeriousSergio: you can do games in front web YEP
[2:48:00] fafuja: but the game is very unique
[2:48:02] Leo_barks_at_sneezes: Leo_barks_at_sneezes subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 56 months, currently on a 15 month streak! 
[2:48:02] matdru: this my current flow -> senior fontend in corp and later pivot to some indie stuff :D
[2:48:09] 8bitbarbarian: you could learn Java/Kotlin...that gives you access to back-end web dev as well as android apps and potentially games from that
[2:48:11] Larklen: And if you stream your indie game development, makes some marketing even harder since people dont want to cover your game since they wont get as much traffic as a game with no known details.
[2:48:15] darknotch: he bounced
[2:48:15] daftMOOSE: bad landing
[2:48:17] K3ll06s: you can do so much as frontend, you  can be the programming lazy kind and be very good website guy, or do more js as a app dude with typescript vue and stuff, just get good at sth and understanding the rest and you can do so much
[2:48:18] SmoothBlizzard: so when do you want to quit streaming?
[2:48:19] Aarimous: Learning to program, the rest is just syntax
[2:48:19] BurnedAether: @Giantwaffle bounce
[2:48:20] Qygon: @Giantwaffle There are web based engines with typescript and knowing ts can help with learning react
[2:48:22] Gobri84: 80+ hours a week? When do you live your life?
[2:48:22] perryDW: bounced landing
[2:48:22] iArchy: he saw german in chat and bonked Kappa
[2:48:27] CanadianLuke: having a good game and monetizing it properly are 2 different things, mode devs suck at monetizing
[2:48:28] Furious_Ham: off topic but what is RLB doing??? glad i invested a few days ago STONKS
[2:48:28] fafuja: you can learn functional programming
[2:48:31] hellrider214: is icarus again tomorrow or is it next weekend?
[2:48:31] aeadon: i've hired two junior devs in the last month that have less experience than you. they'll be making six figures within two years.
[2:48:42] PepperIsUnderrated: Sadge
[2:48:49] Foppit: hey chat why is ETH boomin
[2:48:49] Moobot: You can find Waffle's Youtube channel here - https://youtube.com/giantwaffle
[2:48:49] Karnaxx: I work 40 and don't have that anyway
[2:48:49] Jaroldo3: Software Manager here, We focus heavily on VUE, but having full stack knowledge is important because you usually will be programming in both front and back at some point
[2:48:52] ChoOyu: DatSheffy Clap
[2:48:57] Askjong: me :)
[2:48:59] Gobri84: @Giantwaffle then thats a shit job+shit life
[2:49:00] umbranoxius: @8bitbarbarian kotlin devs cant be trusted
[2:49:06] Tasar_: Better lover what you do then
[2:49:08] Kaomie: Meanwhile here it's illegal to work more than 35h a week
[2:49:10] tivv20: You have what all the other indie devs cant get though..that platform bro use it dont sell yourself shit sucks
[2:49:11] DatoPotatoDato: i know someone who works 90 hours a week and i feel terrible for him
[2:49:12] DreamsTalker07: your od

[2:49:28] CanadianLuke: @Cracker_wacker4 cpa?
[2:49:34] SmoothBlizzard: imagine if you had to travel to work
[2:49:36] TheSavageCoder: @Kaomie illegal to work that much, or illegal for a company to schedule/require you for that much?
[2:49:37] Shoderra: Some people work 80 hours a week 20+ hours of travel on top
[2:49:39] Cracker_wacker4: @CanadianLuke yes sir
[2:49:41] DatoPotatoDato: J OMEGALUL B
[2:49:51] Dsherrell1978: I did it for a while just to make extra money
[2:49:51] Vargh: was there a good intro video for Create?
[2:49:54] fluffycow003: just say it?
[2:49:56] BilusTheTiny: to everyone saying fullstack, he should focus on one side and then if he get used to frontend then do some backend
[2:49:57] Gobri84: Just go full BONK
[2:49:57] Tithonius: your biting the hand that feeds you chat
[2:49:59] Moondarra: truth bomb inc

[2:50:08] daemonaedryn: Who makes a lot more than you
[2:50:10] Batistutah: any money earned is a job
[2:50:10] Damikiller37: You likely earn more than people J OMEGALUL B ing
[2:50:16] BilusTheTiny: bad idea to focus on both if you want to be proficient fast
[2:50:16] SeaOfMadness_: You make 10x what they make a year in month LUL
[2:50:18] SnackableGames: @Mageroth Hes ddef not a milli aire
[2:50:21] Kaomie: What is happeniong now what did chat say this time
[2:50:21] qiakgue: you're working and making a living, does that make every type of work a job?
[2:50:24] officialzip: waffleHmm
[2:50:29] Tech: Truth
[2:50:30] daemonaedryn: True
[2:50:34] CanadianLuke: YEP
[2:50:36] ChoOyu: C Ronaldo makes 2800€ per Hr
[2:50:37] Karnaxx: Don't hate on anyone trying to make a living
[2:50:41] SmoothBlizzard: girls on onlifans are making more than you with only 2 videos a month
[2:50:41] Tech: You don't get paid for your time
[2:50:43] 0sem0: If you think it's a job it's a job
[2:50:44] AvaanKha: CEOs
[2:50:45] UltraScientism: streaming _career_ sound better. like standup comedian career.
[2:50:47] Mandorake: A lot of jobs out there are really stupid easy and make stupid money.
[2:50:47] Akiron_rafa: Do you earn your living doing ... if so it your job
[2:50:48] ProjectAlephnull: Every job has easy and hard aspects
[2:50:49] Crossed_legion: few steps above only fans
[2:50:52] Tech: And that is something people need to understand
[2:50:52] a_brink: I’m a rocket surgeon and make 1 million an hour :)
[2:50:54] darknotch: Student debt Sadge
[2:50:59] Novillac: The goal in life should be to do as little as possible for as much money as possible
[2:51:01] TheSavageCoder: Understanding light architecture concepts of backend is very useful and will definitely help you make better decisions on the front end. But you don't need to dive deep to be proficient
[2:51:02] toastyytm: Who cares what other's do for money, as long as they are happy and its ethical you are fine.
[2:51:03] Mandorake: @Crossed_legion you say that like its a bad thing
[2:51:03] MoopCo: i get $30k for doing nothing, get ratio'd

[2:51:21] a_brink: Might as well quit now
[2:51:22] FoXsTeRDOTA: Nope KEKW
[2:51:24] Mandorake: @Giantwaffle  alot of times it comes from a place of resentment.  You're able to do something amazing and make money doing it while so many of us hate our jobs.
[2:51:25] Secondrate_King: 2000 a second is what he makes right?

[2:51:54] Mandorake: thats nearly double the poverty line
[2:51:54] Moobot: The category was set to "Minecraft"
[2:51:57] daftMOOSE: You could make 10k a day everyday since 1783 and still not have 1 billion dollars
[2:52:01] Atzgee: yeah that should be reality but it is
[2:52:02] I_n_s_p_i_r_e: also free of tax LOL

[2:52:15] toastyytm: 3.715k per second for Bezos
[2:52:18] Mandorake: per minute
[2:52:28] mechoriet: monkaS
[2:52:30] Brozach1: The fact he makes 55k per minute tells me some how Amazon creating literal trillions of dollars of value
[2:52:34] Frozen_Toilet: 80k/hr is about 7.5billion if you work for 40 years
[2:52:39] UltraScientism: computery things tend to turn into monopolies. (duopolies at best)
[2:52:40] Lord_Epsilon: I mean if you make that much money, you could invest and maybe make even more, being overly enthusiastic, perhaps, but still.
[2:52:41] daemonaedryn: Oh god what did nino do KEKW
[2:52:43] ninopanda: i figured it isnt as big as an issue @Giantwaffle
[2:52:49] CanadianLuke: @Brozach1 they own the internet so yea they're valuable

[2:53:54] panzer_elite1: Hey everybody i'm NINO!
[2:53:55] Blazedasthesun: NOP
[2:54:01] Tech: It's people making a lot of money and just holding onto it for themselves
[2:54:05] Demonikall: no not yet
[2:54:08] Blazedasthesun: no
[2:54:13] Mandorake: @Tech Also the exploitation of workers to achieve such wealth

[2:55:53] Tech: That's not quite right
[2:55:57] Tech: That's the nutrition before cooking

[2:56:07] Backtex: I got some instant ramen peepoHappy
[2:56:08] a_brink: That’s a large displacement of meat
[2:56:10] Kuroiorb: it's a lot, but if you only eat one meal a day it's fine

[2:58:21] Tech: Fat isn't bad though
[2:58:23] subfin: @Robbe_____ because we dont use grams...
[2:58:27] Apparentthreat: Robbe_____ it's usually on the label
[2:58:27] Mandorake: @Giantwaffle its also varies widly based off of what they used to make the ground meat with.  Stuff you get in the grocery store can be anything.
[2:58:28] Nexhunter: @Tech it is for me Sadge
[2:58:32] Apparentthreat: for a serving, but might not be 100g
[2:58:47] AllSham: how stupid is that... you search for 1lb of meat and you get result 77 grams of protein... america
[2:58:47] Mandorake: They're just guessing when they grind the meat in store.

[2:59:17] Mandorake: @Tech its slowly changing
[2:59:19] Atzgee: fat is good for you and easy way to add calories if you lack some
[2:59:25] EnergyCrow: @Tech low fat, non-fat that. i agree NODDERS
[2:59:32] subfin: @Robbe_____ lol good point... but even so americans aren't going to actually think about protein in weight, Xg of protein is just an arbitrary number do us
[2:59:35] Nexhunter: @Tech  right now it a battle against the fact I eat too much of fatty foods but it so good Sadge
[2:59:39] CanadianLuke: problem is americans usually get way too much fat in their diets so yea they have aversion
[2:59:47] Apparentthreat: Nexhunter switch it out w/ carbs
[2:59:49] Tech: @Nexhunter It's not about eating too many fatty foods
[2:59:52] Tech: It's about eating too many calories
[3:00:06] Tech: Americans and snacks that are not filling is a duo that needs to die
[3:00:09] Apparentthreat: Tech gram for gram, fat > carbs for calories
[3:00:39] MrPeabodyLive: @Giantwaffle remeber when you a soryan made a fallout bunker in minecraft
[3:00:40] Tech: Yes, but gram for gram, fat satiates our appetite more efficently
[3:00:42] nxusr: I still can't get over how ugly the base is, and how pretty the mine is

[3:01:07] Hunnda: "Americans" lmao
[3:01:09] qiakgue: fat, protein, carbs -> 9, 4, 4 calories per gram
[3:01:25] qiakgue: so wouldn't fat satiating just be due to 2.25x calories per gram?
[3:01:37] RaginGinger: bamBamWWW / How's it going waffle

[3:03:19] Apparentthreat: Nexhunter so cholesterol ?
[3:03:21] TakoKyo: @Tech theres a documentary on YT i believe that talks about how the US came to dislike fat, essentially it boils down to sugar companies giving fat a bad name

[3:29:07] Apparentthreat: hypixel has many many nodes
[3:29:09] Tech: Hypixel does clusters of vanilla servers
[3:29:11] Moobot: Support Waffle by using his Epic creator code: Giantwaffle
[3:29:16] Tech: So all of them are interconnected
[3:29:17] Driitzz: UNLESS you asign 4 cores per VM and you run realms on other core , each VM can handle 50 players
[3:29:17] lCLipZ: so a amd threadripper cant run minecraft fkkk
[3:29:20] barbsfury: hypixel uses smaller maps and subservers and no mods
[3:29:23] Secondrate_King: the server is an HP desktop burning behind him

[3:31:32] qiakgue: if the area loaded was as small as a few chunks in this hypothetical, why would more people wreck it?
[3:31:39] OMICRON: clearly every block should be on its own server
[3:31:53] daftMOOSE: Let them cry
[3:31:58] barbsfury: if you wane an easy slot log on 1-2h before stream goes live i bet plenty of space then no?
[3:32:00] sherbetsean: whilst it's technically possible, you'd need to basically rewrite the mods to be optimised for a large scale project
[3:32:02] Hunter1701: inkierHug @InkieRain
[3:32:08] InkieRain: Hey Hunter

[4:27:31] SeaOfMadness_: A slab above a cactus to the side will break it automatically when it grows
[4:27:38] ai3dunks: Put water under your cactus farm and have the water flow to a collector of some sort

[4:30:36] MechaDom: Anything works
[4:30:44] Dexterous_Alloy: @Giantwaffle Glass panes are ideal because their hitbox is smaller.
[4:30:51] MechaDom: Panes give the most pop room
[4:31:07] Foooks: down one
[4:31:10] aman36000: @Giantwaffle Why let the cactus get 3 high, just break at 2 high?
[4:31:11] Foooks: on the post
[4:31:16] Askjong: do down one
[4:31:23] nxusr: you can have it pop at 2
[4:31:24] CocoScruff: it can be on the second level
[4:31:31] Warkless: Fence one lower, will also lower the chance it can get to touch the cactus below
[4:31:39] The_Knight_Owl: what are these huge lava lakes in this pack?
[4:31:44] bigjonjj7: does the pack have snad? if so you can get hundreds of cactus almost instantly with a redstone clock
[4:31:51] FatRat_: @bigjonjj7 No

[4:41:40] Tech: Well this will likely get worse as more and more updating tile entities are created
[4:41:51] BurnedAether: Don't know how Subtember effects that though.
[4:42:37] bigjonjj7: @hot_rodster no twitch is testing reduced prices in some countries to see if lower cost increases sub count. like in turkey it costs $1.20 to sub

[4:43:12] trackerrrrr: yo chat
[4:43:48] bigjonjj7: @deathu currently twitch is shouldering the loss from reduced price test markets but eventually their goal is to reduce sub cost for everyone causing the streamer to earn less money per sub (same percentage cut) but get more subs
[4:44:18] McSauce: Use the Create hopper.. things then? Supposedly better for TPS too.
[4:45:04] Tech: MC Hoppers are pretty rough
[4:45:07] Tech: Especially when chained
[4:45:12] Tech: It's why most mods make their own hoppers

[4:50:58] SheepsAholy: make the rising part in the middle with a tube going up?
[4:50:59] enderslug: Just extend it a few blocks
[4:51:00] BrotherCerberus: add ice the block before the elevator and then put a sign on the same spot of the ice @Giantwaffle
[4:51:05] Awkward_DM: use an blue ice with an sign
[4:51:15] Warkless: You put a sign one block before the elevator and ice before so it will move with it's own momentum inside
[4:51:17] Rene_211ful: Ice and sign between stream and bubbler
[4:51:22] Foooks: just don't raise it.. use hopper and chest = DONE

[5:03:04] Mandorake: @Giantwaffle you also seem to be doing great for yourself and glad you have a good form of income that seems somewhat stable.  Big streamers have to really keep their numbers up.

[5:03:08] Kazbo2008: Kazbo2008 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 21 months! I hope MC friday is going well. love you waffle

[5:03:11] sirb0nd: tts is annoying
[5:03:12] Travess: Your a chill dude, love the energy you bring
[5:03:23] SupaStevo: What if Google opened up an API where you could turn your own voice into a TTS. Would you enable that?
[5:03:34] Garimore: This is one of the few chats on twitch I actually read
[5:03:41] Zrayy: I hate the chat on those bigger streamers. I don't even recall your chat being that bad when you had over like 10k viewers oftens

[5:04:18] SupaStevo: @Lazdrin true, he'd probably want to get a v-tuber's voice
[5:04:19] Jayouz: I like the way Cohh does it, they don't show by default unless the viewer asks for Cohh to see it
[5:04:20] gatoradefreak: @drsnaki96 exactly

[5:11:19] nxusr: @Tech same, I finally got to go back to the office recently and it's been amazing
[5:11:31] Nexhunter: that why you have your office and game room different rooms NODDERS
[5:11:35] ZhootSe: @Giantwaffle I'm the reverse - I can't be in an office because it will induce so much anxiety I can't work
[5:11:38] Str0ngPaprika: I had the option to work from home and I am working in my office. I need a reason to get dressed and take a shower. monkaS
[5:11:39] SkitsofRandom: anecdotal evidence but highly collaborative teams take a performance hit all being remote
[5:11:41] Phrebio: what i do requires being in person, most likely in a city, but if WFH makes housing in cities cheaper at all ill be hype
[5:11:43] FinnYellowbelly: OHH SHINY
[5:11:44] Tech: Separation of work and home life, better work life balance, I have my meals provided, I can ask someone directly instead of using text messaging
[5:11:46] sankhazo: Just rent a room on your neighbors house to use as office 4Head
[5:11:48] DatoPotatoDato: same KEKW
[5:11:49] helioph0b: yea exactly my problem and I dont have the room for a seperated office
[5:11:50] Speedkill3r: My room is my office… I can’t stand wfh in my room because I feel like I’m never leaving work.

[5:12:01] Traaxus: that me :D
[5:12:01] Kaomie: Where they can fart their butts off
[5:12:01] celadriel23: middle managers hate remote work
[5:12:05] kucher2: i have been distracted by a certain minecraft streamer KEKW
[5:12:05] GrombaBytes: i am from UK so dont have mixed tax laws, but the company i work for sold off 50% of its office space, looking to self off another 25% in year or two and everything is now remote desks
[5:12:08] celadriel23: because they dont actually do anything or contribute
[5:12:13] Tech: Slack Notifications and convo's eat up way more time for me than someone asking me directly.
[5:12:13] Narzzil: Same, my remote setup is in my kitchen and not where my gaming setup is.
[5:12:13] Xiocata: you should get tested for adhd giantwaffle
[5:12:14] pufosul112: look at minecraft chat
[5:12:15] belgianraiders: @deji0 depends.. all my employees have been working from home for 10+ years.. it's all how you set it up and manage projects
[5:12:17] Nerudeus: yeah work room and a fun room that how i do it :)
[5:12:18] SupaStevo: the ability to just go lay down for like 20 minutes has been my biggest boost to productivity on shitty days
[5:12:37] Tech: And most of the problems I have with an office is the office culture, which isn't hard to change if you just bring it up in a good environment
[5:12:39] Traaxus: if I only have to interact with co-workers through a group chat I can handle that. I hate the interruptions at the office when people come by my desk.
[5:12:46] Mandorake: @Giantwaffle my wife is way way more productive at home because the office is so distracting but they have a zero WFH policy and its insane.
[5:12:46] mr_clack: in switzerland big pharma copm.'s offer homeoffice for ever
[5:12:56] Tech: Like people walking up to you an issue? If I have headphones on, please don't talk to me.
[5:13:01] Armanicx: Level 30 Pog
[5:13:07] Mandorake: @Tech works in theory, not in practice
[5:13:09] Deji0: @belgianraiders I am all for it remote work. I just have employees that literally need to be watched. I have a lot of great ones but some ruin it.
[5:13:13] Bleu_Forge: Our office made a rule we couldn't have headphones on Tech KEKW
[5:13:14] Classikal: i'm starting a remote position in a couple of weeks, i'm excited because i've never got to work remote before. hope i dont get tired of it.
[5:13:16] Tech: @Tech I mean works for me
[5:13:21] Tech: And works for our office
[5:13:22] LVL97Magikarp: the goverment has been doing phases on bringing people back to work, but if your performance is good you can stay at home

[5:13:28] Chronoes: if it's planned
[5:13:34] LVL97Magikarp: in the office*
[5:13:36] Tech: If people are not respecting your boundaries and preferences, bring it up
[5:13:37] Esrah: We use Teams, so it's easy to just have a quick video chat
[5:13:37] Mandorake: @belgianraiders that sounds like a management issue
[5:13:38] SupaStevo: thats why you have MS Teams
[5:13:45] RpidFrTommyGun: Teams is great
[5:13:45] Bleu_Forge: yeah it was bad... needless to say I have no desire to return to the office Vangelis716
[5:13:46] Hot_Rodster: Text/Email can be misconstrued also in how it is worded compared to in an person convo
[5:13:50] Nexhunter: @Tech my problem for out here in Mass for office work is that the silicon frat culture is trying to be replicated by tech companies and oh man it just bad bad bad
[5:13:53] enderslug: That’s what video calls are for
[5:13:56] belgianraiders: @deji0 yeah, only have a few.. but can imagine

[5:14:10] SupaStevo: @Nexhunter Especially companies like HubSpot lol
[5:14:10] Batistutah: what you building?
[5:14:13] Tech: It's the same thing for even my meeting schedule. If you need time from me, work within my schedule.
[5:14:20] Vangelis716: Bleu_Forge where i work they bought me 250 euro headset with better noise canceling to use at the office
[5:14:22] Tomthegamer: That's generally how Google works.
[5:14:26] Deji0: @belgianraiders @Mandorake i wish it was that easy to fix. They just slack off when they are from home. in office- great employees
[5:14:27] Sevrene: Similarly: How many billions were lost for the same reason?
[5:14:35] Sanduckchan: u mean like facebook? :D
[5:14:37] SupaStevo: @Nexhunter I applied for a job there, but withdrew after I read about their culture

[5:15:02] SupaStevo: @Tomthegamer You don't think it already has?
