[0:20:51] bar10dr: Has to be priority settings not working as expected
[0:20:51] fapohogu: priorities?
[0:20:53] bobolpwnz: cause models were too low level and tehre were too much of em
[0:20:54] BigClown264: Perfect Plan COPIUM

[0:20:56] psycho917: follow the enderperls
[0:20:57] MrSilverMatch: Probably roundrobin
[0:20:57] lvyEartman: priorities dont work, ender perals get taking
[0:20:57] Bunjimus: i think your gonna have to build a separate system for polymer clay just for ender pearls that way its never empty

[0:21:56] TheIrishGuy: is soemthing blocking the pipes ?
[0:21:56] Face_32: clay is OP
[0:21:56] SeriousPotatoBot: pepeLaugh It was like when my granddad heard about the word "Woke"
[0:21:59] Soul12eaver: what material did you run out of in the system?
[0:21:59] fapohogu: check what's missing

[0:22:23] aundros: Go watch his glass production
[0:22:25] Zapper_777: i guess its full :D
[0:22:25] i556: Is the conduit on the drawer controller set to extract only?
[0:22:25] polarbear42069: ravageSwagnum ravageChun ravageThumbsup
[0:22:41] MrSilverMatch: The fact that you had clay ingots going to the low priority simulation shows that priority didn‚Äôt work
[0:22:48] Face_32: nice to see you guys are finally passiving early game mats
[0:22:48] Inviiti: So you just not going to close the door so I need to tho more lol
[0:22:57] The_Akabanana: Honestly if I was Pati I would have done the same thing, so you wouldn't get mad if it wasn't enough
[0:22:57] bar10dr: Restart time
[0:23:00] KekZwasTaken: then lets find out together :D
[0:23:03] TheIrishGuy: is there a backlog of items in the system ?
[0:23:05] maimvice13: diamond can help
[0:23:06] lukasalbert: @Giantwaffle spend coins on uraninite
[0:23:08] IlsaGold: Ok ez its a skill issue
[0:23:09] lukasalbert: its way cheaper
[0:23:09] Protonmat: u need a safe
[0:23:10] mozsozs: waffleOMG

[0:23:18] kypudo: u have extraterristial matter, buy the ender pearls throught there
[0:23:22] Aivarm: ecause you broke old system as well what would have made jumpstart stuff for you :P
[0:23:24] i556: Check drawer controller conduit
[0:23:24] IlsaGold: Get good
[0:23:26] daemonaedryn: uraninite makes straight pulsating dust
[0:23:27] matori666: Can't sub, FeelsBadMan
[0:23:29] c4l89: ender pearls priority on output from drawer. I watched replay and thought "sussy"
[0:23:32] mechoriet: COPIUM jumpstart it
[0:23:33] lukasalbert: you can turn it into the pulsing dust
[0:23:34] mozsozs: ResidentSleeper
[0:23:34] ThuhMonty: COPIUM it‚Äôll work guys
[0:23:38] lukasalbert: when double smelting @Giantwaffle
[0:23:43] noxiiiouse: old system still running for dust @Giantwaffle
[0:23:46] JVM91: Just wipe the save and start over pepeLaugh pepeLaugh
[0:23:49] lukasalbert: thats how i got my clay going
[0:23:50] Nooooe: you ran our of juice, the system that produce enderpearls couldnt keep up, and the priority didnt work, so it stopped generating ender
[0:23:51] Einar88: @Giantwaffle You get pulsating dust from uranium, can get the clay that way
[0:23:54] orillion: PauseChamp
[0:24:03] Koeckie: RIP was a good run GG
[0:24:09] lukasalbert: yeah that dust kickstarts everything
[0:24:20] OhItsChewie: COPIUM
[0:24:25] Dibbsu: All part of the plan
[0:24:26] J0hanAndersson: COPIUM

[0:24:29] „Åù„Çå„Åß: COPIUM
[0:24:29] Peppermint_Wizard: Use the dust to make the dust?
[0:24:43] Schutter07: smelt it
[0:24:46] lukasalbert: smelt it yeah
[0:24:53] Koeckie: you should really disconnect everything you don't need
[0:24:57] lukasalbert: its super cheap to jump start it
[0:25:17] Angel0death: Just started this pack. I hate you waffle :'(
[0:25:18] weightmaker: priority doesnt work with round robin
[0:25:23] Code4Coffee: What do those chambers do
[0:25:33] DX_Plates: I think I already have it
[0:25:38] aundros: Do we need to double the production here to cover the whole system?
[0:25:40] DX_Plates: Fairly sure
[0:25:44] „Åù„Çå„Åß: oh are they like woot?
[0:25:45] frainsbreeze: did the system break or was it good?
[0:25:58] Code4Coffee: ah yes of course
[0:25:59] lukasalbert: system stalled
[0:26:04] intimdatr: I have spent so much time working on Withcer 3, Noita is next on the chopping block
[0:26:20] kakiewakie_: do it
[0:26:21] GGoodGGuy: just use cheats :D
[0:26:25] lukasalbert: 1
[0:26:25] kakiewakie_: big wall of smelters
[0:26:26] mechoriet: @frainsbreeze Copege its good it worked well for a hour probbly then died
[0:26:27] Mfdtgamer: can you boost them any?
[0:26:27] tomey36: But you ran out of pearls
[0:26:27] sp4wn999: speed upgrrade FTW
[0:26:29] IAmJester: you didn't math this out before you started building?
[0:26:29] Smithii: Starting to sound like IGBLON :D
[0:26:33] Schutter07: maybe you can disconnect the storage bus to see if enderpearl route correctly
[0:26:35] TheIrishGuy: yah 1
[0:26:36] lukasalbert: it always uses 1
[0:26:37] forfiet: saysit failed
[0:26:38] gikei: Time to use math
[0:26:47] lvyEartman: science it to check if its enough
[0:26:48] Shantrix: 1 with 30%
[0:26:48] jayrickson87: you need to upgrade alloy smelters to EV
[0:26:59] omar_i_: waffleEE MathTime
[0:26:59] Face_32: its all maffs
[0:27:01] 0sem0: you did not math it to begin with?
[0:27:01] lukasalbert: more alloy smelters ?
[0:27:03] Vovosunt: could always put more smelters above?
[0:27:03] gartoks: @Giantwaffle 15.05 seconds per run
[0:27:05] TheIrishGuy: 15 seconds you timed it before
[0:27:07] noxiiiouse: you did already 15sec
[0:27:09] dcjrracing11: Is there a multi lock alloy smelter that‚Äôs faster?
[0:27:10] bobolpwnz: MathTime
[0:27:18] her0zer0: it's probably just since there were so many basic running at the same time with horrible drop chance
[0:27:20] Zapper_777: math the ratio.. is 199iq
[0:27:20] highlandermccloud: I think the priorities are the issue @giantwaffle
[0:27:27] IlsaGold: Have we got any of this stuff on the servers, as a debug?
[0:27:31] mcpsluke: mcpsluke subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months! 
[0:27:34] 0sem0: 162?
[0:27:35] lukasalbert: 24 in 15
[0:27:36] J0hanAndersson: monkaMath
[0:27:36] TheIrishGuy: 168?
[0:27:42] Protonmat: add notes for future waffle
[0:27:46] chaoskub: ~100
[0:27:46] Jsmart17: upgrade to ev machines maybe?
[0:27:51] Face_32: if you wrote down your work you couls just look at your notes no?
[0:27:58] Zapper_777: 143
[0:28:03] frainsbreeze: 144?
[0:28:12] J0hanAndersson: monkaMath monkaMath monkaMath
[0:28:12] bobolpwnz: 10 / s
[0:28:13] Zapper_777: 15sec
[0:28:16] chaoskub: 143/15
[0:28:17] lukasalbert: around 10 per sec  ?
[0:28:17] haguex: 143 every 15sec
[0:28:22] kakiewakie_: no?
[0:28:26] kakiewakie_: math?
[0:28:27] Daryl_Kay: Some people were saying round robin doesn't work with priorities, you could prioritize to a drawer and then round robin from there? @Giantwaffle
[0:28:31] lukasalbert: yeah around 10
[0:28:32] Koeckie: 600 per min
[0:28:32] gartoks: Need about 24 enderman models just for the polymer clay
[0:28:34] strickyR: YEP
[0:28:50] Zapper_777: so 9
[0:29:03] Traverus98: do you need more loot thingies making pearls
[0:29:05] trabadam: me thinks it stalled due to 6:1 ration is not valid until all of them are self-aware , so you run out of enderperls peepoHmm @Giantwaffle
[0:29:12] CoolReal: Was the system broken?
[0:29:17] frainsbreeze: maybe put in item filter in the sim chambers with 8 poly clay
[0:29:20] niborkees: technically once the system is full you will never need 9.5 a sec anymore
[0:29:26] Zapper_777: make a screen with a graph :D
[0:29:27] TheIrishGuy: make the drawer bigger
[0:29:32] sp4wn999: dont you have like 100k ender prestine in the ME ?
[0:29:38] MrSilverMatch: Still, it gave polymer clay to simulation chamber with lower priorities so nope RR doesn‚Äôt care about priority
[0:29:42] TigerLuv: add one line at a time, to see when you need more?
[0:29:50] aundros: Don't you just need a bigger buffer for the clay?
[0:29:53] Bulltank: it round robins the stack anyways
[0:30:03] kakiewakie_: calculate how much ur generating now
[0:30:08] Slymph: In case it hasn't been mentioned, KSP is free on epic today peepoPat
[0:30:09] lukasalbert: the alloy smelters should be filling
[0:30:09] TigerLuv: draw limit?
[0:30:09] deadgolfer: drawer is maxed
[0:30:10] Reimzu: upgrade drawer
[0:30:11] lvyEartman: make the buffer much bigger?
[0:30:18] Zapper_777: we need a enderpearl to clay ratio screen :D
[0:30:18] Moobot: You can find Waffle's Youtube channel here - https://youtube.com/giantwaffle
[0:30:19] frainsbreeze: maybe control the ender fluid too? you might waste it eventually
[0:30:20] highlandermccloud: @giantwaffle what if it's filling storage some where else in the base
[0:30:37] WhyYouPayMoney: Yeah, what if we disconnect the inventory from the rest of the base?
[0:30:41] kane1941: WAILA says 3
[0:30:59] kakiewakie_: seems fast
[0:31:00] bobolpwnz: every 3 sec
[0:31:01] frainsbreeze: you can see the time on the alloy smelter
[0:31:02] Koeckie: check it !
[0:31:02] Zapper_777: can you make a production ticker :D
[0:31:02] RefiixGaming: Waila is right it seems
[0:31:05] DemonsDawn: i dont think it was that fast
[0:31:09] her0zer0: 1.5s seems way faster than it's actually going
[0:31:09] Sulheim: ULV to LV doesn't half time
[0:31:10] Tasar_: is there a power issue?
[0:31:11] Bulltank: I dont think thats correct
[0:31:23] highlandermccloud: @giantwaffle what if it's filling storage some where else in the base
[0:31:25] deadgolfer: drawer is maxed out for clay
[0:31:30] mechoriet: KEKW
[0:31:34] Zapper_777: 8per is ok
[0:31:34] lukasalbert: huh
[0:31:35] Schutter07: there is no ulv one, the lv one only uses ulv power
[0:31:36] Smithii: What wires?
[0:31:36] KICKKJ: did you click the hv button?
[0:31:39] J0hanAndersson: D:
[0:31:43] Koeckie: too many?
[0:31:44] Orin_The_Sly: cONDUIT?
[0:31:45] daemonaedryn: Is it underclocked?
[0:31:48] kane1941: AMP?
[0:31:51] lukasalbert: do you have to click the hv ?
[0:32:00] Orin_The_Sly: eiard
[0:32:00] bobolpwnz: Can it overclock only up to level below?
[0:32:06] zissouthebear: zissouthebear subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 10 months! 
[0:32:07] lukasalbert: yeah weird
[0:32:23] daemonaedryn: huh
[0:32:25] daemonaedryn: weird
[0:32:30] KritterIsBack: what if you put it to MV?
[0:32:31] lukasalbert: maybe wwrite a bug report ?
[0:32:32] J0hanAndersson: lirikHMM
[0:32:34] daemonaedryn: not enough power through the converter?
[0:32:34] kakiewakie_: maxed out maybe?
[0:32:35] Koeckie: not enough? too many
[0:32:36] aundros: Maybe its max for that tier of machine?
[0:32:40] Zapper_777: ok 12sec, how many do you have?
[0:32:40] notRoro: it might be rounding up
[0:32:42] frainsbreeze: get another energy converter?
[0:32:44] Fnack: second energy converter maybe?
[0:32:45] kane1941: Cut the power line in half
[0:32:46] drsnaki96: what does whaila say when the machine is set to MV then?
[0:32:51] maimvice13: max vor ther recepie
[0:32:51] Koeckie: connect a second one
[0:33:09] CoolReal: HUH
[0:33:14] lukasalbert: you could also try adding more power
[0:33:14] goldenknight22: maybe tooltip is bugged?
[0:33:15] flamingblaster: is it amperage
[0:33:15] frainsbreeze: HUH
[0:33:15] Bunjimus: wonder if you need another hv power thing
[0:33:16] Bulltank: Its 1 tier down
[0:33:16] mechoriet: maybe waila scuff with 0-3 and 1-3 kinda shit
[0:33:19] Zapper_777: ok.. now its at 3 sec
[0:33:20] Tasar_: @frainsbreeze nice
[0:33:20] Smithii: Use the gregtech depug tool?
[0:33:22] lukasalbert: even if it wont make a differece
[0:33:24] ThuhMonty: Maybe too much power being used at one time?
[0:33:25] Zapper_777: it was 12
[0:33:26] maimvice13: make a second energy converter at the line
[0:33:27] Swocoom: time to tier up?
[0:33:28] Traverus98: Maybe the recipe requires LV so power goes down a tier as a result
[0:33:31] RefiixGaming: No it is really 3 secs and should be 1.5
[0:33:31] Shank_nasty: Higher amps?
[0:33:32] lukasalbert: @Giantwaffle time it ?
[0:33:33] Traverus98: try a ULV recipe
[0:33:35] Hugzie89: logicallyit has to be a supply issue
[0:33:35] Winstonrocks: The recipe is ULV which isnt possible LV is the lowest
[0:33:54] daemonaedryn: No because a lot of recipes are ULV
[0:34:04] Matini97: maybe u can only overclock to one tier lower
[0:34:06] Winstonrocks: if the recipe is tiered down yes
[0:34:06] lilgangstagoth1: if there wasnt enough power in the line the machines just would get enough power not run a tier lower
[0:34:07] Traverus98: Oh I guess this is a ULV recipe
[0:34:09] BirchTheTree: @Winstonrocks thats false. ULV is just the power requirements
[0:34:13] Zapper_777: its not getting pulled out fast enuf? its stuffed at a stack?
[0:34:15] mahoriiii77: build more can fix
[0:34:20] ns0z: @Giantwaffle Do you have access to Naquadah yet?
[0:34:28] Winstonrocks: @BirchTheTree yes but the lowest machine tier is LV
[0:34:28] 0sem0: maybe it can not provide the amperage?
[0:34:30] Nickonil: is there a speed upgrade or power upgrade you can put in it?
[0:34:35] maimvice13: not enough AMP
[0:34:36] SwedishKaito: power loss due to wires?
[0:34:36] mechoriet: wafflePog 3rd row
[0:34:42] daemonaedryn: I can log in and check on the KKona server if you want
[0:34:42] RefiixGaming: 1.3 a sec
[0:34:42] Hugzie89: connect a single one to a converter and test
[0:34:47] pufflefump: Is the power transmission constrained by the EnderIO cables?
[0:34:52] mechoriet: maybe try a extra power converter just to check
[0:34:53] kane1941: anyways 20 every 3 = 7 every 1
[0:34:53] kakiewakie_: KEKW
[0:34:58] lukasalbert: per alloy yeah
[0:34:58] Zapper_777: its to slow to pull from the machine?
[0:35:05] TheIrishGuy: which is enough
[0:35:07] kakiewakie_: hmmmm
[0:35:08] RefiixGaming: So we are good
[0:35:11] BirchTheTree: @Winstonrocks lowest electrical machine yes. ULV is techincally steam age which was removed in this pack
[0:35:11] lilgangstagoth1: dont think its power the machines have full buffers
[0:35:12] lukasalbert: it should be way more than enough
[0:35:12] RefiixGaming: We need only 9
[0:35:32] frainsbreeze: item filter it my dude
[0:35:33] Shantrix: they not all at 30% data yet ?
[0:35:33] daemonaedryn: whats missing currently?
[0:35:36] 0sem0: not all machines a running though?
[0:35:38] DecertoJonesy: maybe not getting enough enderpearls?
[0:35:38] Purecrew: But are you making enough resonant ender as well
[0:35:41] Daanaas: is it chunk load
[0:35:44] weightmaker: just tested it on patreon server and round robin completely ignores priority
[0:35:45] Traverus98: Do you need more loot generators making pearls
[0:35:47] Koristbuh: If those are building a buffer you are making enough, no?
[0:35:48] banutzul: maybe you are not making enough pearls
[0:35:50] lukasalbert: where are you smelting the clathrates ?
[0:35:50] mechoriet: @Daanaas YEP
[0:35:51] highlandermccloud: I think your priority system is messed up @giantwaffle  or it's storing stuff some where else in the base
[0:35:52] lvyEartman: science it
[0:35:52] maimvice13: can you put more amp on the wire with a extra energy convert 16a
[0:35:55] kane1941: not enough pearls
[0:35:55] That0neGeye: It‚Äôs not pulling out of the machines fast enough
[0:35:56] razborsek: Maybe not enough enderman sim chambers?
[0:35:56] her0zer0: nothing is backing up so it's just not enough overall throughout. I think it's because of all the training
[0:35:56] flamingblaster: are you making enough clay?
[0:35:58] frainsbreeze: also drawer upgrades
[0:36:00] Daryl_Kay: You may have not been making enough ender pearls because the level was lower
[0:36:00] matori666: pulsating ender is the bottleneck i think
[0:36:01] sneakyHoovy: no pearls?
[0:36:04] Smithii: Re-place it?
[0:36:04] mechoriet: bug or cable overload?
[0:36:04] daemonaedryn: Break the machine and place it back?
[0:36:09] frainsbreeze: maybe get another energy converter?
[0:36:17] DynamixBoon: Could it be the non-selfware endermen are not creating enough pristine?
[0:36:18] Winstonrocks: @BirchTheTree Yes true but all the recipes work like this so im not sure why but if it uses ULV it down tiers one voltage\
[0:36:18] Hugzie89: @Giantwaffle connect a single one to a converter and test
[0:36:31] Allmostdone: Why would one be correct? And the others not?
[0:36:33] nesse007: try to split the  power? and see
[0:36:37] SmokyMtnRed: Nerdge
[0:36:37] Daanaas: is it chunk load
[0:36:44] Zapper_777: but there is stack in the machines... the buffe dont work?
[0:36:46] deadgolfer: just disconnect all the sim chambers expect for the enderman chambers and see if it fills
[0:36:49] kane1941: How come it didnt simulate to Self-Aware over night?
[0:36:51] Daanaas: ok
[0:36:51] Purecrew: I think its not enough resonant ender
[0:36:52] TheRackster: So for this modpack what is the best power gen starting early? Cus power gen is the thing that infuriates me the most in modpacks
[0:36:58] AleXanDreMau: @Giantwaffle can you upgrade the % of sucess ?
[0:37:04] sp4wn999: so how much ender prestine do we have
[0:37:12] SmokyMtnRed: @TheRackster Sugarcane
[0:37:24] sorefingers: i just started Nomi and i cant click the first task, it just switches back to red. did anyone have a similar Problem with the better questing Mod?
[0:37:27] Slymph: *villager noises intensifies* waffleSTARE MathTime
[0:37:29] DecertoJonesy: how many enderpearls to make the polymer clay and how much polimer clay is being used to make the enderpearls
[0:37:36] TheRackster: @TheRackster Used how? Ive heard waffle mention it but tried looking through and couldnt find in what to use it
[0:37:36] banutzul: ender pearls are not fast enough
[0:37:38] Frikinaus: This used to be a kids game didn't it? Dafuq is this chinesium factory of glorious dimension?
[0:37:39] Daryl_Kay: Yeah dont think you were making enough ender pearls
[0:37:41] Aivarm: stop exporting to ME those pearls atm
[0:37:47] RefiixGaming: The problem is machines are producing till they are full
[0:37:48] lvyEartman: so you are not making enough pearls?
[0:37:55] daemonaedryn: Maybe the 6 to 1 ratio was incorrect?
[0:38:00] Koristbuh: doesn't the multi smelter have a 32stack buffer it needs to build up too?
[0:38:05] flamingblaster: hey @Giantwaffle if the priority is correct and working, the priority 0 simulators should have way less iterations
[0:38:10] niborkees: the 5% in the begin phase was too low
[0:38:17] Nickonil: is the machine connected to some sort of storage tanks?
[0:38:21] highlandermccloud: @giantwaffle what if it's filling storage some where else in the base
[0:38:21] Moobot: Come join the Waffle House Discord! <# https://discord.gg/fhGFtMuzdS
[0:38:32] Goldern: Doesn‚Äôt round robin ignore priority?
[0:38:40] woodlaphroaig: how much ender essens do you have?
[0:38:45] MastaaDopee: !mc_pack
[0:38:45] Moobot: The December modpack, Nomifactory (GTCEu Port) is in full swing !!! | https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/nomi-ceu | The bois were unable to complete the pack in 2022. Will they be able to beat it by NYE 2023? Tune in to every stream to find out! pepeLaugh
[0:38:45] lilgangstagoth1: it dose ignore it
[0:38:45] matori666: @koristbuh I don't think it needs a 32 buffer, it just does up to 32 per operation
[0:38:47] aundros: try just making more enderpearls?
[0:38:49] Noblez_: We seem on track to finish the pack by the end of the year
[0:38:54] tomey36: Too many machines using the resonant ender?
[0:38:58] 0sem0: this is so frustrating LUL
[0:38:59] lilgangstagoth1: u cant round robin with priority
[0:38:59] gikei: test the priority on small isolated system where its simpler to see
[0:39:03] ign0rantlizard: The ender pearls upstairs breaking it at all due to priorttiy ?
[0:39:04] Koristbuh: @matori666 ok that makes sense

[0:39:08] Bunjimus: you may wanna just take the one blade and dedicate to only the enderman
[0:39:15] deadgolfer: do the math to see if it is positive feedback loop
[0:39:19] mechoriet: YEP all pati's fault
[0:39:21] IlsaGold: Is the limit for the liquid to large?
[0:39:22] usernameNull: just remove it from the second storage just in case until it is built up
[0:39:22] CoolReal: D:
[0:39:24] Amokaci72: @Giantwaffle does it make more sense to build a seltery with some "named" endermen maybe u can get faster liquid ender ?
[0:39:27] Nickonil: maybe your getting xcom'ed on the 20% chance?
[0:39:28] TheSpect4tor: Can‚Äôt you add more loot fabricators to make more ender pearls?
[0:39:41] Meanmur: maybe the resonate ender is backing up ?
[0:39:48] hipolover123: Hmmmm. wasn't this meant to be done before the new year?
[0:39:50] gartoks: D:
[0:39:52] TigerLuv: ok I am new, ender peal box on the right, is there just one in there cause waffle put 1 in there
[0:40:24] berlbuster: @hipolover123 didnt specify which year tho
[0:40:25] sp4wn999: TrollDespair always night on this server
[0:40:27] Noblez_: @hipolover123 We still have 358 days
[0:40:30] weightmaker: round robin completely ignores priority. just tested it to confirm

[0:41:14] masturi66: @Giantwaffle hey quick question how did you make it so your world doesn't spawn mobs
[0:41:16] IlsaGold: How much liquid do we need?
[0:41:20] TheIrishGuy: do the pipes have a inventory
[0:41:29] CoolReal: Maybe it is exact balance right now
[0:41:44] deadgolfer: get rid of the tanks, just not needed
[0:41:45] 0sem0: how much ender are you holding?
[0:41:51] TigerLuv: you showed an interface the other day, that showed were things were failing??
[0:41:53] frainsbreeze: guess its just he ender pearl chance
[0:41:57] corbin112: corbin112 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 7 months! 
[0:41:58] LsTheRoberto: Give it some help to backup. Manually craft some stuff
[0:42:10] Harsenik: hi! And how what about the rubber wood farm ? how is it going ?
[0:42:12] FowD8: how are you filling without double filling a slot? when i tried conduit with cover, it still double filled when i'm missing an item @Giantwaffle
[0:42:13] matori666: it is backing up, but slowly
[0:42:13] Shoobinist: want to put down more enderman sims?
[0:42:16] Nickonil: what about just making the system bigger?
[0:42:17] Warkless: it's basically 50/50 Okayge
[0:42:18] usernameNull: the clay stuff is staying capped, it is fine
[0:42:25] Shank_nasty: Drop the limit on the alloy smelters to one recipe? You may not be running the system in multi core with respect to the alloy smelters.
[0:42:32] mechoriet: wafflePog sidequest
[0:42:35] DrYProtoss: just see a doctor
[0:42:42] DrYProtoss: if you have wood problems
[0:42:43] Face_32: yeah wood problems start to pop up when you get older
[0:42:43] frainsbreeze: a good time to use all that bone!
[0:42:44] Shoobinist: you have bones now
[0:42:49] rglecker: heyo
[0:42:49] mechoriet: susHmm didn't we have like a shitload of rubber wood?
[0:42:51] 0sem0: with a broken axe?
[0:42:54] Face_32: no spruce sapplings?
[0:42:59] F6MaxDamage: there are some medications for you wood problems KEKW
[0:42:59] Winstonrocks: one tree with that axe
[0:43:01] GuardMoony: Just fix wood and look in a hour if it backed up more
[0:43:02] IlsaGold: All the machines create a big buffer
[0:43:03] frainsbreeze: automation on day 19!
[0:43:06] daemonaedryn: LUL
[0:43:08] Damos1212: day 19 ding ding ding
[0:43:13] FowD8: how are you filling without double filling a slot? when i tried conduit with cover, it still double filled when i'm missing an item
[0:43:23] Orin_The_Sly: Dec.38th KEKW
[0:43:25] BBQ1: sanity üìâ Day 19!
[0:43:26] RefiixGaming: @FowD8 Filter
[0:43:28] Face_32: no passive wood?
[0:43:33] snurre: almost done
[0:43:36] Saishu_: good afternoon, how did your base go?
[0:43:38] BMYGRLFRND: Day 19 of 11 Pog
[0:43:38] FowD8: @RefiixGaming i tried that, and it still double filled
[0:43:40] IlsaGold: Shpould we lower the buffer limit?
[0:43:41] thexvar1able: atleast replant some
[0:43:44] Smithii: @FowD8 Limited Item Filter
[0:43:49] RefiixGaming: @FowD8 Advanced filter with limited item
[0:44:04] W84M3: howdy!
[0:44:06] LsTheRoberto: Give it some help to backup. Manually craft some stuff Û†ÄÄ
[0:44:06] FowD8: i tried filter... but it seems to ONLY work with ME interface for some reason, conduit and exporter double fills it even with filter?
[0:44:15] Face_32: its good you are starting passiveness on day 19 LMAO
[0:44:26] RefiixGaming: @FowD8 It works on waffles pack
[0:44:30] leeroy_47: Hey waffle.. when you cooked your new pc build couple of months ago.. what got fried in the end ? i missed the conclusion :D
[0:44:31] FowD8: hasHmm
[0:44:35] baconburgerfries: bingPog
[0:44:39] frainsbreeze: this drawer is gonna be forever forgotten!
[0:44:44] lukasalbert: "break glass in case of stall"
[0:44:52] her0zer0: could use the empty slot in that drawer controller since it won't auto extract it
[0:45:00] banutzul: barely backing up while only using 1 row of machines and you need 5 or 6 rows to work?
[0:45:06] TigerLuv: SOCK - save our clay Kit
[0:45:22] The_Holas: imagine you needed to break it in like 5 min Kappa
[0:45:36] Face_32: do you have silk touch yet?
[0:45:43] 0sem0: KEKW
[0:45:46] mechoriet: KEKW
[0:45:48] InternetPlumber: future fuck-up
[0:45:55] mechoriet: COPIUM "just in case"
[0:45:56] snurre: encased just in case
[0:46:14] Amokaci72: hey waffle did u read my idea ?
[0:46:18] mechoriet: COPIUM
[0:46:23] GuardMoony: Time to fix wood
[0:46:23] Moobot: You can sub to Waffle by clicking this neat link -> twitch.tv/giantwaffle/subscribe SUBprise
[0:46:40] Face_32: i thought self aware was a maching tier
[0:46:41] frainsbreeze: time for drawer upgrades!
[0:46:42] Purple_haze12: did it not run all last night?
[0:46:43] sp4wn999: yeh upgrade the clay drawer
[0:46:47] mechoriet: maybe hold 4096 instead of the 2048
[0:46:48] banutzul: build a oak farm in the meanwhile?
[0:46:50] lilgangstagoth1: ive built up a buffer of 100k PPC
[0:46:51] deadgolfer: diamond upgrade much bigger
[0:46:57] GuardMoony: allow the empty chest to be more ingots
[0:46:59] tomey36: Ya def upgrade clay
[0:47:03] aundros: maybe allow for a bigger stack of poly clay? maybe 32 stacks is too low
[0:47:03] meller127: How does the DML super simulation computer works?
[0:47:04] LsTheRoberto: You should store at least 143 stacks so each machine can be fed
[0:47:05] xaviermanifest: i think the speed upgrades are breaking your round robin idea
[0:47:09] IlsaGold: Cant we calc the start up need for clay?
[0:47:09] mechoriet: COPIUM its stall proof
[0:47:11] Joshuapetch: stall proof YEP
[0:47:13] x1xamen: "proof"
[0:47:18] frainsbreeze: i think you ran out of ender pearls
[0:47:20] Kandarjr: Stall proof at 30%
[0:47:26] jayrickson87: upgrade alloy smelters to ev
[0:47:30] CoolAcid: Wiki says it shouldn't break priorities.
[0:47:33] Vovosunt: 1 extract will not be enough
[0:47:38] DecertoJonesy: set the self aware ones a higher priority
[0:47:45] Aivarm: put upgrades to clay chest to jump start everything when you connect and remove after that
[0:47:48] Aeliel_: round robin ignores priority iirc
[0:47:56] Shoobinist: limit is unnecessary if you are making enough
[0:48:01] deadgolfer: don't do the filter, once it backs up it will be fine
[0:48:06] sneakyHoovy: test it
[0:48:08] CoolAcid: EnderIO Wiki says it should not ignore priority
[0:48:15] Xxxneogeoxxx: Limit all but priority 2
[0:48:21] lilgangstagoth1: it dose tho
[0:48:26] IlsaGold: Limit the low prio only?
[0:48:26] KnightofObv: So a few drawer upgrades to start a buffer for when you plug in the others
[0:48:32] Bulltank: its a feature chat, not a bug Kappa
[0:48:36] dcjrracing11: Limit the others instead of the Ender and diamond ones.
[0:48:36] Face_32: this modpack could mess iwth round robin working or not
[0:48:41] kbigLiar: does distance affect priorities? so is 2 even enough for the end of the enderman line vs the start of the diamond line?
[0:48:42] leeroy_47: side-quest time
[0:48:49] LsTheRoberto: You should store at least 143 stacks of the clay so each machine can be fed
[0:48:50] InternetPlumber: just game it out
[0:49:01] matori666: that's a good idea, limit all except the enderman ones @giantwaffle
[0:49:04] Winstonrocks: if the item conduit cant pull enough out to do it without round robin make another draw and have two outputs into the sim chambers
[0:49:09] Vovosunt: need multiple with same prio too
[0:49:13] GuardMoony: Seems there are bug reports about this on github
[0:49:13] brattyssiss: Wafffffleeeeee
[0:49:30] mechoriet: KEKW
[0:49:33] CoolReal: Sadge
[0:49:34] lukasalbert: yeah oof
[0:49:35] 0sem0: nice
[0:49:36] Dagmoo: LUL
[0:49:36] xaviermanifest: now try with speed upgrade
[0:49:37] mechoriet: KEKW Works as intended
[0:49:38] LsTheRoberto: KEKW
[0:49:39] CoolReal: No one is fixing that
[0:49:42] Naappletree: nice lol
[0:49:46] Face_32: or intentional in this modpack
[0:49:46] ThuhMonty: Yep round robin was indeed the issue
[0:49:48] frainsbreeze: SCIENCE BITCH!
[0:49:51] LsTheRoberto: well at least now you know
[0:49:54] xaviermanifest: oh damn u right
[0:49:58] LsTheRoberto: you had a few things set to round robin
[0:49:58] niborkees: figured it out
[0:50:00] Naappletree: good intuition
[0:50:04] Daryl_Kay: Yeah priority to a drawer adn then round robin on the row
[0:50:05] Vovosunt: @Giantwaffle will one extract be enough for the whole system?
[0:50:05] DX_Plates: RR probably uses prio to do RR
[0:50:05] 0sem0: debugged!
[0:50:08] deadgolfer: time to turn off all the round robins there
[0:50:17] xAndreasDam: Does it do round robin on the "inserts" on the same priority level?
[0:50:20] Traverus98: now that you know you should be able to plug everything back in
[0:50:20] Bulltank: Once the system is full its full. Round Robin wont matter
[0:50:20] IlsaGold: I guess the issue has been found
[0:50:20] Bernd135: Try more outputs with the same priority
[0:50:22] flamingblaster: you could build buffers
[0:50:24] arkun_: *shakes fist at past Waffle*
[0:50:25] GuardMoony: Then we will need to fix item creation also
[0:50:26] Vovosunt: @Giantwaffle make mini-buffers for each line and round robin out?
[0:50:31] lukasalbert: i think someone in chat even said that yesterday
[0:50:31] flamingblaster: and then round robin from there
[0:50:31] Traverus98: probably want to turn off round robin on pristine extract to
[0:50:36] kaasrondje: Surely
[0:50:37] BilusTheTiny: So you need two system/network if you want to use priority / round robin
[0:50:39] 0sem0: should COPIUM
[0:50:40] ThuhMonty: Should COPIUM
[0:50:41] mechoriet: buffers == delaying issues like in factorio
[0:50:46] CubicJazz: if your production is more than your usage, round robin isnt really needed anyways
[0:50:49] Naappletree: yep Copium
[0:51:06] zero3juan: "shurely"
[0:51:17] kennycraig: HeyGuys
[0:51:22] GuardMoony: And that's why the ghast didn't work
[0:51:27] 0sem0: Shirley Kapap
[0:51:30] Shoobinist: quantity key pristine matter
[0:51:32] deadgolfer: check for the ender pearls on round robin
[0:51:37] LsTheRoberto: its not even worth the time to try and use it
[0:51:37] frainsbreeze: round robin should be switched on for the pristine matter
[0:51:40] Aivarm: on pristine you want RR enabled as you have different ones
[0:52:04] deadgolfer: bottom of ender loot fabricators
[0:52:10] GuardMoony: but pristine also got prio for ender pearl and diamonds
[0:52:11] usernameNull: round Robin doesn't work if it goes out faster than you generate it
[0:52:11] niborkees: no because the ender pearl priority is higher
[0:52:12] IlsaGold: Do we have things stored to start it?
[0:52:19] InternetPlumber: it won't matter as it will just back up the closer machines first
[0:52:20] podwe: Did u watch RRR in full yet? waffleLUL
[0:52:23] CoolAcid: Wow, Wiki says one thing, EnderIO github issue 1130 says it does what you just scienced. Documentation sux :(
[0:52:27] Vovosunt: there's no way 1 extractor conduit will be able to handle so many target inventories
[0:52:27] InternetPlumber: eventually they will all back up
[0:52:33] DecertoJonesy: make 2 extracts?
[0:52:33] LsTheRoberto: things will back up eventually in the machine, dont need round robin
[0:52:34] matori666: just item limit it to 4
[0:52:34] Slowkill333: put a buffer chest to priority into and then round robin out of the buffer for the sub sections.
[0:52:35] The_Holas: @Giantwaffle Did you watched RRR? PauseChamp
[0:52:37] Aivarm: another closed loop for only ender pearls then
[0:52:37] Bernd135: Ideally you need to extract each pristine indivuallity from their drawer with round roubin enable
[0:52:40] GuardMoony: we could seperate the output of the ender/diamond and the other ones
[0:52:42] chipsdrengen: Nothing else matters
[0:52:45] Bunjimus: wonder if thats why your enderpearls were running out
[0:52:52] deadgolfer: bottom of ender pearls loot fabs?
[0:52:53] her0zer0: I guess that could have brown it too. if you use ender matter for other things
[0:52:54] Aivarm: or add chest for ender pearl generation
[0:52:59] TheIrishGuy: are you DML crafting enderpears fast enough ? @Giantwaffle
[0:53:00] BitterPL: yea round robin will make it break if out of clay in places where priority is important
[0:53:05] Aivarm: for buffer
[0:53:05] her0zer0: broken*
[0:53:13] ThuhMonty: Damn so it is a documented issue but only on GitHub m, not wiki
[0:53:15] FowD8: use gregtech pipes and it'll fill faster than EnderIO conduits (i think?) @Giantwaffle
[0:53:16] TheIrishGuy: not that one the other side
[0:53:20] Traverus98: how many diamonds did you burn since you weren't making any overnight haha
[0:53:23] Face_32: just turn on mobs spawning and go to the end and make a vanilla ender farm
[0:53:33] ns0z: Could downgrade drawers for stuff you dont need 1000s of and make it like 2-4 stacks
[0:53:33] Shoobinist: you were also making enderman heads cause of round robin
[0:53:34] KnightofObv: you need around 10.5k polymer clay stored to fill up all of those DML's
[0:53:45] gartoks: 5 more, right? 1 Enderman + 5 additional
[0:53:56] MrSilverMatch: Time to reconnect everything
[0:53:56] deadgolfer: round robin out of your ender pearl loot fabs could be messing with your priority system and dumping them into your ME instead
[0:54:00] GuardMoony: Could add more ender dml's :D
[0:54:08] snurre: "we"
[0:54:13] TheIrishGuy: @Giantwaffle is your crafting of the pears fast enough your making the Enderman matter but how fast are the pearls being made
[0:54:15] DarkKnghtt58: if you want an emergency stack of enderpearls, probably want to swap out the super tanks, no?
[0:54:24] tomey36: Upgrade ingot chests no way 2k is enough with automation
[0:54:25] Moobot: You can find Waffle's Youtube channel here - https://youtube.com/giantwaffle
[0:54:27] LsTheRoberto: You should store at least 143 stacks of the clay so each machine can be fed
[0:54:29] Intohimos: if everything is priority 2 shouldn't round robin work now?
[0:54:35] Traverus98: you should be able to plug it back in now since priority is set
[0:54:35] xaviermanifest: no do ittttt
[0:54:35] Xxxneogeoxxx: Were the enderman head the issue? 1/3 the pristine matter was going to heads
[0:54:36] Blazedude99: doesn't it take a ton of simulation chambers to back up a loot fabricator? wouldnt that causse a problem with 1 thermal sim and 3 thermal loots
[0:54:53] xaviermanifest: do that and the dust!
[0:55:21] deadgolfer: round robin out of your ender pearl loot fabs could be messing with your priority system and dumping them into your ME instead
[0:55:32] Flobu_: put emergeny clay in the drawer next to it?
[0:55:39] deadgolfer: okay
[0:55:43] matori666: and it will only get better as it levels up

[0:56:09] TasteMaShu: waffleHey
[0:56:11] noturkeyjeremy: why not just use AE for the stuff needed for DLM and eIO for the rest?
[0:56:12] frainsbreeze: connect the sim chambers?
[0:56:13] DarkKnghtt58: swap out tanks?
[0:56:14] KingPuller: make a buffer before the lines and round Robin from there?
[0:56:46] Vovosunt: those tanks cause light updates

[0:57:32] aundros: will it lag with only 2?

[1:04:50] x1xamen: YEP sounds right
[1:04:56] IamCapZz: why is the minecraft music so loud?
[1:04:56] lukasalbert: limit to like 8
[1:04:57] mechoriet: maybe a chest and limit to one stack max
[1:04:58] Vovosunt: @Giantwaffle extract separately on different channel?
[1:05:00] Shoobinist: you can filter the loot chambers
[1:05:07] DarkKnghtt58: it's mainly just enderpearls though
[1:05:09] cheppard: just let it fill up
[1:05:11] Apparentthreat: @lstheroberto something must‚Äôve been slowly corrupting on my side. My windows 11 install has also been buggy since upgrading from windows 10.
[1:05:14] maimvice13: chest it
[1:05:15] lukasalbert: just do it for enderpearls
[1:05:16] Shoobinist: let it fill
[1:05:16] ThuhMonty: Create your own manual round robin is what you‚Äôre saying?
[1:05:17] kaasrondje: It will level uit at 64
[1:05:22] FinnYellowbelly: matxFine
[1:05:28] zero3juan: just do it
[1:05:29] kitofmaadnes: you can mass configire in hand
[1:05:31] mechoriet: yeah just give it time and checkup on it every hour orso and see if still healthy
[1:05:35] KICKKJ: maybe just the ender pearls?
[1:05:37] Purecrew: I dont think it will
[1:05:45] TheIrishGuy: but youll run out if pearls are not fast enough
[1:05:47] LsTheRoberto: @Apparentthreat I heard that its better to go off a fresh OS install for w11 and not to carry all the shit from w10 over. But im too lazy for that
[1:05:53] GuardMoony: Wasnt it 19 dml for 1 loot then we should need 3 for 30
[1:06:10] Apparentthreat: @lstheroberto Yeah; I was also too lazy. It‚Äôs nice to do a fresh install every now and then (every few years)
[1:06:13] psycho917: i think you can roud robin
[1:06:14] Joshuapetch: pepeLaugh
[1:06:15] lukasalbert: ????
[1:06:19] Purecrew: WHAT?
[1:06:26] Nooooe: so can't you just produce more ender pearls?
[1:06:28] lukasalbert: i felt that
[1:06:32] Kandarjr: Just do it for enderpearls, now youre making half of it that you can
[1:06:32] Dibbsu: quik maffs EZ
[1:06:37] LsTheRoberto: Hey its still too early for math
[1:06:38] brattyssiss: what drink is that'
[1:06:41] Fufcia: 6AM VRChat math
[1:06:46] usernameNull: won't need the second until all are ar 30%
[1:06:50] Dagmoo: waffleSTARE MathTime
[1:06:52] kitofmaadnes: @giantwaffle. you can mass fonfigur filters in hand
[1:07:13] Aivarm: well for now atleats youre generating 1 enderpeal with machine.. if you RR that with chest youll have 2 machines running for jumpstart etc
[1:07:32] Purecrew: Based on your calculations you need both of those to be making enderpearls or the system will fail again
[1:07:35] psycho917: you only need to do it times
[1:07:47] kakiewakie_: still fixing this?
[1:07:48] Vovosunt: round robin on a separate channel
[1:07:50] ign0rantlizard: Can we fix the floor when we waiiting?
[1:07:53] DarkKnghtt58: but you need both running for your system to work
[1:07:56] jberk26: Aren‚Äôt the enderpearls the only system that needs the upgraded filter?
[1:08:03] flamingblaster: i wold just pu a chest or a drawer above the row and then round robin from there
[1:08:06] mechoriet: well a cache with only one stack allowed of the ender pearl matter thing and rr from that cache
[1:08:08] matori666: you can prioritize to the chest and then RR
[1:08:10] Kunja: you could just priotise into a chest above the enter pearls and then just do that row round robin into those machines
[1:08:10] tomey36: Just limit filter the ender simulator
[1:08:15] suitedtiger123: cant you round robin the inserts for the enderpearl?
[1:08:22] mechoriet: YEP we should
[1:08:33] Nickonil: do it
[1:08:40] LsTheRoberto: Shouldnt need to, just kick the tires
[1:08:50] frainsbreeze: Unleash the KRANKEN!
[1:08:50] mechoriet: it increases ender pearl gen by a lot
[1:08:55] Purecrew: You really do need both endermans to be generating pearls or the system will fail again
[1:09:08] DarkKnghtt58: you need both enderman LF running to make enough pearls
[1:09:21] lukasalbert: yeah
[1:09:24] DarkKnghtt58: yes, you do
[1:09:26] lukasalbert: you dont make them fast enough now
[1:09:27] Shantrix: it wont fail will just be slow
[1:09:27] LsTheRoberto: Just filter the 2 enderman
[1:09:30] Winstonrocks: use a limit filter?
[1:09:31] LsTheRoberto: for pearls
[1:09:32] lukasalbert: limit them to 4 or 8 ?
[1:09:32] mechoriet: KEKW rework time
[1:09:33] F6MaxDamage: your ender dust = 0 again
[1:09:34] Amraki: "should not". remind us what you said about theory and practice?
[1:09:37] x1xamen: cache time
[1:09:50] frainsbreeze: maybe extract the matter on a different channel for enderpearls?
[1:09:51] mechoriet: pepeLaugh avoid the rework time
[1:10:02] usernameNull: it will start using the second as soon as the first can't keep up, you are half way to it solving itself
[1:10:16] maimvice13: and mak mor ov theme
[1:10:26] GuardMoony: If it's too small won't it use it for the normal items then ?

[1:11:06] x1xamen: nope

[1:11:40] KnightofObv: limit the enderman head one aswell?
[1:11:43] mechoriet: second flaw
[1:11:47] TigerLuv: 816, did it drop to 814?
[1:11:48] frainsbreeze: you need bigger stacks in the item filter
[1:12:05] RationalLies: COPIUM

[1:15:15] banutzul: people kept telling you round robin isnt working with prio but you dismissed it

[1:15:55] SyNcVibez: ‚ú® you're bald‚ú® but in a positive way
[1:15:57] TheIrishGuy: not until they are backed up
[1:16:01] Vovosunt: setup move endermen chambers?
[1:16:05] Vovosunt: more*
[1:16:21] Nooooe: you will eventually, but will be long as everything needs to backup first
[1:16:37] boyownik: What is the speed of your export conduit? Because on default I believe it is 3 so when round robin is enabled 3 items is put in each chest iwth same prio
[1:16:57] navalship55: Alright, thank you
[1:17:04] her0zer0: unless you wait for pearl backup you need a total of 39 self aware enderman sim to overwhelm those crafter
[1:17:16] Angel0death: What about having a buffer chest in between each line with a priority instead?
[1:17:17] GuardMoony: only way to fix it so you ensure items and pearls are created is to split the pristine generation in 2 seperate systems. ( first 3 rows on 1 drawer system ) and the others on a other
[1:17:31] frainsbreeze: waffle your friendly minecraft scientist!
[1:17:31] NinjaMaster__: you could priroity to buffer chests then round robbin off them
[1:17:33] cheppard: shouldn't it fix itself anyway?
[1:17:36] Aivarm: seems like priority stu central and gen-s and RR after that from separate storages
[1:17:37] RefiixGaming: 143
[1:17:46] RefiixGaming: as in all
[1:17:49] TheGeekPeek: Just use a buffer chest with priority, once the first fills it will move to the second section and so on.
[1:17:51] RefiixGaming: so 113 is the rest
[1:17:51] mechoriet: monkaS real voice reveal

[1:27:50] c4l89: the solve fot the wood problem is a torch and 2 stacks of bonemeal Kappa
[1:27:50] Noamwild: you can put a level emitter on that machine that took the wood to export wood when you have lets say above 10k wood?
[1:28:28] Nickonil: aaaand 88k blocks
[1:28:28] Xovital: more!

[1:29:38] Merinshard: easy money
[1:29:43] Merinshard: Kappa
[1:30:00] BadLa: the american government system sure is effective Kappa
[1:30:08] Daryl_Kay: Give up his power?
[1:30:10] TheIrishGuy: me  not connected
[1:30:26] Nickonil: now make a new seperate system that makes ever more ender pearls "just for fun"
[1:30:31] Merinshard: basically everything he believed in he had to give up to become speaker @Daryl_Kay
[1:30:32] Acarea: 20 far right members got everything they wanted by holding congress hostage
[1:30:40] Merinshard: yup @Acarea
[1:30:57] cheppard: can you just export it into the other system?
[1:30:57] kuba_91: I watched a document about deep blue you pasted yesterday
[1:31:15] dylan0806: Is your magnet turned off?

[1:31:36] Brakebein: so good
[1:31:42] snurre: oh yeah I watched it too. very good doc
[1:31:52] Purecrew: Which is dumb why didnt some of the democrats just vote for the republican to end the stalemate
[1:31:54] Merinshard: @Daryl_Kay basically is the gatekeeper for what gets disputed on in the house
[1:32:07] snurre: IBM were so sleazy to Kasparov
[1:32:13] DarkKnghtt58: @Purecrew political suicide, that's why
[1:32:13] Merinshard: And I believe he approves committee placements (which for oversight committee is a big deal)
[1:32:20] KAS_Sprmcy: @dylan0806 magnet doesn't work when holding shift/crouching
[1:32:21] Nickonil: alpha go is awesome
[1:32:26] Merinshard: @Purecrew because, politics
[1:32:32] fREAST: alpha go doc is good
[1:32:50] Daryl_Kay: @Merinshard So im just trying to understand, what does that mean when he gave up his power? Is he not able to be the gatekeeper then?
[1:32:51] Vovosunt: min-max paradigm
[1:33:00] daedmissica0: AlphaZero vs AlphaZero || THE PERFECT GAME is good
[1:33:15] snurre: it's called the horizon effect
[1:33:36] kaasrondje: They recently also programmed ‚Äústratego‚Äù at dutch board game, took that long because it has an ‚Äúunknown bluff‚Äù element in it
[1:33:45] Allmostdone: but alpago vs super alpha go is no contest
[1:33:53] CoopaRTroopa: @Daryl_Kay he didn't necessarily give up his power. he compromised with the 6 holdout republican representatives and gave one of them a higher position that was promised to another one.
[1:33:54] bugsplatter23: Alpha learned to play SC2 as well
[1:34:00] bobolpwnz: Stockfish reached 4k Elo recently
[1:34:03] Merinshard: @Daryl_Kay he is, however, he has to do so in favor of those he was bribed by
[1:34:04] AleXanDreMau: @Giantwaffle the GOD move on AlphaGo doc you can see the face of the progamers saying O F the % going down!
[1:34:20] olm_alone_: the GO algorithm found "noob" moves which turned out to be viable and are now played. so cool.
[1:34:32] Merinshard: so basically far right political figures get to control what is disputed all because he wanted the title of speaker @Daryl_Kay
[1:34:41] Fufcia: stockfish does that a lot
[1:34:52] kaasrondje: Stratego is like 40 ‚Äúunknown‚Äù pieces and you only know what what is once you capture it. Wild
[1:35:04] DoubleOughtNot: 3800 I think?

[1:37:50] Allmostdone: What about the poor guy who's account got banned because they thought it was AI gen
[1:37:57] aundros: Why even stream at that point? its not a real human then
[1:38:02] fREAST: NYC public schools banned chatGPT on their devices/networks KEKW
[1:38:08] PrimusOmegaOne: That could also be used for malicious purposes too though, like automated social engineering.
[1:38:08] Protonmat: there is an vtuber Ia already, that adapts to reaction and stuff
[1:38:12] Peppermint_Wizard: The company I work at uses AI to answer phones and it can laugh and pause and makes background typing noises and stuff. It's very creepy
[1:38:22] snurre: engineers used to make the world better. engineers today only make it worse
[1:38:25] SimonSez: Someone used chatGPT to negotiate with better subscription price with Verisons chatbot

[1:41:37] Demonwareltd: AI websites are the plague
[1:41:38] cheppard: did you try buying something on amazon same thing
[1:41:47] GummiKu: Because google only works with keywords and ChatGPT actually understands what you are asking

[1:41:56] Cannonboot: @Giantwaffle any t ips for starting the pack solo?
[1:41:57] LiveType: The amount of ads is absurd. I had to scroll down 12 links before I saw a none paid link
[1:42:02] kenshin2666: chatgpt answers what you ask pretty decently, google just spams you with paid sponsor shit
[1:42:11] xFroze0: Do you think AI can replace coders soon ?

[2:05:04] sogerr: only one ccd with extra cache is genius, it allows half to have super cache and the other half to boost super high, 8 cores with high cache is more than enough
[2:05:04] Nexhunter: @ThomK114 clock speeds do affect it given if you look at non x3d version compared to it

[2:10:00] mechoriet: @Nexhunter I mean it only happens when i just watch twitch for a moment to relax a bit

[2:16:57] daZonk: check and see if you are self aware
[2:16:59] ThatOnneGuy: Nexhunter depends on how it's cooked and what it's paired with. Mixed hotdogs in macaroni hit different.

[4:03:30] Moopoop: I'm here for the automation
[4:03:33] PureSpider: you make a drawer with higher priority?

[4:03:36] PureSpider: HUH
[4:03:36] Mounolatris: sub ae system
[4:03:36] Snah__: couldn't you make a downgraded drawer for just the stuff you need to make th eminers?
[4:03:39] MrSilverMatch: You export some to be prepared to make multiple drones like to a chest and get it to be high priority
[4:03:48] SailorWS: just set a downgraded drawer to high prio
[4:03:48] TheCairon: you make a drawer with a higher priority, but lower its capacity?
[4:03:51] kbigLiar: make this dust at a higher priority than stainless. job done

[4:04:22] nesse007: yes
[4:04:24] KICKKJ: yes that should work and be ebst
[4:04:30] SailorWS: and the output only goes to the drone system
[4:04:46] MrSilverMatch: Why storage bus ? More an export
[4:04:54] MrSilverMatch: Nothing will use it
[4:04:57] KICKKJ: redstone clock
[4:04:58] tomey36: Set it on dust maybe?
[4:04:59] CoolReal: Make drawer insert only and "manually" extract with pipes

[4:05:11] Razorain56: What did he figure out on the priority of the ender pipes?
[4:05:14] InternetPlumber: I setup a ore processing line dedicated to each tier and time how long it takes for it to process it all

[4:05:27] bird404: standalone
[4:05:28] Saishu_: drawers for ores coming from miners

[4:05:54] GFQPR1882: Redstone clock level emiter ?
[4:06:03] TheIrishGuy: maybe make it just not insert it
[4:06:10] Saishu_: drawers can have redstone upgrades

[4:06:17] Madarion: Time for a Paint work sheet Kappa
[4:06:18] redbeardjedd: Create your own crafting recipe that is one microminer that returns x amount of ore. Then when your system need an ore it will craft a miner and return the materials you want.
[4:06:24] coolcake2: clock is typicaly the worst way of doing such automation
[4:06:38] coolcake2: ah ok
