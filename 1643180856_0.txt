[0:32:00] spardha: alot of employees have had their Mac's wiped and access to apps removed @giantwaffle
[0:32:01] Stormflare: the one good thing elon did was destroying twitter
[0:32:03] Jodeatre: glad im not a twit
[0:32:05] Sinewave: Can't wait for the 3700 lawsuits incoming.
[0:32:06] 112nuno112: 112nuno112 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 15 months, currently on a 7 month streak! Pog
[0:32:10] daemonaedryn: Tech industries really need more unions
[0:32:10] JERICHOLOLO: but 7k people for twitter is alot
[0:32:11] farcryer2: 37 000 peeps gone, reduced to atoms
[0:32:11] krimzin_wizard: wtf is eolon doing
[0:32:13] tommyfod: kinda crazy doing that after a 45b investment isnt it
[0:32:14] StukelyT9: yeah something major will go wrong with the website, how can you know who to lay off within a week?
[0:32:17] 3junaa: it is if you see people as biomatter
[0:32:18] cwwcww: how can you fire people without some grace period?
[0:32:19] FoomDog: That's not unheard of during new ownership of a company though.
[0:32:19] 187_longbow: that is the way is goes
[0:32:20] brightcandle: Not redundencies, he is firing them for cause, he is going to get sued
[0:32:21] xrokic: that seem illegal in some way
[0:32:21] W84M3: can people just sue for lack of  30/60 days before lay off?
[0:32:22] UnicornBrothels: elon is mental
[0:32:23] Mikuro1: He's violating the WARN act, btw
[0:32:24] Bunjimus: i think elon kinda gets off being a meme
[0:32:26] tommyfod: like i get he wants to change things up but usually you wouldnt be so heavy handed so quickly
[0:32:28] PellyPlays: it probably needed it
[0:32:28] brightcandle: He is just breaking employment law for fun
[0:32:32] RoninStorm: i love how quickly people went from bashing twitter to defending it.
[0:32:35] ftzEZ: I'm sure a lot of the people who remain will leave at some point in the near future. That's not an environment most people wanna stay in.
[0:32:38] daemonaedryn: Desperate to not make his loan even worse?
[0:32:39] JERICHOLOLO: capitalism monster?
[0:32:40] farcryer2: That has to break employment laws
[0:32:40] Goldps1: elon is power tripping
[0:32:43] krimzin_wizard: lol
[0:32:44] boatymc_boatface_: the word you're looking for is bond villain
[0:32:44] Zoinx: I wish the US wasn't anti-union
[0:32:46] tommyfod: i think he will try to completely re-invent things i guess
[0:32:47] gman0821: going to be rough for twitter for several months.
[0:32:48] booth8604: is there storage upgrades for them?
[0:32:50] StukelyT9: he's desperate to make money from this, he will be paying $1bil per year in interest
[0:32:50] samuraijac: egomainac?
[0:32:54] PellyPlays: i dont understand what twitter would need that many people for
[0:32:57] CommanderUrsus: almost as bad as AOL Time Warner
[0:33:02] resarFelyK: I think its part of a plan
[0:33:02] Thorin5: unhinged is how I'd describe Elon these days
[0:33:04] Aarimous: How did he get the assets for that?
[0:33:09] Jodeatre: Elon is an alien, he's clearly an arquillian from MiB
[0:33:10] XteN10: 40 bil LUL rip
[0:33:11] brightcandle: 44 billion for something barely worth 10 billion and that was before the exodus started
[0:33:13] farcryer2: Here in EU people would have lost their shit over a move like that
[0:33:16] SassyPants: starlink also in the shitter
[0:33:17] Twin5un: LUL yep that's going to be a wild ride
[0:33:18] ymelus: he bet assets to borrow money
[0:33:20] Fronku: I support what Elon is doing :)
[0:33:23] krimzin_wizard: he owns alot of dogecoin Kappa
[0:33:24] tommyfod: tesla**
[0:33:33] 514484: i hope he destroys twitter, if so he will become my hero, i hope he buys reddit next
[0:33:35] samuraijac: his board must love him
[0:33:39] krimzin_wizard: yikew
[0:33:42] Aarimous: Wild
[0:33:44] resarFelyK: he must be planning do something when he gets most the world online @Giantwaffle cuz atm theres still billions of people he could get on twitter
[0:33:47] Balafore: If he sells stock he has to pay taxes on it. Cheaper to borrow money and repay the loan via what you just bought
[0:33:48] brightcandle: Everyone is talking Mastodon now its crazy
[0:33:53] AlphaSchnauzer: richest to poorest LUL
[0:33:53] forfiet: 8$ just for the blue checkmark
[0:33:54] 112nuno112: he is going to turn twitter into something entirely different. What he really bought was the users
[0:33:55] madscientist_72: That's it?
[0:34:08] krimzin_wizard: if twitter aint profitable. how is it worth over 40bil? thats insane to me
[0:34:12] Crazyfox55: If twitter is a failing business then he has every right to cull employees.
[0:34:15] farcryer2: 100 mil bots YEP
[0:34:21] gregcee: 28mil a year
[0:34:22] Moobot: You can find Waffle's Youtube channel here - https://youtube.com/giantwaffle
[0:34:25] FrostedSentry: cohhBot
[0:34:32] MrArrig: @Crazyfox55 I mean if he want to crash the company sure
[0:34:35] 514484: 300 millions journalists trying to find shitty controversies
[0:34:40] resarFelyK: what if it comes free with starlink subscription
[0:34:42] resarFelyK: EZ
[0:34:45] UnicornBrothels: 28m a year
[0:34:46] Jodeatre: he'll be lucky if one person buys it
[0:34:50] krimzin_wizard: $8 for some pixels KEKW
[0:34:53] gregcee: sorry 28 a month
[0:34:55] tommyfod: what does twitter currently make a year
[0:34:55] StukelyT9: it doesn't even make a profit as is
[0:34:57] Quadzer0: 288 mil a year
[0:35:00] SeaOfMadness_: doesn't he need 1bil/ year to pay off intrest?
[0:35:00] Onoson: just for interest
[0:35:00] UnicornBrothels: oh 28m a month
[0:35:03] brightcandle: The entire point of the checkmark was safety too, it brought legitimacy, charging for it hurts the business of twitter
[0:35:04] cwwcww: well, he just reduced his spending on wages... KEKW
[0:35:04] SassyPants: Scammers will make more money on this than twitter will
[0:35:07] MrHashbrowns: sounds like he fucked up
[0:35:09] HostileLogOut: you be surprised as to how many will buy it.
[0:35:11] samuraijac: i might start using twitter if i could pay $8 a month to see the tag twat on peoples pages...even if its me... but then i would be following/suppoting all the twats
[0:35:11] Stormflare: hopefully this effectively kills twitter
[0:35:12] CommanderUrsus: to cheapen the bluecheck status symbol
[0:35:14] Aarimous: The ads on Twtitter gonna get wayyy worse
[0:35:15] SassyPants: the scam emails are REAL on this
[0:35:16] upgradecarton: they need 1 billion a year, just to cover interest on the debt he saddled them with.  that's not covering anything else.
[0:35:18] daemonaedryn: And thats honestly optimistc
[0:35:29] awesomefreak72: Thats kind of better than just sitting
[0:35:29] HostileLogOut: why not buy it? your paying for discord and you get nothing in return for that.
[0:35:30] kinglouisxvii: its better than nothing tho
[0:35:31] malarkey0094: Musketeers in chat lmao
[0:35:31] SeriousPotatoBot: KEKW TBH he will most likely do another Doge pump and dump scheme again using twiter
[0:35:33] Thorin5: that's not even 1% of his purchase price
[0:35:39] Crazyfox55: @MrArrig Those employees are not helping
[0:35:43] gman0821: and advertisers are already considering pulling ads from twitter lol
[0:35:52] Obidesh: Trying to explain to my child what live streaming is, can some folks say hi Abigail? :D
[0:35:57] kinglouisxvii: its about having recurrring revenue not paying of his debt
[0:36:02] herritic1: isnt the whole point of the checkmark the exclusivity of it? So making it a paid sub devalues it?
[0:36:02] Polystyx: I use browser extensions to get rid of ads lol
[0:36:03] AlphaSchnauzer: Presume his lawyers told him this no?
[0:36:06] JERICHOLOLO: KEKW
[0:36:08] Jodeatre: couldn't happen to a nicer person
[0:36:10] daemonaedryn: @Obidesh Hi Abigail :)
[0:36:11] Stormflare: ideal situation elon goes bankrupt and twitter dies Kappa
[0:36:14] Quadzer0: @Obidesh Hi Abigail
[0:36:18] CommanderUrsus: I still think he's trying to create a WeChat clone, with a payment system
[0:36:18] tommyfod: i.e. like Tesla? hha
[0:36:19] Dataman10: You think he bought it for a Blue bird tick...really
[0:36:20] JERICHOLOLO: but who is gonna but it from him for 50+?
[0:36:23] krimzin_wizard: Mars travel tech is his out with spacex
[0:36:26] UnicornBrothels: i hope he does
[0:36:29] Tinselear: kinda hope he does
[0:36:31] samuraijac: this was his big dick move for trumps media platform...someone must have ribbed him he didnt have his own
[0:36:33] upgradecarton: the problem is that he secured this deal with Tesla stock, so he could take down both
[0:36:35] Dagmoo: i think you underestimate how stupid people are and they will pay for the check mark
[0:36:35] forfiet: was twitter owned by one person before? @Giantwaffle
[0:36:36] waterlimon: ahh imagine if he had put the 44 bill into spaceX :(
[0:36:37] Stormflare: tesla's already overvalued as well
[0:36:44] daemonaedryn: See heres the thing, elon has a lot of fanboys that I 100% believe will bankrupt themselves for him
[0:36:49] ItsOnMax: @forfiet No, it wqas public asset
[0:36:52] Obidesh: Thanks @DaemonSzyman and @Quadzer0 you got a big smile haha
[0:37:02] krimzin_wizard: NODDERS
[0:37:03] Scojan: Is there a dinner command for tonight? @Giantwaffle
[0:37:03] forfiet: @forfiet gotcha
[0:37:04] Twin5un: LUL
[0:37:09] FoomDog: Twitters going private though. Doubt he'll run short of investors with hefty bags to utilize his new platform
[0:37:09] Polystyx: Elon is still a genuis engineer he'll make it work
[0:37:16] Kardiiac: have to consider the other people who helped fund this, that probably also dont want to lost their money :)
[0:37:16] Iksess: he just had extra few billions to spare, he dont need to "recover"
[0:37:16] daemonaedryn: @Polystyx ???
[0:37:16] DanteFreed: Guess Elon's about to sell a kidney.....
[0:37:17] Big_Mikk: its a power trip
[0:37:18] Jodeatre: buys twitter so he can blackmail his ex
[0:37:19] Scojan: Elon has just gone off the rails KEKW
[0:37:21] brightcandle: Just to try and push his agenda, its a lot
[0:37:22] Stormflare: elon is not a genius or an engineer lol
[0:37:25] resarFelyK: has to be a plan he would of lost less money stalling it out in court for eternity
[0:37:25] farcryer2: I love watching the shitshow
[0:37:27] safecampxl: it is extremely stranger
[0:37:28] daemonaedryn: @Polystyx You realise elon is just a businessman right?
[0:37:31] kerpenverpen_: maybe he wants to ruin twitter. i wouldn't be mad
[0:37:32] Mikuro1: Elon hires people to be the genius, he himself is not one at all
[0:37:32] daZonk: He does have a ton of Tesla stock still. And my opinion is his Tesla stock is over valued, his spacex private stock is undervalued. If that hit market it would 10x easy
[0:37:34] safecampxl: strange
[0:37:34] krimzin_wizard: we al make mistakes, just some are bigger than others Kappa
[0:37:38] ProducerMoo: Put his money where is mouth is and it didn’t taste good
[0:37:45] FlashfreezeBuddha: elon is a genius hypeman. not a good businessman
[0:37:45] gman0821: @DaemonSzyman and a somewhat poor one at that
[0:37:51] Polystyx: @DaemonSzyman Do some research he's an engineer, literally designs the rockets
[0:37:55] Obidesh: Obidesh subscribed with Prime. 
[0:37:56] Moobot: Thank you for subbing, Obidesh! waffleHeart
[0:38:01] upgradecarton: he's a modern day PT Barnum
[0:38:01] CommanderUrsus: didn't he already sell $10 billion worth?
[0:38:08] MrArrig: There's a reason the market didn't believe he would buy it early on before they forced him to
[0:38:15] SeriousPotatoBot: @Giantwaffle But isn't Starlink supposed to because VERY profitable at some point soon?
[0:38:17] UnicornBrothels: alwyas has been
[0:38:17] RoninStorm: i couldn't care less about twitter or elon... and it honestly makes me laugh that so many people do.
[0:38:22] resarFelyK: not a good time for manufacturing companies either
[0:38:44] SassyPants: he literally is cying to DOD about starlink it's burning money
[0:38:44] Dresden71: starlink wont be cheap until they finish the entire network
[0:38:45] kerpenverpen_: @RoninStorm drama... drama never changes
[0:38:50] Scojan: He is just going to barebones run twitter at this point it sounds like. Fire anyone who is going to cost him a ton of money
[0:38:52] tommyfod: because they are overpriced and poor quality
[0:38:53] boatymc_boatface_: they couldn't deliver on time
[0:38:53] Gay1e: Elon has leveraged himself into a position where he hopes the Fed wont let him fail
[0:38:57] Stormflare: because there are actual car companies that know how to make a good car in the market now
[0:38:58] OMICRON: i feel like back in the old days with waffle and sev both doing minecraft again
[0:38:58] tommyfod: they had first mover advantage, thats all
[0:39:01] krimzin_wizard: isnt a new starlink node model coming out soon?
[0:39:02] Gay1e: but he will need a massive bailout
[0:39:08] Stormflare: instead of meme vehicles like the cyber truck
[0:39:15] UnicornBrothels: they shouldnt
[0:39:15] Addrax: the only EV i would buy right now is a Ford Lightning
[0:39:15] SeriousPotatoBot: KEKW I passed a 2022 reg Model 3 that already had fogged up headlights
[0:39:21] UnicornBrothels: thats my tax dollars!
[0:39:21] chilly_doggo: He'll definitely lose advertising revenue as well if he goes forward with his stated moderation plans
[0:39:22] nyanqtp: hyundai > tesla imo
[0:39:22] FoomDog: They always save billionaires.
[0:39:22] Scojan: Elon did this to himself, he should suffer
[0:39:24] upgradecarton: the only thing they'd probably try to save is SpaceX
[0:39:25] samuraijac: if elon wasnt the face of tesla i feel it would have done better... he brings good and bad attention to his companies
[0:39:30] Aarimous: They have done it before
[0:39:33] Gay1e: @Giantwaffle He'll try to leverage it as all of the jobs and stuff. But I think he has burried hismelf
[0:39:35] madscientist_72: The Boring Company will save him. Kappa
[0:39:40] brightcandle: Its going to be carnage
[0:39:40] ruleroel: one can only wish
[0:39:42] Basetens: he'll sell it to his new buddies in saudia arabia
[0:39:43] CommanderUrsus: he's already set for life, who cares if some idiots loaned him 44 billion
[0:39:44] tommyfod: impressive they cn turn around the paid option in 2 weeks... makes you think it was already build and not released
[0:39:46] Stormflare: watching the downfall of elon and twitter at the same time is very juicy
[0:39:48] Quadzer0: @Scojan true - he meme'd too hard and got burned
[0:39:49] daZonk: I don’t disagree, but what EV do you like non Tesla? I am still struggling to like another EV (I have been “looking” for an EV for my next car)
[0:39:49] Valhuun: twitter HQ going ot be on mars. mars will be a tax haven
[0:39:50] Jodeatre: he deserves it he's a clown
[0:39:51] isfil: you guys are non believers, elon will unban every single person on twitter. He will save the humanity with his genious mind.
[0:39:51] Aarimous: I drink Coffee
[0:39:52] awesomefreak72: u be hating @Giantwaffle
[0:39:52] ScottDark: Yeah he's trying to make money from twitter but there's no way it's going to be anywhere enough
[0:39:54] SassyPants: i don't care for twitter
[0:39:56] krimzin_wizard: he should sell more flamethrowers Kappa
[0:39:56] buji_bujinson: Is feral lamps in this pack?
[0:40:01] samuraijac: he was set for life before he was born
[0:40:04] GuyPlatypus: it's ok
[0:40:04] Onoson: he’ll probably hand out the checkmark to people he likes to get attention and advertising
[0:40:05] krimzin_wizard: KEKW
[0:40:10] daemonaedryn: Is he in debt or is it his companies?
[0:40:12] Fronku: I love watching obsessive Twitter users losing their shit, gives me dopamine :)
[0:40:14] upgradecarton: and its not partially owned by the Saudi's
[0:40:16] krimzin_wizard: my student loan debt just got wiped out thanks to biden :)
[0:40:23] SimonSez: Musk is going to loose control of Tesla is what I think
[0:40:26] brightcandle: $10 in debt they follow you to the ends of the earth, $44 billion they give you more debt to pay off the debt
[0:40:28] HoodTrack: starlink customers
[0:40:38] Stormflare: pepeLaugh el no sabe
[0:40:47] ThiefHoid: I'm pretty sure Elon would sell any asset he owns before he takes SpaceX public
[0:40:53] zynithtv: you can make item collectors and stuff for mob farm now
[0:40:59] daZonk: He wouldn’t put spacex public,  they would would make new company for starlink and make that public.
[0:41:07] SeriousPotatoBot: @Giantwaffle NOP Did you also see that KSP now has an external launcher after the "tutorial" update
[0:41:11] resarFelyK: we haven't seen any major bankruptcies lately probably due for some giant megalodon to fall
[0:41:26] ItsOnMax: normal
[0:41:28] SeriousPotatoBot: KSP
[0:41:36] isfil: @Giantwaffle isn't spacex already profitable ? With the gorverment contracts ?
[0:41:40] upgradecarton: the whole "leveraged buyout" thing bothers me.  i want to buy a company, but force the company to take on massive debt, so i can buy it.
[0:42:09] That0neGeye: arent they doing some spacex coin?
[0:42:09] DemonicHell3: Nothing makes me happier then using a launcher to launch another launcher to play the game.
[0:42:14] SassyPants: Can a defense contractor go public?
[0:42:17] Fronku: KSP2 is going to be awesome
[0:42:18] krimzin_wizard: so private company stock is just limited shares vs a public? im not smart on that subject
[0:42:25] Aarimous: We are almost done with Nov
[0:42:26] Moobot: You can sub to Waffle by clicking this neat link -> twitch.tv/giantwaffle/subscribe SUBprise
[0:42:27] All_Tech: spacex goes public -> elon announces plan to mine big expensive boulder
[0:42:37] rinrn: Didn't Musk talk about spinning out Starlink and going public with it b4? @Giantwaffle So maybe it wouldn't be whole SpaceX but just Starlink.
[0:42:41] daZonk: Spacex is profitable, but it’s a heavy r&d company, so it’s only as profitable as they want to be. They could dump all that profit into say blowing up 20 starship.
[0:42:44] ItsRender: I cant wait for Dec 6th, Dwarf Fortress babbbbbbby

[0:43:23] SherlockHemlock: Who says SpaceX is allowed to mine those?
[0:43:26] Iksess: are you talking about factorio?
[0:43:31] Felaex: space mining destroys the price of  the material that has been farmed
[0:43:36] Zohaas: How many rockets could he buy for the $44B? @Giantwaffle
[0:43:37] Minelmonia: @SherlockHemlock who is going to regulate?
[0:43:37] SassyPants: @Quadzer0 Cool i had no idea if that was an issue
[0:43:37] Jodeatre: until the belters complain it belongs to them
[0:43:37] Peeeeeeeeeep: I wonder if people would wonder how Elon would fuck it up though based on recent events
[0:43:40] FlashfreezeBuddha: thats a wild west thats still a few decades in the future
[0:43:42] resarFelyK: elon the ceo of umbrella corp

[0:43:47] farcryer2: 99% goes to 5 people. 1% is shared between the rest KEKW
[0:43:51] mcpsluke: no about elon musk
[0:43:51] ItsOnMax: @SherlockHemlock Noone, there is a treaty, but the us did not sign it.
[0:43:51] boatymc_boatface_: and then we're one step further awas from Star Trek
[0:44:00] thebodge: I'm buying a rocket when I when the lottery tonight
[0:44:03] Quadzer0: @SassyPants - I'm sure the US gov't has thoughts lol

[0:44:46] booth8604: Unobtainium Kappa
[0:44:47] ItsOnMax: lithium for Tesla batteries Kappa
[0:44:48] phelps1k: helium-3?
[0:44:49] Jodeatre: idk gold would be good to have cheap for better electronics
[0:44:53] thebodge: uranium
[0:44:53] jmm548: rare earth metals
[0:44:54] chilly_doggo: Nope gotta have that gold toilet
[0:44:54] SassyPants: syndicates have been controling supply and demand for hundreds of years
[0:44:54] Dresden71: the amount of electronics u could build with that gold though
[0:44:56] UnicornBrothels: oxygen
[0:44:56] Gay1e: Look at opec and their oil. They didnt want the price to fall so they jsut cut back productioon to artificially raise the demand ratio
[0:45:02] thebodge: platinum
[0:45:02] UnicornBrothels: KKona
[0:45:07] SimonSez: But the certified diamond market is controlled
[0:45:09] Big_Mikk: yep like element that don't exist on earth
[0:45:10] NotPancakeHero: diamonds are functionally useless
[0:45:14] FoomDog: @forfiet His family also had money. His dad owned stuff in south africa
[0:45:16] daZonk: And those people would be Karen’s
[0:45:16] NotPancakeHero: except for cutting tools
[0:45:21] rcalculated: hey can you guickly explain what you are working on?
[0:45:22] Dagmoo: you literally cant tell unless you look at the etching
[0:45:22] Scojan: Real diamonds you have to pay for the blood part as well
[0:45:28] SeriousPotatoBot: KEKW Thats what my mum said when I told her about Lab diamonds
[0:45:33] T1dddy: you'd be surprised
[0:45:34] Stormflare: yeah everyones getting moissonite and shit
[0:45:35] CommanderUrsus: yeah try not buying one
[0:45:35] Jakodii: how do you create the todolist ?
[0:45:37] ninopanda: diamonds are not the rarest gem stone in the world
[0:45:38] UnicornBrothels: i get my diamonds from Kmart KKona
[0:45:45] Iksess: what the fuck do you even need diamonds for, real life isnt minecraft, diamonds arnt useful
[0:45:45] farcryer2: The Real Diamonds have to be bathed in the blood of child-workers and slaves for them to be valuable
[0:45:47] Fronku: I think getting a single diamond ring is meh but diamond accents are pretty cool addon to a ring
[0:45:54] thebodge: I think Opal is way cooler
[0:45:56] SeaOfMadness_: @UnicornBrothels KEKW
[0:45:57] DeMayon: i have a diamond accented gun KKona
[0:46:06] Twin5un: i did buy a diammond ring for my wife LUL but it's canadian diamonds

[0:46:11] Dresden71: i think emerald is the coolest gemstone on rings
[0:46:18] krimzin_wizard: i want  a diamond toilet
[0:46:19] NotPancakeHero: @DeMayon I have diamond plates in my plate rig instead of steel plates
[0:46:25] xTaktinen: Gold is also funky because it is almost useless. It is mainly mined for storage collection and like 18% is used in industry
[0:46:26] UnicornBrothels: diamond toilet paper would be cool
[0:46:28] All_Tech: i dont want a ring unless the diamond was mined in africa and stored in a warehouse until it was drip fed out to the public
[0:46:29] KidRainbow: Literal planets made of diamonds out there
[0:46:31] ninopanda: @Dresden71 have you seen a red berryl on a ring?
[0:46:45] choklooo: its there
[0:46:47] PxlSauce: also diamonds are boring, colored crystals are more intersting to me, like emeralds ruby etc
[0:46:57] choklooo: you have andesite
[0:47:00] NotPancakeHero: gold is useful for electronics
[0:47:02] krimzin_wizard: yes
[0:47:03] UnicornBrothels: yes
[0:47:03] daemonaedryn: Super good conductor
[0:47:04] thebodge: gold is a great conductor
[0:47:07] farcryer2: Gold is useful for electronics
[0:47:08] xTaktinen: You didn't finish the sentence boy
[0:47:09] Stormflare: they use gold for electrical contacts because it doesnt corrode
[0:47:09] ragettion: electronics i thought
[0:47:09] madscientist_72: Gold is the best heat reflector.
[0:47:09] jinkleft: gold doesn't corrode
[0:47:10] krimzin_wizard: its in tons of eletronics
[0:47:12] SimonSez: Gold is a good conductor and is does not oxidate
[0:47:12] NotPancakeHero: like all electronics have gold in them
[0:47:13] Basetens: conductor, non-reactive
[0:47:14] Jodeatre: gold is great for electronics
[0:47:24] winnerab: gold for electronics???
[0:47:28] Myekos: noble metal :)
[0:47:29] Dresden71: @ninopanda looks really good too, but something about deep green is so pleasing
[0:47:30] Jodeatre: its a noble metal
[0:47:32] farcryer2: conductive, great reflector, non-reactive
[0:47:35] Stormflare: they have close to a complete shell
[0:47:38] krimzin_wizard: right
[0:47:38] All_Tech: an abundance of gold would lead to some interesting electronics
[0:47:41] Apparentthreat: them valence electrons
[0:47:41] jinkleft: Umm doesn't gold have less conductivity than copper but it doesn't corrode? I can't remember
[0:47:44] Nilau: sadly its too expensive
[0:47:44] SeaOfMadness_: Gold is innert
[0:47:47] FlashfreezeBuddha: used in high end hi-fi equipment and other electronics
[0:47:51] winnerab: imagine solid gold heatsinks in your pc
[0:47:52] ninopanda: @Dresden71 yeah i feel ya there. Emerald is a fun stone to play with
[0:47:53] SimonSez: Iron is the most stable atom in the universe. The outer shell is full of electrons
[0:48:03] xTaktinen: The percentage that goes to industry from ALL the mined gold in the world is pretty smal
[0:48:04] farcryer2: @winnerab That is where 99% of it is being used already KEKW
[0:48:05] banshay3: because pure
[0:48:13] Fronku: Platinum electrodes are Pog
[0:48:14] hk_joe: gold is great for rings, especially with diamond on it :)
[0:48:14] rollen123: There is more to it but for a short explanation yea you're right
[0:48:16] Nilau: Vibranium >>> Kappa
[0:48:16] MrArrig: iron? Heard of rust?
[0:48:19] Stormflare: i dont think thats true the noble gases are also very inert
[0:48:21] madscientist_72: Eventually, the entire universe will decay to iron atoms.
[0:48:27] philhaspaidthebills: iron is the most stable in terms of entropy
[0:48:29] All_Tech: yeah the last stages of the universe will be black holes and decaying iron
[0:48:30] UnicornBrothels: Neon seqInsane
[0:48:33] krimzin_wizard: any am class sucks KEKW
[0:48:33] Dresden71: most stable? isnt helium the most inert and stable?
[0:48:43] Stormflare: transistor theory sucks lol
[0:48:46] Dagmoo: yep i feel you had that same class
[0:48:56] icrasvenom: will you join the start for the next foxhole war tomorrow?
[0:49:13] philhaspaidthebills: yah iron is "stable" in the form of natural degradation or entropy
[0:49:24] krimzin_wizard: anyone playing the new PoE flashback league today? or has that ship sailed for most?
[0:49:25] SeaOfMadness_: Iron is the lowest energy atom in the universe. It is the bottom of the energy valley
[0:49:30] PxlSauce: that line of blocks is 1 block too high waffle
[0:49:32] lazyhot: souls sand water manipulation wheels incomming?

[0:49:47] Stormflare: foxhole Pog
[0:50:04] philhaspaidthebills: @SeaOfMadness_ nah thats helium

[0:52:05] PlaguedV: wardens won charlie
[0:52:08] PxlSauce: Waffle that line of blocks is one too high

[1:21:22] Comis19: Twitter has had a massive drop in revenue, due to activist groups pressuring advertisers, even though nothing has changed with content moderation and we did everything we could to appease the activists.  Extremely messed up! They’re trying to destroy free speech in America.

[1:23:23] Stormflare: social media in general has been a net negative for society
[1:23:40] justin_triII: Elon Musk is doing it so he can get rid of bots. He is in turn offering a paid verification process so people have the opportunity to monetize their content as well.
[1:23:41] nick43087: least everyone had a friend named Tom on myspace.  KEKW

[1:25:59] Arimil: The issue with REI is a lot of the JEI integrations don't work.
[1:25:59] hellolilpiggy: @giantwaffle did you notice rei also collapses duplicate items? Look at the tinkers anvil. It says ctrl click to expand

[2:00:34] Jaydepps00: @LokiRulez iirc controlers are needed only for larger networks
[2:01:00] Jaydepps00: @PsychoLizard69 A on an item, and A on a recipe
[2:01:05] LokiRulez: @Jaydepps00 good to know, i always built the controller for that...that would def make things easier lol
[2:01:27] UnfitCheetah: personally I prefer refined Storage, but I know people are always split on this, it is like the coke, pepsi debate.
[2:01:28] daemonaedryn: @PsychoLizard69 Pressing A on an item in REI puts it top left
[2:02:05] brightcandle: Refined Storage is cheaper to get going with and easier to craft, but less capable in the end
[2:02:16] Arimil: The new AE is so much better.
[2:02:23] Jolle450: I miss the times when you didnt have to worry about channels

[2:03:28] Jaydepps00: @eurqa KEKW
[2:03:30] Arimil: CREATE kinda hard to put in modpacks though, since you can very easily break progression with it, due to how easy it is to make complex things with so little tools.
[2:03:32] officialzip: have you done any xnet @Giantwaffle ?
[2:04:52] CoolFroggy: My PO3 is tingling
[2:04:53] Moobot: Come join the Waffle House Discord! <# https://discord.gg/fhGFtMuzdS

[2:10:36] drifter_310: what if you programmed the box by using actual code, but like super easy level coding to introduce people into coding, like a very simplified python or something
[2:10:37] HeartlessM: is he gonna 100% it though? that would probably take months
[2:10:38] Dizz1227: @sliderspy it is

[2:20:42] HyperGainZ: Javascript does not care

[2:21:40] justin_triII: "Jake said 'hello' dont say that"
[2:21:44] leroycs803: Either you escape the character \ , encode it or use ' (single-quote) to open/close the string
[2:21:47] Arimil: yes
[2:21:48] bensmcc: Same thing if you had a double quote in a double quote string.

[2:30:19] TCaillet: its great when you forget to buy thermal paste like an idiot
[2:30:21] MDSZilla: microcenter is like a warehouse beautified
[2:30:22] MDSZilla: LUL
[2:30:25] Omnirex: Micro center also had 3D printing filament which is pretty decent. Has saved me a few times

[2:31:25] Sir_Robbe_: does it have good dust filters?
[2:31:28] VaultPls: i want to make a ultra small form factor and just looking at pictures online really doesnt do justice
[2:31:41] b0ngo: look at it in store then buy online :)
[2:31:45] Blatmachin3: Another big benefit is trying mechanical keyboards side by side

[2:32:04] Omnirex: @lokirulez it’s a lot easier nowadays. An enclosure helps a lot to stop warping off the build plate

[3:00:34] SystemCollapsed: not to hard
[3:00:35] Pe4enie: it's literally a quest
[3:00:36] BigBody_47: nice
[3:00:37] Toxers: Just feel like Draconic armor is better :S
[3:00:43] EvergreenMoth8: @Driitzz yeah thats how i remember how long ivw atched waffle. that wasnt the FIRST stream of his i watched but it was around that month that i had started watching him on the regular
[3:00:44] DepressoMode: gtnh pepeLaugh
[3:00:44] palagrim_: Think the armor literally removes hitbox to make you completly invulnerable
[3:00:47] jayerbuu: @Doodliedie go into the portal
[3:00:48] Allmostdone: And you will see the sun at the end
[3:00:57] RighteousBru: 50 hours for normal people 999 for waffle kekw

[3:01:09] Immp: That armour is immune to /kill
[3:01:09] Gh3ttoboy: THe infinity armor recipe seems to be basic recipe besides the gem armor from Project E
[3:01:09] RighteousBru: the infinity armor makes you immune to /kill
[3:01:13] Tyvern: Fucking hell you already got ME system
[3:01:35] RighteousBru: i think it also removes your hitbox
[3:01:37] jmm548: so if on a server go fro armor first LUL
[3:01:39] Thegrinch6: @Giantwaffle move your computer?
[3:01:55] DX_Plates: Character is a clutz, and continually hits themselves with their sword... LUL

[3:02:50] Allmostdone: IMO: moving the entire axils
[3:03:18] brightcandle: A tunnel around during the side, some steps over the top. just anything
[3:04:03] EvergreenMoth8: @Giantwaffle funfact about the infinity armor. it ALSO makes you immune to /ban commands in a multiplayer server. i tested it with my friend to troll him and he didnt get banned. saying the command failed to run
[3:04:07] TheIrishGuy: just grow more on wood
[3:04:08] Megafishman: the crook
[3:04:08] DX_Plates: Vines are Tree Drops
[3:04:17] Pe4enie: it probably has tree sap or anything?
[3:04:18] TheIrishGuy: bone meal
[3:04:24] Immp: I mean, can you twerk on placed Vines to grow them?
[3:04:25] sliderspy: Move the auto hammers to a compact machine
[3:04:28] stormzwest: @EvergreenMoth8 no way
[3:04:29] TheIrishGuy: the vines
[3:04:30] Pe4enie: check the liquid rubber recipe
[3:04:33] Tech: It's not honest, but it's much
[3:04:41] DX_Plates: Bonemeal + Sheer actual vines?
[3:04:48] stormzwest: @EvergreenMoth8 that is very exploitable lmao
[3:04:49] Pe4enie: no, arboreal extractor
[3:04:51] Pe4enie: bruh
[3:05:02] Arimil: can just put the vines on the wall to grow them
[3:05:15] Tyvern: Really, isn't Stoneblock 3 not on Curseforge launcher?
[3:05:20] dogma802: All this technology and modding yet we still depend on the infinite water glitch
[3:05:23] Pe4enie: that's what i'm saying, you need arboreal extractor to get latex
[3:05:24] Immp: FTB App @Tyvern
[3:05:27] TheIrishGuy: grow vines ?
[3:05:28] Wakarana: @tyvern ftb only
[3:05:30] Hurtwolf: @Giantwaffle have u seen the pack create: above and beyond
[3:05:35] Tyvern: Fecking BRUH
[3:05:42] EvergreenMoth8: @stormzwest its easy to disable though and its more of a side effect of how the immunity to /kill works iirc it works by looking for any command that can instantly kill the player and basically making them blacklisted from that command working on the player such as kill and ban
[3:05:54] EvergreenMoth8: so just disable the command stuff
[3:06:06] RighteousBru: you can grow vines
[3:06:08] BigDumbAnimal: It's working!
[3:06:09] Hurtwolf: waffleBASS
[3:06:13] DX_Plates: Grow vines with Bonemeal and sheet them
[3:06:17] DX_Plates: *sheer
[3:06:25] maccabeus: imagine manually growing vines when you have tree twerker
[3:07:29] madseed15: why don't just put it next to it lol
[3:07:43] DX_Plates: I never make just 4 of something, if you need 1 you'll need a bunch, thats how these packs seem to work.
[3:08:20] stefan150: what hyappened to your other minecraft modpack world
[3:08:27] jmm548: can u doa bulk auto hammer
[3:08:48] Foooks: Dungeon run time?

[3:18:13] lcePops: add another filter for 1 stack at a time?
[3:18:21] FatOPanda: is it reseting wash time when a new item is added?
[3:18:33] ninopanda: use a shute
[3:18:34] Pe4enie: btw, speed of the fan behind doesn't matter, it only increases how far it blows. if you want to make it wash faster, add more fans around it
[3:18:34] HammerssC: try chutes
[3:18:36] TheResinger: can you tell the pipe to pull a stack?
[3:18:37] ninopanda: chute*
[3:18:38] Immp: I dont think pipez will drop onto the depot, just a normal Chute will drop a stack
[3:18:39] KingMidasNV: i heard an australian reviews refer to 4090 as Girthy. i love it

[3:19:20] ninopanda: you can do the advanced and it will drop upto 64
[3:19:30] DemonicHell3: look into laser io and you can set however many you want
[3:19:31] weightmaker: 16 is most efficient i believe
[3:19:50] brightcandle: it's working well now
[3:19:59] bcdmonkey: Could have 4 and just do “a stack” at a time
[3:20:05] bcdmonkey: No need but you could

[3:25:56] Slymph: Cockvember YEP
[3:25:56] Apparentthreat: HACKERMANS
[3:26:03] Apparentthreat: Slymph internal name only
[3:26:10] DX_Plates: It generates the entire worlds history
[3:26:13] TheResinger: depends on how they set the world up
[3:26:15] Krystalchan: 20 minutes is if you want a LOT of history
[3:26:15] jinkleft: It doesn't take 20 minutes. It depends on how you generate your world and size
[3:26:17] shankwolf: depends on world size and history time length
[3:26:17] Mr_Warsta: Se a smaller world parameters, it will be quicker
[3:26:20] ninopanda: depends on how big the map is
[3:26:22] Ceratic: Only if you are doing overly huge worlds
[3:26:22] Slymph: @Apparentthreat Internal indeed susHmm
[3:26:25] kulze: 10-20 minutes, yeah, strong computers take less. Make a small world and it'll take barely any time.
[3:26:26] Mr_Warsta: Buy you can play the same world infinitely
[3:26:27] orillion: nah old old pcs on large worlds sure
[3:26:31] Apparentthreat: ninopanda is your DF wiki
[3:26:32] shankwolf: its like generating worlds in rim world, but a bit longer
[3:26:33] bcdmonkey: Better then a cod game that needs to download another 100gb to play
[3:26:37] lantskip: it will be the worst rated game in the history of Steam
[3:26:41] CoolReal: Shift + Control + Click moves all the stacks of an item, also works for dropping, Shift + Control + Q + Click
[3:26:45] Ceratic: The worlds I play on generate in under 5 minutes usually
[3:26:49] OMICRON: pretty cool
[3:26:49] Moobot: You can find Waffle's Youtube channel here - https://youtube.com/giantwaffle

[3:27:06] Allmostdone: what game?
[3:27:07] dogma802: @lantskip DF?
[3:27:19] Ceratic: The real thing I'm worried about is the killer of all forts FPS death and how new players react to that
[3:27:25] Allmostdone: the orginal DF is free
[3:27:29] DeMayon: @Allmostdone ty
[3:27:32] camper_44: wait 20 minute? pf , waited 6 hours for new world on the first day for que
[3:27:40] RighteousBru: why do you need a security terminal?
[3:27:52] Zakodiac: Chat anything else funny happen from mystery blocks? Been busy past few days
[3:27:53] dogma802: @Ceratic I think DF is well known enough that people will kind of understand. The game's been around fof years
[3:27:56] Apparentthreat: search fluix
[3:28:13] lantskip: @lantskip yes
[3:28:20] RighteousBru: he stopped using the mystery blocks Zakodiac, because they screwed with progression
[3:28:20] Allmostdone: DF has been around for over a decade
[3:28:23] dogma802: I think DF has been in development longer than version control
[3:28:32] dogma802: Nvm
[3:28:37] OMICRON: i had never even heard of dwarf fortress till recently
[3:28:44] CoolReal: Powa for wireless charging
[3:28:45] TigerLuv: imagine running your computer on a water/cog power supply... or better yet your laptop :D
[3:28:47] CoolReal: Player transmitter
[3:28:48] lantskip: @dogma808_marqueezus are you the creator of DF?
[3:28:57] Swippen: Dev started 2002
[3:29:02] Zakodiac: Didn't it have an ascii version?
[3:29:07] TritonXXXG: nino showed me the old game. ita pretty cool
[3:29:11] Wibit: DF is wonderful
[3:29:13] shankwolf: and its free on their site
[3:29:14] lantskip: @Zakodiac it is an ASCII version right now
[3:29:23] Apparentthreat: is it still not ascii
[3:29:23] Allmostdone: the orginal is still ascii
[3:29:24] kulze: @Zakodiac It is an ASCII game right now, gets a graphical proper overlay right now on Steam
[3:29:27] dogma802: Holy shit, DF is actually older than git
[3:29:27] Slymph: Anyone say ascii? ඞ
[3:29:32] 0x4273: KKona
[3:29:35] praxiz: i watched a YT video of the dev explaining why a guy had a lot of dead cats in his tavern ... it ... was incredible to listen to, as a programmer
[3:29:36] OMICRON: yeah i loved and played the shit out of MUDs back in the day when i had dial up lol
[3:29:41] HappyLilToast: it'll def be a hit
[3:29:43] Zakodiac: svn is ass
[3:29:46] dogma802: Git was made in 2005
[3:29:47] 0x4273: git is 2005
[3:29:49] Mr_Warsta: I think they make some $10k in donations every month
[3:29:53] hydrogor: hydrogor subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 46 months! When did stoneblock start?
[3:29:54] 0x4273: bro svn is so bad
[3:29:57] ninopanda: @Slymph you're sus
[3:30:02] praxiz: it's entierly module based, apparently
[3:30:03] Allmostdone: git is very new in computer land
[3:30:04] lantskip: @0x4273 are you Linus Torvalds or not?
[3:30:05] RighteousBru: so it is because of greed, just not his greed... df is payed because of the greed of insurance companies >:(
[3:30:10] shankwolf: viewer count might tank once you boot up dwarf fortress tho
[3:30:13] Apparentthreat: oh fuck. I saw nino play just the ascii one
[3:30:21] Ceratic: The biggest thing about the steam version is an upgrade UI
[3:30:23] Wibit: DF also plays alot better with 3rd party apps like dwarf therapist
[3:30:24] gartoks: Hey waffle and chat o/ Finally home from work
[3:30:25] nellydocs: whats the called ?
[3:30:29] lantskip: @shankwolf very bad take
[3:30:32] dogma802: @0x4273 Can confirm, SVN is dog shit
[3:30:35] ninopanda: the descriptions are the best
[3:30:35] Egrassa22: before git we used 'final_final_final_version.c'

[3:31:52] McFlannel: still hate bredding them
[3:31:53] Stormflare: why is it so OP?
[3:31:55] weightmaker: you need one chicken on a hopper to get passive eggs.
[3:31:57] Pe4enie: it's not very different from bee mods, is it?
[3:31:59] waterlimon: df tutorial: 1. Move cam 2. Diggy hole 3. ??? 4. Profit

[3:32:23] MrHashbrowns: thats how i did it in SB2
[3:32:23] bcdmonkey: Cows were worse IMO
[3:32:24] lantskip: @dogma808_marqueezus that doesn't make any sense. if you've worked on DF for 20 years, why are you still in schoool?
[3:32:28] Cristi__: And they can stack
[3:32:30] Wibit: LUL
[3:32:34] Vickens: 8 iron chickens make like 48 iron every few sec, so crazy
[3:32:35] Pe4enie: aww, they kiss

[3:32:42] nathy_rl: yes
[3:32:44] TuxLafitte: The Chickens mod is crazy...
[3:32:44] lantskip: @dogma808_marqueezus why not?
[3:32:44] jobo256: Stacks of 16, doesnt need food to shit items, only thing is you need seeds for breeding
[3:32:45] RighteousBru: yes
[3:32:47] MrHashbrowns: you have to breed
[3:32:50] TuxLafitte: and OP.
[3:32:55] dogma802: @lantskip I'm not a good enough programmer yet
[3:32:57] DeZyzz: Does SB3 have Bonsai Trees?
[3:32:59] Apparentthreat: catJAMkiss they're
[3:33:01] officialzip: must be why loot bees give eggs
[3:33:03] Cristi__: They can stack up to 16 i think
[3:33:03] Gh3ttoboy: only basic chickens are craftable the higher grades are breeds
[3:33:05] maccabeus: moon2PREGARIO time to make the babies
[3:33:06] thebodge: make it far away form your base... I don't want to listen to chickens all day
[3:33:07] TritonXXXG: theres no way this can be good for performance
[3:33:08] Allmostdone: a 10/10/10 chicken. That sounds funny
[3:33:10] lantskip: @dogma808_marqueezus "yet"... but you could be. I think you are the future Bill Gates
[3:33:21] hotdog_bun_water: I just come back first thing I here is "we have to breed"
[3:33:27] HiroOfTime: do better chicken stats improve breed percent?
[3:33:30] Apparentthreat: it's like productive bees, but chickens
[3:33:31] drissical: roost has an inventory
[3:33:37] Vickens: in breeder u make new chickens
[3:33:38] Wibit: Selective breeding
[3:33:44] jobo256: Roost gives items yeah
[3:33:45] RighteousBru: chicken stats go up and down as you breed them
[3:33:50] Dizz1227: the Hen House is used if you use the chickens in world I believe
[3:33:54] LidlFrog: PauseChamp
[3:33:55] macdrai: When a daddy chicken and a mommy chicken love eachother very much....
[3:34:03] Apparentthreat: does the flint one just get a flint chicken?
[3:34:03] ImposterArchitect: Man, AE2 already
[3:34:04] That0neGeye: once they are made they are like mystical ag plants
[3:34:07] FauxNoodel: you can build an automated way to get to 10/10/10, takes a bit of time for each chicken
[3:34:07] Noraemsu: Soon pizza time peepoFat
[3:34:08] CoolFroggy: YEP
[3:34:09] TuxLafitte: In my Skyblock that is how it worked, I had hoppers drop to chests, which then were pipped to storage.
[3:34:13] praxiz: A friend of mine has a small chicken coop in her back yard and can talk for hours about them. How they have personalities, how they treat each other, etc. etc.
[3:34:17] Twin5un: huh ?
[3:34:18] LokiRulez: breed them to get better stats or chickens, put in roost to produce resouces, use pipe or henhouse to collect them into a sing
[3:34:19] weightmaker: waffle! make one chicken and place on hopper to get passive normal eggs. you will need more than 6 eggs!
[3:34:22] jobo256: You should make 2 flint chickens so they can breed
[3:34:24] DemonicHell3: This is turning into cluckin madness
[3:34:25] Faccer: small cog YEP
[3:34:29] drissical: I just piped up the roosts
[3:34:39] Twin5un: praxiz lol mine are just dumb hahaha
[3:34:48] i_am_davis: you'll need the chicken stick as well

[3:35:06] MishkaYumYum: chickens are boring af
[3:35:11] Scojan: Have you ever watched chickens lay eggs? Its kind of cool
[3:35:14] TuxLafitte: Chickens are OP once you get them going.... they supplied everything I needed in Skyblock
[3:35:16] Scojan: I'm not weird btw
[3:35:19] Wakarana: Chris! is that a weed?!
[3:35:24] LokiRulez: you need to breed them to get better stats
[3:35:26] CoolReal: How do you get eggs chat?
[3:35:27] bravestar0: kaitiacFlex2 kaitiacChicken kaitiacFlex
[3:35:28] Slymph: @Scojan ඞ
[3:35:29] macdrai: it's like bees but with chicken?
[3:35:32] Mikto1000: Chickens are the bees of the ground
[3:35:33] Noraemsu: Chickens get you like 48 of a resource every 2 seconds
[3:35:33] Immp: If you make 2 of the same chicken, put them both in a breeder, you can make a "better" chicken. Rinse and repeat putting better chickens in to breed to get 10/10/10
[3:35:35] Noraemsu: It's insane
[3:35:35] Wibit: Chickens are boring to watch but fun to mess with genetics
[3:35:38] Salerodis: I have never been a HUGE fan of the chickens, but I didn't use it from start to finish
[3:35:41] hydrogor: Rocket Lab is catching their booster today?
[3:35:52] sogerr: @hydrogor yes
[3:35:53] Pe4enie: @hydrogor trying to*
[3:35:56] lazyhot: the 10/10/10 process is long but once achieved it is awsome imho
[3:36:01] hydrogor: Hell yeah
[3:36:07] unknownshand: chicken farms are broken, they are so op. you need to breed 2 of the same kind of chicken to improve the stats up to 15 15 15. then once you have it you throw it in the roost thing and it makes mats
[3:36:07] praxiz: @Twin5un : to be fair she does have a very active imagination (she writes and draws childrens books)
[3:36:36] unknownshand: it might be 10s i cant remember if its 15 or 10
[3:36:39] Twin5un: praxiz that's cute !
[3:36:42] Noraemsu: 10s is max
[3:36:44] jobo256: @unknownshand Yeah its 10
[3:36:45] unknownshand: hay
[3:36:46] LokiRulez: seeds
[3:36:47] Wakarana: seeds
[3:36:48] weightmaker: seeds
[3:36:49] Zoinx: seeds
[3:36:53] unknownshand: seeds rather

[3:36:57] Tutpix: seeds
[3:37:01] Immp: and its 10/10/10
[3:37:06] yoGlitch: hey hey people, seeds here?
[3:37:11] CoolReal: How do you get eggs chat?
[3:37:12] unknownshand: eats the seeds
[3:37:13] Dizz1227: no
[3:37:17] LokiRulez: youll need a few stakes to get max stacks
[3:37:23] Basetens: when a girl chicken, and a boy chicken...
[3:37:23] Kilowatt31: haha the curtain closes
[3:37:23] LokiRulez: stacks*
[3:37:24] TigerLuv: stop watching them
[3:37:29] pupupuputter: you need the temperal bag
[3:37:32] unknownshand: thats a progress bar not a % of seuccess
[3:37:38] stormzwest: chichen porn KEKW
[3:37:42] Noraemsu: Stare Chicken do the thing
[3:37:42] Mr_Warsta: Hey, new Primitive Technology vid has dropped, have you guys watched it already?
[3:37:42] Jaroldo3: IS this NSFW, watching chickens breed
[3:37:44] banutzul: perv
[3:37:54] Dizz1227: Also, I belive each roost can hold 16 chickens in a stack assuming they have the stame stats
[3:37:59] jobo256: Wow LUL
[3:37:59] Slymph: popCat
[3:38:01] awesomefreak72: stop watching u perv
[3:38:02] Bleu_Forge: PogBones
[3:38:09] pupupuputter: temperal bag speeds things up
[3:38:09] Immp: That Streamer luck
[3:38:14] Stormflare: i see why this is OP
[3:38:16] OMICRON: dice predicted
[3:38:21] Pe4enie: 10 10 10 NotLikeThis
[3:38:22] Burshaz: pocket time?
[3:38:23] Zoinx: temporal
[3:38:23] TigerLuv: the little curtain :D
[3:38:23] Stormflare: temporal
[3:38:26] TheResinger: temporal
[3:38:27] praxiz: If I had paid attention in school i would have been able to calculate how many breeding sessions you need to ensure a 90% chance of success
[3:38:28] RighteousBru: temporal not temperal
[3:38:30] Noraemsu: Just got my 16, 10s netherite chicksn
[3:38:32] Thardox: So chickens are the new bees?
[3:38:32] Venxuri: yes, its time in a bottle
[3:38:32] brenner1265: Bottle of time?
[3:38:34] FauxNoodel: @Giantwaffle you want to keep swapping out the lower level breeding chicken with the highest level one
[3:38:35] Immp: Its basically time in a bottle
[3:38:39] MrMoneybagMan: time in a bottle
[3:38:39] WaffleToesZA: tempura prawn
[3:38:39] Pe4enie: it's a time in a bottle
[3:38:41] BoulderInDisguise: they stack to speed up the time too
[3:38:47] GalaxyMonkeyy: its time in a bottle
[3:38:53] Stormflare: chicken inbreeding
[3:38:56] Switcharoo: Chickens are the new bees without the headache?
[3:38:57] DimensionalShadow: Oh we 10/10/10 again?
[3:38:58] Allmostdone: put you chicken in a bag... that sound cruel
[3:38:59] felipe2p2: there was a mod that did this but with seeds, cant remember the name
[3:39:01] unknownshand: stack the 1 1 1 and itll go faster
[3:39:01] pupupuputter: im from ohio pardon my anglish Kappa
[3:39:05] HammerssC: can you let the chickens free?
[3:39:07] Dizz1227: you can stack the chickens of the same stack to speed them up
[3:39:07] alek_199: thoughts on Stoneblock 3 so far?
[3:39:07] HitscanSedan: so this is basically factorio right
[3:39:07] LuhHertz: is factorio or satisfactory better. i really like the idea of both of them
[3:39:13] drissical: This is project ozone seed flash backs all over again.
[3:39:13] CoolFroggy: 10/10/10 is this mystical agriculture but with chickens
[3:39:22] Noraemsu: No crossbreading
[3:39:22] jobo256: This is going to be fun to watch. I just finished making 10/10/10 chickens yesterday
[3:39:23] ilaj_vynneve: probably 2 iron chickens
[3:39:23] pupupuputter: iron and iron
[3:39:24] unknownshand: 2 iron chickens togetherr will just make iron chickens with better stats
[3:39:25] FauxNoodel: @Giantwaffle there is a way with switches/hoppers to automate the swapping of the lower chickens with the higher ones
[3:39:29] weightmaker: if they cant breed, you get 50% to get each chicken
[3:39:30] LokiRulez: in SB2, i 10/10/10 every chicken, took me like a month lol
[3:39:32] panda_boots1: You can stack chickens
[3:39:39] Noraemsu: YEP
[3:39:40] Immp: Stack the flint
[3:39:50] thebodge: yeah the breeding is like magical crops
[3:39:58] jobo256: The flint chickens dont stack because one was crafted and one was bred
[3:39:59] Watertoad: one has emc
[3:40:01] jinkleft: is it different stats?
[3:40:01] nathy_rl: i luckily got the temporal pouch from the first reward in quests
[3:40:03] LurkerNr5: one has EMC value LUL
[3:40:10] weightmaker: bred chickens dont have emc
[3:40:19] Watertoad: one of them is a robot NODDERS
[3:40:19] jmm548: makes sense
[3:40:21] TheOneFromAuir: If the chickens are 10 10 10 you can have a stack of 16 and they will produce faster
[3:40:25] 0sem0: can you do emc already?
[3:40:28] TheResinger: its probably so you cant duplicate 10/10/10 chickens
[3:40:32] alek_199: @Giantwaffle thoughts on stoneblock 3 so far? Is it good
[3:40:42] chewwbakaaaa: we had a server with my friends and we had so many chuickens our server was unplayable lol
[3:40:56] Gh3ttoboy: just craft wheat in seeds
[3:40:59] Kavokane: Twerk
[3:41:01] weightmaker: 1 wheat = 1 seed in normal craftin grid
[3:41:09] Venxuri: when Josh is your friend Kappa
[3:41:15] NoSkillNeededT_T: to ur right u have mor seeds
[3:41:22] nathy_rl: 16 max
[3:41:23] Arimil: yes
[3:41:24] icprincess: @Giantwaffle is there a seed chicken? lol
[3:41:25] mrtraxx: 16 max
[3:41:26] FauxNoodel: yeah you can stack 16
[3:41:26] brightcandle: It takes a lot of time to get a full set of them but it gets insane
[3:41:27] unknownshand: yeah it goes faster
[3:41:29] MrMoneybagMan: yes
[3:41:29] smiley1985__: It goes alot faster
[3:41:32] LokiRulez: you can put up to 15 and it goes faster
[3:41:34] jobo256: Chickens can stack up to  16 with the same stats
[3:41:47] Switcharoo: Sev at one time tried to see how many chickens he could get in a 3x3 area
[3:41:49] Stormflare: they have to have the same stats to stack
[3:41:52] Noraemsu: YEP 󠀀
[3:41:55] Watertoad: they drop like 48 yeah
[3:42:02] MrMoneybagMan: Chickens = OP
[3:42:02] nathy_rl: i have coal chickens running my whole RF system haha
[3:42:03] Watertoad: and tis like instant
[3:42:03] CarriedNeko: does this modpacj have some form of deep storage?
[3:42:05] thebodge: make iron block floors
[3:42:06] Noraemsu: I have 875k iron atm just from chickens
[3:42:06] mrtraxx: Chicken does take a long time. but are OP
[3:42:08] Stormflare: make your entire base iron
[3:42:09] Greedyro: You never have enough iron
[3:42:11] TuxLafitte: Yeah... my diamond chickens were making crazy amounts of diamonds...
[3:42:17] unknownshand: all you do to make this process easier is you just use a flat mover and move the new chickens into a new breeder and just repeat it like with 10 breeders in a row
[3:42:23] chocolatemilklg: I did chickens in stone block 1 and it was busted
[3:42:26] jmm548: bone meal grass ?
[3:42:28] thebodge: turn your base into iron blocks
[3:42:28] weightmaker: crook grass for flowers
[3:42:28] unknownshand: throw the base eggs in and walk away after stocking all the breeders
[3:42:30] jmm548: fro floowers
[3:42:30] Stillglade: you had beetroot seed
[3:42:30] brightcandle: chicken breeding is going to want a lot of seeds!
[3:42:31] jobo256: You can make a netherite chicken too LUL It can be OP

[3:52:38] unknownshand: if you set it up properly you can put like 10 breeders in a row with a mover between them and put 2 base chickens in add 4 seed to each breeder and then walk away and itll just poop out a 10 10 10 at the end
[3:52:41] ilaj_vynneve: I feel like the chicken mod would be more balanced if you actually had to breed the chickens without the breeder
[3:52:43] Scojan: But you could have 48 each Kappa

[3:53:33] 0sem0: it pops two maybe?
[3:53:35] punkgeek: I thought it was the same speed but automatically starts the breeding cycle again
[3:53:40] unknownshand: although if you have 10 10 10 you should split them and only breed 10 10 10
[3:53:41] awesomefreak72: thats orgy ma men

[3:53:58] NightsAngels: you can do more than 2 per slot i think
[3:54:09] Raggsokks: its is a clock or somthing to breed the chicken faster ? its was that some time
[3:54:16] bEC69_: is this mod puck on curse launcher or some other?
[3:54:17] Aomtte: No, the speed depend on the slot with the less chicken

[4:19:55] Nexhunter: they just launch in NZ chat RocketLab is an american company
[4:20:06] SassyPants: @Obliviron do you need help? did someone kidnap you?
[4:20:17] fixterjake14: Yeah, funny government moment, they had to get FAA approval for this launch in NZ
[4:20:18] Allmostdone: is the whole rocket 3d printed?
[4:20:24] TritonXXXG: publicly traded. last chance to invest before the catch KEKW
[4:20:27] Obliviron: @SassyPants yeah i need some coffee to wake up from the endless rocket vods LuL
[4:20:30] Delaxo1: earth is not flat!!!
[4:20:35] mewmewmews: it's flat :)
[4:20:37] DarkSpooon: A pumpkin!
[4:20:46] twopapernotes: pepeSmoke
[4:20:47] DX_Plates: @TritonXXXG I just scooped up more the other day
[4:20:49] Nilau: I love that accent
[4:20:49] CoolFroggy: Fake KKona
[4:20:52] Pixelmain: @Delaxo1 I dont trust you
[4:20:52] elgallochode: its curved
[4:20:54] BurnedSteak: Rocket launches in the wrong direction on the under side of the planet Kappa
[4:20:57] elgallochode: jeez
[4:20:57] Sanduckchan: fingerprints?
[4:20:57] Delaxo1: lol
[4:20:59] Lemon__peel: I dunno man that earth is looking pretty flat to me peepoHmm
[4:21:00] Zrayy: @Delaxo1 That's just the lens distortion
[4:21:02] SassyPants: @Obliviron make a pour over by the time you are finished the stream will be done
[4:21:06] TritonXXXG: @dx_plates is a bargain price. wish I had some cash to scoop too
[4:21:10] slyjedi: humans are nutty.  How bout we scoop it up with a heli? lol
[4:21:16] IlsaGold: They have decided to move the Gävlebocken to outer space
[4:21:19] Sanduckchan: thanks for confirming :D
[4:21:26] Vittozz: rOUND EARTH?
[4:21:28] Obliviron: @SassyPants is it really that quick lol thank god
[4:21:32] elgallochode: ohoh someone getting fired
[4:21:38] Nexhunter: if they didn't clean room that shit first NASA not gonna be happy with them KEKW
[4:21:40] Allmostdone: fingerprints?
[4:21:41] elgallochode: fingerprints hahhahaa
[4:21:42] xavier2119: i could listen to this girl talk all day
[4:21:47] Swippen: @Vittozz Only the gopro camera making it look round.
[4:21:47] Kavokane: Beautiful round flat earth
[4:21:50] CoolFroggy: You can clearly see that the round is flat here
[4:21:51] Valanze80: Space is insane. Its so big. I have been doing a lot of reading and there are suns/stars billons of times larger than the sun. Think about that. How much space is there that yoh have things billions of times larger.
[4:21:58] TritonXXXG: good air resistance from flipping
[4:21:59] Rippan: it has RCS, so it should be able to line itself up on reentry
[4:22:01] mechoriet: they have cold gas trustors
[4:22:03] FenixTheSnolx: I think it's just repositioning for reentry
[4:22:03] trabadam: COGGERS
[4:22:09] Tiggaboo: flatest earth ive ever seen
[4:22:09] natsu130: the it drop to someone house OMEGALUL
[4:22:12] bismarcksd: trajectory is waffles head
[4:22:14] CocidiousMcBeth: should fall with angle of highest resistance down
[4:22:18] SassyPants: @Tiggaboo i was waiting for this
[4:22:19] Lemon__peel: That camera view is gorgeous
[4:22:20] Nexhunter: @natsu130 over ocean
[4:22:20] weightmaker: they are aiming for north-korea's missile
[4:22:21] WarpOs: look, mouse points getting out, its 3d fake render Kappa
[4:22:23] elgallochode: its almost reentry
[4:22:25] CrystalSmack: is it breaking?
[4:22:31] thenaylander: all the crap coming off that thing...
[4:22:32] LidlFrog: PauseChamp
[4:22:33] Nexhunter: so a fish's house yep NODDERS @natsu130
[4:22:34] DX_Plates: @Valanze80 Only a fraction of a percentage of "space" has stuff in it
[4:22:34] laidher: is that space trash?
[4:22:38] natsu130: @Nexhunter mistakes can be made
[4:22:39] waterlimon: noo its all mice
[4:22:44] Driitzz: look at all the space debris
[4:22:44] HyperGainZ: facecam is in the way
[4:22:48] Lemon__peel: @waterlimon ratJAM
[4:22:50] Swippen: The small rounding of earth is just the gopro lens making it look round
[4:22:51] CrystalSmack: aaaaah
[4:22:53] Johnhugem: it still blow my mind how we are watching a video from so far away
[4:22:57] Nexhunter: @danbilater the upper stage will be for a bit until it returns the first stage will be ocean trash if they miss
[4:22:58] Allmostdone: space is full of stuff. We just can't detect it
[4:22:59] blastfamus: must be plenty of air for the ice to fall away like that
[4:23:00] praxiz: look at that perfectly flat horizon guys
[4:23:03] Meeffas: !modpack
[4:23:03] Moobot: Try one of these: !mc_modpack ー !factorio ー !bestmod ー !ksp ー !rimworld
[4:23:14] Zuiuzz: @praxiz flat earth confirmed?
[4:23:18] KanickKanack: hmm why no curve in horizon?
[4:23:36] weightmaker: speed is at top-rioght?
[4:23:36] Moobot: You can sub to Waffle by clicking this neat link -> twitch.tv/giantwaffle/subscribe SUBprise
[4:23:38] TogglesLore: Top right?
[4:23:39] Driitzz: flat earther Pepega
[4:23:44] Kavokane: 'Hot and nominal' my collage nickname
[4:23:47] Valanze80: @DX_Plates Which is insane to me. Its soo big with so much just nothing much in between. I had no idea it was like that.
[4:23:51] nxusr: random chunks of stuff flying past
[4:23:54] Obliviron: rocket needs more juice FeelsGoodMan
[4:23:55] praxiz: lol, because you're essentially about less than a fraction of a millimeter above a basketball, @KanickKanack
[4:24:00] havanacouplebeers: some people have no clue how big the earth is
[4:24:04] TritonXXXG: Prayge
[4:24:11] Korrdz_: your cool
[4:24:21] officialhunterx: how hot is that orange bit
[4:24:22] Nexhunter: he just likes the accent Kpapa
[4:24:22] SassyPants: I like the aussie accent
[4:24:23] Nexhunter: Kappa
[4:24:23] natsu130: soo is the earth flat or what? NOTED
[4:24:25] KanickKanack: @praxiz ok sure dude ;) looks a little higher than millimeter XD
[4:24:28] Watertoad: i dont see no curve KKona

[4:24:33] mechoriet: @nxusr probbly boil off of some tank
[4:24:37] PliusInfo: Clap
[4:24:37] Tech: Bruh, why they using a fish eye lens to make the earth look round
[4:24:39] Sir_Darkstar: She has a cute voice too
[4:24:40] Lemon__peel: Last time i saw greg was the super heavy landing right
[4:24:45] MyFutureBoyfriend: What types of batteries do they use? I assume it has to be something lighter than li-ion
[4:24:46] JiMiNaToR_: Greg got a gf Kappa
[4:24:46] praxiz: @KanickKanack : well the earth is a little bit bigger than a basketball as well
[4:24:52] TritonXXXG: @tech PepeLa
[4:24:54] Nexhunter: @MyFutureBoyfriend nah shit is heavy KEKW
[4:24:55] Jamswhat2: @Tech KKona Clap
[4:25:00] DarkSpooon: Car batteries from O'Reilly
[4:25:01] Smithii: AAA batteries Kappa
[4:25:02] GoodOldXijan: why is a swap even needed? cant u just have all on the line?
[4:25:02] Rubinix: Hey waffle, do you have a position in Rocket Lab?
[4:25:04] mechoriet: they probbly use caps for inbetween swap
[4:25:08] gingerrsss: bunch of triple a's
[4:25:09] MyFutureBoyfriend: 18650
[4:25:11] usernameNull: just yeeting batteries into space?
[4:25:11] KanickKanack: @praxiz so bad example by you then XD so dumb how people still claim globe theory
[4:25:17] Tech: I can't believe there are serious flat earthers
[4:25:20] Basetens: you just have an astronaut go and change those for you
[4:25:21] Imperial_Kappa: its flat KKona and i can see the dome
[4:25:22] SassyPants: @Smithii that "big" for you?
[4:25:29] ninopanda: @Tech right?!
[4:25:31] mechoriet: they said there will be camera's on heli but connectivity meh
[4:25:34] Obliviron: @Tech shut up globe earther. Go run in a circle or something
[4:25:34] BurnedSteak: Helicopter should just equip a starlink dish
[4:25:35] qSwiftY: @Tech me :)
[4:25:36] Nexhunter: oh yea chat so the SLS launch for november is like at midnight eastern
[4:25:38] Nexhunter: sooooooo
[4:25:39] fixterjake14: Yeah super delayed
[4:25:40] praxiz: @KanickKanack : i could explain it but I don't have my crayons with me, sorry.
[4:25:40] BurnedSteak: Perfect connection
[4:25:41] fabojantan: bye bye space junk
[4:25:43] AIex_0: yeah she said its behind
[4:25:46] nxusr: yep they said the cameras are delayed
[4:25:47] FenixTheSnolx: Wow that is an insane delay lol
[4:25:47] TogglesLore: Delayed def
[4:25:51] TritonXXXG: prob video delay
[4:25:59] ilaj_vynneve: pretty tho
[4:25:59] SassyPants: na just bad CGI... /S
[4:26:01] Watertoad: i think its a reflection
[4:26:03] KanickKanack: @praxiz no worries, that's the excuse I hear a lot from "scientists"
[4:26:06] Nuuf: its space dust Kappa
[4:26:07] Obliviron: when is this rocket video gonna end lol
[4:26:09] Chronoes: @Nexhunter so something nice to enjoy with a morning coffee in EU? Kappa
[4:26:10] mechoriet: thats the heli Pepega
[4:26:11] FenixTheSnolx: That's heli cam
[4:26:14] Nexhunter: @Chronoes yes KEKW
[4:26:18] ChrisHimself: it's the heli cam @Giantwaffle
[4:26:26] Rippan: isnt that from the heli watching the hook
[4:26:28] LidlFrog: monkaHmm
[4:26:30] thisisitbruv_kris: ey yo, I just started stoneblock 3. kinda overwhelming. What the hell is REI? My quest says: "Using crook on dirt has a chance of dropping any of these items. You can see the chances for each in REI"
[4:26:38] SassyPants: water not sky
[4:26:38] mechoriet: "small"
[4:26:38] trabadam: so helli is catching the shoot ?
[4:26:38] thisisitbruv_kris: REI monkaHmm
[4:26:39] Tech: Yes
[4:26:46] Kavokane: Can't hide failures in the clouds this time
[4:26:51] Koeckie: this pilot got some balls, that's crazy D:
[4:26:57] natsu130: bets someone? NOTED
[4:26:57] Tech: And it uses the wing since it's more predictable
[4:26:58] Dagmoo: PogChamp perfect time to get out of meeting
[4:27:02] FenixTheSnolx: No it uses a round chute with a hole in it
[4:27:05] Korrdz_: damn that thing is movin 28.6k
[4:27:05] fixterjake14: Catch isn't even scheduled for another 6 ish minutes
[4:27:10] ScarceLoot: that pilot is getting big bucks
[4:27:10] Lemon__peel: Yeah this pilot gets paid well KEKW
[4:27:14] mechoriet: pepeLaugh it does
[4:27:17] mechoriet: they changed it
[4:27:21] CorSPACE: i think they used round chutes for testing
[4:27:25] Rippan: it does, they already catched it once but had to drop the rocket
[4:27:26] 0x4273: Pepega
[4:27:30] fixterjake14: Over a year ago now I believe
[4:27:31] Nexhunter: they should just use a fulton balloon and use a C47 NODDERS
[4:27:31] Allmostdone: why not shoot a guy from a cannon. He could grab the item and guide it down. Kappa
[4:27:35] CocidiousMcBeth: seen this used to grab stuff from the ground, never seen it used to grab something falling :D
[4:27:37] Delta134: maybe you mixed up the spacex fairing
[4:27:38] 0x4273: PauseChamp
[4:27:39] FenixTheSnolx: They changed like a couple years ago
[4:27:40] Quadzer0: @Lemon__peel - probably a big bonus for every success
[4:27:46] lofffff: PauseChamp
[4:27:47] CATPOOPslurper: i couldn't even spread butter on my muffin correctly this morning and these people are doing this stuff goldyDone
[4:27:48] Punistick: PauseChamp
[4:27:53] MrMoneybagMan: PauseChamp
[4:27:59] Basetens: what is the catch window like? how fast is it falling when they try?
[4:28:00] Kandarjr: Hell off a heli pilot must be this one
[4:28:01] LidlFrog: PauseChamp
[4:28:02] TritonXXXG: YEP time
[4:28:03] schpelt: A helicopter. Catching a falling object. ..
[4:28:03] GamerGoldy: @CATPOOPslurper he probably missed his muffin too :D
[4:28:05] mechoriet: PauseChamp we can replay the first test and confirm it
[4:28:08] Nuuf: pepeLaugh gonna miss the catch
[4:28:11] FenixTheSnolx: Last one had a round chute too
[4:28:14] mechoriet: after :)
[4:28:17] Quadzer0: Gamba?
[4:28:17] fixterjake14: The last one was a circular chute
[4:28:19] eucoco: this seems overly complicated
[4:28:27] eucoco: to catch a rocker mid air with a helicopter
[4:28:29] CATPOOPslurper: @GamerGoldy it takes some coordination for sure LUL
[4:28:30] WindWalkR: Prediction?
[4:28:31] Frag_Magnet_: @eucoco And risky
[4:28:36] Speedglass: hanging loogey
[4:28:37] Dagmoo: what was the failure last time again chat?
[4:28:38] Pkill13: am i about to watch a death
[4:28:41] Chronoes: @eucoco less complicated than making a powered landing
[4:28:43] Zoinx: land it KEKW
[4:28:43] GFQPR1882: Sounds easy I don’t know what she’s talking about
[4:28:44] SassyPants: I vote yes
[4:28:44] mechoriet: 5Head just land it
[4:28:44] ScarceLoot: the name of the rocket makes a lot of sense now
[4:28:45] DX_Plates: Rocket Science... Complicated? nah
[4:28:46] Nexhunter: it not that complicated it a fulton recovery method
[4:28:46] Deepcast: here FISHY FISHY
[4:28:47] GFQPR1882: KEKW
[4:28:48] bcdmonkey: Not waffleNote
[4:28:48] custus: teleport it
[4:28:48] Apparentthreat: hands
[4:28:48] MyFutureBoyfriend: I vote we leave the batteries in the ocean. I left some space near my car batteries.
[4:28:48] tzunki29: just pick it up with the ship like the back up plan
[4:28:49] TogglesLore: With my hands obv
[4:28:49] CoolFroggy: Just catch it
[4:28:50] Speedglass: bubblegum on a string
[4:28:50] word_of_the_day: a giant catcher's mitt from acme
[4:28:51] BoulderInDisguise: big hand
[4:28:51] Lemon__peel: Complicated but is it any more complicated than refurbing the rocket that's been dunked in the oceon
[4:28:51] gregcee: Just make it land on its own like SpaceX... Big brain
[4:28:51] Watertoad: magic KKona
[4:28:51] tomc1k: bouncy house
[4:28:52] HyperGainZ: just land it Kappa
[4:28:52] DarkSpooon: A net
[4:28:53] BurnedSteak: Chopsticks 5Head
[4:28:54] ChrisHimself: just suicide burn it
[4:28:54] wondox: have superman catch it
[4:28:54] Rippan: With what fuel LUL
[4:28:55] Neffets1212: something like a net maybe?
[4:28:58] Stragmol: light the fuse and run and use a trampoline
[4:28:58] m1ntyb0iz: just dunk it
[4:28:59] 112nuno112: giant pillows
[4:29:01] jinkleft: Catch it with magnets
[4:29:01] BeagleCypher: Let it crash on cruel earth
[4:29:02] Sandiro1: a giant net 5Head
[4:29:02] KanickKanack: spread net in ocean
[4:29:02] ninopanda: air bags
[4:29:04] SeriousPotatoBot: Massive trampoline 5Head
[4:29:05] LoadedBurrito420: have it fall on a trampoline and have it bounce til it loses momentum
[4:29:05] Sir_Darkstar: This is close to Fulton but 10x harder
[4:29:05] Nexhunter: chat it literally a fulton recovery just instead of a person on the ground it a rocket in the air
[4:29:05] Zrayy: How is the helicopter flying so high, that's insane
[4:29:07] Houdini_Seven: Large Catcher's mit @Giantwaffle
[4:29:07] m1ntyb0iz: dunk it bro
[4:29:07] gingerrsss: just land it in water with floaties
[4:29:08] laidher: catch it with your hands 5Head
[4:29:08] ausHenry: neither was falcon 9
[4:29:09] Mannyy06: catch with my hands 5Head
[4:29:09] DX_Plates: Yes it has, A guy designed a model rocket to self land. LUL
[4:29:10] Rippan: Bouncy house?
[4:29:11] mechoriet: pepeLaugh but will be for there stock
[4:29:12] Speedglass: i would prefer a butterly net
[4:29:12] CorSPACE: propulsive landing would be pointless for electrons size
[4:29:13] TopT3k: Git it out the water with a boat
[4:29:13] Pkill13: isnt the center of gravity too high or too low for the rocket to land
[4:29:13] Talon_Jasra: Joe Barnard has entered chat
[4:29:13] elgallochode: GIANT PILLOWS LMAO
[4:29:14] waterlimon: Just include helicopter blades on the booster
[4:29:15] FlammAlpha: 4Head just land it bro
[4:29:16] CATPOOPslurper: just reload your save if you fuck up EZ
[4:29:17] nxusr: this puts the complexity in places that _aren't_ the rocket, so it's overall better
[4:29:18] cbcktt: RKLB to to the moon!
[4:29:20] fixterjake14: It is so much easier to land big rockets, small rockets have way smaller fuel margins, so really not feasible to do propsulsive landings
[4:29:22] LidlFrog: same skill level as the crane games NODDERS
[4:29:22] Tech: Smaller rocket falls victim to the cube square law Chat
[4:29:24] praxiz: @KanickKanack : wait, you think I'm a scientist, because I hold the outlandish belief that the earth is flat?
[4:29:24] TritonXXXG: people used to think the spacex and blue origin landings were impossible
[4:29:26] mechoriet: @cBcKtt COPIUM
[4:29:30] Allmostdone: why not make a water proof ballon that would surround the item?
[4:29:32] MrMoneybagMan: what r we even looking at
[4:29:34] Lemon__peel: Would be cool if they had a second camera to look at the rocket as it comes down
[4:29:40] Speedglass: is that the ocean
[4:29:47] vordican: helicopter capture is very complex.  it should suicide burn right before hitting the water and then get recovered
[4:29:50] HyperGainZ: @Tech, Laws are mad to break pepeLaugh
[4:29:50] JiMiNaToR_: drones with attached nest would be better
[4:29:54] bismarcksd: how much does the body weigh?
[4:29:58] KanickKanack: @praxiz bro just drop it, my evidence i literally on stream and you can't provide to me a lick of proof, gj scientist
[4:29:59] Nexhunter: @TritonXXXG except for no they were just not feasible with the costs of the tech in the 90s the first landing was in the 90s by a company that went under financially KEKW
[4:30:02] Watertoad: i think it burnt up
[4:30:02] gregcee: Do we know the size comparison of this rocket and Falcon 9?
[4:30:06] kenshin2666: helicopter catching a parachute? monkaS
[4:30:07] jmm548: i want a hook view LUL
[4:30:08] m1ntyb0iz: they don't have that because the rocket isn't real
[4:30:09] StePorz: is the helicopter going to feel like some turbulence when it catches that heavy rocket ?
[4:30:10] eucoco: i would wrap the rocket in a giant condom so it would be waterproof and so i could hit the water no need to catch @Giantwaffle
[4:30:12] Not_a_Machine: Or a second helicopter view
[4:30:13] mechoriet: 😡 they need a starlink on that heli YEP
[4:30:17] SassyPants: 5 years ago... first rocket recovery.. today "why do you think it's so complicated?" JuSt lAnD iT111
[4:30:18] Orin_The_Sly: I want to see from the Hooks view KEKW
[4:30:21] FenixTheSnolx: I hope they release some views after they recover it
[4:30:22] Sir_Darkstar: Imagine being the guy that had to operate the hook.
[4:30:29] havanacouplebeers: I wonder how big that helicopter is?
[4:30:30] x_Deathscythe: @jmm548 The motion sickness of a camera on the hook would be crazy
[4:30:35] jmm548: LUL
[4:30:39] Tabakhase: @StePorz thats why they dropped the last one iirc
[4:30:40] echo55_: Oh I figured it would weigh more than that
[4:30:41] Tech: Heli Carriers are insane
[4:30:42] Speedglass: if you slowed the accent and decent you wouldnt need so much ceramic plating
[4:30:44] IlsaGold: The bend on the line is actually a due to drag from the end of the line. Guess they have a drouge there
[4:30:46] vordican: wut
[4:30:49] DX_Plates: "Self Landing" small rocket: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SH3lR2GLgT0
[4:30:50] JohnnyJ2008: where are they flying rn?
[4:30:51] Zakodiac: exposure
[4:30:51] Lemon__peel: all the money
[4:30:51] MyFutureBoyfriend: $15/hr
[4:30:54] Obliviron: not enough
[4:30:54] tomc1k: 50k a filight
[4:30:59] havanacouplebeers: hopefully a lot...
[4:31:00] TritonXXXG: I'm amazed its not automated or remote piloted
[4:31:00] slyjedi: please signs these forms
[4:31:00] Zakodiac: @Giantwaffle exposure only
[4:31:04] fixterjake14: They may have eyes on it, looks the the helicopter is turning a lot
[4:31:05] CocidiousMcBeth: would think if they can get this to work, in time we will see them develop programs to make this much easyier
[4:31:07] Dagmoo: we watched the video NODDERS
[4:31:07] Allmostdone: it weights a ton? Damn
[4:31:08] ShadowBlade72: They likely have to take into account kinetic load vs static load. A 1T rocket falling is going to have a greater initial kinetic load right?

[4:42:44] mechoriet: Sadge man I could play a modpack but solo is boring as hell
[4:42:52] justin_triII: Just wait till Vine takes over TikTok, then we're gonna hear the libs talking bad about Vine.
[4:43:02] Wibit: time to trash some chickens
[4:43:04] justin_triII: @mechoriet Facts!
[4:43:05] Apparentthreat: i've got 2 more names on the BOP list. watch out chat
[4:43:07] ninopanda: @Invalidm_ KEKW good luck with that. i have stuff to actually build today
[4:43:17] Invalidm_: Sadge actual work
[4:43:19] SeriousPotatoBot: chat is being EXTRA Pepega today it seems
[4:43:21] LidlFrog: monkaCozy
[4:43:23] Speedglass: elon is hard at work trying to monetise twitter into a machine that milks pennies from its users
[4:43:35] elgallochode: lmao
[4:43:35] mechoriet: @SeriousPotatoBot YEP twitter invaded waffle's chat KEKW
[4:43:41] elgallochode: instead of making the users money
[4:43:42] zynithtv: need upgrade
[4:43:42] justin_triII: @Speedglass So is every other platform? Google, YouTube, Twitch???
[4:43:46] TogglesLore: 1 at a time
[4:43:48] GamerGoldy: dsaL
[4:43:48] officialzip: you need a card to set to round robin
[4:43:49] Dizz1227: Did you set it to round robin?
[4:43:50] ninopanda: @Apparentthreat only 2?  i stopped making the list at 1 page KEKW
[4:43:50] IlsaGold: Cant we put a coal chicken on the line?
[4:43:52] Bunjimus: pipez are really slow unless upgraded
[4:43:54] MonkeyWalk: its not on round robin
[4:43:55] ImTheDummy: All going to one lol
[4:43:58] IlsaGold: LUL
[4:44:02] Speedglass: you can pay a monthly fee for a checkmark
[4:44:05] elgallochode: imagine twitter paid its users to mine doge
[4:44:24] QuestionMarkYes: I think it loaded the right one first
[4:44:26] justin_triII: These people have to be the R word, the $8 a month is literally going back to users so they can get paid to monetize.
[4:44:30] elgallochode: doge will take over the dollar
[4:44:39] Buige: kill that chicken please
[4:44:40] elgallochode: unironically
[4:44:40] Obliviron: @TritonXXXG it has value as a platform. idk if he overpaid for it but it would have been fine over time. Might still be
[4:44:48] Krystalchan: @elgallochode KEKW imagine you could only pay for your blue check mark with doge
[4:44:49] Apparentthreat: Speedglass my bet is some people w/ the check mark won't want to pay for theirs while a decent amount of others will start paying, but not enough to make money. idk.
[4:45:00] Speedglass: apple does the same thing. they allow accounts to 'boost' their platform exposure
