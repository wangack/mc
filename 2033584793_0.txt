[2:06:01] aratavi: isnt it possible to build a big platform under the elytra frame, like far under it, so that when u set render distance up it will fall on the platform?
[2:06:02] Trainboyz1: ant check behind you
[2:06:07] SaylorMimi: Also render distance is at 2, so the bridge didn't render well

[2:06:29] ComfyChameleon: and now we know :)
[2:06:34] Swotfabs: @aratavi Chunks are infinite vertical so while you are building the platform it already fell.
[2:06:34] Linkio7: Smant you have 2 times more viewers than NickEh30
[2:06:35] Holodista: Oh wait finding the bridge was basicly impossible since render distance was Set to 2
[2:06:37] livipup: @RonitG1204 Don't worry about it YEP
[2:06:37] supermembrane: @aratavi this is much easier he just needs one block instead of a platform, but i suppose that would work
[2:06:38] DeterminedDaaf: You have too short time to think of any of those things.
[2:06:40] derpcube69: do you have rockets with you
[2:06:41] SuperTheUnderDog: @aratavi the whole chunk loads, up+down all the way. And we first tried using a machine that built a bridge but it missed/wasn't fast enough
[2:06:43] Linkio7: did*

[2:35:19] chopik85: You can use a single observer looking at the bottom sugarcane

[2:35:30] StalKe468: Piston bottom row more efficient
[2:35:35] sufer_vortex: you need to put pistons first
[2:35:35] DylanRhg: The pistons need to be up one, and where the observer is, is where the piston needs to go
[2:35:35] LegislatoreDelSalotto: isn't observers one block above where you put them, and pistons below?
[2:35:35] ComfyChameleon: KEKW

[2:36:24] slightabsolutes: it cant receive power from the front
[2:36:25] ap0llo7724: observer tick delay vs pistons
[2:36:26] reenl: nice idea tho
[2:36:26] theknightooo: put piston below observer
[2:36:26] maxthechillbot: piston below?
[2:36:28] ramsterram: you cant power it from the front
[2:36:30] usingername_: below observer
[2:36:30] memeprism: observer for top piston on middle
[2:36:31] timex78: What has happened
[2:36:32] IronGubber: us redstone torches
[2:36:33] SuperTheUnderDog: huh, so that's what you were trying to do
[2:36:33] Remue: @RemiTh3Rat no me
[2:36:35] clotar95: Obs
[2:36:35] cat_man2f: ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
[2:36:35] chopik85: That would make a clock I think
[2:36:36] jetman205: Hoppers pick up blocks thrrough mud
[2:36:37] MaxUumen: piston head cant be powered
[2:36:38] poliwhirlswril: piston on bottom observers on top
[2:36:39] blitzothegod: Do piston then observer on top
[2:36:39] MonkeyMan849: Wouldn't you want to detect when it gets 3 tall anyway?
[2:36:40] SaylorMimi: Mud is 9/10th of a block
[2:36:40] jonthewalrus: You can do hoppers below mud
[2:36:41] KJ1cool: observer on top of piston, redstone behind piston, block above redstone
[2:36:42] reenl: mud is not a full block, hoppers
[2:36:43] StalKe468: Thats a bedrock feature pal
[2:36:44] sodiumfrickingChloride: wooo skyblock
[2:36:44] IronGubber: sugarcane goes through mud
[2:36:47] spritz_____: Piston, observer, connect with redstone
[2:36:47] theknightooo: piston below observer
[2:36:48] starship1701: put pistons where you put the observers, put redstone on top, and connect it to 2 daylight sensors, one of them on night mode
[2:36:50] cat_man2f: ,mmmmmmm
[2:36:50] jasminekazooie: so no head ...
[2:36:51] clotar95: Obs top piston mid sand bot
[2:36:51] logmania: woah
[2:36:52] adasiasl: It goes pistons on the 2nd row then a block behind them with redstone on it and observers on the 3rd row if I remember correctly
[2:36:52] RemiTh3Rat: remith7Sob the gottee becomes the gotted smom7
[2:36:52] ramsterram: D:
[2:36:53] dito1fungi: just rebuild it and put the observer at the bottom
[2:36:54] dr_halsey_: pisston
[2:36:55] duke_tubem: mud isn't a full block high so it can have hoppers directly underneath
[2:36:56] shasta_le_bab: put observer directly above the piston, facing into a block
[2:36:57] Tegridi: Hoppers can pick up items through mud, but not sand / other sugare cane blocks
[2:36:57] justaguynexttoyou: smant is smort
[2:36:59] CryoSnakeEyes: noo
[2:37:00] ap0llo7724: you could make a QC farm
[2:37:01] dito1fungi: then the piston one ontop
[2:37:06] LORDLUDDY646: what is going on just got here?
[2:37:07] Gizmo_1994: for collecting
[2:37:08] HeldenBuch: mud is the same as soul sand
[2:37:08] KJ1cool: hopper under mud
[2:37:09] dandersuar: mud isnt a full block
[2:37:10] CylusGamer: mud is not a solid block
[2:37:11] dratiboy: Hoppers can pick up items through mud
[2:37:12] Zyonji: Hoppers can collect items through mud
[2:37:14] jazardly: you can do hoppers through mud or something
[2:37:14] ap0llo7724: without redstone
[2:37:14] kubchop: when is ur next yt vid?
[2:37:16] IronGubber: hoppers under mud will collect sugarcane
[2:37:16] dito1fungi: replace the bottom line
[2:37:16] jetman205: If you place hoppers under mud and plant ssugarcane on top itl be lossless
[2:37:18] theBreadsauce: hoppers catch stuff thru mud cuz mud isnt a full block tall
[2:37:19] dr_halsey_: water above segar cane
[2:37:19] zelirety3: ggladios pog
[2:37:20] theknightooo: perfect
[2:37:22] collink2002: mud is for when you use trains
[2:37:23] Erubbu: !music
[2:37:23] Nightbot: yup sounds like music to me
[2:37:24] EzraManning: he‚Äôs on 1.18.
[2:37:24] komatoses_: Nah, chat's just yapping
[2:37:25] logmania: wait sugar cane grows on mud?
[2:37:25] Caeser_SPQR: mud is technically a transparent block so hoppers underneath it can pick up items through it
[2:37:26] jasminekazooie: perfect!
[2:37:26] everyEdi: mud is smaller than a normal block, so pistons below can take the cane
[2:37:29] Akrep004: this music reminds me of lockout
[2:37:31] collink2002: minecarts
[2:37:35] TwinkyOctopus: hoppers can pull through mud
[2:37:35] IronGubber: sow
[2:37:37] ramsterram: oh lol
[2:37:37] SaylorMimi: Mud is in the mangrove update
[2:37:37] HeldenBuch: fair
[2:37:41] cat_man2f: ooooooooooo
[2:37:42] jasminekazooie: no brain NOPERS
[2:37:43] logmania: NODDERS looks good
[2:37:45] blitzothegod: Yay he figured it out
[2:37:50] kubchop: this beat bangs
[2:37:51] ramsterram: how did we get here would be impossible with darkness
[2:37:55] CashCab1221: you can use redstone behind the observers and it will be done
[2:37:58] HighOnCrax: use sticky piston, place a block in front of the sticky piston, observer on top with block behind it
[2:38:00] logmania: why two piston?
[2:38:02] adasiasl: That was correct you just needed a redstone dust!!
[2:38:04] RemiTh3Rat: this is too much brain for me remith7Sob and im just watching remith7Sob
[2:38:04] Jenix106: You're losing us
[2:38:06] Cheezecake00: glasspanes over the water so the sugercane dont bounce to far
[2:38:06] CylusGamer: yes
[2:38:08] granimated: ???
[2:38:08] onesockninja: how did you get red sand?
[2:38:10] CashCab1221: dont need two pistons
[2:38:12] jasminekazooie: @RemiTh3Rat me 2
[2:38:13] some_stupidusername: I mean it‚Äôs still a sugar cane farm
[2:38:14] RonitG1204: they do
[2:38:14] Zyonji: Both do go on because of quasi connectivity
[2:38:14] d4harp: yes it will via BUD i think
[2:38:20] kubchop: every in chat giving their suggestions lmao
[2:38:20] carlthecrableg: thye both do turn on
[2:38:20] SuperFire92_: defniitely don't use two pistons tho
[2:38:21] amiswrong: @onesockninja trading
[2:38:22] DaNzNiAl: Sugar cane grow faster on mud i think
[2:38:23] jetman205: observer into block behind
[2:38:25] IronGubber: redstone torches)
[2:38:26] RemiTh3Rat: @jasminekazooie me 3 smomLUL
[2:38:26] ramsterram: no?
[2:38:26] lSpruce: why 2?
[2:38:28] Rinnylol1: one block higher iirc
[2:38:28] SuperFire92_: it will NOT work with 2
[2:38:28] CylusGamer: power top botom moves to
[2:38:28] DeadNight_4: power up 1 move block
[2:38:30] SaylorMimi: Two pistons push the sugarcane into the water more
[2:38:32] verorick_yo: Wasting ressource
[2:38:32] ramsterram: ah nvm
[2:38:39] jazardly: won't they also go across to the other side too?
[2:38:46] blitzothegod: No the piston will block it from growing anymore
[2:38:50] crowkemon: why not use observers?
[2:38:51] thanos12345635: catJAM Û†ÄÄ

[2:38:54] PyjamaMole: Jammies
[2:38:54] Speculata: guh
[2:38:56] jetman205: two pistons can't work with an observer, theres no room
[2:38:58] schokolade73: just got here, did he get an elytra already?
[2:39:03] kubchop: I thought u were good at red stone
[2:39:04] RyanAyoubi: should I change the stream title?
[2:39:05] shasta_le_bab: no its quasi'ing
[2:39:07] SuperFire92_: @jetman205 this is true
[2:39:16] jasminekazooie: will an observer be able to flip that switch ?
[2:39:17] RyanAyoubi: also apparently i can do that
[2:39:20] theknightooo: you don't need two pistons!!
[2:39:22] blitzothegod: You'll see for sure
[2:39:22] logmania: vips can do that
[2:39:22] LegislatoreDelSalotto: unless you observer on the other side and go around for redstone?
[2:39:24] cat_man2f: mmmmmmmm
[2:39:28] logmania: huh Û†ÄÄ
[2:39:28] TheMostEpicest: farming simulator themos54When
[2:39:31] adasiasl: Are you gonna have one at the very end that activates them all?
[2:39:32] awsmrs: @RyanAyoubi editor privledges
[2:39:32] DeterminedDaaf: Building sugar cane farm
[2:39:34] collink2002: sugar cane only goes up 3 on its own
[2:39:34] DaNzNiAl: With my sugar cane farm i only use 1 observer
[2:39:34] granimated: i mean this is just crazy
[2:39:36] blazeintro: ah ummm
[2:39:37] FestiReformed: hey smant the game sound isn't synced idk if u know?? :)
[2:39:38] crowkemon: ur making this way too complicated
[2:39:38] maxthechillbot: does in not work with observer above piston? sorry if you already answered I wasn't paying attention
[2:39:38] ILLlMITED: hmmm
[2:39:39] SaylorMimi: "Getting high on sugar in Skyblock"
[2:39:40] ayan0z: 300 on humanbench mark verbal memory test im a god
[2:39:40] blitzothegod: Let him cook
[2:39:40] justaguynexttoyou: WHY ARE YOU USING TWO PISTONS?
[2:39:40] collink2002: so it wont do anything
[2:39:40] For1orn_: doesnt sugarcane oly grow to 3
[2:39:41] RemiTh3Rat: skylbok
[2:39:42] jasminekazooie: "doing stuff in skyblock"
[2:39:43] thsgrn: hmm
[2:39:43] limitile: uhh ummm uuh umm
[2:39:43] cat_man2f: ya
[2:39:44] TwinkyOctopus: hopper minecarts can fix that. also, use glass panes to keep the sugar cane from getting stuck on the other side
[2:39:48] DaNzNiAl: And 1 hopper
[2:39:48] Zjarrlou: "oh ah uhmm Skyblock"
[2:39:49] tntnew: farming views

[2:39:58] electraminer: let him cook smolCook
[2:40:00] komatoses_: @thsgrn why
[2:40:01] awsmrs: @Zjarrlou I like this idea
[2:40:02] cat_man2f: you can
[2:40:02] kubchop: Depths or sky islands totk?
[2:40:03] niko__bellic: have you been enjoying the cold
[2:40:05] cryptanalysis0: sugarcane can only grow up to 3 blocks tall, if ur using 2 pistons you have to use the observer from the other side
[2:40:05] RonitG1204: ‚Äúmaking tedious farm‚Äù for the title?
[2:40:05] logmania: i've just never seen a sugarcane farm with 2 pitsons but smolCook
[2:40:07] maxthechillbot: you don't need 2 pistons?
[2:40:07] crowkemon: you are making this way too complicated
[2:40:07] chopik85: If an observer looks at the bottom sugarcane, it detects it getting randomticked
[2:40:09] timex78: What are u doing
[2:40:10] SuperFire92_: i believe you will find this does not work
[2:40:10] GalarianGuy: SmallAnt's aren't real Madge

[2:40:15] jasminekazooie: then an observer to know when to flip the switch??
[2:40:17] CylusGamer: I belive
[2:40:18] usingername_: gamba on if it works
[2:40:19] ap0llo7724: how will you read when the sugarcane grows though

[2:41:25] SuperFire92_: HEY BUT WHAT IF THAT UHH IDK DETECTS THE PISTON FIRING TOO, CAUSING THE PISTON TO FIRE AGAIN?
[2:41:26] justintheosu: BIG BRAIN!!!!
[2:41:26] crowkemon: you only need one layer of pistons
[2:41:27] granimated: PFFFT true
[2:41:29] logmania: okay...
[2:41:30] timex78: wow 1000 iq
[2:41:33] blitzothegod: If you have the piston on the 2nd row it'll also destroy the 3rd layer

[2:41:42] ChosenSpider420: Hi small
[2:41:44] buttonsbuttonsbuttons: but mud
[2:41:46] granimated: the piston will activate the observer
[2:41:46] spritz_____: Do t put a piston on the bottom it‚Äôs just gonna get rid of the source one
[2:41:47] SuperFire92_: @awsmrs LOL ur right
[2:41:47] fidojp: im sure that ill work :)
[2:41:47] electraminer: test it!
[2:41:47] logmania: oh thats why you are doing 2 i understand fully now
[2:41:48] PyjamaMole: feels like the first piston might cause an infinite look
[2:41:50] DeadNight_4: piston poving will also trigger it ?
[2:41:50] stinkytobybean43: hopper Minecart under the block with the sugar cane
[2:41:52] TheFireDem0n: it detects the piston smant
[2:41:52] usingername_: what if it detects the piston pusg
[2:41:53] adasiasl: OMG I BELIEVED AND YOU HAPPENED IT WORKED BECAUSE SMART ANT

[2:41:53] theBreadsauce: massive brain smant
[2:41:54] Swotfabs: How will it regrow?
[2:41:54] granimated: infinite loop right
[2:41:54] sup3p: the piston will trigger the observer
[2:42:00] ironfredz: this is too smart for me
[2:42:00] waterfly_222: this will do a detect loop with the piston
[2:42:01] crowkemon: MINECART HOPPERS
[2:42:03] timex78: 10,000 iq
[2:42:03] ap0llo7724: it will
[2:42:06] koolmeteenmol: hi
[2:42:07] CylusGamer: it will
[2:42:07] fidu___: it will loop. because the piston will trigger the observer
[2:42:09] spritz_____: Oh nvm that‚Äôs just wood
[2:42:11] ramsterram: yeah
[2:42:13] RemiTh3Rat: i like to move it move it
[2:42:13] BloodyAxe: It will, i made this same mistake
[2:42:13] jasminekazooie: will the piston scare the observer and keep pushing him Sadge
[2:42:16] griffdog435: can‚Äôt you just place a block to test now?
[2:42:18] For1orn_: test by making it 3 tall
[2:42:19] ap0llo7724: but you can do locking repeaters
[2:42:20] SuperFire92_: delay what
[2:42:21] Vyr3CC: Put the observer on top of the observer
[2:42:27] Arrjay8: whatabout glass panes above the water?
[2:42:29] logmania: infinite loop?

[2:42:34] usingername_: i mean you do you
[2:42:35] Vyr3CC: Put the observer on top of the piston I mean
[2:42:36] electraminer: that redstone already triggers the pistons
[2:42:40] ap0llo7724: you need locking repeaters
[2:42:40] Bisget0Bell: you could also pickup the items with a hopper minecart below to fix items getting stuck on the sand
[2:42:41] Arrjay8: so the sugar can hit the glass panes and fall straight down
[2:42:41] AtomicWaffle14: This is just gonna be a big noise machine.

[2:43:27] usingername_: or panes
[2:43:27] Tegridi: Hopper minecarts will succ through full blocks too, but a lot more to build
[2:43:28] Mad_Turtle_Boi: make the water 3 wide?
[2:43:30] timex78: Why are u making this
[2:43:31] ramsterram: catJAM catJAM catJAM catJAM

[2:43:36] stinkytobybean43: they will land where the sugar cane grows
[2:43:39] kubchop: ‚ÄúSmant can break the game to obtain an elytra but can‚Äôt make a sugar cane farm :)

[2:43:49] metaknight199323: ohhhh clever I seee
[2:43:50] thsgrn: @timex78 he needs sugarcane to make paper to make fireworks for elytra flight
[2:43:51] smallpokemon122: Send the sugar cane to prison
[2:43:52] ComfyChameleon: free my mans NOOO he aint do nothin
[2:43:53] electraminer: SUGARCANE'S VAULT: the INESCAPABLE PRISON
[2:43:55] BloodyAxe: 1 higher for the top
[2:43:56] sevenbee: will they still fall down into the water tho?
[2:44:01] crowkemon: they can pick it up
[2:44:02] timex78: 10000 iq play
[2:44:04] moothemoo_: mincart hoppers can pick up through a full block
[2:44:04] TheMostEpicest: they do sev
[2:44:05] granimated: smant's design is finally onto something this is great
[2:44:06] logmania: they should sev
[2:44:07] over_sniffer: i forget what this song is and what it is from
[2:44:11] jazardly: minecart hpooers not normal hoppers
[2:44:12] schokolade73: why multiple layers of pistons?
[2:44:15] RonitG1204: would they not bounce back and land on the sand
[2:44:17] failedmitosis: FREE HIM THE SUGAR CANE DID NOTHING
[2:44:17] kubchop: -Can break the game to get an elytre but can‚Äôt make a sugarcane farm
[2:44:17] justaguynexttoyou: suger your under areest for growing canes
[2:44:18] octopatch1: smolBrain
[2:44:20] AtomicWaffle14: Are you in a version where you can make Mud? Cause mud isn't a full block and you can grow sugarcane on it.
[2:44:20] usingername_: they can fall onto the sand
[2:44:21] hood3d_: Make it so the observer is in the middle so it breaks when there is three the only problem is the Redstone routing
[2:44:23] TheMostEpicest: octo peepoJuice
[2:44:25] cryptanalysis0: minecart hoppers can pick up under full block, normal hoppers cant
[2:44:28] sevenbee: @AtomicWaffle14 he is not
[2:44:28] Vyr3CC: Pretty sure they'll still pick up through a block if its a minecart hopper
[2:44:32] awsmrs: @over_sniffer sounds like kirby
[2:44:34] FestiReformed: ingame sound not synced with stream :O

[2:45:31] electraminer: you could just trigger off of a daylight sensor
[2:45:34] yael_garden: Who let this man cook
[2:45:35] Bisget0Bell: you could also just do a timer
[2:45:37] Cyklan: i see it YEP
[2:45:37] RonitG1204: NODDERS strange cooking = burning
[2:45:38] granimated: this is like sledgehammering a cake you're butchering years of sugar cane farm innovation
[2:45:39] mylow13: cooking with a candle

[2:45:58] Metoisbak: infinite loop tho
[2:46:01] starship1701: minecart hoppers can pick up items through a solid block but what you're doing is fine
[2:46:02] CylusGamer: Make a prediction
[2:46:03] moothemoo_: careful not to get the observers stuck in a clock
[2:46:05] TheMostEpicest: themos54When
[2:46:08] BAMAT0: use just one observer
[2:46:14] stinkytobybean43: they land where the sugar cane grows
[2:46:20] chopik85: observer at the bottom + redstone line for pistons
[2:46:22] BAMAT0: and add a repeater so it wont loop
[2:46:23] Aiirrii_: who let smant cook
[2:46:24] ap0llo7724: you need locking repeaters and you can use just one observer
[2:46:24] thsgrn: @I_love_u_lots ice bridge did not work, but you can push blocks into unloaded chunks so you can support the itemframe before it pops off
[2:46:27] shasta_le_bab: this is wild
[2:46:28] dandersuar: is there a way to get bedrock in survival?
[2:46:30] granimated: no offense chat i think this is genius
[2:46:32] RemiTh3Rat: @I_love_u_lots he ended up using a method that @PyjamaMole posted in the discord smomGG
[2:46:32] timex78: What are u doing

[2:46:46] sevenbee: @mrmcflufflekins smolShrug if someone redeems lol
[2:46:50] Alfirindel: wait why are the observers facing a solid block? dont they need to be able to see the sugar cane grow into the empty space?
[2:46:51] hood3d_: Just make the bottom piston activate twice quickly to make the second sugarcane go in the water
[2:46:55] ayan0z: 350 on verbal memory test
[2:46:55] onyx8282: Impossible
[2:46:55] verorick_yo: Who let him cook
[2:47:00] kubchop: this looks like a 7 year old made it
[2:47:01] timex78: Why iron bars
[2:47:02] starship1701: some of those slabs are too high

[2:47:07] Metoisbak: I trust you, just not the observers
[2:47:09] prettysureitsmika: I FINALLY MADE IT TO A SMALLANT STREAM!!!
[2:47:09] electraminer: having two pistons is like definitely twice as efficient, smallant has the right idea here
[2:47:11] Jenix106: It would probably be better if you just have it grow one block instead of two, it makes no difference and you can save pistons
[2:47:13] DeadNight_4: hrrmit Tanner: confirmed =p
[2:47:14] electraminer: just gotta find how to stop the clock
[2:47:15] logmania: @timex78 so the sugar cane doesn't go to the other side

[2:51:27] hood3d_: Call your mom
[2:51:28] ComfyChameleon: what was he cooking?
[2:51:29] moothemoo_: actually a pretty fair idea, just pop a hopper clock on it  or smth
[2:51:29] TheFireDem0n: it will go off forever if you wire this up
[2:51:32] awsmrs: what's he smolCook ing?
[2:51:34] Jewshy__: just start over

[2:51:39] agent_underscore: bro cooked but im still hungry
[2:51:41] justaguynexttoyou: he wasnt cooking he was baking

[2:51:53] mrmcflufflekins: smolCook
[2:51:54] granimated: dude its gonna go TSKSKTHSKSK 20 times because every piston will go off

[2:51:59] Mirashade: Lost the recipe while cooking
[2:52:00] poliwhirlswril: neither do we
[2:52:01] awsmrs: @RemiTh3Rat but if you were a piston you wouldn't be alive smolPout
[2:52:02] happybeari: u were just pwaying
[2:52:02] blazeintro: fyi
[2:52:04] smallpokemon122: I need you to cook faster the guests are waiting
[2:52:05] raparent06: it's nice that you believe in yourself but it probably won't work LUL
[2:52:05] AtomicWaffle14: I think you wanted to make it so any piston triggering would also trigger the rest.
[2:52:06] TheFireDem0n: @SmallAnt this will keep firing the piston, you don't want this design
[2:52:07] RemiTh3Rat: i think you were trying to build a sugarcane farm? hope that helps smomGG
[2:52:09] Aiirrii_: he wasn't cooking he was broiling
[2:52:09] prettysureitsmika: You were trying to feed the redstone line into the pistons maybe?
[2:52:10] logmania: @smallant1queenant2v hi peepoJuice

[2:52:22] mutschuk: Trust me. - What was I trying to do
[2:52:22] chopik85: you COULD make the redstone go down the sides to power teh pistons at least
[2:52:23] BAMAT0: use just one observer with a repeater so it wont loop
[2:52:26] RonitG1204: you were trying to burn food
[2:52:28] lNakazan: how are we getting an elytra?
[2:52:31] regahOG: Hello Smallant. Loved the Skyblock video!
[2:52:34] MaxUumen: I'm glad you tested this build
[2:52:34] c1tru5_1: is anyone else experiencing delay with audio and video???
[2:52:36] RemiTh3Rat: @awsmrs no.... i would be a sentient piston? youre so silly sometimes
[2:52:41] poliwhirlswril: what are you cooking
[2:52:42] hood3d_: Nut
[2:52:46] cianchetto4: @c1tru5_1 yes there's delay
[2:52:48] smallpokemon122: 10 years later
[2:52:48] failedmitosis: bro was cooking so hard he burnt the house down
[2:52:49] hyperglaceon: hello smallant
[2:52:53] logmania: he's still cooking just because it's still in the oven doesn't mean its done chat
[2:52:53] tubbytank101: what about an elytra farm
[2:52:56] TheFireDem0n: I will send a tileable design in the media chat soon smant
[2:52:57] moothemoo_: yea that works
[2:52:58] kubchop: smant can break the game for elytra but can‚Äôt make sugar cane farm

[2:53:01] granimated: chat say no so he stops
[2:53:01] Jenix106: Do you really want every observer to power every piston?
[2:53:02] justaguynexttoyou: nope
[2:53:03] awsmrs: @RemiTh3Rat oh okay :) but you wouldn't have any arms or legs üò≠
[2:53:03] raparent06: probably idk
[2:53:05] electraminer: the redstone could also just go down
[2:53:07] DamienPup: guys, keep letting him cook
[2:53:07] hood3d_: Leeeeet hiiiii m
[2:53:08] fletchybean: will the lower piston ever even trigger? also is you had onw row of pistons it would still produce at the same speed!
[2:53:13] hood3d_: Coooiok
[2:53:15] Zyonji: You could get the signal around the corner with 2 observers

[2:54:03] MigherHind: Can you turn block volume up pls :)
[2:54:03] Jewshy__: remove the top row of pistons
[2:54:04] MaxUumen: you need a negative delay
[2:54:04] jellybeannnnnnnnnnnnnnnn: my poor ears
[2:54:04] chopik85: told ya
[2:54:06] ap0llo7724: run a repeater into the side of that one

[2:54:55] SymbioticPlant: the pistons are activating the observer

[2:55:39] coolsans69: Hermitcraft worthy my ass
[2:55:40] Rinnylol1: I don't think it'll work since when the pistons activate they activate the observers so it'll make a clock
[2:55:41] Mirashade: I don't see any delay myself
[2:55:44] cryptanalysis0: nah the game audio delayed

[2:55:45] mr_bwue: When are you going to do more zelda games?
[2:55:46] ebeneezersplooge_: @smallant it isn't working because the second row of pistons are triggering the observers again
[2:55:47] awsmrs: @RemiTh3Rat but you'd be too busy being used in a redstone machine to stream PepeHands
[2:55:48] geeesed: you can remove the top row of pistons because if the second row of sugarcane breaks the third row of sugarcane also breaks
[2:55:48] TheMostEpicest: Clueless
[2:55:49] logmania: WAYTOODANK more delay pls
[2:55:54] eltaco227: nice
[2:55:56] lucemiart: how did you get the elytra???
[2:55:56] ninjapenguin140: Don't you need a signal voltage? Like a no/and?
[2:55:59] TheMostEpicest: YEP solved
[2:56:01] SaylorMimi: Iron bar farm? PogChamp
[2:56:01] LilyIsWasHere: The sound seems abt 0.75 seconds ahead of the ideo
[2:56:02] MaxUumen: you need to ignore every second trigger
[2:56:03] RonitG1204: just make this as same as kelp farm by farming it twice a day @smallant
[2:56:04] moothemoo_: just remove the top row of pistons
[2:56:06] onyx8282: It grows 1 block every 8 min
[2:56:06] dratiboy: You actually need less delay...
[2:56:08] Jenix106: You can't delay it since the signal lasts for the same amount of time
[2:56:08] Spark_Horizion: small ant pancakes or waffles
[2:56:08] mattp_12: more delay YEP
[2:56:10] DeadNight_4: iron bar farm =O
[2:56:11] ap0llo7724: lock the repeater by powering the side of the on switch repeater with two ticks of delay
[2:56:11] egnoig: are elytra rockets just rockets or are the rockets made for the elytra?
[2:56:12] radpear_: Smant delay doesn‚Äôt do anything
[2:56:12] MaxUumen: if you just delay, it wont stop the pulse
[2:56:12] maxthechillbot: yeah, 1 hour delay
[2:56:12] TanukiYuki_: the observers are bserving the pistons!!!
[2:56:13] major_dissapointment: No the signal is still coming so you will just delay ot
[2:56:13] jasminekazooie: delay? more like OY VEY
[2:56:13] TheMostEpicest: YEP
[2:56:14] eltaco227: cough

[2:56:19] jonthewalrus: more delay means the off tick happens late which means the cycle still repeats when the piston retracts or am I crazy?
[2:56:20] Phyremaster: Usually only one layer of pistons is used, since the top one will pop off anyway, and the observers can then not be looking at piston heads
[2:56:23] Rinnylol1: I don't think it'll work since when the pistons activate they activate the observers so it'll make a clock
[2:56:25] EzraManning: @deadnight_4 (I tried to recommend Tangos tutorial but he didn‚Äôt see my message LUL )
[2:56:26] TheMostEpicest: just one more repeater i swear
[2:56:26] geeesed: delay wont help
[2:56:29] granimated: use an observer after the repeater and it'll pulse instead of holding the signal
[2:56:29] logmania: this is the most complex sugarcane farm i've seen, props for that
[2:56:29] chopik85: nope delay won't do anything
[2:56:31] TrumpetGamerLIVE: paper mario origami king ost catJAM
[2:56:32] ninjapenguin140: It needs an and gate'
[2:56:33] eltaco227: smolYep
[2:56:34] MaxUumen: why should it stop?
[2:56:34] major_dissapointment: The pulse comes -> you wait longer -> The pulse still arrives
[2:56:36] TanukiYuki_: the observers are observing the pistons!!!
[2:56:37] smallpokemon122: Faster?!?!?
[2:56:37] BAMAT0: you need less
[2:56:38] lSpruce: Who let this man cook
[2:56:40] ninjapenguin140: And*
[2:56:40] PyjamaMole: Drake
[2:56:40] DamienPup: your just making a redstone clock LULW
[2:56:42] jasminekazooie: dis beat kinda sick
[2:56:42] ap0llo7724: please lock repeater‚Ä¶
[2:56:45] Rinnylol1: you have made a clock lmao
[2:56:47] aDuckyRubber: @smallant its not working because the second row of pistons are triggering the observers again and again
[2:56:48] maxthechillbot: I don't think it's almost working, I can't lie
[2:56:50] DarkLightAll1: you made a loop
[2:56:50] logmania: catJAM yo beat goes hard
[2:56:51] DeadNight_4: @EzraManning figuring it out is part of the fun
[2:56:51] metaknight199323: Smallant how did you come up with this master plan dudeee
[2:56:54] geeesed: @SmallAnt you can remove the top row of pistons because if the second row of sugarcane breaks the third row of sugarcane also breaks
[2:56:55] mr_bwue: Kappa Kappa Kappa Kappa Kappa Kappa Kappa Kappa Kappa Kappa
[2:56:56] DarkLightAll1: top piston obeservers
[2:56:56] Mirashade: At least Wooper is watching and giving us emotional support
[2:56:58] hood3d_: That's good
[2:56:58] SaylorMimi: Locking repeater would work
[2:56:58] dr_halsey_: catJAM #
[2:56:58] ap0llo7724: face a repeater into another one that gives the output
[2:57:00] granimated: an observer after the repeater should fix it
[2:57:00] Cinderspears: the pistons trigger the observers
[2:57:02] logmania: YEP working
[2:57:03] tubbytank101: W cook
[2:57:04] girlz_for_jesuz: He is burning the food NOOOO
[2:57:04] CylusGamer: just make a hopper clock
[2:57:05] TheMostEpicest: YEP
[2:57:05] awsmrs: :)
[2:57:06] jellybeannnnnnnnnnnnnnnn: why don't you have the observers detect when it grows
[2:57:07] ChargingFurret: @SmallAnt you don't need the upper row of pistons, the lower row will break the upper sugarcane\
[2:57:08] Phyremaster: The observer is observing the piston retraction, no amount of delay will stop that
[2:57:09] Zyonji: You'd want to one tick the pistons
[2:57:11] blaxertz: the ovserbers are catching the pistons , u need to turn them off until piston contracts again
[2:57:11] RonitG1204: nice looper you got there KEKW
[2:57:12] Cikyra: just as intended YEP
[2:57:13] usingername_: working!! smolBounce
[2:57:13] Tegridi: Loudest sugarcane farm
[2:57:14] maxthechillbot: least efficient sugarcane farm

[2:57:17] RemiTh3Rat: thats my chef
[2:57:19] SeBash_y: music to my ears
[2:57:21] TheFireDem0n: @SmallAnt I put a working tileable lossless design in discord in the media channel
[2:57:23] cat_man2f: mmmmmmmmmmmmm
[2:57:23] DamienPup: "working"
[2:57:26] jasminekazooie: you definitely made something !
[2:57:26] chopik85: place an upwards piston with sand in the corner
[2:57:28] PyjamaMole: hey sebash atirelComfy
[2:57:28] moothemoo_: ngl your idea of making it fire like twice a day was pretty good
[2:57:28] logmania: @maxthechillbot D:
[2:57:28] dratiboy: Place a block on the pistons, then Redstone on those blocks. Get rid of the repeaters. That should work
[2:57:30] Cinderspears: the pistons trigger the observers causing a loop
[2:57:30] granimated: YES
[2:57:31] BAMAT0: connect the redstone with and without the repeater
[2:57:32] electraminer: yes you just need it to be a repeater
[2:57:34] RonitG1204: no
[2:57:34] TheMostEpicest: okay ant right between where those repeats were, put a upward piston below the corner, then a block of sand above
[2:57:35] CylusGamer: make a hopper clock to slow it down
[2:57:37] orphandenier: bro spent an hour building the most dysfunctional machine imaginable
[2:57:37] awsmrs: WAYTOODANK
[2:57:37] logmania: WAYTOODANK
[2:57:39] girlz_for_jesuz: piston jazz
[2:57:41] smallant1queenant2v: Yahhhh
[2:57:41] starship1701: Pls get rid of all the observers you only need one on top facing a daylight sensor
[2:57:42] cat_man2f: oooooooof
[2:57:43] imaadhv2: WAIT DID I MISS THE ELYTRA WHENNN WTFFF
[2:57:43] timmik: smolCook smolCook smolCook
[2:57:45] reenl: block on piston pointing up then, repeater points in full block and out of full block
[2:57:45] Mirashade: Pistons are so angry
[2:57:45] SeBash_y: pyjamamole smomHey
[2:57:45] RonitG1204: WAYTOODANK
[2:57:48] Varigatou: Mr Streamer why are you using two rows of pistons
[2:57:50] electraminer: repeater going into the repeater, not a piston
[2:57:50] TheMostEpicest: sebash peepoJuice
[2:57:51] MaxUumen: comparator could do that
[2:57:52] ap0llo7724: PLACE A REPEATER FACING ANOTHER REPEATER ON TWO TICKS PLEASE I BEG YOU
[2:57:52] CintiaEdel: There is one extra layer of pistons. you absolutely don't need the upper layer and it is what's causing the feedback loop
[2:57:52] awsmrs: sebash smomHey
[2:57:53] RemiTh3Rat: this is fonky smolDance
[2:57:53] usingername_: that sounds like a laser
[2:57:55] TrumpetGamerLIVE: piston go zoom
[2:57:55] jasminekazooie: ahhhh sleepy time ASMR
[2:57:57] ILLlMITED: thats a good beat
[2:57:57] Rinnylol1: the rhythm sounds funky
[2:57:57] logmania: make it stop pls
[2:57:57] stormapple: Nice beats
[2:57:58] metaknight199323: of course it worked we believed in you this whole time
[2:57:59] granimated: @reenl observer would work as well
[2:58:01] PyjamaMole: you can block repeaters but only with other repeaters
[2:58:03] Hekawolf: DinoDance
[2:58:03] maxthechillbot: someone put a design in #media on discord
[2:58:04] darknight_26_: I think that the piston will always set off the observer, and vise versa. Regardless of the delay.
[2:58:05] TheMostEpicest: pcrowWoke
[2:58:05] SaylorMimi: It needs to be a repeater going into another repeater to lock
[2:58:05] Zyonji: You're thinking of a comparator
[2:58:09] DeadNight_4: redstone going up
[2:58:10] TanukiYuki_: the observers are observing the pistons, the pistons are triggering the observers again!!! @SmallAnt
[2:58:10] ninjapenguin140: pistons
[2:58:10] jedi_gut: how did you get redstone?
[2:58:10] RonitG1204: KEKW
[2:58:11] usingername_: turn block volume up
[2:58:12] inposible9000: if you get rid of the top pistons it fixxes
[2:58:12] Cinderspears: the pistons trigger the observers making a loop
[2:58:13] TheMostEpicest: the block
[2:58:14] electraminer: there's an observer next to the block
[2:58:14] gavin_4112: The pistons are triggering the observers
[2:58:14] jellybeannnnnnnnnnnnnnnn: magic
[2:58:14] cianchetto4: from the bottom i think
[2:58:14] iansonofthor_: I can only imagine what monstrosity that Tanner has created
[2:58:15] martyboy13: the observer sees the piston?
[2:58:16] PyjamaMole: the block is powered
[2:58:16] moothemoo_: observer powering the block
[2:58:18] redfireyoshi: get this man out of the kitchen he is burning everything he cooks
[2:58:18] shasta_le_bab: THE PISTONS

[2:58:22] Mirashade: Stobe redstone catJAM
[2:58:25] chopik85: observer
[2:58:26] Mad_Turtle_Boi: piston are triggering the o servers
[2:58:26] Helias03: maybe use a repeater on a repeater to block itself
[2:58:28] skywarriorad: i think you could use a sticky piston removing a block from the redstone line stopping the signal after running for a bit
[2:58:31] ap0llo7724: PLACE REPEATER INTO ANOTHER ONE
[2:58:31] failedmitosis: OBSERVER PISTON LOOP
[2:58:32] CallMeS1R_: OBSERVERS TRGGERING PISTONS
[2:58:32] schokolade73: remove top layer of pistons
[2:58:33] busterhwk: bamOmega
[2:58:33] granimated: i am SOBBING right now
[2:58:33] ninjapenguin140: It needs a signal voltage, and an "And gate"
[2:58:35] cryptanalysis0: smallant hopper minecarts, unlike normal hoppers, can pick up items under a full block.
[2:58:35] EzraManning: it‚Äôs not an intentional clock chat
[2:58:35] awsmrs: @SmallAnt better design in #media in you care
[2:58:37] chief_kief69: Do you still like Marissa
[2:58:38] inposible9000: @SmallAnt take out the top pistons
[2:58:39] maxthechillbot: I don't think this design will ever work
[2:58:40] TheFireDem0n: @awsmrs saoHey
[2:58:40] asterisk5555: what is happening?
[2:58:41] CintiaEdel: just remove the upper layer of pistons
[2:58:47] PeterBP616: It‚Äôs Minecraft magic

[2:58:48] DeadNight_4: I love this
[2:58:51] trishulaxvi: huge waste of resources
[2:58:51] Cinderspears: the pistons trigger the observers causing a loop
[2:58:52] diex2074: Make some ladders dude
[2:58:52] RonitG1204: KEKW
[2:58:53] electraminer: this could actually work tho
[2:58:54] Gigolo_zzjone: no1DERP
[2:58:54] maxthechillbot: someone put a design in #media on discord
[2:58:56] jasminekazooie: @CintiEdel he is committed to this
[2:58:59] ChargingFurret: remove the upper layer of pistons and youre golden
[2:59:00] B_dge: fart smella
[2:59:00] CylusGamer: @SmallAnt make a hopper clock to slow it down

[2:59:11] cryptanalysis0: hopper minecarts pick up under a full block test it out
[2:59:11] pianto81: Remove top layer of pistons cause gravity
[2:59:12] Jenix106: Dutchpilled, just gotta have faith
[2:59:12] GCMat: why is it delayed audio btw?
[2:59:13] MaxUumen: try with comparator?
[2:59:17] dr_halsey_: KEKW
[2:59:17] granimated: you disconnected that one
[2:59:19] logmania: and it doesn't work Sadge
[2:59:19] SaylorMimi: The line is broken
[2:59:20] geeesed: @SmallAnt you can remove the top row of pistons (which are triggering the observers make it break) because if the second row of sugarcane breaks the third row of sugarcane also breaks
[2:59:20] moothemoo_: you need a repeater or comparator to lock the repeater
[2:59:22] onyx8282: fart smella

[2:59:35] agent_underscore: I think your humming is delayed
[2:59:36] maxthechillbot: @PyjamaMole I'm saying somebody already put a better design there
[2:59:37] TanukiYuki_: your whole desktop audio is delayed
[2:59:39] TheFireDem0n: @SmallAnt better tileable design in #media
[2:59:39] awsmrs: @SmallAnt better design in #media in you care

[2:59:46] logmania: oh no opening minecraft camera
[2:59:46] givesmeseriousconniptions: the sound is not delayed its ahead of the video!
[2:59:49] SOFUC_KING: how did you get an elytra on skyblock?
[2:59:50] electraminer: he's trying to use locking repeaters. he just doesnt know you need a repeater to lock a repeater

[3:00:00] ninjapenguin140: CapitalD
[3:00:00] skywarriorad: redstone signals go through non transparent blocks so you can have it pass through one of those blocks and a signal from the observers delayed late enough to let the pistons activate at least once and and then cuts off any further signal from the observers...

[3:04:46] TrumpetGamerLIVE: catJAM catJAM catJAM
[3:04:46] moothemoo_: dirt farm when?
[3:04:48] timex78: All hope is lost
[3:04:48] geeesed: why not use a flying machine one? they're faster than observers because you can build them bigger easier
[3:04:50] cryptanalysis0: try again smallant maybe you can think of another genius design
[3:04:51] kavkakes: @awsmrs That makes sense! his accent sounds like a watered down northern lion!
[3:04:51] ap0llo7724: I tried to explain to you smant :(
[3:04:53] moothemoo_: dirt farms are sick af
[3:04:53] jasminekazooie: YEAH GOOD ONE
[3:04:53] CintiaEdel: you could use minecarts with hoppers to collect instead of water so you don't lose any drops to randomness
[3:04:57] logmania: good one
[3:04:58] richardlongest: tellem
[3:04:59] TheFireDem0n: any mods to notice smant there is a good lossless design in #media?
[3:04:59] maxthechillbot: DoudDoug?
[3:05:00] jasminekazooie: GET EM !!
[3:05:00] limitile: good comeback!
[3:05:01] MigherHind: Maybe the stream isn't delayed, but allour eyes are Kappa
[3:05:03] YaGiC_TV: Pretty sure small farm will be replaced by a wallmart Sadge
[3:05:03] usingername_: check media
[3:05:05] sweeby_hm: where's the music from? sounds like bloons to me smolBounce
[3:05:06] smallant1queenant2v: @kccrimson_ smolWave

[3:05:24] smallpokemon122: The elytra stuff killed it
[3:05:24] kccrimson_: @smallant1queenant2v Hello! Fancy seeing you again lol
[3:05:30] mychoco: Hi, idk if you will read this message but there's an easier way of doing a sugar cane farm, use mud blocks, as they have a lower box and just put hoppers under them, so you don't need a water flow
[3:05:30] raparent06: @sweeby_hm legend of zelda iirc
[3:05:35] cryptanalysis0: try out hopper minecarts they can pick up under full block
[3:05:36] moothemoo_: 1 gt per item
[3:05:40] timex78: Uhh idk
[3:05:42] moothemoo_: 20 items/sec
[3:05:43] maxthechillbot: regular hopper*?
[3:05:45] BAMAT0: you mean hopper
[3:05:45] granimated: fast enough that you don't need a loading dock
[3:05:48] thhanatos: at least 1 second
[3:05:48] starship1701: You mean into a hopper? not that long
[3:05:48] Mirashade: ...Into a minecart?
[3:05:49] ambiguouspeanut2: its really fast
[3:05:52] royalcreeper5001: I like the music
[3:05:53] electraminer: speed of the normal hopper
[3:05:53] TheFireDem0n: @SmallAnt check #media for lossless tileable design
[3:05:54] tubbytank101: do you ever think it‚Äôs weird you‚Äôre just talking to like 2000 strangers
[3:05:54] ChrysanthemumCrown: How was Elytra obtained?
[3:05:55] CintiaEdel: hopper minecarts are fast as fuck
[3:05:55] sweeby_hm: @raparent06 sounds so similar wowie
[3:05:56] oddfrodgery: minecart hoppers are way faster
[3:06:02] DeterminedDaaf: Yeah I only notice a slight delay between you and the music. But it's not really that bad.
[3:06:07] prettysureitsmika: The exact number is 20 items per second if that helps
[3:06:07] granimated: the rail is going to be so loud wow
[3:06:09] ap0llo7724: hoppers are half speed of hopper mine carts, a full Minecraft would take 1.5 minutes
[3:06:12] moothemoo_: actually i dont think hopper carts can push items iirc
[3:06:16] electraminer: hopper minecarts are fast to pull, not fast to push. but it won't matter here
[3:06:16] timex78: don't get others get to u
[3:06:21] ap0llo7724: minecart
[3:06:27] logmania: @ap0llo7724 a full minecraft

[3:06:49] Lukaelle: arent you gonna constantly hear the minecart moving?
[3:06:52] itsTiJe: Good luck with that
[3:06:52] katiepunch: can u make a giant roller coaster please
[3:06:53] chewie1212: and it works
[3:06:55] raparent06: @sweeby_hm yeah they probably use some of the same instruments or something

[3:31:48] coinfliep: @mindfrk_x3 me
[3:31:49] Dedpulley: It's like modular too. We wouldn't need that much either
[3:31:52] yyyolk: the breakdown of one cell makes it look easy saiiNoted
[3:31:54] moothemoo_: @mindfrk_x3 that's at max scale, it doesnt need to be that big
[3:31:55] awsmrs: @RyanYeet2010 he isn't, you should've looked at the discord
[3:31:56] agent_underscore: THe united states military
[3:31:57] smudgemci: cut sandstone is nice touch
[3:31:57] smallpokemon122: Why do we need gunpowder?

[3:32:01] RonitG1204: this is easy and effective farm
[3:32:02] strawberry_taco: i can't believe that tiny thing is 17k per hour (and we dont even need cats)
[3:32:05] CaioLugon: just do 3x3 tbh
[3:32:06] moothemoo_: also ilmango was playing skyblock without dupers
[3:32:10] CapDeathWish: not much
[3:32:12] Rinnylol1: maybe a stack max
[3:32:13] logmania: at least 18k
[3:32:14] Pikablu2015: 650k gunpowder is getting ready for war
[3:32:14] EtubeOSRS: 30k
[3:32:14] P0tatoKing42: the night monkaW
[3:32:15] Grigori22: maybe just make one module
[3:32:15] anpananpananpananpanan: @smallpokemon122 fireworks
[3:32:15] ninjapenguin140: How would we get the sand for the bombs
[3:32:16] granimated: maybe 10
[3:32:16] timex78: You are Canadian Mario with no mustache
[3:32:17] egnoig: 800 max?
[3:32:17] SaylorMimi: One gun powder is 3 rockets
[3:32:17] dandersuar: make a 3x3 then
[3:32:18] starship1701: You could have an amazing fireworks show
[3:32:18] thsgrn: If it's not loaded most of the time then you need good generation when you do load it, right?
[3:32:19] BAMAT0: 17K GIGACHAD
[3:32:19] jdogskizzle: like 10 probably
[3:32:20] diremars: 54
[3:32:23] RyanYeet2010: @awsmrs oh

[3:32:24] smallpokemon122: He made a bat farm
[3:32:24] RemiTh3Rat: what if you want to explore terrain further out ? smomGG
[3:32:26] EzraManning: all the TNT HYPERS
[3:32:27] CapDeathWish: 2 by 2?
[3:32:28] raparent06: 500 max
[3:32:28] DeterminedDaaf: Even if you get that much gunpowder, your bottleneck will be paper.
[3:32:29] Arbjorn_: yeah tnt not very useful in a void
[3:32:29] senorBS: its all about the flex in minecraft farms KEKW
[3:32:29] audio_noodle: can use max flight duration rockets lol
[3:32:30] memetan_24: Less than 100 probably
[3:32:31] overk1ll2: yea just do 3x3 i made a raid farm on my survival and lil bit of gunpowder lasts you ages
[3:32:34] CaioLugon: yeah
[3:32:36] leacwm: bat farm
[3:32:36] justAMandragon: just make fewer modules
[3:32:43] jesternote_live: Did you get the elytra?
[3:32:45] radpear_: If you get 17,000 an hour than you can make an eternal firework display
[3:32:49] moothemoo_: @ninjapenguin140 ilmango had a couple mods to get some nonrenewables, or difficult to renew resources
[3:32:52] RyanAyoubi: if you want to do math, just make enough to fly constantly for a minute and then use that for the max rate
[3:32:53] Zyonji: It only works this well on the bottom with nothing above though
[3:32:53] RonitG1204: just making the farm might give you enough gun powder KEKW
[3:32:54] gavin_4112: If you're using a couple stacks of duration 3 rockets an hour probably like 500 or so an hour but maybe a bit more
[3:32:56] DeadNight_4: the nice thing about farms with insane rates, is you can build them away, afk once, and then go back and unload them
[3:32:59] timex78: You are Canadian Mario with no mustache
[3:33:02] moothemoo_: all mob farms require player presence
[3:33:04] strawberry_taco: make like 1 chunk full
[3:33:04] SaylorMimi: Just need to make sure there's no blocks above it
[3:33:06] peacatchyou: @SmallAnt dont you have your first farm? It should have some gun powder
[3:33:09] jdturtle666: witch farms?
[3:33:29] granimated: you could do it right under your platform as well
[3:33:32] logmania: chunk it NODDERS
[3:33:35] strawberry_taco: @SmallAnt put some fireworks in your hand in case you fall
[3:33:36] raparent06: @radpear_ they havent released auto crafters yet tho
[3:33:36] RonitG1204: kill the bat smolGun
[3:33:42] Markivory: a 3x3 should give you around 6k per hour
[3:33:43] nawskk: @RyanAyoubi He always wants to do math smolCoffee
[3:33:57] electraminer: i mean you have some gunpowder, you can make a few
[3:33:59] radpear_: Think what a funny prank it would be to get 1,000,000 gunpowder and pretend that‚Äôs how you cleared out the entires area and it was never skyblock
[3:34:01] timex78: Using my switch to watch u right now
[3:34:12] mr_bwue: What do you think the next zelda game will be about?

[3:34:27] ashtonjt1596: can you trade for paper?
[3:34:28] Radzio454: @mr_bwue walking and puzzles, next question
[3:34:32] smallpokemon122: Check the paper chest
[3:34:36] DeterminedDaaf: with a gunpowder farm like that paper will be your bottleneck for rockets
[3:34:37] k1ttenkat26: does it need light to grow?
[3:34:45] timex78: Using my switch to watch u right now
[3:34:52] RyanYeet2010: @smallant why is your axe named "bonk"
[3:34:53] lukerobertslukool: paper farm?

[3:35:11] overlyaveraged: how did he get elytra?\
[3:35:11] GalarianGuy: smolBonk
[3:35:13] overk1ll2: you should be getting around 2700 gunpowder an hour with 2x2 if 5x5 makes 1700 so 2x2 should be more than enough for you
[3:35:13] lukerobertslukool: bonk
[3:35:13] logmania: ttyd smolDance

[4:57:54] i_Ai_Eye_Aye: its the red stone right
[4:57:54] Zyonji: But it doesn't get light from the lava
[4:57:55] Draklozius: Oh maybe the redstone rail ?
[4:57:55] girlz_for_jesuz: redstone block?
[4:57:56] steal_licks: "wheres the hole"
[4:57:57] nilonhooo: i think the cauldron with lava emits light
[4:57:58] manasar: The cauldrons maybe?
[4:57:58] grasscoder27: ONLY TOP SLABS BLOCK LIGHT NOT BOTTOM SLABS
[4:57:59] battlingthecats: check just in case
[4:58:06] Lukas_Klasen: This is too confusinging
[4:58:06] terakin21: catJAM
[4:58:06] etanesnd: maybe you could see if it works at night when the sky light is an issue to see if its that or something else
[4:58:07] thsgrn: redstone rails/blocks would be block light, not sky light, chat
[4:58:07] Daan18w: Wasn'tt there a block above the cauldrons int he design?
[4:58:08] EpicPuppy613: @grasscoder27 false
[4:58:10] stinkytobybean43: light can go through the slabs
[4:58:16] PogPlayzMinecraft: Mogswamp is the king of super flat and now smallant is becoming the king of Skyblock xD
[4:58:24] timex78: what was ur first nintendo console/handheld
[4:58:26] SaylorMimi: Hoppers let light through from below because they're not a full block
[4:58:27] ceo_pi: its the lava thing
[4:58:33] DeadNight_4: you don't need to look at sky light for mob spawning
[4:58:33] some_stupidusername: I see
[4:58:41] jbax2021: is the redstone glowing
[4:58:43] kiyzzerr: is it because of the redstone blocks
[4:58:44] khaosking6: i th ink it might be the lava cauldrons
[4:58:45] smudgemci: are the Caludrons blocked off, cause he said they are transparent in the tutorial

[4:58:51] CashCab1221: if you have light below
[4:58:53] RemiTh3Rat: thats what i was thinking potentrially
[4:58:53] darthfranco123: suns In the sky...
[4:58:55] RonitG1204: maybe
[4:58:58] etanesnd: transparent hoppers on the bottom?
[4:58:58] SuperTheUnderDog: @kiyzzerr it's sky, not block light though
[4:59:04] starship1701: Didn't the video show him putting a block on top of the lava cauldron?
[4:59:04] Lukaelle: how odd
[4:59:07] brrontto: iirc creeper farms need you to be high above it vertically for it to work
[4:59:08] kiyzzerr: ah
[4:59:12] ceo_pi: the ;ava thing is letting in light its not solid
[4:59:13] Daan18w: Block above the cauldron right?
[4:59:18] TheSeaPunCake: arent the rails or redstone blocks making light
[4:59:19] Markivory: I think you need to put something on top of the lava
[4:59:21] Smalls440: it must be the hoppers from below then?
[4:59:28] Synchro_maestro: praise the mango
[4:59:30] khaosking6: @brrontto thats vanilla this is skyblock
[4:59:30] electraminer: its not the lava, it must be stuff from below
[4:59:31] joebro836: hello there
[4:59:33] thsgrn: @TheSeaPunCake that'd be block light, not sky light
[4:59:34] thosebroshaha: SHIT!
[4:59:42] DeadNight_4: give it a minute to work, you're currently blocking spawns
[4:59:42] etanesnd: it can't be the lava because the block light is zero
[4:59:42] poggers_73: fortnite stream?
[4:59:52] superdino790: @smallant have you ever played The Last Of Us?
[4:59:52] etanesnd: its probably the hoppers from below
[4:59:53] nightfyer: do cauldrons with lava emit light?
[4:59:53] Meep_Meep100: hoppers
[4:59:53] hihownotyou: is it the red stone block
[4:59:55] Myexample: is it the hoppers?
[4:59:58] bhutch12345: if it is ill do absolutely nothing
[4:59:58] LolbitDaGamer: redstone produces light thio
[5:00:00] Lukaelle: might as well patch the bottom to be safe
[5:00:01] BAMAT0: just call ilmango üß†
[5:00:05] mikr0wav3: wait til night to see if it is from the sun
[5:00:06] geeesed: hoppers arent solid
[5:00:08] thsgrn: @hihownotyou block light is zero that's not the problem
[5:00:09] awsmrs: @poggers_73 he played it once for the world's greatest gamer event, and I remember he did not like it, so no
[5:00:10] Meep_Meep100: can u but blocks under them?
[5:00:10] birddad_: time to encase it in a cube let's go
[5:00:11] timex78: chek the light level down at the hopper
[5:00:13] thosebroshaha: 426744276775
[5:00:13] battlingthecats: cover it all with normal blocks just in case?
[5:00:17] hihownotyou: put block under the hoppers
[5:00:25] diego420xd: redstone block
[5:00:26] Draklozius: Redstone rail ? Do they glow a lil ?
[5:00:28] awsame303: illmango has blocks in the bottom of his farm amybe you should check that
[5:00:30] GalaxiesOrigin: Have you built those automatic cobblestone generators thatuses complex redstone, leaves, and the normal water/lava, to make thousands per hour with no input?
[5:00:30] kiyzzerr: check the hopper connections ??
[5:00:37] darthfranco123: block out the sun
[5:00:40] PyjamaMole: make overhangs at the side to block light?
[5:00:41] geeesed: cover the underneath
[5:00:42] SaylorMimi: You can build the roof out to the side
[5:00:44] UnwillingPish: @Draklozius the light is only coming from the sky, not any blocks
[5:00:46] grasscoder27: hoppers are transparent so just place a block bellow the hoppers
[5:00:49] poggers_73: @awsmrs ok :(
[5:00:56] Meep_Meep100: might only work at night
[5:00:59] thsgrn: @Draklozius that would be blocklight, not sky light
[5:01:05] drusna: could build a platform around the sides to block sky light
[5:01:05] electraminer: does it have more floor out to the side, because that could help prevent light from sneaking around the edge
[5:01:08] Draklozius: right
[5:01:08] CapDeathWish: item elevator ay? sweet
[5:01:09] DeadNight_4: didn't ilmango have hoppers at -64 ?
[5:01:13] Synchro_maestro: how far below is the farm? could your platform be too high up?
[5:01:18] iamzxchh: the hoppers let light through so just put blocks below them
[5:01:23] awsmrs: @poggers_73 I mean I wouldn't watch it anyway, not a fan of the game
[5:01:29] Zyonji: You can build a ring around the farm to block sky light.
[5:01:30] awsame303: WAIT NVM his has light under it too
[5:01:36] LDNTyler: just build the roof out by like 3/4 blocks, should be fine
[5:01:39] grasscoder27: hoppers are transparent
[5:01:39] Markivory: I think you need a block on top of the lava cauldron
[5:01:44] etanesnd: time to build a floor
[5:01:47] joebro836: you said there were redstone blocks in the build, they create light, are they covered?
[5:01:49] smudgemci: acoording to wiki Hoppers  are transparent
[5:01:56] iamzxchh: put blocks under the hoppers
[5:01:59] PyjamaMole: NODDERS
[5:02:04] grasscoder27: you need to cover the bottom of the hoppers
[5:02:05] poggers_73: is there a clip of smant playing fortnite in world greatest gamer?
[5:02:07] kiyzzerr: double check hopper connection
[5:02:10] awsame303: go to 6:28 on the video guys his has light under it too
[5:02:13] CathieNova: Cover the hoppers underneath with blocks.
[5:02:14] khaosking6: blocks under hoppers or bigger roof
[5:02:16] Horystar: @joebro836 Redstone blocks don't create light, redstone torches and lamps do
[5:02:18] electraminer: 3-4 blocks isnt gonna help, it should be 15 blocks blocks or just cover the bottom
[5:02:21] UnwillingPish: weirdly the inside is 7 though. mobs should spawn at 7 or below
[5:02:24] moothemoo_: putting a brim in also improves some spawns
[5:02:24] Tordero1: what are we doin
[5:02:27] TheFanMan7777: @Synchro_maestro everything in the chunk is loaded no matter what height you are at and its a light issue not a render issue
[5:02:27] legoless100: just put blocks under hoppers
[5:02:28] joebro836: oh alright
[5:02:30] awsmrs: @poggers_73 the vods are up on ludwig's yt
[5:02:31] moothemoo_: i dont remember if creepers are affected
[5:02:32] stormyqj: Cauldrons let in light?
[5:02:33] serumano_: redstone ORE blocks create light (or used to)
[5:02:33] randomraisin0: I've been gone for a while, i thought you would've finished the farm by now
[5:02:40] DeadNight_4: hoppers are solid on top though
[5:02:40] chess_bud: Hey smallant, I just wanted to say you are a very dedicated man smolEcksdee :)
[5:02:41] thsgrn: @UnwillingPish that changed eventually
[5:02:42] Horystar: Cauldrons are transparent as well
[5:02:44] poggers_73: @awsmrs ty i will go watch
[5:02:44] awsmrs: @awsmrs or if not the vod, the video for it is there too
[5:02:46] Ibens_Inferno: redstone gives off faint light when you break it but only when you break it
[5:02:46] Zyonji: Brim is a good word!
[5:02:48] Big_Con_Gaming: I say floor below hoppers
[5:02:49] FaeAura: @stormyqj surrounded by full blocks so no
[5:02:54] Blueice999_: Was the farm made when mobs could spawn at light level 7?
[5:02:55] mattp_12: KEKW

[5:03:06] Britishpikachu: dude got piston'd
[5:03:06] SaylorMimi: They can spawn on the sand yes
[5:03:07] moothemoo_: death by sunn
[5:03:09] some_stupidusername: KEKW
[5:03:09] Quittle7: KEKW
[5:03:12] grasscoder27: just place a full block bellow the hoppers unless you built it at bedrock level
[5:03:14] Synchro_maestro: @Synchro_maestro it's more so because mobs won't spawn if they're too far away iirc. there's like a sphere they can be in
[5:03:17] moothemoo_: no you put slabs in there
[5:03:17] RonitG1204: no?
[5:03:19] matthew123112311231: hey guys

[5:04:27] granimated: more bats than creepers
[5:04:28] mayajvix: its 2 per hour close enough
[5:04:30] electraminer: its probably going to be somewhere between 5 and 10 times slower given the height
[5:04:34] pOpTrAiTs: not exactly 2000
[5:04:35] LolbitDaGamer: make brim to improve

[5:11:38] granimated: nope

[5:11:39] diztortion__: Hope your final evolution isn't a furry like in the new gens
[5:11:41] Synchro_maestro: doubt it

[5:11:50] RemiTh3Rat: Make it brighter so the bats dont spawn, hope that helps smomGG
[5:11:50] rangacherry: you might evolve when exposed to a certain item
[5:11:51] Dung_Eon: they could be filling the boats
[5:11:55] CapDeathWish: but, aren't you fully evolved? Baby->Teen->Adult
[5:11:59] Horystar: They shouldn't
[5:12:00] grasscoder27: no bats have there own separate mob cap

[5:14:43] CapDeathWish: looks like it'd fit in too xD
[5:14:45] kokonutdoggy: smant are you a self proclaimed genius?

[5:15:14] CapDeathWish: true
[5:15:16] BennoDrago: Can't ungodly mean either beyond godly or less than godly?

[5:15:23] FlipFlopEatChop: How does the height of the farm affect the rates?
[5:15:29] ItzH3r0h: whos your favorite comedian??
[5:15:29] lajotu: it probably wasn't designed for a void world, technical builds are just usually built there for testing
[5:15:33] Aed530: Do you prefer bedrock or java?
[5:15:33] usingername_: this doesnt look like 650k per hour

[5:30:48] joebro836: hey smant I got a video/stream idea, Pok√©mon (any main series game) but you can only use Pok√©mon from that game‚Äôs generation, for example: if you play Pok√©mon X or Y, you can‚Äôt use the Kanto starters or any other Pok√©mon that are not from that reigon, also, to make things extra spicy, you could only use shiny‚Äôs if you want
