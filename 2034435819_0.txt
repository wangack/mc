[0:10:48] Aurelius101: @mister_nibbles And you can tell the Earth is round by looking at it, and yet some people...
[0:10:51] baltimore_667083: @jessicaengle but they are-no seriously they exist
[0:10:54] Dread_Pirate_Westley: Wait, if I'm making pasta and salt my water, does the water disappear?
[0:11:15] mister_nibbles: @Aurelius101 Sure but its a lot easier to see the ocean than the curvature of the earth lol
[0:11:16] jessicaengle: @baltimore_667083 Kappa I think?   That means you're telling a joke right?

[0:12:31] TXC2: Hello Everybody
[0:12:37] beowuuf: one of the suggestions referenced not using optifine
[0:12:40] beowuuf: hey txc2
[0:12:45] TXC2: hi beowuuf
[0:13:27] TXC2: so I missed the intro, what are we doing?
[0:13:33] beowuuf: loadingreadyrun "Chunklock does NOT play well with Optifine, please keep that in mind if you are experiencing issues with chunk boundaries not rendering or partially rendering."
[0:14:12] beowuuf: @TXC2 this is called chunklocked, you get locked to a single chunk until you give the boundary a particular item to unlock the next chunk
[0:14:14] BusTed: tqsHype
[0:14:32] TXC2: ok so chunk unlocks are not team based, for scoring
[0:14:45] TXC2: beowuuf  neat, thanks
[0:15:11] beowuuf: lol
[0:15:13] Genie_M: you can race opening chunks

[0:15:18] TXC2: here fishy fishy!
[0:15:35] DudelidouX: Locked to the closest?
[0:15:45] Lirelent: it moves with closest I think
[0:15:46] Genie_M: closest player
[0:15:47] Master_Gunner: It moves with whomever's closest, yeah
[0:15:47] mister_nibbles: closest person to it
[0:15:49] lamina5432: the closest
[0:15:49] Statist42: moves with the closest person?
[0:15:50] Sarah_Serinde: It seems like it's just the person who's closest yeah
[0:15:57] LordZarano: It moves with whoever's closest
[0:15:58] hanzi_keat: hanzi_keat subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 60 months! 
[0:16:12] creasehearst: or it moves with whoever is closest to it
[0:16:16] Genie_M: it seems closest player yes
[0:16:22] Genie_M: it's very user friendly
[0:16:30] noSmokeFire: traditionally with a rod
[0:16:46] brieandbacon: Could you attack that chunk from a different direction?
[0:16:48] TXC2: can the fish move past the boundary?
[0:17:00] jessicaengle: teeheeheeeeee
[0:17:06] noSmokeFire: looks like stripped oak, but it's hard to tell with your texture pack
[0:17:14] jessicaengle: With a lure of course
[0:17:52] jessicaengle: Or perhaps some kind of jig DinoDance
[0:17:58] Genie_M: you can race to open more chunks

[0:21:08] Saintnex: spirals are awesome
[0:21:10] TXC2: ok for a start it's a helical staircase, and 2 it's normal
[0:21:30] rogerivany: James clearly needs more experience digging holes.  ;)
[0:21:39] beowuuf: so monsters aren't chunklocked...
[0:21:40] Genie_M: chunk 0 is forgotten, noone remembers what other ways need
[0:22:09] TXC2: Genie_M  ever forward, never learning Kappa
[0:22:13] beowuuf: seabatClap
[0:23:44] rogerivany: So hostile mobs can get in the unlocked chunks from the locked chunks?

[0:24:11] TwitchTVsFrank: Remember you don't have netherite armor or weapons
[0:24:17] beowuuf: yup, looks like creatures and monsters can cross boundaries with ease :p
[0:24:21] Manae: Zombie stole a shovel
[0:25:14] TXC2: the "monsters" care not for our imperialistic notions of boarders

[0:26:16] TXC2: "there's Zombies in the water! I do not feel safe!"
[0:26:39] w1gum: Does that mean you can shoot through it too?
[0:26:43] rentar42: i think the skelletons technically count as "campers" ...
[0:27:00] TwitchTVsFrank: Our food comrade

[0:28:19] Manae: Oak source?
[0:28:21] brieandbacon: This can get you the oak stairs though
[0:28:22] Harvest25: Oak from that
[0:28:35] TXC2: yeap needed 2
[0:28:43] rogerivany: This does look fun
[0:29:29] TXC2: this feels like it might be good for newer players, to get them to make stuff, and go places they normally wouldn't
[0:29:39] rentar42: did spoders always swim in minecraft?
[0:29:58] Lirelent: RIP server

[0:31:23] TheAwkes: They only have to be good at it long enough to take over a majority of the market.
[0:31:23] rentar42: wait, but twitch runs on AWS ... so it can't all be down.
[0:31:25] Lirelent: LRR bot runs on minecraft
[0:31:29] avi_miller: LRRbot decided to take a snow day
[0:31:30] NorthstarTex: now how will I get my advice?
[0:31:32] MarsIsDead: Turn on the Paul Beacon!
[0:31:53] PsychoI3oy: yeah because hanzi_keat and I subbed for 60 months each between mister_nibbles and rentar42
[0:32:01] brieandbacon: There was a *different* paper
[0:32:03] kalira77: i think map was the first thing you got from the chest
[0:32:05] beowuuf: lol
[0:32:05] BrookJustBones: I think the one that doesn't stack is a map?
[0:32:13] baltimore_667083: map was the first thing you grabbed
[0:32:38] beowuuf: LOL
[0:32:40] Lirelent: needs kelp, locked away the kelp
[0:32:45] brieandbacon: Can you hit outside the border?
[0:32:52] Snowcookies: Kelp is behind DLC
[0:32:54] Tripleyew: like a diamond in the wall, taunting you
[0:32:56] beowuuf: need kelp to get kelp
[0:32:57] TXC2: brieandbacon  probably not
[0:33:12] Manae: Oak fence, too
[0:33:13] TXC2: some WAILA
[0:33:32] rogerivany: take the oak planks as well?
[0:34:22] Nickiatori: woah this is really cool, reminds me of runscape chunk locked accounts
[0:34:47] Snowcookies: looks like oak
[0:35:40] Harvest25: Birch door, oak stair and oak pressure plate
[0:35:47] beowuuf: too far
[0:35:51] BrookJustBones: It acted like a blank map somehow
[0:35:52] DudelidouX: was that just a map?
[0:35:53] scuba_antney: It didn't generate, so you just got a map
[0:35:53] TwitchTVsFrank: Lagged chest
[0:35:59] Nickiatori: that was a regular map
[0:35:59] NorthstarTex: its just a map?
[0:35:59] brieandbacon: the map may have borked with server issue
[0:36:02] Harvest25: That is MAP, not treasure
[0:36:16] TXC2: I think it would be better if when the chunks unlocked, it was coordinates instead of a number
[0:36:20] kalira77: it was a treasure map before he opened it
[0:36:23] rentar42: yeah, the tooltip definitely said burried treasure map
[0:37:12] Lyinginbedmon: Lyinginbedmon subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 73 months, currently on a 73 month streak! 73 months is just long enough to punch another chunk!
[0:37:34] TwitchTVsFrank: The race to see who gets the nice chunk is on
[0:39:00] TXC2: question: is the neither (and the end for that matter) also chunklocked ?
[0:39:04] Sarah_Serinde: Ah, I see Serge suggests someone else does it, so that he can keep unlocking chunks :P
[0:40:04] Nathade: chunk unlocking stalls for a bit when they reach 2 chunks before nice until someone has the ressources to unlock 2 chunks
[0:40:06] rogerivany: Brown candles don't seem like a thing you can get quickly.
[0:40:08] beowuuf: @TXC2 oooh, that would be evil
[0:40:58] Harvest25: Can you?
[0:41:02] Sarah_Serinde: Yeah you can always just unlock other chunks
[0:41:52] Nickiatori: i feel like unless the end portal has a really annoying item locking it this feels pretty beatable
[0:42:12] TwitchTVsFrank: 5 more chunks to go
[0:42:31] ekimekim: hm. if all the end portals had end stone or something locking it, the game could in theory be unwinnable
[0:43:22] LordZarano: Any number below 34 will be 1 player sleep with 3 players
[0:43:28] Lyinginbedmon: Hopping through the End portal to a floating obsidian platform and having to dodge the dragon while unlocking chunks towards the island sounds like it'd be Rough
[0:43:45] rogerivany: Yes.  You could put a box around the zombie.
[0:44:12] rogerivany: #blameJames
[0:44:21] TXC2: why live link animals when you can live like bears?
[0:44:26] Dread_Pirate_Westley: You have some string. Enough for a fishing rod?
[0:44:27] TwitchTVsFrank: You didn't build it the serge way

[0:52:24] TwitchTVsFrank: Adam West
[0:52:32] TXC2: undecided44  the number they have personally unlocked
[0:52:37] MarsIsDead: Kevin Conroy... Big gay Batman is best batman
[0:52:37] Cptasparagus: @TXC2 Kanye?
[0:52:39] TheShokara: the only correct answer is Kevin Conroy
[0:52:51] TXC2: Cptasparagus  Adam west !
[0:52:51] undecided44: Thanks @TXC2
[0:52:54] BrookJustBones: Beej
[0:52:58] baskwalla: Yup, Kevin Conroy
[0:53:07] Cptasparagus: @TXC2 :P
[0:53:31] Xed_Regulus: D'oh, I was wrong, Kevin CONROY, not Conway
[0:53:57] TXC2: Kevin conway twitty as Batman Kappa
[0:53:59] baskwalla: Just like The Goonies, they're rolling in chunks
[0:54:52] undecided44: For me its Keaton ('how do you know its Japanese?' 'I bought it in Japan.')
[0:54:54] MarsIsDead: Also, when are we ever going to get a live action Terry McGinness?
[0:55:22] TXC2: MarsIsDead  that's what the most recent batman movie should have been
[0:55:55] DarkNacht: DarkNacht subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 79 months! 
[0:55:56] LRRbot: lrrSPOT Thanks for subscribing, DarkNacht! (Today's storm count: 31)
[0:56:15] MarsIsDead: @txc2 Agreed... Batman Beyond (or Batman of The Future for the Brits) is the second best Batman period
[0:56:25] insanecat6mtg: @undecided44 I think it's how many the player has unlocked individually. This play through also just started today but I'm pretty sure James says that near the beginning.
[0:57:03] Lyinginbedmon: Gonna have to try and triangulate it
[0:57:28] orangey44: thats after unlocking enough chunks to get a blaze rod in a fortress :D
[0:59:05] ekimekim: what happens if you go through a nether portal into a locked chunk?
[0:59:09] undecided44: @insanecat6mtg thanks. I catch many of the MOC episodes via vod, but just joined this one late. I heard the pitch last week, but was just trying to get grounded on how the count related to progress... just as I joined James was looking at Uno ( 8 chunks) then Serge (~25 or something).
[0:59:35] TXC2: ekimekim  I assume it unlocks the first chunk you go to in the neither
[0:59:42] Nickiatori: it a frienderman!
[1:00:08] Angreed66: If I were them I would never use coal in case you need it to unlock a chunk since charcoal is renewable
[1:00:18] rogerivany: Rude not to give you his eyes.
[1:00:22] ekimekim: TXC2: but what about the other way? if you unlock an area in the nether but not the overworld
[1:00:44] TXC2: ekimekim  ooh good point
[1:01:33] Xooszi: Xooszi subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 52 months! 52 months! Sweet
[1:01:33] LRRbot: lrrSPOT Thanks for subscribing, Xooszi! (Today's storm count: 32)
[1:01:38] rogerivany: Copper for a copper wall.
[1:01:54] TXC2: ekimekim  maybe it just unlocks the chunk, given that it will then be surrounded by locked chunks for at least 8 chunks
[1:02:27] undecided44: ... more cowbell?
[1:02:27] TXC2: Desires are the cause of suffering
[1:02:40] brieandbacon: "If you're happy and you know it, it's your meds"
[1:02:46] Mangledpixel: Stiff upper lip, what what
[1:02:47] ladyjessica: father?
[1:02:48] DudelidouX: Don't think you want to talk about things like that with twitch chat....
[1:02:58] TXC2: "shut up and Vote"
[1:03:13] Bowlsrus2000: a
[1:03:38] SpleenLord: Afternoon all. What's a chunklock?
[1:04:23] TXC2: hello SpleenLord  to open a chunk you need to throw a particular object into the chunk
[1:04:36] Angreed66: Honestly this early it's easier to jump off a cliff to refill hunger
[1:04:36] Mangledpixel: today's fish is trout a la creme. enjoy your meal
[1:04:51] rogerivany: WAsn't there seeds in the chest as well?
[1:05:10] BrookJustBones: They would need to unlock a bigger cliff
[1:05:27] Lyinginbedmon: Imagine if death didn't refill your hunger

[1:09:53] vegetalss4: I see, I didn't know vanilla minecraft had challenge modes
[1:10:47] UtilityPunk: Can set up a hopper to harvest eggs
[1:10:52] Mangledpixel: I could go for a chicken turner
[1:10:53] TXC2: vegetalss4  it's a datapack

[1:12:46] BrookJustBones: James, you where ar -111 not -11
[1:12:49] Sarah_Serinde: @vegetalss4 This isn't an official mode offered by Minecraft. It's not considered modded because there aren't any new blocks or crafting recipes or anything added that would change the actual gameplay, it just adds some restrictions (namely, world borders that you have to unlock using vanilla items)
[1:13:06] beowuuf: uno id not wrong :)
[1:13:09] boyesie: four candles, 'andles for forks
[1:13:13] bethjch: four candles is brilliant I concur
[1:13:25] carbonoid12: there are 4 lights?
[1:14:10] vegetalss4: @Sarah_Serinde Ah Ok. Thank you for the explanation
[1:14:35] Mangledpixel: the Four Candles sketch is a prime example of blowing your best joke right at the start
[1:14:40] LordZarano: 4 candles was voted as the number 1 best comedy sketch in the UK a few years ago I think
[1:15:03] Mangledpixel: the rest of the sketch is ok, but the opening joke is just sublime
[1:15:04] Piratical_tendancies: cracking sketch, absolute classic
[1:15:18] Angreed66: Is that an azalea too?
[1:16:16] TXC2: Mangledpixel  right?
[1:16:25] rogerivany: Did we get enough string to make a rod?
[1:17:01] Genie_M: Nether opens the same way?
[1:17:31] UnknownFriday: What would the dragon fight look like in this environment?
[1:17:34] brieandbacon: ...what is pokie hole?
[1:17:38] Sarah_Serinde: Nope
[1:17:39] Angreed66: Pokeyhole has the math behind it
[1:17:44] omdorastrix: I wanna be the very best
[1:17:59] LordZarano: 1x1 holes in the walls of your tunnel
[1:18:04] rogerivany: I don't know pokey hole
[1:18:29] TXC2: is the pokey hole were we keep the pig ?
[1:19:05] Nickiatori: are the chunks getting more pricey as we get further from spawn?
[1:19:30] MarsIsDead: Clip that!
[1:19:33] Xed_Regulus: Did Serge have a stroke?
[1:19:37] BrookJustBones: @Nickiatori yes
[1:19:44] Nickiatori: ice bucket chacket!

[1:21:16] rogerivany: Can you get a village in a birch forest?
[1:22:09] Huskey3737: Grab the rose bushes for the chunk?
[1:22:15] Nickiatori: they should i really like the themed villiges
[1:22:27] Huskey3737: shweet

[1:24:01] TXC2: hello its_ya_boy20  welcome
[1:24:31] TXC2: JoeKim  the chunks start inaccessible, you unlock them with certain items
[1:24:37] KodeMage: everything is on fire?
[1:24:41] JoeKim: oooo interesting
[1:24:49] Genie_M: Cool
[1:25:07] Genie_M: The end will be a challenge
[1:25:21] Sarah_Serinde: I'm not sure you do want to go that way :D
[1:25:33] TXC2: so useful Kappa
[1:25:53] noSmokeFire: bonemeal on warped nylium?
[1:25:59] fonkoncle: is this java or bedr?
[1:26:08] Sarah_Serinde: Java
[1:26:21] creasehearst: they hang of the green trees iirc
[1:26:32] Harvest25: Go up
[1:26:33] noSmokeFire: "Applying bone meal on warped nylium occasionally creates 1-block tall twisting vines on any nylium or netherrack nearby."
[1:26:43] TXC2: I'm not sure if we've ever played Bedrock on MoC
[1:26:45] Xed_Regulus: What happens if you move the portal?
[1:26:49] ライシェン: o7
[1:27:01] DudelidouX: Try going up?
[1:27:37] Lirelent: wait till chunks requires stacks of emerald blocks
[1:27:45] Lirelent: (I don't know if that is a thing)
[1:27:51] Dread_Pirate_Westley: Serge is sleeping in James' bed!
[1:27:56] Nickiatori: i feel like you can prbably get softlocked with a bad nether spawn
[1:28:05] TheAinMAP: https://clips.twitch.tv/AgreeableComfortableSwordRalpherZ-j7wXRSSooy1GLQkX
[1:28:20] MarsIsDead: @nickiatori Just move your portal
[1:28:20] Dread_Pirate_Westley: @Nickiatori Then you just go somewhere else and build another portal.
[1:28:22] Lirelent: though could always cheat in items if they get truely soft locked
[1:28:25] Lirelent: by boat
[1:28:25] brieandbacon: ...James
[1:28:29] Lirelent: bye*
[1:28:29] TheShokara: oop
[1:28:32] Angreed66: reminder boats are entities

[1:28:36] MrSarkhan: Wow rude
[1:28:49] Nickiatori: new goal fill the chunk with more boats

[1:30:23] TheAinMAP: https://clips.twitch.tv/BusyTrustworthyTermiteDoritosChip-7vRoMm6WmSpMEIOV
[1:30:40] Angreed66: it is
[1:31:23] TXC2: we need land, it's the one thing they don't make anymore
[1:31:58] TristalMTG: This looks rad, and I've never even played Minecraft
[1:32:20] Angreed66: your previous direction had a new wood type visible in a biome that could also have berries
[1:33:10] Angreed66: still not worth a chunk
[1:33:36] LordZarano: 111!
[1:35:12] TwitchTVsFrank: Is that the flower you need
[1:35:35] noSmokeFire: bees are pretty accessible from growing birch trees next to flowers. More trouble than they're worth? probably

[1:38:05] TXC2: glod!
[1:38:35] TXC2: the Birchlocker
[1:38:36] Angreed66: except that spruce forest

[1:45:22] rogerivany: You even had gold armour in you inventory but wasn't wearing it.
[1:45:23] ipoddodd: It's at most 159 chunks away
[1:45:31] TXC2: this is why you explore in spirals, not in a straight line
[1:45:56] Angreed66: save one for bonemeal later?
[1:46:07] phoenixfeather14: kill the skelie and use the bonemeal

[2:00:28] TXC2: me thinks we need some farms going :p
[2:00:46] rogerivany: Ooh, witch farm
[2:00:46] Dread_Pirate_Westley: Time to build a witch farm.
[2:00:51] beowuuf: what up, dirt
[2:00:59] Spades_Slicc: Waddup Dirt
[2:01:30] Koshindan: Is there an overall map of unlocked chunks?
[2:02:03] Snowcookies: let those bees bee
[2:02:06] baskwalla: One day, a shulker of chunks
[2:02:33] TXC2: Snowcookies  but we need to rub crystals on them Kappa
[2:02:55] beowuuf: @Koshindan this is basically vanilla with a daapack, so they'd need to make the map :)
[2:03:17] CururuGuasu: Many chunks
[2:03:19] Genie_M: This is the birch plane
[2:03:47] TwitchTVsFrank: James you are home
[2:03:55] beowuuf: fun is fun
[2:04:08] LordZarano: @beowuuf The map James got earlier from the shipwreck didn't show locked chunks
[2:04:09] Gadora: I kind of want to see this mixed with a UHC.
[2:04:43] TXC2: "can't argue with having fun" My depression: "are you challenging me?"
[2:04:45] omdorastrix: no uno cows go "Moo" not "ooh"
[2:04:52] LordZarano: @LordZarano Or it did show them? It looked normal is what I'm trying to say
[2:04:53] beowuuf: @LordZarano darn :(
[2:05:07] TXC2: omdorastrix  depends where they're from
[2:05:42] omdorastrix: Leaves
[2:05:59] TwitchTVsFrank: Saplings?
[2:06:06] zeathean: reach out, touch leaves
[2:06:08] beowuuf: nether trees - it's only about 8 'leaves' for one bonemeal
[2:06:17] weekendjedi42: Chop other trees and use their saplings
[2:07:48] beowuuf: tall boi
[2:08:46] yalc321: Comin in to the stream super late, whats the TlDR on this challenge?
[2:09:20] LordZarano: @yalc321 Need resourses to unlock chunks
[2:09:25] TXC2: yalc321  chunks are locked, gotta give an item (like dirt or a block of wood, or 12 honey jars) to unlock
[2:09:36] yalc321: Neat
[2:09:55] yalc321: Is there an end goal to unlocking them?
[2:10:04] Koshindan: A watched sapling will never grow.
[2:10:09] beowuuf: @yalc321 plain vanilla otherwise
[2:10:57] yalc321: Unlocking chunks in the nether and end sounds interesting
[2:11:16] Cptasparagus: serge's crack is pretty?

[2:11:43] Tandtroll_OG: I mean I wouldnt mind seeing more of this
[2:11:45] Quaseymoto: i am suddenly very curious if you would need to unlock chunks in the End DURING the dragon fight
[2:11:48] Quaseymoto: that would be fun chaos
[2:12:04] beowuuf: i mean blue nether area = no critters and mushrooms :)
[2:12:18] yalc321: Look for the forest through the trees
[2:12:44] beowuuf: spruce forest can have village... *fingers crossed*
[2:15:23] yalc321: A chunk of pure sugar
[2:15:28] TXC2: would be nice if the wrong item bounced off the wall instead of being lost to it
[2:15:56] TXC2: Server!
[2:16:20] Angreed66: It does bounce
[2:16:22] LordZarano: What is "respecting the remnants" advancement?
[2:17:05] TXC2: with all the unlocking, are we loading an extremely high number of chunks ?
[2:17:59] omdorastrix: I wonder if it's all the bouncing icons on the borders
[2:18:58] wench_tacular: all berries all the time
[2:19:05] Genie_M: You've been berryblocked
[2:19:36] rogerivany: That's berry annoying
[2:19:36] omdorastrix: Only one person would DARE give james the SweetBerry...
[2:21:04] Dog_of_Myth: lrrBartleby
[2:21:29] Snowcookies: they're berry happy to be there
[2:22:02] Zu_o: with this ruleset you could do the north 100 challenge, where we must go 100 chunks north
[2:22:34] Snowcookies: I guess the game expects you to do some mob hunting
[2:22:38] baskwalla: Uno beat me to it
[2:22:41] TXC2: fai fai faith a!
[2:22:55] LurkerSpine: good old Stealers Wheel
[2:23:02] omdorastrix: Maybe a dungeon nearby?
[2:23:14] Statist42: so whats the endgame here? trying to unlock as many chuncks as possible?
[2:23:36] KeytarCat: @Zu_o That's very good, maybe as a future subathon bit to get some of the other N100 folks in?
[2:23:40] Genie_M: Enjoy
[2:23:54] KeytarCat: @Statist42 The process is the goal
[2:24:07] TXC2: Statist42  no, just the same endgame as vanilla, just with the chunk unlocking making it more challenging
[2:27:24] LordZarano: Getting very close to chunk 256
[2:27:31] Quaseymoto: Potential suggestion / challenge.  This could be a fun mod to mix with the single block races you've been doing.

[2:27:35] frizbehobit: I like the skin
[2:27:51] TwitchTVsFrank: PopNemo PopNemo PopNemo
[2:27:52] frizbehobit: or texture pack.
[2:27:59] JoeKim: you tell em jade
[2:28:05] ShaneLeeAtk: Jade wants to be HEARD
[2:28:07] TheAinMAP: mattlrBork2
[2:28:14] Snowcookies: James uses Faithful texture pack iirc
[2:28:32] Dread_Pirate_Westley: Or combine this with Minecraft Bingo.
[2:28:51] LordZarano: faithful.team iirc?
[2:29:22] Genie_M: Not harder - slower. Much slower
[2:29:34] Quaseymoto: The single block run I felt could be more fun since it is more likely to have you go down different paths.
[2:29:42] TXC2: lrrHORN lrrHORN lrrHORN
[2:29:45] ipoddodd: 2^8!
[2:29:47] TheAinMAP: lrrHORN
[2:29:56] TwitchTVsFrank: It could make normally too easy one item runs interesting
[2:30:01] PsychoI3oy: you have more than enough saplings for the sapling chunk
[2:30:10] LordZarano: A chunk of chunks!
[2:30:20] Quaseymoto: @TwitchTVsFrank  that was my thought. Some of the harder things would probably not be a good stream
[2:30:41] Spades_Slicc: Apparently you can sculpt cream cheese like clay
[2:31:17] Nickiatori: we should build houses out of cream cheese then
[2:31:17] probablyvampires: jlrrCool
[2:31:40] probablyvampires: jlrrCoolgame I meant
[2:32:07] ipoddodd: Is this a one off world, or will they be coming back to this weekly?
[2:32:19] pcglbrock: pcglbrock subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 7 months, currently on a 7 month streak! Thank you for having me
[2:32:20] LRRbot: lrrSPOT Thanks for subscribing, pcglbrock! (Today's storm count: 37)
[2:32:41] TXC2: Nickiatori  slow down there Satan :p
[2:32:57] Angreed66: remember to harvest and not break them
[2:33:01] probablyvampires: PogChamp Berry Edition
[2:33:13] weekendjedi42: Grow them, dont use them
[2:33:27] TXC2: sweat berry baby buggies
[2:34:41] Zu_o: I wonder if this could go a step further and make it so you have to unlock a second step, so you have to unlock building after exploration in the chunk
[2:36:12] Sarah_Serinde: It's Uno's turn to have the good server connection for once
[2:36:26] Nickiatori: server should be in newfoundland, split the differance
[2:36:39] cutetokill: hey james how you doing
[2:36:43] catfoo123: HI
[2:36:56] TXC2: hello cutetokill  and catfoo123  welcome
[2:37:00] LurkerSpine: 63 ish
[2:37:02] DudelidouX: As anyone gonne in the right direction at least?
[2:37:14] LurkerSpine: yeah was about to say
[2:37:25] cutetokill: been watching LRR for years and finally got to catch a live stream
[2:37:28] Tandtroll_OG: I mean working together you might get there, or close
[2:37:30] Nickiatori: 8
[2:37:43] kalira77: if 63 chunks in overworld, then yeah, 8 in nether
[2:37:47] ipoddodd: 125 is 1000/8
[2:37:53] BoatyMcBoatfaceJr: but can you get out of the nether?
[2:37:58] baskwalla: If you make a portal from the nether into the over world can you not enter the portal until you've unlocked the chunk?
[2:38:25] beowuuf: @cutetokill sergeHi
[2:39:02] Nickiatori: notharingbon!
[2:39:08] rogerivany: Serge always builds a house.
[2:39:13] Nickiatori: candle%
[2:39:29] Angreed66: candle is probably farther away than that village
[2:39:36] Nickiatori: time to locate the nearest jungle
[2:39:38] Sarah_Serinde: I'm not sure I'd go that far :D
[2:39:46] Sarah_Serinde: Bees definitely create issues
[2:39:57] TXC2: remember: bees are not the only/best pollinator
[2:40:03] LordZarano: Bees can be created just by growing trees near flowers
[2:40:38] rogerivany: Where did we find melons?
[2:40:46] LurkerSpine: "and I pulled out My Axe!"
[2:41:28] Quaseymoto: did you coordinate check that location?
[2:41:50] Quaseymoto: I feel like you're 300-400 blocks in 1 direction than you were when you checked
[2:43:00] rogerivany: This looks fun.  I downloaded the data pack.  I'm going to try it later.
[2:43:42] Koshindan: Or if the achievement gets relocked after being used.
[2:43:42] Angreed66: Achievement ones are usually maps
[2:43:46] Diabore: JAMES
[2:44:16] PsychoI3oy: the one i've seen uses wolrd border and it expands for each achievement
[2:44:23] RoyGBivSF: Captive Minecraft is a fun one
[2:44:36] PsychoI3oy: yeah, captive minecraft, that's the name
[2:44:40] KeytarCat: Is that exponential?
[2:45:12] RoyGBivSF: captive is a block at a time instead of a chunk
[2:46:20] TXC2: yeah that song is no from me dawg
[2:46:31] Sarah_Serinde: Aw it's singular and everything
[2:46:50] Sarah_Serinde: Quick find another James to join you, it doesn't say anything about multiple Jameses
[2:47:03] yomidian: early game tends to be some of the most interesting stuff in this kind of challenge, imo
[2:47:03] KeytarCat: No Jame Allowed
[2:47:11] wizardwd: I wonder how it would interact with other mods that add ressources
[2:47:30] TXC2: the no Jameses club is allowed one James
[2:48:08] TXC2: lrrFINE
[2:48:11] TheAinMAP: benginFine
[2:48:24] wench_tacular: 1 isn't zero
[2:48:26] Snowcookies: there's some white mushrooms here if you still need them
[2:48:28] KeytarCat: @yomidian Yeah, James mentioned that the endgame for this server would be something like clearing the Brown Candle chunk
[2:48:29] PsychoI3oy: can't you smelt netherrack into netherbrick?
[2:48:41] Nickiatori: that fire looked like it gave you a small double jump
[2:48:46] TXC2: I think shouting "I am alive!" is the HEIGHT of hubris :p
