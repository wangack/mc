[1:10:54] jarvitect: They hired a whole professional dev team to make the map and spent thousands of dollars on it
[1:10:58] JaffaMod: Want to support the streamer and the Yogscast? 75% of donations go directly to the streamer! https://twitch.streamlabs.com/yogscast
[1:10:58] Z0eff: Faaafv ... hmm monkaHmm
[1:10:58] joeblowman: surely they just want to keep the exclusivity of it for a while
[1:11:01] Viztee: They must have paid some coders and artists so much for that holy crap
[1:11:05] ArcticNW: isn't it just the early access that costs that 1000 pounds?
[1:11:05] wombat11265: On the topic of 5up isnt he in the actual Vault Hunters SMP?
[1:11:06] PersephoneHazard: It seems like it cost £50k to make, and is currently only available to people who CONTRIBUTED more than £1k of that. So it's not really for sale at that price IYSWIM.
[1:11:07] starlitesparkl3: Boba found an AE2 alien chip
[1:11:10] ICitizenErasedI: they put in 50k to develop the map
[1:11:11] Mega_R: paying 1000 dollar to beta test
[1:11:14] dribbledevil: it cost 50k to make apparently
[1:11:16] RemedyIsGoth: They know SOMEONE would pay
[1:11:21] osici: It's just a mod, but they hired artists and devs

[1:11:29] PhoticSneezeReflex: KEKW
[1:11:31] jarvitect: They hired a whole professional dev team to make the map and spent thousands of dollars on it, so anyone who contributed money to the costs of making the map has early access. It's not pay to play
[1:11:34] Scaedura: it had new tasks and such as well
[1:11:37] AureliaaX: This part wont make it into the YT cut pcGiggle
[1:11:43] CosmicFrog: It's like a business licence I guess. In the same way that companies have to pay like 10 times more for software than individuals.
[1:11:43] biscuitsandgravy_: 50k in a single map is absurd
[1:11:52] porkydo9: Its for the beta test, full free access is coming later

[1:12:21] tilaron: selective chat reading strikes again LUL
[1:12:21] TheTurtleOhPower: spend 1000 on mince meat butt plugs.
[1:12:21] Basement_baron: is this why yogventures flopped, not enough money
[1:12:24] PersephoneHazard: You can't pay £1k to buy it - it's just that it's currently only available to people who contributed more than £1k to development
[1:12:24] GingerOnTheRoof: hello lads ravsDumper
[1:12:26] artilectXLII: didn't `among us` add 3rd party plugin support to the game over the last year?

[1:12:44] ICitizenErasedI: @biscuitsandgravy_ absolutely not absurd - dev costs more than you think - a new skullgirls character was roughly budgeted at 100k
[1:12:45] SunburnOrk: hryWave Idunyken
[1:12:47] MasterPohTato: if im a content creator for among us content that 1k is an investment in getting more attention i dont understand where the problem is lol
[1:12:49] porkydo9: Its a backer tier which lets you beta test
[1:12:49] fungalgoon: amongass
[1:12:50] stormrage58: A gold butt plug
[1:12:57] mattypea: I got a YT recommendation about a 10yo british boy that won 1k and used it to buy 6 calves
[1:13:00] AureliaaX: Its such an achievement if you can manage to upset Duncan, the man is a well of chill
[1:13:02] Dokga_: Did they spend more money making that one map, then the entire game itself?
[1:13:02] jarvitect: @PersephoneHazard this is correct
[1:13:03] zakarta_: i new it was legit when i had to really look around to find a price, because there where no info anywhere

[1:13:09] Idunyken: SunburnOrk yogHey
[1:13:21] fungalgoon: i got them Gucci cheese clogs
[1:13:26] lord_mada: you know someone out there probably put $1k into yogventures
[1:13:28] ICitizenErasedI: think of it like a kickstarter - people that put in 1k to the kickstarter project get early access. they're not expecting regular peeps to put in 1k
[1:13:33] tilaron: @jarvitect @PersephoneHazard they aren't interested in reading the truth NotLikeThis
[1:13:36] Faaafv: and that's why she is streaming with a potato cam
[1:13:36] Gamers_Couch_AJ: still even if you contribute 1000 to help development, that is practically buying the map for a thousand pounds
[1:13:37] Z0eff: @lord_mada almost certaiunlky
[1:13:38] jarvitect: Also, the guy behind the map is like 20 years old so give him a break guys geez

[1:14:14] fungalgoon: uh oh you forgot your Great Value™ kneecap pass
[1:14:15] Kilaldagren: Thats why I never buy games on Steam Summer sale unless I have been meaning to get it
[1:14:18] molecraft: I'm sad the bees is over
[1:14:21] PunNotFound: basically why everyone i know got Garfield Kart

[1:14:59] Idunyken: Eco has had a few updates
[1:15:00] starlitesparkl3: @Z0eff yes
[1:15:02] MasterPohTato: big streamers make thousands of dollars easily, paying 1k for a map that they play for weeks may as well be free to them
