[3:42:11] Darkaros: Ya he crashed everyone else
[3:42:12] itmeJP: so ill stop logging in
[3:42:26] itmeJP: i put on a relic that i looted that had frost resist on it (a helm)
[3:42:31] itmeJP: and its a bugged model or something
[3:42:33] Sekhcellent: his hat
[3:42:53] itmeJP: if i open my inventory up it crashes
[3:42:56] Prelt: The hat of nuclear fission
[3:43:02] itmeJP: i cant open my normal inventory because it has a 3d model
[3:43:03] Darkaros: Everytime someone (including him) SEES it, it crashes them

[3:43:13] hackett33: character editor program
[3:43:15] Vadar_Vadar: Could a mod remove the Item?
[3:43:16] itmeJP: dark was saying the fix is to commit suicide and never wear that gear again, but then i lose all my current gear lol
[3:43:17] Sekhcellent: can Barry zap it
[3:43:21] ShaiHulud66: kill the armor by attacking it or editor program
[3:43:24] rehvolutionz: Can Barry edit your inventory in a server file?
[3:43:27] Darkaros: Barry can do it
[3:43:29] Darkaros: I think he's bedge though
[3:43:31] narveik: remove trough server files
[3:43:33] Randon_Tain: best answer edit his player nbt file on the server
[3:43:49] Darkaros: ya Barry mentioned NBT as well
[3:43:51] NovaKat72: can other players not pick up your items? (i haven't played minecraft in a hot min)
[3:43:54] 14neo: just have Barry reproduce all your gear for you ijp5HEAD

[3:44:05] CapnSlipp: If it’s a render bug, can you temporarily turn shaders off?
[3:44:07] LootGoblinGrenade: does recovering gear just auto loot all? Can you die, collect, and then just not pick the helm up?
[3:44:10] Sekhcellent: all this "one person is here so we can't do anything"
[3:44:10] hackett33: its not just need access to his character files

[3:44:16] Sekhcellent: isn't*
[3:44:25] Darkaros: also we can't attack his armor either. He crashes us when we render the 3d object LUL
[3:44:27] Randon_Tain: worst, wipe his player file and he loses everything
[3:44:40] Sekhcellent: hate it
[3:44:43] Darkaros: Nah JP can also "just" commit suicide and have the grave with the gear
[3:44:44] Sekhcellent: even when it's me
[3:44:55] Darkaros: Earlier today I had this exact bug with my Relic chestplate
[3:44:58] Vadar_Vadar: There are a couple options sounds like editing the files, mod removes it, dying

[3:45:13] Freeze_wire: I just put on a legendary relic and it crashed my game
[3:45:15] NovaKat72: gassySCREEN
[3:45:17] Randon_Tain: but then he has to get the grave which open the inventory, didn't that make him crash?

[3:45:27] MrSlagle: DAMN IT CHAT, you ruined it...
[3:45:33] NovaKat72: lol
[3:45:34] Randon_Tain: or was it the player model that did that?
[3:45:43] Darkaros: @Randon_Tain You can open your inventory... with a backpack LUL or opening a container in general. You just cant open the normal inventory button cuz of the 3d model
[3:45:55] Icarus_VR: If it's in the grave, or in the inventory and not equipped, it doesn't do the crashing thing, right? Could be as simple as dying and then throwing it out
[3:46:14] Darkaros: Ya but JP doesn't want to lose his good gear which is understandable
[3:46:26] Darkaros: also the grave auto-equips his gear
[3:46:36] Icarus_VR: Oof
[3:46:40] MrSlagle: The statue will be known as "Him", because he is over there in the corner.
[3:47:25] Darkaros: no idea whatsoever SUBprise i had a birb in test servers too and idk
[3:47:44] lonewander1998: couldn't he equip something in the slot that the item that is causing the crash so that when he claims his stuff it doesn't equip
[3:47:56] mopp789: Check the recipe for the feathers
[3:48:13] Darkaros: @lonewander1998 Nope. How do you equip an item when the inventory screen to equip an item has a 3d model that crashes you :p
[3:48:31] Darkaros: Also if you wear something, then open the grave, it'll auto-equip the old grave item
[3:49:11] SombrerBOT: Max streams every day but Sunday! He usually starts between 8-10pmCST.

[3:49:51] CTruelove: possible to toggle grave auto equip?
[3:50:03] Freeze_wire: @Darkaros  is what is crashing the game a chest piece type of thing?
[3:50:19] mopp789: U need a xp farm
[3:50:26] Darkaros: @Freeze_wire It's certain Relics that don't have models. I thought it was just my Chestplate but it's also JP's Helm
[3:50:57] Freeze_wire: I was asking cause I just ran into this problem on my own save
[3:51:08] Darkaros: Be very careful about equipping any future non-ring/neck Relics in case of more crashing models
[3:51:10] Sekhcellent: !bs
[3:51:10] SombrerBOT: UNLESS MAX ASKS CHAT SPECIFICALLY, please do not backseat game. Mods will let you know if you have gone too far, so please respect their guidance.

[3:52:10] tapatochips: Pog
[3:52:41] ShaiHulud66: dont waste your diamonds on hoes tho
[3:52:43] mopp789: Is there a better armor then netherrigh?
[3:52:58] ThaProfessor11: gassyGASP platySUH
[3:53:09] Sekhcellent: @shaihulud66 damn man. hoes deserve diamonds too
[3:53:16] Freeze_wire: @Darkaros  do you know of a way to unequip the item?
[3:53:37] Freeze_wire: sorry for asking multiple questions but no idea who else to ask
[3:53:51] Darkaros: @Freeze_wire Nope SUBprise Look into NBT editing if you're single player. Or just die and have the bugged item unequipped into a grave. You can move everything not-equipped into a chest at least
[3:54:14] ShaiHulud66: so basicly he has to go jump in lava
[3:54:42] BethFreemanArtist: Riker is being SUPER responsive with how he should treat yam it’s cute
[3:54:47] Freeze_wire: @Darkaros  thank you, sounds like the easiest option

[4:12:10] Sekhcellent: shit on their shelves NODDERS
[4:12:37] softestprince: very common practice, shitting on shelves
[4:12:37] MojoAI: That button 🔁 in the crafting table is part of the Polymorph mod. "When a group of ingredients matches more than one recipe, a button will appear above the output slot. Pushing this button will show a list of all possible results and selecting one will change the crafting output to match. Polymorph will also remember the last selection as long as the ingredients don't change, so repeated crafting actions are possible on the same selection." (for crafting & smelting) @GassyMexican
[4:12:38] WDForty: ??
[4:12:52] Cryocian: bro, it was started in like 2005, and they immediately tried to sell it as a time-honored tradition, lol
[4:12:52] softestprince: elf on the shelf is very creepy. hate it so much
[4:12:56] oiseauxmorts: I hate it because customers constantly ask for it
[4:12:59] Sekhcellent: teaching kids about government surveillance NODDERS

[4:14:01] MojoAI: meaning a certain crafting recipe may have diff outputs
[4:14:06] WDForty: it sounds like to me cycling between like an oak door vs birch door, etc.

[4:26:03] Cryocian: just wipe your eyes
[4:26:12] MojoAI: i think it's because the progress bar is going down on the item, it's more of a Minecraft thing
[4:26:28] Moogles1: so what is the basic idea

[4:27:47] Darkaros: @SirLuc2 it equips over, yep
[4:27:59] sirluc2: that's unfortunate.
[4:28:26] Darkaros: The modpack devs are aware and suspect it's a mod compatibility thing cuz models werent broken pre-update

[4:45:03] MojoAI: mending is great
[4:45:10] WDForty: mending doesn't take all the xp
[4:45:12] ChaYumiko: Mending is good for weapon repair
[4:45:13] Darkaros: actually a big find
[4:45:16] Xanderan_Madman: Minecraft has really evolved over the years.
[4:45:25] WDForty: mending is super useful

[4:45:26] SombrerBOT: https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/medieval-mc-fabric
[4:45:35] WDForty: vanilla allows mending on weapons
[4:45:38] tunannif: I think weapons count as tools
[4:45:40] Darkaros: a sword is a tool for the purpose of killing monsters :)
[4:45:51] MojoAI: say if you had mending on all armor slots, once those items are fully repaired any other xp would go to your bar
[4:45:57] MojoAI: same with tools and weapons
[4:46:00] ShaiHulud66: @Darkaros a stabby tool :)
[4:46:05] WDForty: how about on your relic?
[4:46:05] 14neo: yeah
[4:46:09] Water_Cat1: no, just applies to that one when you pick up XP
[4:46:09] 14neo: just to the thing you apply it to
[4:46:11] CapnSlipp: Has Gassy not played normal, vanilla Minecraft in the last 8 or so years?
[4:46:12] MojoAI: yes
[4:46:13] WDForty: yea, only on the enchanted piece
[4:46:17] Xanderan_Madman: Not gonna lie boss, I have no idea
[4:46:23] MojoAI: mending only applies to the item it's on

[4:46:50] ShaiHulud66: not unless there is an arcana mod that lets you inscribe it
[4:46:52] WDForty: cool
[4:46:55] Morderalptraum: there might be a mod that can dupe it
[4:46:57] MojoAI: put it on everything eventually 🤷󠀂♂️
[4:47:02] WDForty: grindstone
[4:47:04] 14neo: Grindstone and book is it?
[4:47:05] WDForty: item + book
[4:47:44] StygianIkazuchi: ok this modpack looks neat. I may need to try it out
[4:47:52] MojoAI: grindstone i believe just removes enchantments and gives you whatever xp it'll provide
[4:48:02] jwoody92: axialTalon
[4:48:05] MojoAI: i could be wrong tho
[4:48:19] ShaiHulud66: thats a huge dragon in the distance, you should tilt at it
[4:48:32] ShaiHulud66: don quixote ref sorry lol
[4:48:43] Darkaros: @MojoAI idk if it's a mod or vanilla and i've just been dumb but you can extract it with a book too, that's the purpose of second slot

[4:58:20] Dopiestshark: for it to just be quiet then suddenly from no where the villager hmm
[4:58:26] Dopiestshark: with an echo effect on too
