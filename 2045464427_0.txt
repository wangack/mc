[2:31:04] PurpleSquirrel1503: ALOO Silly
[2:31:04] Sillythy: Thank you to Mono! linkzzeyBits
[2:31:25] gustifo: A frog goes into a bank and approaches the teller. He can see from her nameplate that the teller’s name is Patricia Whack. So he says, “Ms. Whack, I’d like to get a loan to buy a boat and go on a long vacation.” Patti looks at the frog in disbelief and asks how much he wants to borrow.
[2:31:47] Sillythy: I am thank you Peepi just been on holiday, but glad to be back linkzzeyCozy
[2:31:50] gustifo: The frog says $30,000.  The teller asks his name and the frog says that his name is Kermit Jagger, his dad is Mick Jagger, and that it’s OK, he knows the bank manager.
[2:31:52] MandaLin: linkzzeyDed it's the same joke all the time
[2:31:56] Amandroid: curvyeBlank
[2:32:04] gustifo: Patti explains that $30,000 is a substantial amount of money and that he will need to secure some collateral against the loan. She asks if he has anything he can use as collateral.  The frog says, “Sure. I have this,” and produces a tiny pink porcelain elephant, about half an inch tall, bright pink and perfectly formed.
[2:32:09] Sillythy: ALOO Squirrel shyHug
[2:32:15] jestom7: I have another one for you. What has one eye,but can't see
[2:32:26] gustifo: Very confused, Patti explains that she’ll have to consult with the manager and disappears into a back office.  She finds the manager and says “There’s a frog called Kermit Jagger out there who claims to know you and wants to borrow $30,000. He wants to use this as collateral.” She holds up the tiny pink elephant. “I mean, what the heck is this?”
[2:32:33] gustifo: you asked, I am delivering :)
[2:32:50] gustifo: The bank manager looks back at her and says: “It’s a knick knack, Patti Whack. Give the frog a loan. His old man’s a Rolling Stone”

[2:56:26] iGirlGeek: But yes, when you're old, you'll be long sighted, but lasik should correct the short sightedness
