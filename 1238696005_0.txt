[0:57:19] BannedKidd: Housing market exploded because a lot of people were unhappy with how their state was handling COVID and left. California for example.
[0:57:19] Masterfelly: Masterfelly subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 56 months! 
[0:57:21] Miestro: I expected a year maybe year and a half
[0:57:22] ba_nanananananana: turns out the worst is still ahead
[0:57:24] ClumsyZombie: LOL my   Work From Home started March 14th 2019
[0:57:26] Bearded__Wonder: someone explained to me that the theory is all the people that planned on miving for the first year of the pandemic couldn't and caused a kind of backup so when they were able to there was a surge of people buying houses
[0:57:26] cwwcww: where else would you put your money
[0:57:26] Miestro: but we're bast that
[0:57:28] bigrig107: @giantwaffle I was a roof salesman during the height of Covid and I made a killing in commission from older homeowners having extra money from stimulus and just sitting at home
[0:57:29] roguerray: Will eventually hurt when prices go back to normal and the houses built with the expensive overly priced material is only valued at low cost.
[0:57:30] Bearded__Wonder: thats the theory at least
[0:57:32] KABBL: 2 weeks max I thought ...PepoSad
[0:57:33] FlipFlipFlaparoo: I expected a year
[0:57:35] philip0524: Isnt the housing market a huge bubble?

[0:58:12] mrb0808: @stonan the spreading
[0:58:20] Driitzz: is there a tick lag ? PauseChamp
[0:58:21] kleokl7: as someone who's studying economics and loved macro economics, they absolutely created a bubble that's going to bust in their faces just like in 2008
[0:58:23] gman0821: they have to increase them
[0:58:24] DeMayon: increase in june next year, fed plans to reduce their bond purchases by march
[0:58:27] Lycam: @Giantwaffle My house is on the fringe of a big city in a cheaper suburb. The value has increased 100k in a year.

[0:58:35] Cametes101: vertigo effect
[0:58:35] Qwertynen: the whitelist link isnt working for me hmm
[0:58:35] Miestro: because it can always mutate to something worse if I'm not mistaken @stonan
[0:58:35] FilodoxiaTV: distortion?
[0:58:37] Lupic: you can disable that affect entirely in the video settings
[0:58:40] Lorilath: uk just raised interest rates
[0:58:41] DesertNavy: Rates up 3 times in 2022
[0:58:45] yonikasz2: Nah man biden printed too much money Jerome gonna raise the rates
[0:58:46] mitmiter: thats a setting for speed to change FOV
[0:58:46] Peace_Warrior: view bobbing? you can turn it off
[0:58:48] Lupic: "Gameplay can adjust FoV" or something
[0:58:54] Dojolego: !mc
[0:58:54] Moobot: Waffle is playing on his vanilla 1.18.1 sub server. How can you join? Gotta be a Sub and first join the whitelist.giantwaffle.tv server to get whitelisted. Once that's done you can join the mc.giantwaffle.tv sub server. Note: there is a link you'll click in the whitelist server chat.
[0:58:56] GoombaCake: Fed is fked imo. no matter what they do it'll be bad
[0:58:58] HyperKitty_: @stonan it's incredibly infectious, higher cases numbers, so even if the % is lower, hospitalisations will still be significant
[0:58:58] Yogithebaer: they keep moving it up it was originally no increase until 2023
[0:59:00] MrHashbrowns: fov bug
[0:59:02] DeMayon: no, they actually pushed it up. bond purchases were supposed to end in June. They moved it up to march
[0:59:08] Lupic: just disable the sprint fov effect
[0:59:09] Widdie: its a bug with the dynamic FOV i think
[0:59:12] fry_like_a_pirate: catJAM
[0:59:13] kleokl7: they can't stop abruptly, lobbying is stopping them as well, if they increase rates and stop buying, the market will crash the next day
[0:59:14] That_Guyy_: LUL
[0:59:15] SeriousPotatoBot: gachiBASS
[0:59:18] Lycam: @Giantwaffle You're rubberbanding
[0:59:20] Marabou_Dude: catJAM
[0:59:23] Lupic: it's been in the game forever too lol
[0:59:24] Lupic: yeah
[0:59:27] Gh3ttoboy: what is your fov
[0:59:27] Chronoes: you can reduce it with the FOV distortion setting in graphics
[0:59:28] Fufcia: just bind sprint to button instead of double tapping W
[0:59:28] Narcotical: That is kinda fuckywucky
[0:59:28] Lycam: @Giantwaffle The server doesn't know if you're running or walking.
[0:59:28] produkteriswf: ye
[0:59:31] mechoriet: could be cause its lagging
[0:59:35] Hurtwolf: limited coding skills Kappa
[0:59:36] AComfyKnight: dynamic fov
[0:59:36] Zuiuzz: it happens after tapping W 3 times instead of 2 i guess
[0:59:41] Baenjamin: is it a bug if it is intentional?
[0:59:43] merscever: @Giantwaffle reduce fov effects in options -> accessibility settings
[0:59:48] Driitzz: are you using double tap W to sprint ? that might be the issue i always used Ctrl
[0:59:48] OMICRON: lol i just thought you were just stopping and going
[0:59:49] Deathu: are you double pressing w to sprint ? @Giantwaffle
[0:59:52] Othixz: They've also stated that they're doing 3 interest rate increases next year instead of the 1 they had planned.
[0:59:53] Th3ScaryGary: you can turn it off in bedrock.
[0:59:53] C0ldPlasma: @stonan becauce thats not true
[0:59:56] Myekos: looks intentional, to give a visual clue to speed
[0:59:58] very_appreciate: is it even a bug if it's been in that long?
[1:00:03] resku89: Its probably the RAM LUL
[1:00:04] BenjaminBen_: @Giantwaffle what did you do yesterday?
[1:00:05] Deathu: you should just switch to using ctrl to toggle run
[1:00:06] FlammAlpha: when sprinting by using CTRL it's less often
[1:00:08] DeMayon: use ctrl to run
[1:00:11] Hurtwolf: its not a bug, its a feature 4Head
[1:00:13] reefz___: bind sprint to a key instead of W and it wont happen @Giantwaffle
[1:00:13] Manapool_GB: Its going to be 3 months lock down i personally think 2022 is already done
[1:00:15] fry_like_a_pirate: happens with ctrl too
[1:00:25] lcePops: Double W is what does that
[1:00:25] Fufcia: I never had this issue when I had sprint binded to different button
[1:00:25] ItsANoBrainer: double W is only way to run KEKW
[1:00:31] gman0821: double W gang KKona
[1:00:33] Inasnum_Mitis: His keyboard doesn't have ctrl Kappa
[1:00:34] Chronoes: there was no run back in they day, just walk KEKW
[1:00:38] ItsANoBrainer: I bet you use I for inventory too
[1:00:40] FilodoxiaTV: Sure gramps Kappa
[1:00:45] Lupic: back in my day sprint wasn't even a thing
[1:00:46] Deathu: btw waffle guardians suck
[1:00:49] Narcotical: quadruple u
[1:00:50] Myekos: that would make it quadu right?
[1:00:51] ShayeBlackwood: Ctrl is for crouching, heathens.
[1:00:51] Lazdrin: yeah
[1:00:51] HyperKitty_: I always rebind it to shift

[1:01:02] Chronoes: E is default I think
[1:01:02] Hurtwolf: i use E as well
[1:01:03] ItsANoBrainer: I always used I, and then I switched to E after they moved it from I to E
[1:01:03] FIatEarth: WutFace people don't use E?
[1:01:04] DirtyMarshMallo: e
[1:01:06] AleXanDreMau: Tab
[1:01:06] novemberan: e
[1:01:07] ManInBlackYOO: lol ee is the default key
[1:01:11] waluki: @Giantwaffle Buying any NFTs?
[1:01:12] Manapool_GB: Always E
[1:01:12] kleokl7: nr. 1 law of economics "If inflation goes up, unemployment goes down", if that is not the case, it means that you're cheating the system and you will get into trouble trying to rebalance (aka deflation)
[1:01:15] Zemy: supernatural? monkaS
[1:01:15] ba_nanananananana: F11 for inventory for me
[1:01:16] sam8825: now? you mean it always way?
[1:01:18] AleXanDreMau: e to see players
[1:01:22] merscever: i use arrow keys to move :)
[1:01:23] Gh3ttoboy: E has been default since forever
[1:01:24] Hurtwolf: in battle royales. TAB is recommended
[1:01:25] rykk3r1: tab is always scoreboard
[1:01:26] fry_like_a_pirate: i play apex so i just want it to remain consistent
[1:01:33] Warkless: i think it as "i" at one point NODDERS
[1:01:35] FalseMann: The FOV thing isn't a bug, you can disable it in Accessibility settings
[1:01:42] JommyBee: Sadge
[1:01:56] Iksess: use beds tssk
[1:01:57] Moobot: You can find Waffle's Youtube channel here - https://youtube.com/giantwaffle
[1:02:02] Chronoes: @FalseMann it is a bug if it zooms in and out while spriting. it's fine when it just zooms in
[1:02:05] AnesthesiaFC: just start blasting the whole area
[1:02:17] BenjaminBen_: I think you look good when you are visually sprinting KappaPride

[1:07:05] Xmitty: @Giantwaffle Spark was ported to 1.18. It's a great profiling tool for servers to diagnose where the tps spikes are coming from exactly.

[1:10:47] brightcandle: You want balance, if you give it too much it will spend a lot of time garbage collecting
[1:10:50] Tabakhase: look at "free -m" - 90% of that memroy will be "cached" aka disk-cache that autodrops if needed
[1:10:55] GoombaCake: free -h
[1:10:57] subfin: subfin subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 10 months!

[1:26:44] Goldenlion5648: why did you ban a mod?
[1:26:46] mechoriet: you will still get the join and leave loggings cause the ban check happens after the join stuff
[1:26:47] nfguler: d i r t
[1:26:50] ninopanda: do you need me to take a look at it?
[1:26:57] mahoraz: he probably has a client up thats in an erronous state (of trying to reconnect)
[1:27:10] Kaomie: Is it actually a mod or someone spoofing
[1:27:17] mechoriet: well or Pepega mojang code
[1:27:27] Lazdrin: make beds and blow some shit up

[1:27:32] kyanpeppaa: need the beds to make it quickk
[1:27:32] HiddenEpiphany: can anyone join the server?

[1:27:34] turtlebear02: tnt my dude
[1:27:34] 0rangelight: What was lagging the server?
[1:27:35] Minelmonia: how many have you got in total so far?
[1:27:37] DirtyMarshMallo: bed strat is pretty good early game
[1:27:40] Iksess: no beds = no netherite peepoSad

[1:27:48] HiddenEpiphany: thanks @Larklen
[1:27:51] ninopanda: @giantwaffle I pretty much will not be playing on the server, so if you need help with the back end I am free
[1:27:54] camels13: becase this is not how you mine for netheride
[1:27:58] Thurlas: maybe he's so terrible that he even fails to disconnect OpieOP
[1:27:59] MusWoW: eff4 on netherite pickaxe + mending you'll find some reaaaally fast
[1:28:15] Blockmann317: Hey, how do we join server?
[1:28:19] Invalidm_: @ninopanda you won't? Sadge

[1:28:23] Moobot: Waffle is playing on his vanilla 1.18.1 sub server. How can you join? Gotta be a Sub and first join the whitelist.giantwaffle.tv server to get whitelisted.

[1:28:23] tvtoddy: Mine at chunk borders
[1:28:24] Warkless: enchant pickaxe Susge

[1:28:26] AleXanDreMau: @Giantwaffle go spend some H on get mending and efficiency 5

[1:28:49] Cannonboot: @Giantwaffle yo waffle, have you learned java?
[1:28:49] MusWoW: i crafted pickaxe first and after an hour I was full netherite
[1:28:58] Dagmoo: i mean you took significant breaks to fix server too
[1:29:08] Invalidm_: Oh yeah I guess
[1:29:12] Larklen: KEKW
[1:29:15] Iksess: didnt you have enchanting table at spawn
[1:29:26] daemonaedryn: Isnt it like the rarest ore in the game?
[1:29:37] MusWoW: @larklen got ur diamonds back?
[1:29:41] Frag_Magnet_: These only generate twice per chunk in veins of 1-3.
[1:29:43] Shantrix: what of someone X-Rey them all and put the blocks back monkaS
[1:29:43] Deathu: maybbe you are just unlucky waffle
[1:29:56] kyanpeppaa: I like enchanting diamond stuff then upgrading since you can perfect enchant easier w/o books on gear
[1:29:57] Blockmann317: better to use the bed method for this right?
[1:29:58] Larklen: @MusWoW NODDERS
[1:29:59] Gh3ttoboy: also digging in 1 line isnt really efficient try going a few blocks the skip 2 blocks
[1:30:03] Iksess: you can enchant diamond and then upgrade it to netherite
[1:30:07] Dagmoo: just make pick before armor?
[1:30:11] Julklappen: Don't you have enought or a netherite pick?
[1:30:25] daemonaedryn: It is also heavily luck based, the chances on a 1x2 tunnel hitting exactly the same coords as the debris will be placed in must be tiny
[1:30:40] MusWoW: @larklen monkaS
[1:30:52] sinar_ap: sinar_ap subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 13 months! <3
[1:30:52] daemonaedryn: There was a guy selling mending books for like 2 diamonds yesterday

[1:30:55] fry_like_a_pirate: there is one but i think someone said he's claimed
[1:30:56] Mr_Fungi: mending villager at spawn but its under claim
[1:30:56] Invalidm_: Technically deepslate coal ore is now the rarest ore Kappa
[1:30:58] Hurtwolf: somebody make a villager trading hall :)

[1:31:10] MusWoW: in spaen
[1:31:12] Larklen: thought there was one at spawn yeah
[1:31:13] MusWoW: spawn
[1:31:13] Mapleton: @Mr_Fungi no longer
[1:31:16] Iksess: if people are doing villagers correct, they should have 1 emerald mending book
[1:31:19] Sandiro1: It is not claimen anymore
[1:31:26] Kaomie: People in chat ruining the economy giving out mending books Kappa
[1:31:30] MusWoW: oh
[1:31:34] Hurtwolf: @Iksess you get that by saving a zombie villager right?
[1:31:42] Iksess: @Iksess YEP
[1:31:43] Invalidm_: why fix it?
[1:31:44] MusWoW: is he expensive tho
[1:31:44] Larklen: Not under claim anymore
[1:31:53] daemonaedryn: A netherite pick has 2k durability
[1:31:58] MusWoW: i know some guy sells mending book for 1 diamond
[1:31:58] BenjaminBen_: People making a line for food on day 1 and queue for mending book day 3, the grinders
[1:32:06] o_Note_o: You mine quartz and shit to get exp
[1:32:11] Iksess: @Iksess if game difficulty on hard, you can zombi any villager, then cure him and he will give you discount forever
[1:32:12] TRAYW1N: plus i breaking 3 it’s 2k
[1:32:13] Rottastic: xp farms are very slow with this amount online
[1:32:14] listikuss: Is this vanilla?
[1:32:20] Invalidm_: best xp farm is gonna come from the end.
[1:32:30] SirKaelan: You should probably get a torch for these gravel patches
[1:32:31] timichango: i believe u should add ur enchantments to diamond pickaxe first and then make it netherite, cuz if u will try to add some enchantments to netherite pickaxe it will say its too expensive or something
[1:32:32] Kaomie: Sell the quartz to Waffle
[1:32:38] BenjaminBen_: Invalidm_ leaf it there LUL
[1:32:41] TRAYW1N: we have quartz at spawn you should look at the chests when you go
[1:32:54] SirKaelan: Oh shit, okay LUL

[2:12:03] punkgeek: Netflix used to ban or block folks for that but they gave up a while back
[2:12:04] Bearded__Wonder: yea i never liked that tbh because isn't it the copmany that get in trouble for when you bypass region locks?
[2:12:04] general_jim_bot: because people aren't smart enough to know the real reasons VPNs are useful

[2:12:16] randomkatka: Because region locking shouldn't be a thingn
[2:12:20] merscever: feels like something netlix and disney would sue vpns for

[2:12:26] Turbologic: use VPN you can download torrents KEKW
[2:12:27] WoofWoofDude: netflix & comp blocks most vpns now days
[2:12:28] enderslug: Region looking is rude
[2:12:28] stormblaz: its to protect economic balance
[2:12:29] BenjaminBen_: apparently it's a thing for twitch subbing as well
[2:12:30] Chauxz: Maybe they've sold to most people who use VPN for security and are not targeting people who dont care about that side of things?
[2:12:30] melo_signed: its not illegal to bypass region locking thats why they advertise it
[2:12:32] SupaStevo: @merscever they have lol
[2:12:36] stormblaz: taxes
[2:12:41] Chauxz: not = now
[2:12:42] Myekos: region locking is a sovereign nation thing

[2:13:23] cranberryleaf: region locking def makes sense. you can't be charging russians 80$ USD for something they can't afford it
[2:13:25] officialhunterx: isnt reion locking because of licensing
[2:13:25] Allmostdone: Wow. That’s strict

[3:54:27] Wrezl: maybe its maybelene
[3:54:27] Miestro: it could be long GC times depending ont he garbage collector with a 16g heap too
[3:54:29] mechoriet: probbly not KEKW
[3:54:34] daemonaedryn: Turn off the server, and disable them 1 by 1 to check?
[3:54:35] Wyatt_Earth: oh. any of the plugins red when you do /plugins?

[3:55:04] mechoriet: thats a startup generator
[3:55:23] Tabakhase: also install "htop" and "iotop" to check the host itself is good =)
[3:55:24] Charlesiv: that line changes the GC you use, i think he's wanting to changer the heap size
[3:55:27] mechoriet: 12 gigs should be enough
[3:55:35] HiveTyrantSlippy: KEKW

[4:00:19] mechoriet: can you show the list
[4:00:25] mechoriet: in sublime

[4:01:19] BayrAttack: Both
[4:01:19] mechoriet: now retry

[4:01:59] Larklen: KEKW
[4:02:01] babyaddalyn: @HouseOfDoggus https://startmc.sh/
[4:02:05] Xerexos_: KEKW
[4:02:08] fishypooos: I agree, messing with your own server is so much more fun
[4:02:09] LUCIFER_RA: it had the naughty word KEKW
[4:02:09] Netfreq: Ctrl-z will pause a process, then you can fg or bf that pod (foreground or background)
[4:02:10] Larklen: @Tabakhase refresh KEKW
[4:02:11] Tabakhase: monkaX moobot
[4:02:12] ThatOnneGuy: KEKW that moobot bop took me a sec to figure out
[4:02:12] Potato_79_: yoooooooo hi
[4:02:23] Netfreq: Er, bg
[4:02:31] Larklen: PauseChamp did it fix the lag
[4:02:32] Wyatt_Earth: @Giantwaffle From a players perspective it's very nice to see a server owner taking action against lag. One of the best things you could show me as a paying customer (if im boiling this down). Thanks so much <3
[4:02:38] luminousAJ: ssh 192.168.1.1
[4:02:39] L707644: @Tabakhase you used a naughty word w/o the s LUL
[4:02:39] Hurtwolf: lag fixed? PauseChamp
[4:02:49] deja_foo: you can ssh straight from powershell without putty
[4:02:52] NephilimXS: wait, even with out linux subsystem installed?
[4:02:52] mechoriet: @Giantwaffle its probbly gonna lag still but not the stutters :) cause the flags doesnt fix lag
[4:02:54] simik2: but how do you manage keys without putty?
[4:02:57] KnickKen: PepeHands Putty
[4:03:00] TCaillet: TCaillet subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 8 months! 
[4:03:01] Netfreq: Just install vscode (it’s free) and you can open remote shell from that
[4:03:01] 514484: been like that for ages
[4:03:03] Tabakhase: @L707644 oh i ee LULW
[4:03:03] fishypooos: no
[4:03:05] JareBear: no
[4:03:06] Gliderman: you can also use the Ubuntu subsystem
[4:03:07] drissical: they are not the same
[4:03:09] ashooby: windows comes with openssh these days
[4:03:11] 3poundChickenWing: cmd works in powershell, not vice versa
[4:03:18] cmmeth: it has more power
[4:03:18] Dank_Pleb: can you use RSA keys with powershell tho?
[4:03:18] fishypooos: powershell is a different shell
[4:03:18] Tabakhase: its different terminals LUL
[4:03:20] Larklen: You can also SSH over IPoAC :0
[4:03:21] Xerexos_: I ssh into my rpi :)
[4:03:23] SamDabbers: cmd is dos basically
[4:03:30] PaulFlies: powershell has a whole different set of commands
[4:03:30] K4shira: imagine using putty when there is securecrt
[4:03:31] ChefGromboli: PowerShell has it's own language, CMD is the default Windows CLI.
[4:03:33] ZyianDev: powershell is more powerful and more modern
[4:03:33] forthereals: have you switched to Terminal in Win11 instead of cmd?
[4:03:38] Hot_Rodster: cmd is old win before gui
[4:03:41] Larklen: IP over Avian Carriers pepeLaugh
[4:03:43] luminousAJ: he's meming LUL
[4:03:44] Gliderman: internet protocol over avian carrier
[4:03:44] Hot_Rodster: yes
[4:03:45] teddytalent: yes
[4:03:47] Hurtwolf: poweshell is from 2006. cmd is 1981
[4:03:48] ChefGromboli: If you do a lot of WIndows work.
[4:03:49] DeadeyeWolff: yes
[4:03:49] FlammAlpha: I work in PowerShell :)
[4:03:51] Miestro: for windows devs
[4:03:51] fishypooos: on windows yes
[4:03:53] 3poundChickenWing: very good for windows admin
[4:03:58] teddytalent: you can do everything in powershell
[4:03:58] JareBear: for windows shops yeah
[4:03:58] ZyianDev: Powershell for Windows, Bash for Linux
[4:03:59] luminousAJ: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_over_Avian_Carriers
[4:04:10] CakeYay: its good for IT Admins
[4:04:11] bcollinstex: good for admin stuff
[4:04:14] Miestro: thanks LuminousAJ just what the world needed
[4:04:14] deja_foo: Powershell will eventually take over :)
[4:04:15] devoidglow: use the furnace to check
[4:04:16] Gliderman: IPoAC has the highest bandwidth of any protocol
[4:04:19] DeadeyeWolff: break some blocks
[4:04:23] Allmostdone: yea the latest stupid ransomware was written in powershell
[4:04:24] LUCIFER_RA: try item pickup
[4:04:24] 0v3rfl0w: admins yes, developers nope
[4:04:24] Netfreq: Use vscode, then remote shell from that, install your database pluggins and cli to mongo/oracle/MySQL, etc
[4:04:25] Makaheehee: Drop something and pick it up
[4:04:26] Tabakhase: cmd is all thats left of DOS Sadge
[4:04:27] simik2: drop and pickup
[4:04:29] GeneraISpy: drop something
[4:04:35] NephilimXS: Windows Subsystem for linux and just ssh that way tessSHRUG
[4:04:35] L707644: ^
[4:04:42] SkibbezZ: Sadge @Tabakhase
[4:04:44] matey1116: just do /tps
[4:04:46] Minelmonia: @Tabakhase del *.*
[4:04:48] Makaheehee: Always better. Kappa
[4:04:51] teddytalent: its the players plugin Kappa remove all other players and boom solved
[4:04:59] MrTiiltLoord: try it
[4:05:01] HouseOfDoggus: Would you consider dynmap?
[4:05:02] Wyatt_Earth: @Giantwaffle I assume you have ClearLagg installed
[4:05:05] fishypooos: @ZyianAzen i mean python is more accurate comparison. PowerShell has a crap ton of modules rather than just built stuff  on the OS
[4:05:06] mechoriet: can you show that error
[4:05:09] luminousAJ: generating the arrays at the wrong size
[4:05:13] Tabakhase: define " a lot" - unless its a per-frame thing it likely isnt tooo much to worry...
[4:05:17] mechoriet: if there is no leaking info in it
[4:05:17] aledantee: Trace calulcations monkaX
[4:05:27] ashooby: should try the shenandoah garbage collector if your jdk has it
[4:05:35] Wyatt_Earth: absolutely
[4:05:37] Xerexos_: ci personally causing the lag
[4:05:37] babyaddalyn: spark but idk for paper
[4:05:38] mechoriet: timings
[4:05:41] mechoriet: spark
[4:05:47] Xerexos_: spark
[4:05:47] Amcro: is this vanilla?
[4:05:51] Zuiuzz: depending on the amount of exceptions they could partially be the reason for lag -> writing log files takes time as well
[4:05:51] mechoriet: spark is deep
[4:05:55] Tabakhase: there are fancy TPS-map tools yea, but no clue if 1.18 for all those fancy thingys
[4:05:55] mechoriet: analisis
[4:06:00] CorSPACE: spark is fabric isn tit
[4:06:08] SkibbezZ: just get a better server Kappa

[4:07:02] SolarisFall: nice
[4:07:05] mechoriet: @deja_foo its not :)
[4:07:13] Makaheehee: But do you have a lag "spike" or is it just .. lag? Kappa
[4:07:19] mechoriet: tick monitoring doesnt give any information what is doing it

[4:07:59] Miestro: that's the package hierarchy to percent of tick time usage
[4:08:01] deja_foo: @mechoriet Yeah, i'm dumb. I just clicked the link. I typed before looking / thinking. lmao
[4:08:03] NinjaInSpandex: does 1.18 paper have the same bug from 1.17?  zombies would pickup the drops from the dead squids in caves and never despawn
[4:08:03] mechoriet: @aledantee pepeLaugh DFU is aids
[4:08:07] Miestro: can it generate flame graphs/

Paper also includes the next version of Timings, enabling you to quickly find out what's slowing down your server."
[4:09:22] prairydog: 🤓
[4:09:24] babyaddalyn: it will tell you what function is is causing lag and you will can trace it back to a mod if its a mod doing it or pure mc
[4:09:27] simik2: HACKERMANS
[4:09:30] mechoriet: by doing /timings on and after a while /timings report

[4:26:03] mechoriet: there are recommendations for settings below

[4:27:43] EBrarian: time for some mob caps ?
[4:27:43] Zuiuzz: its 70 per player
[4:27:45] LUCIFER_RA: waffle i found a link that has some tips for optimizing server, maybe you will find possible solution there https://github.com/YouHaveTrouble/minecraft-optimization
[4:27:45] DatSparrow: @zedvawn is tha the minimum version tho, cause I know it supports that but its depentent on how waffle installed the server. You can get about a 40% boost in server performance from like java 8/9 to 17
[4:27:46] mechoriet: thats default
[4:27:52] chuckymax: per player yeah
[4:27:53] babyaddalyn: edit buikkit.yml and adjus spawn-limits: and its per player around them
[4:27:54] silv: im gonna collect every 313 axolotl in the game :)
[4:28:00] PODD: maybe start by cutting your numbers in half
[4:28:00] Mbkuling: 70 per player?
[4:28:10] mahajimbo: MONKERS they know

[4:28:33] Zuiuzz: yes 70 per player
[4:28:38] raiju_soul: @Blazedasthesun huh. they might need to execute some axolotls. :)
[4:28:43] zedvawn: @DatSparrow Yes, my understanding is you must run atleast Java 17
[4:28:50] babyaddalyn: fine? 80*70 = not fine
[4:28:51] mechoriet: yes but enity's are very heavy on servers
[4:28:56] Narcotical: The creatures are twice the limit though, no?
[4:28:58] DatSparrow: @zedvawn Good to know. Thanks. :)

[4:46:23] Variosit: sqquids
[4:46:24] Rob_Kebab: oh maybe not
[4:46:24] Tompop23: Is it just because of how many chunks are loaded from everyone.
[4:46:24] Variosit: bats
[4:46:25] FlipFlipFlaparoo: Anything above 15 is probably best
[4:46:27] Variosit: bickens
[4:46:29] daemonaedryn: theres a lot of chickens at spawn
[4:46:32] NodBabe: @Giantwaffle Fireplace died :(
[4:46:34] Zuiuzz: bats do

[4:46:42] Mr_Fungi: @tigerman1983 other streamers also dont like learning it like waffle does
[4:46:46] zedvawn: I would bet that is just the amount of loaded chunks
[4:46:59] Calls1gn: the fire :(

[4:49:31] RemST: dead fish in the caves?
[4:49:31] Variosit: you can find out what mobs are spawning in your world
[4:49:33] Variosit: some way
[4:49:33] mechoriet: server oversleep is the wait time for the next tick
[4:49:34] Variosit: i know it
[4:49:34] zedvawn: thanks
[4:49:36] Pashoopati: Lazy server

[4:49:52] Sloopwafel: memory/cpu issue?
[4:49:53] PaulFlies: RIP that website LUL
[4:49:57] hbboia: I think you should download more ram for your server :)
[4:49:59] Filsklor: it s a lot
[4:50:00] GFQPR1882: @Giantwaffle we need a community mob spawn mayb ?

[4:50:28] Richie31213: what happened to COTD?
[4:50:30] BMYGRLFRND: @Miestro I know, but I risked the bonk for it
[4:50:33] KekMannetje: what's the render distance?
[4:50:36] zedvawn: Yes, its definintely chunk related
[4:50:45] lcePops: lower chunks from 12 to 8
[4:50:49] mechoriet: maybe view-distance on 8
[4:50:54] NephilimXS: 253  chickens in one region
[4:50:55] gladiar: you might need a stronger server Waffle, or more cores..
[4:51:01] anx_gotta: How many chunks does each player NEED to know about at one time? @Giantwaffle
[4:51:02] JareBear: test by removing all other players for a few minutes
[4:51:09] NephilimXS: there's also 2 regions with 300+ chests
[4:51:13] FlipFlipFlaparoo: distance is too high.
[4:51:20] DX_Plates: Theres a chicken farm at spawn
[4:51:23] GFQPR1882: DO IT and see pepeLaugh
[4:51:30] Jerod5_: reduce sim distance to 5
[4:51:31] Denimdan13: yeet the players, dont restart for it
[4:51:33] Hurtwolf: tadpoles widepeepoHappy
[4:51:51] anx_gotta: holy shit bro. Bring that shit down
[4:52:02] BONBONNIE13: HACKERMANS Simulation Distance = 1 Chunk
[4:52:04] BONBONNIE13: EZ
[4:52:05] KekMannetje: cap players at 10 Kappa
[4:52:07] mechoriet: @Giantwaffle yes but only simulation-distance 8 is ticking around a player
[4:52:08] TheBonBon_: might need to nuke all animals once
[4:52:09] Aldizzert: Do they double simulate?
[4:52:10] neoblox: reduce view distance and increase no tick view distance - though i am not sure if it exists anymore in paper 1.18
[4:52:10] TheIrishGuy: you can always bring it down when people are mostly alone
[4:52:15] GFQPR1882: try it
[4:52:17] FlipFlipFlaparoo: try cap it at 8 and see if it makes a difference
[4:52:18] mechoriet: or whatever you set it too
[4:52:22] anx_gotta: Bring the view distance to minimum and test it
[4:52:22] Kardiiac: could always bring it down for now and up it later when you look at builds n shit
[4:52:28] costaexe_: !mc
[4:52:28] Moobot: First, go to Minecraft client and connect to: `whitelist.giantwaffle.tv` - click the link in the in-game chat to login to Twitch. Afterwards, you can join the sub server at `mc.giantwaffle.tv`
[4:52:31] NephilimXS: there's also like 500ish dropped items in the nether
[4:52:49] Pashoopati: Tell everyone at spawn to run in different directions and see what happens
[4:52:52] Zuiuzz: 500 dropped items should not affect the server at all
[4:52:52] mechoriet: no-tick-viewdistance = simulation-distance cause no-tick-distance is not yet ported to 1.18.1 by paper
[4:52:58] anx_gotta: Dude, lower
[4:53:20] DX_Plates: @Pashoopati We saw on Saturday LUL, restart every hour
[4:53:20] Hayestackk: do 0, make it blind roleplay server
[4:53:22] simik2: Which game do you like better, ConfigCraft or MineStats?
[4:53:24] FlipFlipFlaparoo: i think 8 is normal for a server
[4:53:28] anx_gotta: @Hayestackk lmao
[4:53:28] uwuphoria: this is the game i followed you playing like 8 years ago PogChamp
[4:53:37] bcdmonkey: 8 for the first couple weeks waffleNote

[4:53:59] Ritz_RP: What if I 69 the server
[4:54:00] Wazix11: can always increase it as the builds start happening
[4:54:05] HyperKitty_: @fishypooos indeed... still worth a try
[4:54:05] Mikael_Since: any ratJAM SoSnowy here?
[4:54:08] DeMayon: @Fyrboxer4 the amount of updates that happen. that is measured in TPS or ticks per second
[4:54:08] lcePops: yeah, dynamic view distance is the way to go: https://papermc.io/forums/t/1-14-1-18-view-distance-tweaks/3432 d
[4:54:11] officialhunterx: can people build chunk loaders
[4:54:12] GFQPR1882: we live and we learn its fine by me to test

[4:54:20] Goldenlion5648: did you see yesterday's advent of code problem?
[4:54:20] Deathu: is there a way to make it dynamic viewdistance like if theres 50 players on its 12 if 70 its 8 and so on
[4:54:23] BiJay0: not bad
[4:54:25] Zagitta: region 0,-512 has 253 chickens
[4:54:26] heyemmanuelle: Clap
[4:54:28] Collyy_y: so close
[4:54:31] DX_Plates: @Fyrboxer4 A server cycle. Each cycle where it processes updates is a tick.
[4:54:32] DeMayon: @Fyrboxer4 you want as much TPS as possible, as low ticks per second mean that the server is essentially lagging
[4:54:32] DatoPotatoDato: PogBones
[4:54:32] DigitallyAdmiringHumanity: Clap
[4:54:36] anx_gotta: @Fyrboxer4 Tick is usually used to mean one full game cycle. The amount of time it takes to process all the game logic.  The longer this takes, the slower and laggy'er the game gets
[4:54:42] Tabakhase: A region can cover 512 blocks around the coordinates.
[4:54:42] Plyzria: lul wtf
[4:54:45] Filsklor: kill the chicken 😡

[4:56:41] L707644: Isn't that spawn? 0:-512?
[4:56:42] Hordsak: mob limiter
[4:56:43] Thurlas: kill them! amyzY
[4:56:44] davethulhu: chicken genocide
[4:56:44] ZyrnUwU: Can we see the chickens before you murder them
[4:56:46] Gliderman: do chickens spawn naturually
[4:56:46] Tabakhase: farms INSIDE always loaded spawnchunks is bad idea LUL
[4:56:46] Deathu: or... just lower the playercount to like 70 or less
[4:56:50] TheWonderLlama: If all 253 are in one tile it can be rough
[4:56:50] mahajimbo: its a chicken farm they will hatch in like 6 seconds
[4:56:50] ThatOnneGuy: kill all the penguins on the server too Kappa
[4:56:51] Apparentthreat: chicken quota pepeLaugh

[4:56:55] anx_gotta: Can we see the chickens... I want to soo 300 ckickens in a spot
[4:56:59] Igmatic: kill all the chickens!
[4:57:01] ba_nanananananana: check the Germans. DansGame
[4:57:02] fishypooos: Chicken police
[4:57:03] 0rangelight: Just highlight all the chickens
[4:57:04] Netfreq: @giantwaffle here comes the Thanos chick *snap*
[4:57:06] wobbe: DON´T PANIC!
[4:57:09] RoninStorm: 250 chickens in ONE chunk... is a bit crazy
[4:57:09] Yumzoi: There are plugins that make a max mobs per chunk etc which can stop stupidly big mob farms
[4:57:10] ba_nanananananana: maybe they're mining bitcoin in their basement
[4:57:17] TheIrishGuy: Do mass Genocide to the chickens
[4:57:21] Apparentthreat: it's clearly blazed doing it
[4:57:24] zedvawn: TPS can be affected by saves. Which you already said you pre-loaded wayyy too many chunks
[4:57:24] daemonaedryn: Im not sure its 8?
[4:57:27] GFQPR1882: just set a limit of chickens that ppl have to stick to
[4:57:32] ThatOnneGuy: It might be better to find the location of the chickens to know where to go if a problem arises again
[4:57:33] anx_gotta: Can we see the chickens?

[4:58:19] zedvawn: TPS can be affected by saves. Which you said you pre-gen a lot of chunks
[4:58:32] KayakinC: If you are having this much problem with the server only being up then maybe lower player count? Only going to get worse really
[4:58:47] BiJay0: 0ms PogChamp
[4:58:50] SirKaelan: RainbowPls
[4:58:55] Zuiuzz: @TheBonBon_  I think the world is limited to 40k by 40k but according to dinnerbone thats the right coordinates :D
[4:58:55] mechoriet: no that right it should be G1 old: 0
[4:58:57] ashooby: makes sense, there just hasn't been an old gen gc yet
[4:59:02] Blazedasthesun: imagine you were somehow looking at the wong server KEKW
[4:59:05] mechoriet: cause old gen is very very slow to clearup
[4:59:12] Miestro: looks like an improvement from before TBH
[4:59:13] AnesthesiaFC: youre not loading all the chunks all the time right? just initially loaded them before opening the whitelist?
[4:59:15] DX_Plates: @KayakinC Time fixes player count.
[4:59:20] Rocha_Victor2: chunks not unloading maybe?
[4:59:39] mechoriet: pepeJAM

[4:59:54] Miestro: I want to see the chickens
[4:59:54] FlipFlipFlaparoo: Just make a sheep auto farm
[4:59:57] Deathu: waffle just set the view distance and sim distance to 2 chunks and if it still lags burn the paper and get something else xD or lower player count
[5:00:18] ashooby: should try shenandoah GC, would be a fun experiment
[5:00:24] HyperKitty_: there is a dynamic view distance plugin
[5:00:24] L707644: Isn't it on peaceful also?
[5:00:25] GFQPR1882: @Giantwaffle whats the despawn rate at ?
[5:00:32] aledantee: @ashooby GC spikes aren't the problem
[5:00:38] CorSPACE: could try dynamic view distance

[5:09:03] Rottastic: Laziness
[5:09:05] Quasky: Because this code is OLD
[5:09:06] ashooby: multithreading is hard
[5:09:11] simik2: ^
[5:09:12] BiJay0: is it same with bedrock?
[5:09:13] Variosit: cant you force it to do that somehow?
[5:09:13] TheKnopex: multi threading is not as easy as you think
[5:09:13] Kevincav: Lol multithreading is easy
[5:09:13] aledantee: isn't there a fabric mod that separates them? monkaHmm
[5:09:17] phoenixxua: it's not easy. especially for gaming servers with a lot of clients
[5:09:22] FlammAlpha: consistency between threads is the difficult part
[5:09:23] Crossed_legion: its hard, and consistancy is harder
[5:09:24] slayerman_x: multithreading is hard, so many problems appear when you try to convert code
[5:09:25] Maximus439: multithreading is easy if you write it in from the beginning
[5:09:36] daemonaedryn: Well would the mods matter?
[5:09:40] ashooby: think of factorio, it's not multithreaded, it's just fast because it's written in C/C++ (not sure which)
[5:09:42] Kevincav: I think multithreading is used between regions.  I.e. if you had a pvp region, one for skyblock, ...
[5:09:46] mechoriet: @Maximus439 good luck getting redstone threaded without desync issues
[5:09:53] gladiar: why not a bedrock server?
[5:09:56] Zuiuzz: Lets give Waffle some multithreading tasks so he sees synchronizing and keeping consistency is hard
[5:10:02] CorSPACE: theres addons but they arent the same
[5:10:04] BONBONNIE13: When does Minecraft: Definitive Edition come out - made in Unreal Engine 5?
[5:10:05] TheKnopex: LUL
[5:10:06] aledantee: @mechoriet might be able if you can detect disconnected regions
[5:10:08] SirKaelan: KEKW
[5:10:10] Yumzoi: Do bedrock servers perform alot better?
[5:10:10] kypudo: the 1.18 i think has started some multithread stuff
[5:10:12] phoenixxua: regular Minecraft also didn't have API but since it's java, it was hijacked into internals to add mods
[5:10:13] CocoScruff: saying bedrock is "good" is well understating how much of a buggy mess it is :-P i'm glad it's more "stable" server side but holy heck is bedrock buggy compared to java
[5:10:14] TheKnopex: c++ can die in a fire
[5:10:16] celadriel23: why cant it be done?
[5:10:21] anx_gotta: O.O I wouldn't say c++ is better... it's different
[5:10:25] GFQPR1882: i miss auto sort items
[5:10:27] slayerman_x: c++ is antiquated, so many modern languages are better
[5:10:29] Crossed_legion: @Giantwaffle how about you try some mutitheaded work in java and see how hard it is
[5:10:32] Kevincav: Some of it is in c++, at least when I had access to the code it did
[5:10:46] Gliderman: ehhhh, I wouldn't say that c++ is better than Java or the other way round.
[5:10:54] BONBONNIE13: HACKERMANS
[5:10:54] CocoScruff: yea 100% - i get that. bedrock feels way different
[5:10:59] Gliderman: it's very task dependent

[5:11:11] SlrKnight: what is bedock?
[5:11:15] Zuiuzz: how much RAM is your server currently using?
[5:11:20] aledantee: bedrock red stone isn't deterministic
[5:11:32] Lazdrin: maybe you need to allocate more ram @Giantwaffle
[5:11:32] Miestro: the dealbreaker for me with bedrock is self hosting and mod support
[5:11:33] phoenixxua: it's wrong. each language has own niche
[5:11:48] Swiftarrow4: It's very accessible
[5:11:48] Apparentthreat: the way you said antiquated felt wrong
[5:11:48] SlrKnight: is bedrock a company
[5:11:50] Apparentthreat: but wasn't
[5:11:51] kypudo: c++ for gaming is god tier, but also a shit ton off time
[5:11:54] zedvawn: @Zuiuzz 12GB
[5:11:57] simik2: c++ is antiquated? latest version of standard is 2020
[5:11:58] J0hanAndersson: @phoenixxua YEP
[5:11:58] wondox: c++ antiquated? lol
[5:11:59] KekMannetje: python is nice for scripting, but I don't like it for larger projects
[5:12:01] slayerman_x: @tuxwonder7 swift ? rust ? C# (but that has intermediate language)
[5:12:08] wizsarton: c++ is tool, get the correct tool for the task
[5:12:09] NonSix: rust better
[5:12:10] SonDun: Java has a lot of multithreading API's
[5:12:12] TheKnopex: @SlrKnight bedrock is the name for the version of minecraft

[5:13:47] Chris_Cross_Crash: Instagram
[5:13:51] zedvawn: im telling you man, try removing save-interval just for a small period of time. Large saves affect TPS heavy
[5:13:59] Deathu: way to fix the lag waffle is to have a plugin that lowers the viewdistance acording to how many ppl are online if its 50 its 12 if its 18 its like 5 and so on
[5:14:09] Chris_Cross_Crash: Instagram is Django (heavily modified of course)
[5:14:11] Klorell: netflix is python fastapi too i belive
[5:14:13] SkywardDev: Sounds like a nightmare to scale lol
[5:14:13] tigerman1983: less people less lag. does that not tell you to limit the number of people on
[5:14:23] aledantee: @zedvawn only true for vanilla
[5:14:28] DeMayon: yeah but then TPS would recover
[5:14:35] rykk3r1: Copium
[5:14:35] Zuiuzz: did you ever check if your RAM is sufficient?
[5:14:36] DeMayon: if it was a saving issue

[5:14:41] Tabakhase: flix is/was ruby (rails) i think
[5:14:43] schwebels428: so limit it until you can tweak the settings properly
[5:14:43] Narcotical: In a week the nummber of people on will be limited naturally
[5:14:45] kypudo: maybe lookup some vm arguments for server?
[5:14:45] Myekos: whatever is telling you that should provide those settings

[5:15:50] Larklen: Disable TPS, problem solved :)
[5:15:53] slayerman_x: just disable player movement KEKW
[5:15:54] Netfreq: Do a stack dump, you might find you GC settings are jacked up… there are like a dozen GC methods (parallel, non-parallel, marked, etc…)
[5:15:58] orangecreamsicle3: well you preloaded the chunks rooThink
[5:16:02] mechoriet: @Larklen 5Head best idea so far
[5:16:09] Thaykor: What if you restart and ask everyone to just run as far as possible? If the tick dives down to ~6 right away then it’s chunks
[5:16:11] fishypooos: at the least its a learning experience for you @Giantwaffle
[5:16:13] EbonLux: just shut down the server, then there will be no lag
[5:16:13] CocoScruff: just remove everyone from whitelist - problem solved Kappa
[5:16:15] zedvawn: You could also change chunk-gc timing to 400ms
[5:16:23] mechoriet: @orangecreamsicle3 it still has to be send to the player and kept in server memory :)
[5:16:29] Netfreq: Do um ya, I’m going to need you TPS report in the morning…

[5:21:37] daemonaedryn: widePepeLaugh
[5:21:42] Netfreq: Really need a tuning guide…. Most the memory settings should be identical or multiples of 4 or 8… for memory pagination…. Java tuning is an art, but lots of guides out there
[5:21:43] daemonaedryn: Prayge
[5:21:44] Seeker28: clean that vase @Blazedasthesun
[5:21:46] mechoriet: what is simulation at?
[5:21:51] maybol283: is there a new minecraft patch or something>

[5:21:52] BenjoTV_: Chat, has he thrown any darts on stream yet?
[5:21:58] fishypooos: @Blazedasthesun my room is hotboxed rn... I need to open a window pepeLaugh
[5:22:00] Zuiuzz: @orangecreamsicle3 did you ever check ram usage?
[5:22:01] Netfreq: There are sites you can send output logs to help you tune

[5:22:23] babyaddalyn: @Tabakhase mclink.dries007.net:25565
[5:22:27] mechoriet: @Giantwaffle can you do `/paper chunkinfo` when the server is filled up
[5:22:29] Tabakhase: @Milexna SRV _minecraft._tcp. it is NODDERS
[5:22:32] Hykisho: oof minecraft music Kreygasm
[5:22:37] Wyatt_Earth: @Giantwaffle If someone was to have some stupid amount of sheep/cows/whatever would you be able to pinpoint that chunk with so many entities?
[5:22:54] daemonaedryn: I cant see my mountaintop PepeHands
[5:22:55] MaskedGibbon: how many chunks does the server load?
[5:23:07] Larklen: MONKERS
[5:23:15] mechoriet: @Giantwaffle can you do /paper chunkinfo
[5:23:18] zedvawn: View distance is not exactly 'loaded chunks' more chunks can stay loaded than are rendered at one time by a player
[5:23:21] JJorbann: Even after the restart I am still unable to join. I am sure it's something on my end.
[5:23:23] mechoriet: it shows how much is loaded at the moment
[5:23:26] Netfreq: I play Minecraft only from the CLI…. Just don’t forget anything…. Feels like classic Zork

[5:23:52] Wyatt_Earth: I would think there would be some plugin that finds loaded chunk entity counts and orders them for you to see which chunks cause the most processing
[5:23:56] Reloadinko: did you get the server form ubisoft? Kappa
[5:24:01] kypudo: you might have something lagging your server, you should try a profiler
[5:24:11] TheKnopex: delete all chests NODDERS
[5:24:14] zedvawn: View distance is not exactly 'loaded chunks' more chunks can stay loaded than are rendered at one time by a player
[5:24:18] Wyatt_Earth: boats, minecarts, paintings, armor stands.... all entities
[5:24:23] babyaddalyn: chest is actualy a tile entity, and creatures etc are entitys
[5:24:27] CocoScruff: item frames are pretty bad too i think
[5:24:35] mechoriet: @orangecreamsicle3 where did you get the 15k number from?
[5:24:39] Rottastic: Dropped items
[5:24:44] Smili: will there ever be a fix for minecraft server laggg..? FeelsBadMan 2022 still hope..
[5:24:52] MechaDom: Item frames are also entities
[5:24:57] orangecreamsicle3: @mechoriet chunkinfo
[5:25:05] Soovix: Did you make a world border and pre load the world so the server isn't tanking every time someone goes off exploring?
[5:25:07] TheKnopex: 2022 is just 2020 too
[5:25:08] Chernobyl26: en tities
[5:25:11] schwebels428: so if you put a chest in a boat you get an entity in an entity? EVE taught me that was a bad idea
[5:25:26] jay7tx: What about entities in a claim tho?
[5:25:29] mechoriet: and clearlag makes the server lag even more cause its gonna keep trying to spawn up to the mobcap
[5:25:31] Wyatt_Earth: oh nice. can i ask for world dimensions please?
[5:25:36] Maximus439: 📉   tps
[5:25:42] Wyatt_Earth: like, how big?
[5:25:44] mechoriet: of the spawn-limits settings
[5:25:51] babyaddalyn: clearlag is bascly a kill command that clears items of ground so it just does /minecraft:kill @e[type=minecraft:item]
[5:25:55] R0neyTV: alot of 1.17 plugins work on 1.18, might be worth giving it a go?
[5:26:12] TogglesLore: Kill the animals we must
[5:26:18] Thaykor: Server fixing is content! Let’s do it
[5:26:25] tr0picalbird: is it save to play on the server or can people grave your place?

[5:27:11] claspingtick1: twitch server debug category when

[5:27:31] Netfreq: …. Not the content we wanted, but it’s the content we deserve!!! Back to wrapping up coal
[5:27:32] The_Ice_Cold_Killa: @Giantwaffle are you strip mining at -54 height?
[5:27:55] mechoriet: https://github.com/kennytv/list-of-shame/blob/25c9beb2d72686b30e91608bbcc2b92ab8a33e6b/README.md?plain=1#L15 pepeLaugh a big person from paper about clearlag xD
[5:28:04] mechoriet: and he is not wrong :)
[5:28:32] Fronku: I think most of the paper forks that optimize for large player counts have no plans to update for 1.18, besides pufferfish which ported most of the optimization patches from purpur,
[5:28:33] Wrezl: can you disable bats? i mean they don't really add anything
[5:28:33] Moobot: Come join the Waffle House Discord! <# https://discord.gg/fhGFtMuzdS

[5:28:44] mechoriet: it looks already way better
[5:28:49] JU1CYo: villager tick is always one of the worst
[5:28:51] Seeker28: tick entities are too damn high
[5:28:55] orangecreamsicle3: @Wrezl my immersion D:
[5:29:22] ChefGromboli: Is mob griefing still disabled?
[5:29:29] TRAYW1N: yes
[5:29:30] Wrezl: i mean bats or blocks popping in and out which is the worse immersion breaker? @orangecreamsicle3 :)
[5:29:36] JU1CYo: @Giantwaffle get rid of fish they are the worst
[5:29:41] JU1CYo: aswell as bats
[5:29:46] MetalBBA: I mean that would just be a server cap not a per player cap
[5:29:46] mechoriet: @Giantwaffle if you set ambient to 0 it disables bat spawning cause thats the only mob in the category
[5:29:48] Nelekt: and multiples serveur ?
[5:29:49] notBeezyy: what y are u at rn
[5:29:50] TRAYW1N: oh nvm disabled
[5:29:55] Netfreq: I’m going to need everyone go signup for a free demo AWS account, we’re going to spread the load over 6,000 small ec2 instances
[5:29:56] mechoriet: yes KEKW
[5:29:57] unogolly: What server jar are you running? Bukkit?
[5:29:59] Jayouz: Might want to consider upgrade the old celeron server :D
[5:30:02] mechoriet: no its not
[5:30:04] bepbong: !battle
[5:30:05] orangecreamsicle3: I think there is a plugin that combines mob entities in to one entity
[5:30:05] BiJay0: squid
[5:30:11] notBeezyy: show your coords
[5:30:12] LegoCoin: would that cause villagers to despawn
[5:30:17] mahajimbo: WhySoSerious it is simple, we must
[5:30:18] JJorbann: Is the server running the standard 25565 port?
[5:30:18] Soovix: how much ram is on the server for 150 people cap?
[5:30:19] unogolly: Ahh kk, yeah paper is forked from spigot
[5:30:25] orangecreamsicle3: @JJorbann no port
[5:30:28] Nilau: #SaveTheBats but get rid of players Kappa
[5:30:34] JJorbann: I have a feeling that my workplace is blocking the 25565 port.
[5:30:38] Tabakhase: @Netfreq ive actually seens mth like this with bungee done once...
[5:30:41] Deathu: i feel like you running bukkit paper and spigot seems like a lot
[5:30:43] Wyatt_Earth: how many gigs
[5:30:48] mechoriet: might want to update that some more log4j versions have dropped KEKW
[5:30:52] unogolly: detotated wam
[5:30:55] NarwhalArgy: @Giantwaffle Depends what type of server it's running on
[5:30:59] notBeezyy: what y level are u minin at?
[5:31:01] Wyatt_Earth: did u say 100 gig server?
[5:31:06] Lazdrin: you have 16 gigs allocated?
[5:31:08] Yasin___: @Giantwaffle how much the server cost to you per month? average.
[5:31:10] NarwhalArgy: @Wyatt_Earth no 100 man server
[5:31:19] The_Ice_Cold_Killa: @Giantwaffle are those problems the result of too many players? or does that happen in even in small 5-people ones aswell?
[5:31:33] Zuiuzz: @Lazdrin just 12Gigs allocated
[5:31:41] kypudo: why not?
[5:31:41] mechoriet: 64 gigs i guess
[5:31:48] mechoriet: with a i7 i guess xD
[5:31:53] mahajimbo: PauseChamp back to admin
[5:31:56] kypudo: just leave like 10% for SO
[5:31:56] Langes01x: I'd at least give the server half
[5:31:59] TheWanil: The ammount of Iron you get in 1.18 is ridiculous... damn this game just became so much harder... or is it just me?
[5:32:09] Nilau: Check how much dedotaed wam you got
[5:32:10] NarwhalArgy: @Giantwaffle I was say 16 is definitely enough for 150+ players
[5:32:14] mechoriet: pepeLaugh there are like 5 login panels KEKW
[5:32:15] MusWoW: @TheWanil nah you can mine with fortune now
[5:32:15] Wyatt_Earth: One is for the service, one is for the server?
[5:32:26] Zuiuzz: Just give the server more ram and see if it improves
[5:32:38] unogolly: dedicating too much too much can fuck the server /make it lag when java's 'memory' cleaner runs
[5:32:53] simik2: it's been a while since I played mc. Do you have to migrate to MS account to play?
[5:32:56] TheWanil: @TheWanil yeah i meant in the beginning of playthrough, that's true with fortune though
[5:32:56] mechoriet: @Zuiuzz NOPERS more ram adds more GC time and makes it lag even more :)
[5:32:58] Deathu: how reliable are the compnay you are using rn waffle maybe something is wrong on their end ?
[5:32:58] unogolly: so yeah allocating a close amount is good
[5:32:58] Tompop23: @giantwaffle does vanilla still memory leak or is that just a modded thing really?
[5:33:05] fishypooos: @Zuiuzz more ram could increase lag
[5:33:09] zedvawn: You def dont want to over allocate RAM. 12 should be fine
[5:33:10] cranberryleaf: @Deathu it's OVH very high end
[5:33:30] Chernobyl26: @simik2 not quite yet, but they said eventually you will, I did mine it was pretty easy
[5:33:30] Netfreq: I have an old TI-92 calculator I can donate to the CPU cause…. It has more processing power than the Apollo2 module
[5:33:38] Zuiuzz: yeah I know @fishypooos @mechoriet but having not enough is also very bad for lag
[5:33:40] Smokedawg1337: I host my Rust server on OVH and it doesn't lag. I get 250 people daily playing
[5:33:50] Dannythebrill13: @Zuiuzz even so, 12 gigs is plenty
[5:33:52] kypudo: make sure you are using your cores
[5:33:53] mechoriet: @Zuiuzz well then the server would crash with OOM
[5:33:54] orangecreamsicle3: @onzonzonzonzon thats different
[5:33:57] DeMayon: whats the TPS at?
[5:34:07] DrNucleotides: download more GHz 4Head
[5:34:15] kennishin: its C#
[5:34:20] fishypooos: progress Clap
[5:34:26] Deathu: ah i think theres your issue, you are using amd (not sure if this is accurate but) when i switched from my i5 to a ryzen cpu that was better on paper i got les fps in minecraft @Giantwaffle i don't think ryzen chips work that well with minecraft
[5:34:29] wandataco: why is C++ faster for games?
[5:34:37] mechoriet: yeah keep adjusting spawn-limits it has alot of impact
[5:34:46] mechoriet: on performance
[5:34:49] goemii: goemii subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 32 months! 
[5:34:51] NarwhalArgy: @Giantwaffle What's the chuck saving at?
[5:34:52] undeniablyrexer: GC performance sort of depends on RAM.  It needs to run more if Java doesn't have enough RAM allocated.
[5:35:06] WOSNAK: is waffle using bisect hosting? they are the only ones that I see that has 32gb ram
[5:35:07] notBeezyy: what y level are you mining at?
[5:35:11] Chernobyl26: This was probably one of the most informative streams, I learned without a doubt that I dont ever want to run a MC server
[5:35:14] banshay3: @Giantwaffle are all the enchants required for the pickaxe to heal normally?
[5:35:21] TheWanil: is this why big multiplayer games have stress tests before launch?
[5:35:32] Fronku: @Deathu the nocom expliot which required minecraft to be optimized to the limit pretty much ran on a 5950x ...
[5:35:33] Tabakhase: did you switch servers? last i remember movin said it was a game64, whats be a 7770k or so o.O @Giantwaffle
[5:35:46] soe_frost: Boys, I didnt get the job Sadge ... have a drink for me tonight pls
[5:35:46] NarwhalArgy: @Giantwaffle I would start with changing the chuck saving and limit entity collisions

[5:36:19] Deathu: @Fronku yeah but from what i know EPYC processors are not the best at single core but are great at multycore
[5:36:29] laidher: yeah it needs to be on hard
[5:36:30] zedvawn: Yup, you cant reduce villager trade costs on normal
[5:36:35] Deathu: and since minecraft uses moslty single core i don't think epyc is great for this

[5:37:07] Smokedawg1337: How much do you pay a month @Giantwaffle
[5:37:08] GriffinTek: hopefully it's a 5000 series
[5:37:13] Tabakhase: AMD Ryzen 5 5600X - 6c/ 12 t - 3.7GHz / 4.6GHz ?
[5:37:16] Netfreq: Snapdragon? I get confused with all the new names
[5:37:23] daemonaedryn: monkaS
[5:37:27] daemonaedryn: a few hundred a month?!
[5:37:33] Tabakhase: 120€/m https://www.ovhcloud.com/en/bare-metal/game/game-1/
[5:37:36] zedvawn: You cannot reduce villager trade costs on normal. So all trade would stay at default price
[5:37:40] Dannythebrill13: @Netfreq Snapdragon is a mobile chip
[5:37:41] jay7tx: KEKW “Snapdragon”
[5:37:54] BMYGRLFRND: so... question. if I were to open a multi session for a modded server in minecraft and wanted to do it by opening to lan from singleplayer (so not a dedicated server), should I use those flags for my singleplayer client? @Giantwaffle
[5:38:02] Narzzil: OSRS? hmm
[5:38:05] CorSPACE: ya a snapdragon 810
[5:38:06] JommyBee: im running a AMD Ryzen 9 5900X 12-Core Processor 3.70 GHz RainbowPls

[5:38:36] jay7tx: Mobile is powerful
[5:38:36] Spectacular101: Ingenuity
[5:39:00] CorSPACE: alot of deep space probes etc use the same radiation hardened cpu thats based off of a powerpc cpu from early 2000s
[5:39:01] Jayouz: Well those Snapdragon chips have to deal with the 5G radiation :D

[5:43:41] Myekos: if you're going to farm them, may be clear the other sides?
[5:43:41] b0rtjedb: @Giantwaffle with f3 you can see the growth stage of the crystals
[5:43:59] soe_frost: silk touch the X blocks, you are free to mine the others tho (maybe with iron)

[6:02:05] boishky: You can use the /timings command in game to help create an output of performance over time (TPS) Likely lots of entities as well as mobs
[6:02:06] zedvawn: Remove the villager AI
[6:02:07] daemonaedryn: Eesh 1 xp farm for 100 people?
[6:02:14] Variosit: designate those portals at the 10k checkpoints
[6:02:17] Variosit: like shops
[6:02:18] zedvawn: @Outen11 He has already done that
[6:02:18] Variosit: and shit
[6:02:24] GarlicJelly: 1 exp farm for 100 players... The line to enter it LUL
[6:02:40] b0rtjedb: DaemonSzyman end exp farm can give you 100levels in a few mins

[6:03:23] nellydocs: boats ..
[6:03:37] officialzip: Wont that make them not bread again?
[6:03:51] officialhunterx: you could spawn in villages with comannds without ai
[6:03:52] Netfreq: There’s a mid to remove villager AI… it’s called WestVirigina mod
[6:03:52] Reloadinko: just do /server run_better LUL
[6:03:56] GarlicJelly: Just lock them in so they can't move helP
[6:03:59] Hekrux: @officialzip 🍞
[6:04:03] b0rtjedb: DaemonSzyman specific setups can reach it, but with mobcap it might be an issue
[6:04:11] Jerod5_: they also would never refresh their inv/buys
[6:04:21] baboclus: baboclus subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 10 months! waffleHOMIE

[6:05:01] zedvawn: Villagers are not the main source of TPS lag here.
[6:05:17] Deathu: yeah i think thats a good idea
[6:05:25] J_Bubba: <3
[6:05:29] Blazedasthesun: @Giantwaffle we were thinking of emptying a water temple and making it a library with villagers
[6:05:38] lcePops: on peaceful, it wasn't fixed
[6:05:39] percival_jenkins: restart server again KEKW
[6:05:40] lvyEartman: kill all zombies?
[6:05:43] Deathu: yeah but even on peacefull it was still bad so the zombies dont do much ?
[6:05:43] DeMayon: peaceful didnt fix it
[6:05:45] b0rtjedb: can you check which mob uses most tick?
[6:05:52] Apparentthreat: Chat, please check that image in the command so I can fix anything that's needed waffleH
[6:05:52] daemonaedryn: But if the problem was zombies, wouldnt being peaceful fix it entirely?
[6:05:53] zedvawn: My issue is the mob# isnt growing at the rate that TPS is dropping
[6:05:55] lcePops: if peaceful didn't fix it, its not the mobs
[6:06:02] DeMayon: ^
[6:06:02] Narcotical: server restart counter this stream? KEKW
[6:06:16] b0rtjedb: @Giantwaffle check which entity uses most tick?
[6:06:22] Askjong: Is it redstone clocks?
[6:06:48] zedvawn: My issue is the mob# isnt growing at the rate that TPS is dropping.. its not mobs
[6:07:02] StOrMy1100: @Apparentthreat Looks good
[6:07:06] lcePops: if peaceful didn't fix it, its not the mobs
[6:07:09] LiamJJMusic: villager ticks are always rough tho
[6:07:20] FlipFlipFlaparoo: is it passive mobs?
[6:07:21] escapenew: check ALL
[6:07:46] zedvawn: Guys its not the mobs
[6:07:47] b0rtjedb: @Giantwaffle what helps as well is put torches in the caves underneath spawn, because there are alot of zombies most likely
[6:08:09] devoidglow: I keep getting timed out FeelsBadMan
[6:08:28] zedvawn: TPS is dropping while mob count isnt growing plus peaceful did nothing
[6:08:29] skynetcloud: @Giantwaffle also you gonna add an icon and a motd to the server??
[6:08:45] BrewCat1215: @narcotical At least 25 KEKW
[6:08:48] Foooks: Waffle, could it be the coreprotect loggin all changes which is delaying actions?  (Hope this was not asked prior, if so I am sorry)
[6:09:03] Du4lgame: @giantwaffle paperMC has a bug, which is fixed in regular MC, which lets zombies hold eggs (from zombie jockies) and ink sacs etc which will result in massive amounts of never despawning zombies.
[6:09:22] b0rtjedb: @Giantwaffle what helps as well is put torches in the caves underneath spawn, because there are alot of zombies most likely
[6:09:22] Moobot: You can find Waffle's Youtube channel here - https://youtube.com/giantwaffle

[6:10:22] zedvawn: 2%-5% is nothing
[6:10:25] ThatOnneGuy: server hasn't even been up for a week, destroy all the things.

[6:14:40] Foooks: yes farm animals
[6:14:47] Variosit: and they dont despawn
[6:14:50] lcePops: I think they were spawned in before this was changed and they dont despawn
[6:14:54] Variosit: unless you kill em
[6:15:00] Myekos: can you kill 50% of all creatures, like Thanos, and check the tps?
[6:15:14] zedvawn: Watch TPS go down faster than creatures go up
[6:15:15] Gliderman: 600 animals is nothing for a server
[6:15:20] NonSix: yeah no more random spawns
[6:15:22] Tabakhase: time todo murder murder shit peepoHappy 🔪
[6:15:22] slyjedi: 1 hr animal purge...ready go

[6:15:39] tr0picalbird: @Giantwaffle can people grieve your stuff on this world?
[6:15:49] Du4lgame: are there large villager trading halls?
[6:15:54] FauxNoodel: need better server?
[6:16:07] Gliderman: trust me, I've run it on 2GHz processor with 600 animals and it only dipped to like 19 tps
[6:16:09] mechoriet: @Gliderman on 1.17.1 this should be fine for sure idk what they change code wise around mobspawning yet
[6:16:12] ChoOyu: Probs an Illegal Mobfarm somewhere
[6:16:13] Foooks: what is a full server tick include?
[6:16:23] L707644: Server restart every 5min KEKW
[6:16:27] mechoriet: @Gliderman on 1.18?
[6:16:46] Gliderman: fuck, you right, not 1.17 or 1.18
[6:16:53] Gliderman: 1.16.5 for a long time
[6:17:04] Wyatt_Earth: how many homes do players get? just the 1 i assume?
[6:17:06] mechoriet: @Gliderman they changed alot of code since then KEKW
[6:17:12] Deathu: There are too many players on waffle its just a limitation of minecraft i think no matter how much optimisation you do it won't fix it fully imo
[6:17:17] Gliderman: and made it worse?
[6:17:30] Tompop23: Maybe mobs aren’t despwaning outside the lowered radius? Kill everything lol
[6:17:30] Moobot: You can sub to Waffle by clicking this neat link -> twitch.tv/giantwaffle/subscribe
[6:17:34] zedvawn: Gotta do process of elim. Run server empty, run server after destroying entities, etc
[6:17:55] mechoriet: pepeLaugh imagine paper being the issue
[6:17:56] The_kid_as_a_teen: well paper is thin
[6:17:59] kibberthepeast: havent tuned in for a while, hows your programming project doing?
[6:18:00] mechoriet: spigot is even worse

[6:18:08] Jayouz: Why not just break it on stream so we can watch? :D
[6:18:12] phoenixxua: @Giantwaffle you can just require Sub Tier 2 to access server and lag is resolved Kappa
[6:18:20] ffiiffoo: hello its modded?
[6:18:32] mechoriet: its looks smoother tho
[6:18:33] phoenixxua: @ffiiffoo it's almost raw 1.18
[6:18:38] zedvawn: @ffiiffoo no, vanilla
[6:18:40] Foooks: Have you reduced view distance for the server?
[6:18:41] mechoriet: with block pickup and breaking

[6:19:11] Deathu: 13 is fine if we can keep it at 13 tho
[6:19:13] Suet99: growing crops at low tps is agony
[6:19:13] Myekos: did you get all your ancient?
[6:19:20] tr0picalbird: are things you build in the server safe
[6:19:23] Du4lgame: spiggot and PaperMC have a lot of shared stuff, so should make no difference. But I noticed issues with PaperMC multiple times on my servers
[6:19:29] R0neyTV: randomtickspeed isnt set high is it?
[6:19:32] Apparentthreat: tr0picalbird you can protect your stuff w/ a claim
[6:19:39] Chris_Cross_Crash: Ohhh that makes sense. Yea that's kinda crappy
[6:19:40] Netfreq: There has to be a better way to scale horizontally across servers… not just vertically with faster CPU/memory…
[6:19:43] Morpheus3456: maybe too many animals in too small spaces so they are constantly pushed around?
[6:19:44] Yasin___: Fluids...
[6:19:45] Leroi_Duspam: hey, can anyone join the server?
[6:19:45] JareBear: lol Feed the Beast was hilarious dealing with that
[6:19:46] tr0picalbird: thanks @Apparentthreat
[6:19:48] L707644: Yeah region lock the server. 0 to 12h only NA and from 12 to 0 only EU KEKW @Giantwaffle
[6:19:52] zedvawn: Gotta do process of elim. Run server empty, run server after destroying entities, etc
[6:19:56] mechoriet: @Du4lgame KEKW they honestly dont
[6:19:56] Thurlas: what are you grinding atm?
[6:19:59] Fronku: well they are making some grandiose claims for the pufferfish fork, I wonder if it will actually solve most of the issues, hopefully it works out
