[0:10:30] camaroo_: flight sim is a joke, if they make a new game and the addons dont transfer over
[0:10:39] camaroo_: yes
[0:10:41] train2001: MSFS 2024 is just a massive scam.... its just a update
[0:10:42] BIFF72OL: yea xbox got my attention just by actually having big games on it

[0:10:59] johnnnnieg: Dune its dlc for first game irc
[0:11:00] pcjohnyt: i thought it was expansion
[0:11:02] RafaLorenzo: I just dont understand why sony say at the end of the games "its going to be at X and X platforms" but xbox only say Xbox so i was confused with MFS and Cyberpunk
[0:11:02] Sparky1232: Cheer500 I wanted to tell a Zelda joke but i didn't want to Tri and Force it. So instead i was going to post a Link but couldn't find anything good.
[0:11:02] Merrie11: it is a new game, all the addons from the ingame store will work in 2024
[0:11:05] 0x4273: why would they make it a new thing
[0:11:07] train2001: yeah its a standalone game. but its just a update....

[0:20:37] Hurtwolf: i want more solo SoT
[0:20:47] Hurtwolf: without the thought of someone ending me.
[0:20:53] SeriousPotatoBot: people are hoping that SF will be a 10 year game
[0:20:59] wastelandsradio: I like the content additions sot is doing but it’s limited mechanically
[0:21:00] AIex_0: best part is its all on game pass EZ
[0:21:08] train2001: yeah but also what MSFS 2024 trailer let you see is just new missions that could also be just a update in MSFS2020... @Giantwaffle
[0:21:10] Borlaq: Legend you can get in 1 day of grinding from nothing now

[0:46:50] M1k3D3l7a: cause MS said 10 years of support for MSFS2020
[0:46:53] AtomicDorito97: Cause it's a bit weird. It could have just been bundled as a big update
[0:46:57] warcake: tbh the dope missions are worth the price of entry
[0:47:02] train2001: @M1k3D3l7a yep LUL

[0:47:17] wastelandsradio: I doubt its the same engine, it might be an engine 2.0 type of update
[0:47:20] Wakeuphate: literally dropped the amount for MSFS on a single map in DCS LUL

[1:43:13] Sinergetyx: after all the bullshit that todd howard promised in the past i dont trust him to pass the salt
[1:43:18] Chalkstix: Baldur's Gate was a 5 disc game in 1998
[1:43:23] trabadam: is was really exited about Starfield, but literally fell asleep during yesterdays presentation Bedge
[1:43:28] KC_GingerSnapz: @Sinergetyx Sadge

[1:43:48] br_ie_k: have you played battlebit? it's releasing in like 3 days
[1:43:52] thebubbajones1: This looks like what dragon age inquisition should’ve been
[1:43:52] LastWarriorKing: seems overly ambitious
[1:43:53] Lajnuss_: @Ketchup455 same! I cant wait! but i will probably lose my party the week after when starfield releases LUL
[1:43:54] Harmar: @Sinergetyx its going to be 50/50 on that part but the video (50 minutes) makes me think he might have pulled it off lol
[1:43:54] Strider1515: Expert writer KEKW as opposed to what, a non expert
[1:43:54] fafuja: I can see why people are hyped game seems very rich

[1:44:31] W84M3: it's always fake when they say "city alive, all chars have stories"... sounds too repetitive when it's never been true KEKW
[1:44:31] daemonaedryn: Casually firebombing children
[1:44:31] Kjoelby: Did they just firebomb a child in their promo material LUL
[1:44:36] Chalkstix: but tbh, they could've just removed tieflings
[1:44:40] zero3juan: they have oil refineries?
[1:44:48] Vizion_TV: Baldur's Gate playable Early Access so far is already great, and its only to Level 5
[1:44:53] grundlechooch: @giantwaffle can we trust Bethesda on release date though? Fallout was arguably the biggest fumble of all time with all the shit they pulled
[1:44:55] Ryetta: you can firebomb kids and women great
[1:44:59] Ketchup455: @Lajnuss_ the i'm just going to wait for starfield to be fixed before i play it so it works out perfectly for me. play BG3 until starfield is fixed
[1:45:09] Stormflare: flying ruins game maps
[1:45:14] zero3juan: strong agree

[1:47:09] Sunforest: Madge
[1:47:09] Derized_: graphically looks good, but I'm skeptical on the gameplay still
[1:47:10] Moobot: Coldfir3 is the best mod. This is not a scripted message.

[1:58:20] praxiz: Famously Codsworth in Fallout 4 had like hundreds of names stored, that it would call you, if you named yourself one of them. And one of those name was Fuckface
[1:58:22] Nexhunter: @Giantwaffle ID was brought on not for combat but for lighting and graphics help with the CE2 update

[1:59:50] Bernasrebelo: @Bernasrebelo x can only do 60 at 1440p i think
[1:59:50] punkgeek: Yeah, that seems fine
[1:59:55] NoFeaR_Tv: Exactly. I agree
[1:59:56] LatHund: Yeah its instanced
[2:00:00] RamseyRinehaus: i feel like trying to solve for that is whats killing Star Citizen
[2:00:01] bugsplatter23: procedural miracles exist
[2:00:02] Reshi_o7: As long as the actual flying is good and not like nms
[2:00:03] Wingy_: Its procedurally generated
[2:00:06] Catdaddyneff: i think its fine
[2:00:12] PlaguedV: i prefer instanced areas that have personal touch
[2:00:12] Harmar: @Adril99 hard to say as this is first new universe in 20 years, im sure they want to "try" to make it a hit
[2:00:13] Sazuke__: is this game singleplayer? 󠀀
[2:00:13] Jibbur: I don't want them to waste and this is a great way to manage time costs and still feel massive
[2:00:14] mlmach6: its not that big a deal
[2:00:14] Kjoelby: Just like KSP, no entry physics
[2:00:15] k0nk_: Im not mad about that. it would have failed if they had us go orbit to ground.
[2:00:15] daemonaedryn: Agreed, but it would have been nice. I just hope you can still fly in the cities
[2:00:16] lord__pasqual: is that why NMS is heavier in graphics nowadays then ever before?
[2:00:25] cascading_simulations: It's 1000 procedural planets, but the cities are hand-crafted.
[2:00:25] bonelake: Story and exploration
[2:00:26] punkgeek: Story and picking up a million items to fill my house
[2:00:27] deathbytray16: deathbytray16 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 42 months! POGGIES
[2:00:27] Sandboxie97: i think you can fly around the planet a bit. they kinda show that later
[2:00:28] KluDeez: it also enables modders to go crazy
[2:00:33] Grimholde: No one has a system that could run 1000 planets like that. It makes sense to do it like that.

[2:18:02] フリクリ: @Giantwaffle other than a day 1 patch/ server issues, what would absolutely ruin your expectations about this
[2:18:03] daemonaedryn: @Busterpunker its not
[2:18:03] McSauce: MrDestructoid
[2:18:03] Hurtwolf: @Busterpunker Singleplayer
[2:18:05] D1CKENSS: it looks super promising but im not letting hype get to me for the millionth time

[2:18:10] OkumuraWF: HK1 voice replacer when?
[2:18:11] ricecracker_: rooBot
[2:18:12] badmode: there must be so many sci fi easter eggs in this
[2:18:13] lord__pasqual: @Busterpunker, it's solo RPG
[2:18:13] Kisheen: @Night_Crawlerz I still don't think they've shown any flying, and landing is just cutscenes. Makes it a far thing from a space sim
[2:18:17] Protonmat: It needs to be multiplayer
[2:18:20] Shroadie: can you link the vid at the end
[2:18:23] Mandorake: i wish you could land it yourself
[2:18:24] tinayoufatsloth: its singleplayer

[2:18:28] Hurtwolf: The constellation edition looks cool
[2:18:28] Busterpunker: aww shit thats a shame
[2:18:29] Robbware: @Protonmat It needs to be singleplayer. We have enough multiplayer games as it is
[2:18:29] Ryetta: i have 0 hype after cyberpunk scandal
[2:18:36] Yizzles: inb4 the ships don't crash they just bounce off the world and glitch into space
[2:18:38] Marenti: cockpit
[2:18:39] Shadewe: Doesn't look like you take off yourself.. Looks scripted...
[2:18:40] Nexhunter: @Hurtwolf it is produced by The Wand Company
[2:18:40] KC_GingerSnapz: @Night_Crawlerz Its not a space sim lmao
[2:18:40] bugsplatter23: chatGPT is programming the whole game for them.. it's really busting it's circuits to get it done on time
[2:18:42] Pineapplebro: Pineapplebro subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 13 months! 
[2:18:42] Kisheen: @DaemonSzyman Well there we go.

[2:40:59] Kavokane: It would be nice if the story if the story was largely optional
[2:41:00] b0tmau: @D1CKENSS the odds are definitely not in their favor but one can hope
