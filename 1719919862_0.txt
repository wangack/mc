[2:38:59] samm0212: Rossibo is the centaur of attention
[2:39:03] joll05: That's why kirsty has no camera, she's turned into a centaur
[2:39:06] thomaswilliams98: @kacs_ky @Goldbirdie it was a myth all this time? brionyAhh
[2:39:09] falla_softpaw: oh god... now I've just remembered that terrifying picture that Cosmic sent in Buncord before

[2:39:40] CapraphobicSquid: Briony did you leave the banana bread at home?
[2:40:04] NuclearSlayer52: it doesnt grow any faster on any block, someone has tested that myth, and even checked the code, and theres nothing to signify that it would grow any faster
[2:40:23] un0fficiAlly: A torch implies fire
[2:40:24] Goldbirdie: U didnt have any flashlights?
[2:40:28] georgehehheh: Nobody uses flame torches anymore though
[2:40:29] squeaky_s: Its an electric torch.
[2:40:34] nonaame04: Flashlight > Torch
[2:40:35] RufusTheHairyCatWrangler: but flashlight is just as inaccurate, they don't flash
[2:40:44] 3v1lc0w: you don't need a table to make torches bronky
[2:40:48] Notaro_: a flashlight doesn't flash!
[2:40:58] Goldbirdie: They flash on
[2:40:58] georgehehheh: The function flame torches served us EXACTLY the same as electric torches
[2:40:59] Nomadile: flashlight should only be for those old timey camera fwoonphs or camera flash
[2:41:04] samm0212: Flashes??
[2:41:07] drakegard: Meaning of words change Chatting
[2:41:09] Esid: brits would call motorcycle horses if they could
[2:41:12] UnderwurldChris: my torch doesn't flash
[2:41:18] Notaro_: flashlights do not flash
[2:41:18] thomaswilliams98: @kacs_ky I've been lied to for years brionyGrump
[2:41:18] LividCode: they both do the same thing so they get the same name
[2:41:18] nonaame04: It’s a light you flash, not a light that flashes
[2:41:24] tesaft: It's not worse than "pocket lamp"
[2:41:27] Harima048: but a flashlight is when you take a picture
[2:41:34] Serrybaarie: Rythian why are you so opinonated sometimes?
[2:41:35] Cindipool: The torch supplanted the torch as a source of light bowieThinking
[2:41:38] SeaThreePeeO: Didn't Rythian say last week there were different ways to say bucket in Swedish?
[2:41:41] natikar: feels bad
[2:41:41] georgehehheh: Nobody uses flame torches anymore and electric torches serve EXACTLY the same purpose
[2:41:43] UnderwurldChris: hand light?
[2:41:45] CountDaz: the modern torch is just a linear evolution of the flaming torch
[2:41:47] richisskill: well it was probably called an "electric torch" originally and then we dropped the electric part because people know what you mean (as long as they're not american lol)
[2:41:48] samm0212: Torch in the flame-on-a-stick context hasn't been used outside of minecraft and indiana jones films since like the 19th centruy
[2:41:56] georgehehheh: So torch makes perfect sense
[2:42:00] Goldbirdie: Rythian why are you Danish?

[2:43:55] boca_leche: I don't think infinite lava works
[2:43:57] 39SaltyCookies: OOOO
[2:43:59] kacs_ky: infinite only works with water
[2:44:19] tesaft: Does a polar bear fit in a boat?
[2:44:24] Goldbirdie: Why does kirsty have smelly particles
[2:44:29] SeaThreePeeO: You have to use dripstone and a cauldron under a lava source to make infinite lava
[2:44:31] CapraphobicSquid: brionyTap bear fren
