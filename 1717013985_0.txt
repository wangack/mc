[1:08:58] TheEggBeard: Oh the butterfly effect has a less depressing American Ending, too.
[1:08:59] roflwotl: The "ending" versus the actual ending
[1:08:59] vandlol: the cave always wins
[1:09:13] disscospider: the moss only grows one block out from water i think
[1:09:18] TyrsHTML: @Z0eff we live in the bad ending!
[1:09:20] Necrophcodr: a good conspiracy psychological thriller must have a "bad" ending
[1:09:22] RaiyneV: the end of infinity war was still so good to me.

[1:23:52] rax023: part of the fun is surmounting the glorp
[1:23:55] RufusTheHairyCatWrangler: You can tell this is the first time Duncan has actually had to do all this, rather than finding what he needs in his second inventory
[1:24:05] Faaafv: Chatting You can obtain it if you right-click with an Empty Syringe in your hand on any plant
