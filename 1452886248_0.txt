[0:15:46] Ner234: For a split second I thought this was a video game OMEGALUL . Something about the lighting made everything look kinda fake.

[0:17:04] Turbologic: Can we just ban stroll? KEKW
[0:17:05] Vargh: that's the penalty for Stroll I think
[0:17:05] TylerDuhCreator: im so over stroll
[0:17:21] celadriel23: the clip of alonso looking in his mirrors earlier is probably more than stroll has ever looked at his mirrors in his entire career
[0:17:24] bcdmonkey: @ris747 yes but last years top drivers can’t even finish a race with out there cars imploding
[0:17:25] bearman_tv: can we just ban Stroll already? LUL
[0:17:25] Tenkaichi500: glad there werent many crashes

[0:17:57] the__Benji: They only show the leaders + Merc
[0:17:58] celadriel23: its crazy tho that we're 3 races in and only 1 team does not have points yet
[0:17:58] lacr3: Nope
[0:17:59] Vargh: not a lot happened though
[0:18:00] Z8246: pitting in the last lap, gigachad

[0:18:03] Turbologic: Albon was in pit
[0:18:08] Turbologic: KEKW
[0:18:10] lacr3: The one corner after Riccardo coming out of the pits.
[0:18:14] HanzDiesel: how

[0:18:15] DDJJ77: @Giantwaffle albon 1 tire stop
[0:18:24] drsnaki96: with 2 SC but still
[0:18:24] IKineticTheory: was stting p5 for a while
[0:18:31] Vargh: Michael Schumacer finished in the pit once to have his one stop
[0:18:37] imTymp: yea he did a lap then pit then changed
[0:18:38] Vargh: so it's not unheard of
[0:18:41] cubejamf1: Whats mor eunbelievable is that his final 7 laps.. he was lapping faster than the McLarens
[0:18:48] DKFrits: SUSSY
[0:18:52] lacr3: Gigicgad
[0:19:01] Turbologic: @Vargh nop it was the a drive throught penalty

[0:19:25] L707644: @Giantwaffle check out the video in dc f1 channel about stroll KEKW
[0:19:28] Al_Kappaccino: in the future tires wont even be an issue i think, like a wing or something
[0:19:29] LordDusk: 0 pits is possible, can't remember which race it was, but somewhere in the 90s it happened.
[0:19:29] Al_Kappaccino: imo
[0:19:41] celadriel23: only 1 team w/o points now
[0:19:42] Shotouw: Albon also had some life in those tyres left and I have no clue how
[0:19:47] cubejamf1: I wonder what Albon could have done if they pitted him 4 laps earlier on the softs, he was so fast on those new tyres
[0:19:49] LordDusk: No no, if it rains, the requirement is gone, even now.
[0:20:05] finbab: Good race from the honey badger too
[0:20:11] thedudde: and albon raced is butt off. flat out whole race

[0:22:55] KrupTionn: YEP
[0:22:55] Turbologic: YEP
[0:22:59] SgtSnipes2: i remember Vettel had a race in singapore where he won by doing a no-stop and then pitted on the literal last lap. because the start/finish line was further than the pit exit he was technically able to finish the race without actually putting a lap on a new compound
[0:22:59] Vargh: Imola is a proper track yeah
[0:23:04] EeelsBadMan: Actual circuit but not great for overtakes
[0:23:05] GreenyZA: yes Imola is a proper track

[0:59:17] Mandorake: we did it in 30 mintues
[0:59:21] ForgottenTime: Do you think cause the draw of this game is the rolling of gems and items not the pve content itself?
[0:59:24] Mandorake: only reset p2 twice

[0:59:27] FaithTheFallen: is waffle close to 1400 yet?
[0:59:27] rykk3r1: AYAYA AWOO

[0:59:39] Leviterian: we took like 25 minutes in a party finder :D
[0:59:47] TxMaverick88: P1 & P2 are easy. P3 kicks it up a notch but its not too bad

[1:00:43] Shiiratama: maybe pity stuff? we had a similar situation where a supp paladin finished the argos solo when we had like 5 seconds left this week
[1:00:45] ForgottenTime: Do you think your not feeling cause the draw of this game is the rolling of gems and items not the pve content itself, and now your all gambled out?
[1:00:49] MistaBleak: i have a shadowplay of it, we finished at 0:02
[1:00:51] rykk3r1: having done argos p3 undergeared as a bard for 2 weeks, it was a good challenge, now that i'm at ilvl it's a faceroll
[1:01:21] TxMaverick88: @rykk3r1 agreed. lot going on in P3 but most of it just doesnt matter

[1:03:53] Leviterian: they always have events beforehand
[1:03:54] Arkypoo909: They only wipe when they have big new things to add and need to start everyone over
[1:04:00] Decinho_: did u beat velganos?

[1:04:40] TigersLionsBears: thats how i feel about lost ark right now i login to it to complain how it could be so much better if they did x y z thing lol
[1:04:48] Woodzee__: The game has its flaws but its still an absolute gem

[1:05:41] ashla11: people keep saying south vern will bring more materials, but how much?
[1:05:47] TheEndMyFriend: Lost Ark has nice classes and combat, but sadly its still an asien game
[1:05:55] god_of_transparency: about three fiddy

[1:19:59] Larklen: We gamba on hone? pepeLaugh
[1:20:03] ForgottenTime: I think it’s just that when you play Tarkov at the start of the wipe people just want to watch other people play it. So maybe playing at off times more people want to watch it

[1:33:51] Venxuri: and nameless valley
[1:33:53] kdarith: swamp and nameless valley are Pog
[1:34:10] nathrizen: the loading things takes longer than the quest
[1:34:11] SolarisFall: I wish you could hide tasks where the rep has been completed. Like I will never do rethramis una again once the rep is done. pls let me hide it
[1:34:20] InoUno: Click the little compass icon on the quest to quikly open map for warp
[1:34:52] FUNKz: @SolarisFall sort by reputation quests
[1:34:59] Purecrew: Based on time its taken me 2 months to get 11, You need a total of 15 of each card for max awakening meaning it should only take me 4-6 more months to complete my Lights salvation 30 awakening but RNG can be a bitch so who knows.
[1:35:07] Traaxus: once you finish that chain you can also do the feiton skill point potion chain.
[1:35:31] SlyPoooper: WICKED just got 2 to 100%
[1:35:32] Dagmoo: @solarisfall you could kind of do that by favoriting everything and remove as you complete reps
[1:35:42] Woodzee__: Yudia has one rapport? Try that first
[1:35:50] SawyerStreamsStuff: yudia has 2
[1:35:50] SlyPoooper: Yudia is fastest

[1:36:21] SawyerStreamsStuff: West Luterra has 1
[1:36:45] Dagmoo: @solarisfall kind of annoying tho because then you cant really use favorites to see the few unas you want to do every day quickly
[1:37:15] Nexhunter: i wish we could change our advanced classes
[1:37:18] produkteriswf: yep
[1:37:20] rykk3r1: i'm using it on a gunlancer

[1:37:59] Nexhunter: technically sorc was nerfed millions of times and is still op so KEKW
[1:38:00] Shadowl0: having second blade is nice. i play one surge one remaining for different feel to class
[1:38:03] Decinho_: waiting for scouter
[1:38:18] imTymp: my accessories on bard are too expensive no way id make another bard
[1:38:19] Neonnimbus: my question is if you didn't use all your 302 power passes will the next time you use be the feiton pass?
[1:38:25] AceBlizzardz: scouter will become my new main
[1:38:25] FUNKz: @SolarisFall no, you literally go to the daily quest window and in the drop down menu click reputation quests
[1:38:36] Nexhunter: pepeLaugh
[1:38:41] Purecrew: Nope because they are Vern Power passes
[1:38:47] Purecrew: Its in their names
[1:38:49] Nexhunter: he doesn't know pepeLaugh
[1:39:03] Nexhunter: yes
[1:39:04] SlyPoooper: yes
[1:39:06] Nexhunter: you select which one
[1:39:07] Grondulin: yes
[1:39:08] imTymp: yes you can choose i think
[1:39:11] Neonnimbus: oh ok cool
[1:39:11] SolarisFall: @FUNKz holy shit you can scroll down on that drop down? mind blown KEKW
[1:39:23] imTymp: id be so sad
[1:39:25] Nexhunter: would be hilarious KEKW
[1:39:27] garyllama: what's the difference between powerpass and knowledge transfer? other than cost and time
[1:39:28] Angrytroutt: hopefully deadeye becomes viable, was having fun with it till I tried pvp.
[1:39:30] Neonnimbus: I dunno it just says power pass on the char select so wasn't sure
[1:39:51] FUNKz: @SolarisFall and now you can see only the quests you can do do get reputation, that's what you wanted
[1:39:51] DX_Plates: DX_Plates subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 42 months! The Answer
[1:39:52] SnoLys: just done a guardian with a sorc without stone, no engravings, level 21 accessories and 976 item gear O_O
[1:39:56] Mandorake: deathblade good at everything
[1:39:56] Nexhunter: @garyllama powerpass for say feiten gets you all the way to 960 ilvl where you just then gotta hone to 1100 without having to hone to each stage in KT
[1:40:00] Traaxus: a good DB in arena is scary.
[1:40:02] ayaya_prime: I had a match yesterday with 3v3 all deathblades lol
[1:40:18] Nexhunter: OMEGALUL fuck that shit
[1:40:18] Purecrew: Yea you can choose which one to use but you dont get your vern power passes upgrade.
[1:40:20] Angrytroutt: terrible
[1:40:25] Angrytroutt: the cc WutFace
[1:40:27] BrocketMann: I'm guessing with the feiton powerpass it gets you to 960 before feiton right? not after?
[1:40:31] nathrizen: that's how they get you; a growing roster to eat up more time monkaS
[1:40:35] Nexhunter: @Brock_Anthony after
[1:40:38] BladesSama: huh
[1:40:40] garyllama: @Nexhunter are side quests and such completed with one and not the other as well?
[1:40:43] produkteriswf: wait what

[1:41:08] Derckington: hmm
[1:41:17] nathrizen: dude, this seems like sometime we need to test and verify
[1:41:17] rykk3r1: pretty sure u get more vendor currency higher
[1:41:22] Warkless: i oneshot everything on highest, so it won't matter
[1:41:22] nathrizen: something*
[1:41:24] AceBlizzardz: its not equal but its so small a difference it dosen t matter
[1:41:29] SolarisFall: @FUNKz thanks my dude! that helps alot
[1:41:35] BrocketMann: Well that would have been nice to know before I grinded out t2 chaos dungeons for glaive KEKW
[1:41:45] Purecrew: If you are on shoting everything anyways at high levels it wont matter
[1:41:47] hotdove911: there is no difference if you one shot everything
[1:41:55] imTymp: using potions in chaos? just be a bard never pot again KEKW
[1:41:55] Moobot: You can find Waffle's Youtube channel here - https://youtube.com/giantwaffle
[1:42:02] Archelonde: Who uses potions in chaos?
[1:42:41] Archelonde: Well, you also dont run a chaos build to clear it fast KEKW
[1:42:52] Purecrew: 1430+ people can pretty much do 1400 and one shot everything anyways so time is the same.
[1:43:28] Warkless: i oneshot everything at 1400
[1:43:29] Pikutinho: yes :)
[1:43:30] imTymp: ur not?
[1:43:30] FUNKz: 1395 YEP
[1:43:32] Purecrew: Nah just 1400
[1:43:35] Tenkaichi500: i am YEP
[1:43:35] emanymanheman: what una's do you do after T1/ I feel like all the takss only give t1 mats
[1:43:41] Scardi06: 1385
[1:43:50] Tenkaichi500: im 99999 YEP
[1:43:54] Grondulin: everyone is 1400 by now, everyone under is an alt
[1:43:55] imTymp: im 1  hone from 1390 so basically 1430
[1:44:05] SnoLys: @emanymanheman una rewards scale with you, so if you are t2 they give t2 mats, if you are t3 they give t3 mats
[1:44:05] PellyPlays: i just got to 1365 and feel like i have been doing dailies for months and burning mats out the wazzo
[1:44:12] PellyPlays: wazzooo
[1:44:16] emanymanheman: @Grondulin my main is 600 lol
[1:44:18] MartyL48: 1319 on main here
[1:44:30] nathrizen: lopang for T2 alt gives ~13k per quest.. so 39k per char.  -7k for ports so about 32k per char
[1:44:30] contravize: i was grinding unas for charisma etc. until i hit 1385 on my main and i HAD to switch all my alts to lopang
[1:44:36] simon3161: @Grondulin my main is 1396 with two 1370 alts lol
[1:44:42] Saisino: Agreed
[1:44:48] samuraijac: 1397.5 and ill hopefully have all 5 alts in t3 by reset
[1:44:51] Larklen: Spent all day appliance shopping ResidentSleeper
[1:44:51] Purecrew: The T3 honing chance for alts once you hit 1385 is actually insane for saving mats on alts getting to 1340
[1:44:52] Grondulin: @emanymanheman @simon3161 just joking xD
[1:44:55] defaultnew: i spent 14k blue stones and 32 books to try for 1360-1370 yesterday KEKW and still didnt get it

[1:47:46] daemonaedryn: Who doesnt want a tank? Imagine that conversation starter NODDERS
[1:47:48] ba_nanananananana: most tanks are 1-3M tho. Only the SAM systems are 20M
[1:47:58] Larklen: "It's hard but honest work KKona "
[1:48:07] Nexhunter: but a mine clearing system would be so good for farming cause you can till your soil quickly KEKW
[1:48:10] nathrizen: lol that sounds so badass
[1:48:12] DrWinston0Boogie: pfft, you know if that happened in the US we would be paying taxes

[1:48:20] Myekos: isn't Ukraine offering 1M for Russian pilots to give up their planes? :)
[1:48:23] Nexhunter: @DrWinston0Boogie they don't get to keep them
[1:48:24] Saisino: 1-3M is a shit ton in Ukraine  lol
[1:48:33] KingMidasNV: Ukraine is such a badass place. following some of the gov people on twitter is awesome

[1:50:41] TheMeowstardCat: Never did the clock clock app, Imo clock clock is horrible
[1:50:59] Allmostdone: But the oil companies told me that climate was a hoax. Kappa
[1:51:06] Sylamun: EVs are great but not a solution
[1:51:16] ba_nanananananana: lithium is a trace element tho, we can't just keep building and wasting lithium batteries (and most are wasted)
[1:51:18] highvltge: problem is world's dependency on coal for power
[1:51:19] Tenkaichi500: btw i hated moonfall but loved the CGI
[1:51:25] emanymanheman: what sucks is buying an ev is good but the big problem is like 5-10 companies that produce the majority of co2 emissions
[1:51:28] officialhunterx: lets say you were to retire right could techically make a subscription based service to keep your vods so we can watch them i would pay for that
[1:51:43] SolarisFall: apparently nissan is working with NASA to develop really efficient batteries that won't require rare earth metals
[1:51:45] TheMeowstardCat: Let me know when they roll out free charging and super fast speeds in my area until then I will stick with gas. No way I can charge my car in under 10 minutes
[1:51:46] Nexhunter: @officialhunterx he just set his vods to sub only
[1:51:48] Sylamun: cars dont even matter tbh. It's the industry that uses most of the energy
[1:51:48] Nexhunter: NODDERS
[1:51:48] ba_nanananananana: whenever someone says "recycling", bitch, we don't even recycle plastic, we just ship it to poor countries and they dump it.
[1:51:49] MushuTushu: isnt most pollution from corperations, so residential EV's are a drop in the bucket
[1:51:54] Apparentthreat: If anything, EVs will help with pollution in urban areas. No one likes smog
[1:51:57] Cmdr_Void: consumer emissions are a joke compared to industrial ones. so someone has to convince the big corpo's to change....
[1:52:02] Nexhunter: @Apparentthreat damn straight
[1:52:04] TelRehiad: @Giantwaffle I've been playing LA super casually, I'm at 600 item level 15 hones tier 1. Am I supposed to just keep honing to 800?
[1:52:18] Dagmoo: i mean didnt the kurzgesagt we watched say we are no longer on track for catastrophic global warming?
[1:52:19] officialhunterx: carbon filters
[1:52:27] Sylamun: Dude you have no idea how much energy the industry uses. Cars are a drop in the bucket
[1:52:27] ba_nanananananana: rural anything, e.g. alaska, is just not for EV
[1:52:28] Nexhunter: @Dagmoo oh no we still are KEKW
[1:52:32] Warkless: Trains? devCheck
[1:52:36] nathrizen: @TelRehiad no
[1:52:45] daemonaedryn: optimistic?
[1:52:46] Myekos: sponsored perhaps?
[1:52:48] Nexhunter: it is against doom and gloom consumerism
[1:52:52] Apparentthreat: Nexhunter people will say "EVs still get power from fossil fuels" and I'm just like "so? Won't be like that forever" and then I have the statement I made.
[1:52:54] Nexhunter: not really the fact we are on track
[1:53:00] Dagmoo: @nexhunter yeah i struggled with believing it...
[1:53:01] emanymanheman: yeah one of my profs who is at the top of the field for water/climate management in Chicago says we're still fairly fucked
[1:53:04] Warkless: It never said we are not on track for it, it just said it's not as a bad Susge
[1:53:04] contravize: i dont think cars are even significant, its industry polluting the world
[1:53:05] The1_TS: Read a good article, the metals required in the future EV worled are also mostly in countries we don't want to give money to.
[1:53:13] Chronoes: I think it's more like, we're not going to demolish it but still significantly hurt the climate
[1:53:16] Sylamun: 60% of your carbon emission is buying stuff
[1:53:18] daemonaedryn: It felt like a "So we're kind of fucked, and keep fucking up, but theres a CHANCE!"
[1:53:21] Sylamun: 30% is eating meat
[1:53:22] Nexhunter: so the video was more about the fact that we shouldn't be going into gloom and doom capitalism
[1:53:27] Nepli: Agreed, I love kurt vids, but this one felt like a slight miss. True we are a lot better but we're still a LONG ways away
[1:53:32] defaultnew: I mean the oceans are literally being decimated KEKW what do we do when all the ocean life is gone
[1:53:35] Tenkaichi500: covid helped LUL with envirement
[1:53:36] Cmdr_Void: 3° temp climb is still millions of people dying. so there is that. still better than everyone dying
[1:53:42] even__odds: dude anyone that says EV don’ t have enough range for every day use doesn’ t know what they’re talking about.
[1:53:43] daemonaedryn: Imagine a world where lobbying was illegal.
[1:53:45] SolarisFall: @TelRehiad once you get ilvl 600, open auction house and buy 802 pieces. don't hone passed +15 on T1
[1:53:48] myKunami: next lobby will be drinking water
[1:53:50] Nexhunter: chat you all literally missed the meaning for the video asroBlank
[1:53:52] ba_nanananananana: I love how especially with energy it's just lobby vs. lobby, ideology vs. ideology
[1:53:54] Myekos: the planet just has to outlast the oil supply
[1:53:55] Al_Kappaccino: lobbying is illegal in some places
[1:54:01] TelRehiad: @SolarisFall perfect. ty.
[1:54:08] ba_nanananananana: German energy politics is truly the dumbest shit no matter which party.
[1:54:09] BoooFN: africa is gonig to have x3 its current population probably monkaHmm
[1:54:15] PellyPlays: we will not hit 10 bil population
[1:54:17] Tenkaichi500: how many grey population will we have?
[1:54:18] VitaminT93: We are most likely living in the era with the most populated earth.
[1:54:22] Nexhunter: the doom and gloom capitlisim the video was about is where we say cause well we are dead time to go buy a hummer, but we aren't at that point were doom and gloom is all that is left cause enough work has been done and best to continue it
[1:54:22] Sylamun: If you want to help, stop buying things
[1:54:28] Nexhunter: fuck no they aren't
[1:54:29] ThatOnneGuy: I've heard a lot of theories that one of the reasons we're still as fucked as we are is because the generations in power are still those that care more for profit than anything, and hopefully our upcoming generations are a little more... sensible... the internet helps a lot tbh
[1:54:31] Chronoes: hell no
[1:54:31] Nexhunter: they went backwards
[1:54:32] ba_nanananananana: no we're on gas and coal.
[1:54:33] VikkeB: Lol
[1:54:34] st3x_: sadly we are not
[1:54:35] defaultnew: pepeLaugh
[1:54:36] davethulhu: i have bad news for you
[1:54:38] 13hunteo: UK energy grid is like 70% renewable
[1:54:39] Grondulin: nope they on coal
[1:54:41] punkgeek: Germany gets a ton of gas and coal from Russia, too
[1:54:42] RandomNotes: allot of EU countries shot themselfs in the foot by trying to get off nuclear power
[1:54:44] Dagmoo: @defaultnew exactly i dont know how we will be ok with even the current ocean trends everything will be completely gone with 3C warming
[1:54:46] lange__: Germany have opened alot of coal and gas in the last couple of years
[1:54:47] MrArrig: Coal/gas is pretty widely used still in germany
[1:54:48] Kman1026: What is the AI response program you always talk about?
[1:55:01] Chronoes: Planned to expand gas transport from Russia, removed nuclear plants
[1:55:01] DX_Plates: @TelRehiad Unce you get to +15 ilvl 600 I think you should unlock Vern questing, which is were you get your next level of Chaos Dungeons which will start dropping the next tier gear.
[1:55:02] Tenkaichi500: cant buy things? then i should unsub right KEKW
[1:55:03] ba_nanananananana: We shut down half of our nukes and replaced them with gas and coal. And we burn wood to heat homes LUL
[1:55:04] WeirdestYeti: the plan was for 2030, now its 2025 in germany
[1:55:09] defaultnew: @Dagmoo yeah so i guess bye bye to breathable surface air pepeLaugh
[1:55:16] Sylamun: thats a farce. They dont account for the fact that energy storage barely exists. Its all an accounting trick
[1:55:18] Al_Kappaccino: lol
[1:55:18] daemonaedryn: The companies did a really good job on putting the focus on peoples carbon emissions and ignoring company emissions
[1:55:19] isfil: They said that Humanity has a 12Billion Humans limit, population is only growing because of Development countries, that are in the transition to industralization
[1:55:41] Nexhunter: well duh
[1:55:42] emanymanheman: my dad always makes the point that is useless buying EVs since the electricity comes from coal/gas anyway and that's when I realize why we are in the position that we are
[1:55:43] ba_nanananananana: we don't have the tech or any idea how to replace coal. Except with gas. Which doesn't really help. Also, that gas is Russian.
[1:55:49] VitaminT93: We are most likely living in the era with the most populated earth.
[1:55:57] officialhunterx: not if putin has a say
[1:56:04] FlammAlpha: that's china I think
[1:56:08] ayaya_prime: that's china
[1:56:09] Sylamun: the only realistic solution is nuclear
[1:56:10] vycount_frost: chinas 1 child policy
[1:56:10] Nexhunter: @ba_nanananananana and the nuclear rods also come from Russia for Europe pepeLaugh
[1:56:10] defaultnew: that was china
[1:56:17] lurking_2: Japan would want the opposite if anything
[1:56:17] Tenkaichi500: oml they want to replace a busy train route with buses in ontario NotLikeThis
[1:56:18] TheWonderLlama: China had the one child policy
[1:56:22] ba_nanananananana: German Energiewende is originally (and still largely) about exiting nuclear power. It was never about carbon. LUL
[1:56:22] Nexhunter: china is a gov policy but was loosened up
[1:56:29] Al_Kappaccino: we just need better capacitors for solar
[1:56:31] punkgeek: Japan's population is in decline, they aren't going to do that
[1:56:33] Nexhunter: japan isn't
[1:56:34] Larklen: Japan's population is seriously in decline
[1:56:35] defaultnew: Ya japan is struggling right now with a birth decline
[1:56:36] Venxuri: I discovered RealLifeLore on youtube and its great been really enjoying the videos
[1:56:38] nathrizen: japan is declining pop
[1:56:39] Nepli: Japan is very old
[1:56:42] ayaya_prime: japan's average age is extremely high
[1:56:44] Nexhunter: japan population decline is where they need to encourage some fuckery
[1:56:50] sogerr: japan wants people to have kids, tokyo is overpopulated but a lot of old people
[1:56:51] TheWinslowWonder: Japan needs more Young people to support the older people
[1:56:51] Nexhunter: or swap to immigration acceptance
[1:56:52] isfil: China and they do not have that law anymore, because china has a male problem (Too much males to females ratio)
[1:56:54] TelRehiad: yes. hikimori is a huge problem
[1:56:58] Nexhunter: Russia is/was also in decline
[1:56:59] TheWonderLlama: Yeah, work/life balance got out of whack, so no one is having kids
[1:57:00] MrArrig: Its a problem of age distribution iirc
[1:57:03] officialhunterx: just make it illgal to have babies easy Kappa
[1:57:05] Nexhunter: but they had a resurgence of children being brought in asroBlank
[1:57:06] ThatOnneGuy: there was a country that was paying for breedable men suitors because they're having such an issue with the younger generation not having children
[1:57:17] Al_Kappaccino: if everything is automated, population drop might be a good thing
[1:57:23] emanymanheman: I feel like as the boomer generation continues to die off, a lot of countries will have population decline and will then stabilize
[1:57:25] 0sem0: Some bad shit happening in China Shanghai right now
[1:57:35] Sylamun: bad shit is always happening in china
[1:57:36] BoooFN: veiKiss chu
[1:57:50] Nexhunter: @emanymanheman every industrialized population will have decline if you aren't accepting immigration from developing nations
[1:57:51] ohbi78: trusts, trusts everywhere
[1:57:52] Myekos: it'll go to their kids
[1:57:58] even__odds: its already a problem, not enough people for the job market
[1:57:59] Nexhunter: not all kids or younger folks are okay
[1:57:59] Moobot: You can sub to Waffle by clicking this neat link -> twitch.tv/giantwaffle/subscribe
[1:58:01] Larklen: soon COPIUM
[1:58:10] ba_nanananananana: most things about German energy politics is marketing. The actual numbers suck. When you hear "100% renewable" then it's like one day in Summer, rest of the year we're EU average or worse. France is good.
[1:58:12] Tenkaichi500: COPIUM
[1:58:14] Asthrun: true for me
[1:58:15] MrArrig: It's gonna increase wealth disparity drastically
[1:58:16] ThatOnneGuy: I'll get almost nothing when my parents die :)
[1:58:22] TelRehiad: can't wait for the old politician boomers start disappearing. good riddance.
[1:58:23] god_of_transparency: not false
[1:58:30] officialhunterx: im getting a poop when my parents pass
[1:58:37] Sylamun: "100% renewable" energy contracts are actually 70% AT MOST
[1:58:44] Larklen: KEKW
[1:58:44] st3x_: @ba_nanananananana france still got a lot nukes, right?
[1:58:48] Sylamun: because the other 30% simply doesnt exist
[1:58:49] ThatOnneGuy: KEKW
[1:58:49] rykk3r1: KEKW

[2:00:49] daemonaedryn: What was the word?
[2:00:49] Venxuri: kurwa? yes
[2:00:51] ba_nanananananana: st3x_ when you as the German Green party if they'd rather have nuclear power for low carbon or keep on the current system, they pick the current system 100%
[2:00:51] amarillo16: Minecraft today?❤️

[2:33:07] MushuTushu: vscode is king
[2:33:17] UselessSlime: Same. I live inside Emacs :) If I could get away with it, I'd even use EXWM, the Emacs window manager
[2:33:17] Hibame: @Nexhunter worth every dollar
[2:33:20] UnforkableOnion: use emacs Kappa
[2:33:23] BilusTheTiny: vim 😏
[2:33:29] TelRehiad: @UnforkableOnion sadist.
[2:33:30] Apparentthreat: yeah, vim best tbh
[2:33:31] daemonaedryn: I think that colour means its a rare trinket
[2:33:33] Nexhunter: god damn terminal editors sodaMad
[2:33:33] itsIffy: @Giantwaffle jetbrains will soon release fleet to combat vscode, yet have the options to retain the ability of a full fledged IDE
[2:33:34] FlammAlpha: OMEGALUL use vi for everything
[2:33:38] Face_32: the turtles arent hostile tho
[2:33:43] chaoskub: I use VS Code, but with VI keybinds

[2:35:43] itsIffy: intellij widepeepoHappy
[2:35:50] UselessSlime: Fleet is gonna be fun, especially if it takes the nvim approach and I can use it's server component for wild nonsense :)
[2:35:55] chaoskub: @Nexhunter I don't ONLY use VI bindings. I just prefer them 80% of the time when writing text, and they have large benefits for developers who are frequently doing actions VI has functions for.
[2:36:08] Brianmose12: D:
[2:36:10] chaoskub: But yes, there are a lot of useful keybinds outside VI
[2:36:11] chaoskub: <3

[2:38:57] SmartDoll: @Nexhunter always makes my day when someone at work screenshares and they spend 10 minutes editing config files with vi
[2:38:58] hiroscho: @cramazo but can it crash as much as eclipse?
[2:39:20] Nexhunter: @SmartDoll asroBlank let not talk about how slow I am with vi when editing on a server

[2:46:54] Nexhunter: my old boomer 28 year old eyes can easily read JSON but yaml that shit i fuck up constantly
[2:46:58] Azafure: Wouldn't it be more common higher up since there are less ores there?
[2:46:58] Akiron_rafa: NODDERS

[2:49:03] chaoskub: @mahoraz You don't need it if you handle your inputs, which you should be doing for security anyways.
[2:49:05] BrickDickJr: @Giantwaffle make some sharping kits so you can repair pick on the go
[2:49:07] Kipe33: I gave up on this pack cuz the endgame tokens felt too much for me
[2:49:09] Chronoes: my only problem with default JSON is the lack of comments
[2:49:13] Apparentthreat: FlammAlpha simply no Kappa
[2:49:18] UselessSlime: How's Ansible? We use Salt @ work and it gets on my EVERY nerve
[2:49:23] undeniablyrexer: you might want to look at what other colors of corundum you need and start growing it
[2:49:25] vebbeen: tried this pack and got stuck on beeswax.. feelsbad

[2:49:46] FlammAlpha: qynoaSlam combining terraform with ansible is actual pain tho
[2:49:49] daemonaedryn: or even better, a bee villager
[2:49:49] mahoraz: @chaoskub thats true if you are the only dev in the team or dont develop apis for 3rd part usage

[2:50:08] kerpenverpen_: KEKW

[2:50:08] Chronoes: @Chronoes comments for config files are often pretty useful
[2:50:09] Kipe33: you should definitely build the scanner if you need one specific ore
[2:50:18] MechaDom: Because you're looking for it
[2:50:18] Crossed_legion: biome

[2:50:47] SirKaelan: pepeLaugh

[2:51:00] Apparentthreat: Nexhunter peepoRun hashicorp
[2:51:01] PublicSafetyDan: Many ores spawn at 32. If you go higher where other ores don’t spawn you will be more likely to get coal.
[2:51:03] LokiRulez: ore generation chagned
[2:51:05] SirKaelan: Turns out it spawns literally nowhere LUL
[2:51:06] Azafure: Ye but it's more common higher in the world isn't it?
[2:51:07] vebbeen: @dobie yea i guess i need to find that dude
[2:51:09] imTymp: not all ores spawn up high tho so maybe more chance for coal generation?
[2:51:11] MrAppl3: can you make coal farms in this pack?
[2:51:14] daemonaedryn: Theres two ore cards for the scanner, the common one can find coal
[2:51:15] DrFriendly: I think you can check in JEI for the highest spawn rate y coordinate?
[2:51:32] FlammAlpha: PepLaugh at least I can blame it on the ansible team and I don't have to deal with it myself, I just gotta import it
[2:51:32] dobie: nah that doesnt exist in 1.16

[3:48:41] Larklen: I remember playing a lot of Lego Blockland as a kid KEKW
[3:48:42] SolarisFall: I remember grinding levels in EQ as a teenager for 16-18hrs a day for days on end with absolutely no problems
[3:48:42] MrBlueSky_729: they dont yet know how fast time goes
[3:48:46] maguschala: OSRS for sure

[3:49:04] Klorell: @SolarisFall the good old EQ times
[3:49:04] Igneous3: empty backpack?
[3:49:06] Retalia2: as an adult, we know "why would i do thisi for 6 hours when i could do this for 1 and get the same results" as a child all i saw was money going into my pocket, not how much per hour etc
[3:49:12] Face_32: @Tasar_ i was huge into whisky and coke back in wotlk days, it went hand in hand with my wow grinding
[3:49:13] AvaanKha: I farmed currency for a headhunter a few years back
[3:49:20] daemonaedryn: Nope
[3:49:20] Mitsuninja: timer check

[3:49:31] DimensionalShadow: Storage doing alright?
[3:49:34] daemonaedryn: Any area with a bit of open space
[3:49:35] SolarisFall: @Klorell hell yeah, especially the hell levels of early EQ, like vanilla and velious
[3:49:39] Larklen: To this day, I dont know how I beat Majora's Mask as a kid
[3:49:42] Face_32: @KrunkleDunk that would be sick tho
[3:50:25] Face_32: i personally hate games that use "inventory management" as a game mechanic
[3:50:27] xClod: yeah
[3:50:34] Kenanja293: check out little logistics for auto-fishing
[3:50:39] daemonaedryn: Check how difficult the crumbling catalyst is to make?
[3:50:44] Klorell: @SolarisFall i came in a bit late for that, only had a taste. i started really playing for Luclin
[3:50:46] DimensionalShadow: Fancy fishing rod
[3:50:49] Kipe33: you also need bait if i'm correct
[3:51:03] daemonaedryn: Make a tackle box
[3:51:03] Starlight82: Yeah! I almost can't play a single game recently. I've been player every day since 1995, and now the motivation is totally gone, lol

[3:51:52] Kenanja293: little logistics has vanilla auto-fishing, which got me plenty of fish-bones and nautilus shells
[3:51:56] Azafure: Maan when was the last time u had tic tacs
[3:51:56] daemonaedryn: Place the box down
[3:51:57] C0ldf1re: 🪱
[3:52:12] SolarisFall: @Klorell good then! they really weren't fun at all. Having a level require 4-5x the amount of xp for no reason was not fun. Took them years of complaining for them to actually look at the curves in detail and realise it was bugged
[3:52:14] TheGAM3Report: this is dank

[3:53:41] TigerLuv: is Bobber in chat?
[3:53:48] Ohjaytee: you have a fishing trinket
[3:53:52] Monty0x: The line and bobber are cosmetic. You can dye them
[3:53:59] Kenanja293: with little logistics you basically set up a tugboat to go fishing, set a route, and make a port where you empty it, and it just fishes items you can get from vanilla fishing

[3:58:26] DatBlindArcher: Yeh something like a disk drive
[3:58:29] Monty0x: Some storage drawers and a drawer controller for your most common items maybe?
[3:58:42] Retalia2: @thisisbrad just think of "its a really big chest that holds lots of stuff and you can upgrade it"
[3:58:44] matey1116: You havelike 1k seeds you can move from the chests to the bulk seed storage
[3:58:44] TheGAM3Report: can we apply the energistics to the storage? :tf:
[3:58:45] Retalia2: thats all it iis
[3:58:52] LokiRulez: @thisisbrad yea, its hpysical items that get stored, so the drives have a certain amount of space, which equates to how many items it can hold
[3:58:52] DX_Plates: @thisisbrad You know how people digitized their old VHS tapes. Its kinda like that.
[3:58:57] Monty0x: The worm has durability per cast

[4:01:09] maccabeus: who heals overnight?
[4:01:09] KrunkleDunk: that is the IRS sending a message
[4:01:09] Dagmoo: paper cuts always linger forever
[4:01:16] vlessthan3: healing factor is slowing down with age
[4:01:17] Fufcia: thats emotional damage
[4:01:19] IlsaGold: Fine cuts heal slower
[4:01:22] Ohjaytee: you should make some digital storage for those tax documents
[4:01:23] Mini___1: @krunkledunk, :D
[4:01:25] BobTaco21: This is why I digitized everything
[4:01:27] DrFriendly: I know nothing about runescape, but watched multiple episodes of a guy who could only move 1 tile at a time and had to unlock them with xp
[4:01:28] Apparentthreat: gonna make waffle fill out an injury report for himself
[4:01:39] TheGAM3Report: disinfect the wound
[4:01:40] Nepli: Oldge Sadge
[4:01:40] Drudo: does it depend on biomes?

[4:01:46] jmm548: no cause alot of blood does not go to it
[4:01:47] imTymp: scan everything yea its so simple
[4:01:50] dylan0806: Your rod and hook are to good
[4:01:53] MadsPH: doctor here, no clean cuts heal worse and slower
[4:01:57] Jibbur: Man... so sad my save corrupted on this modpack the day before I got to RS drives...
[4:02:00] Hibame: iphone can now do a decent scan with notes app
[4:02:09] Mandorake: @MadsPH why
[4:02:09] Tasar_: haha
[4:02:13] Strider1515: no, blood = scabs but paper cuts arent deep enough for cells to promote growth
[4:02:23] CanYouDigIt7: maybe you gotta eat the fish
[4:02:25] LiveType: light reflection
[4:02:26] MadsPH: you want a teared edge in order to get a nice scar
[4:02:28] maccabeus: waffleThink
[4:02:30] kerpenverpen_: you do all your taxes by yourself?
[4:02:32] pikabuhhh: oh no we are about to drift off minecraft again LUL
[4:02:33] DX_Plates: Smooth edges = less surface area for rebinding\healing?
[4:02:36] C0ldf1re: KEKW
[4:02:37] CD579: thats why doctors dont use scalpels and use rusty knives
[4:02:41] Apparentthreat: if there are multiple pages to scan, use a scanner. if one page just use a photo app to convert to PDF on phone
[4:02:47] Allmostdone: You need to be in a PHD program to understand a copier
[4:02:48] YOUCEP: is this mod inspired by terraria? first time i see it
[4:02:48] Skorpio1: perfect time to watch youtube vids about scanners Kappa
[4:02:51] jmm548: no cause alot of blood does not go to it so it heals slower
[4:02:52] MadsPH: I mean in order to get the least scarring
[4:02:53] Myekos: tape it tight, or superglue
[4:02:56] ba_nanananananana: Old household remedy for papercuts 1/4 shot glass of salt, 1 pinch of sugar, 1/4 shot glass of vinegar, 1/4 shot of everclear, apply to papercut. Doesn't work but it hurts much more
[4:02:57] Apparentthreat: unless you need 300 DPI pepeLaugh
[4:03:00] Eppixx: Glue
[4:03:06] TigerLuv: I use liquid bandaids
[4:03:06] Orin_The_Sly: Is the fishing rod to good? Maybe try without the tackle?
[4:03:07] Igneous3: not deep enough you'll have to wait for new skin layer
[4:03:09] Jibbur: What we fishing for chat?

[4:03:31] Tasar_: Apply "newskin" done
[4:03:34] Kenanja293: I'm still thinking setting up little logistics and then doing something else might be better than fishing for garbage
[4:03:35] Mini___1: NOTED
[4:03:38] Bleu_Forge: KEKW
[4:03:42] KrunkleDunk: he is trying to have it heal, not regret the weekend.
[4:03:44] xClod: KEKW makes sense now
[4:03:44] LiveType: Whenever I cut myself like that I clean well with soap and then seal the wound up tight. Heals within a week in most cases.
[4:03:46] Face_32: does this mod want larger bodies of water?
[4:03:56] hisdue: NOTED apply to mouth
[4:04:02] kerpenverpen_: it would be funny if you fished out a disk drive right now LUL
[4:04:05] Azafure: Your rod to good for bones?

[4:04:20] Rubinix: I wonder if there's a cooking recipe for the bones
[4:04:22] Azafure: idk man I don't fish
[4:04:33] TheGAM3Report: try withotu a worm
[4:04:38] GrimRipperGaming: don't u cut the fish with a knife for bones?
[4:04:40] Orin_The_Sly: waffleD We're all guessing
[4:04:58] maccabeus: I prefer boneless fish tbh
[4:05:04] Jibbur: use occultism to automate this for bones, that was my simpler solution
[4:05:04] CanYouDigIt7: Gotta catch a bigger fish and then check its stomach
[4:05:07] MrAppl3: there was a knife in the pack
[4:05:11] DoubleOughtNot: I just eat the bones.
[4:05:12] DX_Plates: Keep throwing the spaghetti chat, something'll stick eventually
[4:05:15] imTymp: just get bones its simple
[4:05:26] MrAppl3: waffleD
[4:05:27] Kenanja293: @Jibbur or set up little logistics
[4:05:31] Azafure: I found bones in chests in little huts by the water
[4:05:37] Immp: There is a Fillet knife, but the Fish bones are a Junk Reward from fishing
[4:05:38] madseed15: Jebaied
[4:05:41] TraxiRage: What are you trying to fish exactly?
[4:05:48] daemonaedryn: Its not really that complicated, its one block you add to your altar
[4:05:50] TraxiRage: THere is a fish rod from a pharaoh which you need for some quest I know that
[4:06:02] Orin_The_Sly: monkaHmm
[4:06:08] TheGAM3Report: i died at green dragons, you can have my bones :tf:

[4:06:20] Igneous3: worm broke
[4:06:20] minedmatrix: it might be a diamond fishing rod thing
[4:06:24] TraxiRage: But not sure if that's what you are looking for atm
[4:06:27] Gunsrude: I got one fish bone after leaving an autofish overnight.
[4:06:29] daemonaedryn: YEP
[4:06:32] minedmatrix: maybe a lower tier?
