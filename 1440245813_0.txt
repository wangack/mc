[1:09:10] NOOBY1278: you can get 4 with a 6/6 stone and two +9 equiped

[1:29:06] Xev_00: You can still get good accessories for less than 10k
[1:29:15] xymenez: timmacHMM
[1:29:18] Blasian__: think the consensus is that stats>engravings but you prio the engravings
[1:29:24] Neonnimbus: cheap legendary accessories with decent stats could be less than 5k even
[1:29:25] Cannonboot: u dont need that much gold lol, just get spec items,
[1:29:26] thoruk6: just don't be poor 4Head
[1:29:31] xymenez: I do, actually I do
[1:29:32] Othixz: Listen waffle... all you have to do is get better at the game. Then you will get more gold.

[1:37:47] BigOhNotation: pick up the boss rush unas weekly
[1:37:55] oldirty83: @Giantwaffle is LA also dying in NA or has it a more solid playerbase atm?
[1:38:01] WorkflowTV: Mod pack today?
[1:38:03] Neonnimbus: made more gold, still prob won't buy better budget accessories KEKW
[1:38:07] gitykins: bosh rush weekly at 1370 is so valuable
[1:38:30] oldirty83: yeah its crazy to see thats y I wanted to know .. feelsbadman .. I like the game :(
[1:38:33] LordDusk: Numbers are falling, but nowhere near dying numbers.
[1:38:38] Xev_00: KEKW
[1:38:47] st3x_: doomer mentality still in, huh?
[1:38:51] AIex_0: @oldirty83 the numbers are still really good tho all things considered
[1:38:53] Belgarath81: I enjoyed it when I played but there's no way I have the attention span to keep up
[1:38:57] Pumatrick: a big portion of the playerbase were always bots. inflated numbers were never real
[1:39:07] gitykins: with accessories there are way more class +3 something +3 than 2 non class
[1:39:07] Cannonboot: dont look for crit spec, look only for spec+engravis
[1:39:15] DeadlyBrother: do rings and earrings first
[1:39:25] Venxuri: stats > engravings
[1:39:39] Xev_00: You're going to need decent gear to even do Valtan though
[1:39:43] Cannonboot: u dont need the spec and crit balanced
[1:39:52] Cannonboot: u want 70-30 spec crit
[1:39:55] taysfaded: you can farm the accessories from hard mode and argos anyways buying now is just dumb
[1:39:57] BuIkpowder: 8 min till tooki. LFG T00ki
[1:40:00] oldirty83: oh and you reached 1370 GZ Waffle! :)
[1:40:06] madseed15: @BuIkpowder KEKW
[1:40:17] AIex_0: yeah i go all in spec then just crit from necklace
[1:40:20] Mandorake: Spec until 1200 then crit
[1:40:28] Melfcin: More spec= more dmg for surge. So yeah full spec
[1:40:36] RafaLorenzo: @BuIkpowder LFG GF can you help me?
[1:40:41] Sportman4Life: Necklace gives the most stats, so that could end up 70/30 if it has crit
[1:40:42] Rozz161: get spec/crit surge 3 on neck would be cheapest
[1:40:47] Qwerkie: it is infuriating that i have almost 200k harmony shards on my main and i can't use them on an alt
[1:40:49] Cannonboot: doesnt it just makes it 70-30 split? i heard the same thing, that u only need spec but i know some crit is nice for more dmg
[1:40:56] gitykins: put on +9 adrenaline and +9 ambush from books, use your stone, and then get 6 ambush from accessories and like lvl1 surge
[1:41:01] taysfaded: you can give it a few weeks and see what you get and if youre hard pressed on buying then you can fill then
[1:41:12] taysfaded: imagine buying everything now and getting better stuff same week
[1:41:24] KittenMitton: you get a lot of free class engravings so you should easily get +9 surge
[1:41:33] imTymp: yea i rolled a awakening spirit stone i got dropped and am very happy
[1:41:33] Mandorake: my stone luck has been trash.  i swear its rigged
[1:41:34] JonathanLivingstonSeagull: arent you supposed to leave surge at 1 and max out other engravings?
[1:41:37] Melfcin: mokamoka on my server poggers
[1:41:50] gitykins: you get free class from jewelry he means so you dont need x9 books on
[1:41:53] Archelonde: lol t t3's in my t2 raid and I did the most damage LUL

[1:47:16] Orin_The_Sly: +1 Chat just like to bich
[1:47:17] thunderdan11: its why i dont do infinite chaos
[1:47:18] Asphoron: Better than Moonmoon, playing some games to 85% and quitting
[1:47:25] Spaydex: i play every day, never do guardians lol
[1:47:26] Mandorake: @Giantwaffle ive never stuck to an MMO launch like this.  feels good.
[1:47:32] HCJobo: yea i def see that negativity from ppl, them thinking they can keep up with the hardcore players and getting upset about it
[1:47:34] Khealim: i ditched guardians for pvping only doing em with 40% pity for double loot
[1:47:43] imTymp: i play maybe 2 hours a day and im over 1370 with no alts a low lvl island and barely rapport casual isnt too hard
[1:47:45] MellowKoNeko: better off making another alt than doing infinite chaos
[1:47:57] Celnoc: did you see ATK's video about his daily routine where he starts like: "i first do leapstone dailies with my 6 alts, and then lopang for silver with my other 16 alts" LUL
[1:48:03] Archelonde: Honestly infinite chaos is fine for t1 and 2 cause theres a limit
[1:48:06] Archelonde: to what you can buy
[1:48:12] Mandorake: i forgot you can do sailing for guardian souls
[1:48:12] Archelonde: but t3 being 99 limit is nuts
[1:48:29] munko: how many hours a day does he play lost ark?
[1:48:36] PorkaYamigo: i use 0 alts almost in t3
[1:48:39] Mandorake: @Giantwaffle its also not you rmain Stream game

[1:49:43] ThatOnneGuy: munko oh probably 12-15 hours LUL
[1:49:44] Traaxus: zeals and saint can because they have KR chars and tons of alts. Just NA version doesn't seem like enough content for long streams
[1:49:52] Artoosa: 1340*
[1:49:54] ThatExcitedViewer: i think someone in chat said they have 1 main at 1375 and 5 others above 1300
[1:49:55] Swiper95: can switch abilities once they are on cd
[1:50:00] Asphoron: Cutedog_ has like 12 T3s and 500k gold
[1:50:00] PorkaYamigo: we need to get an alt before the game dies @PaulFlies LUL
[1:50:07] Archelonde: take a second after you go through portal to spec into prelude of death to make this easier LUL
[1:50:12] NexX_____: anno season 4 ?
[1:50:31] Spaydex: @Giantwaffle Zeals said he loves it, since he would be bored on NA without KR
[1:50:53] Sportman4Life: At some point there will be a plateau though. They've played for a long time on KR already
[1:50:53] heydreammm: Zeals wants to make NA his main but he’s waiting for more content
[1:50:56] imTymp: there is really only 1 ability u need to make mobbing as bard easy
[1:51:10] Spaydex: Yeah KR is much more fun right now
[1:51:28] Neonnimbus: you've said that for the past week LULW
[1:51:35] Tokinstaffel: you could swap out 1 skill and make this 100 times easier
[1:51:37] HCJobo: the server that is 3 years ahead of content is more fun, color me surprise Kappa
[1:51:37] Mandorake: @Giantwaffle Texas just ranked #2 in stress levels lol
[1:51:42] imTymp: its just prelude of death and u mark everything then kill 1 mob and they all explode like corpse explosiion
[1:51:43] imTymp: KEKW
[1:51:53] Sportman4Life: It's little work to give her the right abilities. Can just use another skill tab for it
[1:52:05] HellTime: You need chaos dung build for bard, it will be much easier
[1:52:25] Sportman4Life: @imTymp Yeah Lol And still fun
[1:52:28] Mini___1: boss room with that spec will be fun

[1:55:05] imTymp: the only use for the damag build is tower and solo chaos
[1:55:12] imTymp: its not needed if u dont do tower and u matchmaking
[1:55:42] Sportman4Life: Tower on Bard is hell, I can tell from experience

[1:56:31] sogerr: rox said on the forums they are afraid of backlash if they change the roadmap after announcing it
[1:56:33] folmerrr: april 2030
[1:56:39] Chronoes: your lie in april
[1:56:40] hisdue: road map is on the 7th ark, go find it

[3:26:11] LAWLTA: Gear on the ground auto sells
[3:26:16] Victo0: it looks kinda cool but also as someone who bought DDA it just looks like an alternative gamemode for the game that is instead sold as a 12€ standalone
[3:26:26] kkotoro: theres a portal next to the crystal
[3:26:26] NetAssetz: @LAWLTA nice - that's clutch
