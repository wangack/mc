[2:12:12] lilgangstagoth1: dont think the coils raise power usage do they?
[2:12:27] Peeeeeeeeeep: @eckphoenix if you compare a new EV vs new ICE car an EV is cheaper in the long wrong on maintenance and gas/electric, but it's a larger up front cost usually. But you can still find cheap ICE cars
[2:12:30] jayrickson87: coil blocks don't speed up the blast furnace. it just allows you to smelt different ingots

[2:12:56] kane1941: wouldnt you be able to generate power from the moon stuff?

[3:24:41] Niceyyy: nah it super niche
[3:24:42] Kuroiorb: Accurate
[3:24:42] drsnaki96: maybe moobot likes tech cause he doesn't bother it much
[3:24:44] daemonaedryn: This is practically an entirely seperate game from minecraft
[3:24:47] Slasher0915: There is huge potential for this
[3:24:52] Zohonde: you mean Satisfactory?
[3:24:53] Stormflare: did waffle forget factorio/satisfactory exists?
[3:24:58] dadmanandy: Logistics
[3:25:00] bugsplatter23: all the cost is in art
[3:25:02] smityp: Minecraft Dungeons is fire!!
[3:25:02] Soul12eaver: factorio and satisfactory would disacgree
[3:25:04] ashla11: spending time on the engine would likely make it not worth it
[3:25:07] daemonaedryn: The fact this modpack exists shows its not entirely niche
[3:25:07] kane1941: DSP doing great
[3:25:08] RingSong: Vintage Story is that, Waffle, more or less. Former minecraft modder making their own game.
[3:25:08] GuardMoony: game dev is much more work then mod dev
[3:25:15] M1k3D3l7a: execpt the dude who's selling his shader through Patreon, dunno his name anymore

[3:25:19] M1k3D3l7a: except*
[3:25:24] thebubbajones1: People like factories, look at anyone playing any game, if there’s a way for passive income/ mats then people go for it
[3:25:25] Slasher0915: It also partially intersects the incremental/idle game category
[3:25:27] kingasasin177: Engineer mindset
[3:25:27] Lorektxl12: my game crashes when loading
[3:25:32] DonMerkuzio: foxhole is not a logistic game btw KappaHD

[3:25:56] LethalBro: Gamefeel is such a weird magical thing to "optimize" for
[3:25:59] kane1941: You need a lot of resources to publish a game to make money, mods are just there on forums
[3:26:03] Yakobro: @Giantwaffle imagine this without DML KEKW
[3:26:15] M1k3D3l7a: or like a DLC?

[3:26:39] thebubbajones1: My apartment complex has a bulldozer here knocking down perfectly healthy trees, anyone know why?
[3:26:43] Scopes64: modding a game is easier than making a game in many cases, creativity and idea wise.
[3:26:43] LethalBro: Pog PATI
[3:26:48] Yakobro: rocket fuel pepeLaugh
[3:26:53] Lorektxl12: any idea on why Nomi crashes when i try to launch it
[3:26:54] aundros: Poggers
[3:27:01] stolen_muppets: Trees are the true enemy, Factorio teaches this
[3:27:14] Tompop23: Time/skill wise, how hard would it be to make this pack a standalone from scratch instead of just making a mod for mc though @giantwaffle ?
[3:27:31] thebubbajones1: @tompop23 years
[3:27:34] aundros: Very hard
[3:27:41] Tompop23: That’s what I thought
[3:27:43] Techniker32: Couldn't the space station help with power problems?
[3:27:46] Slasher0915: It's just complicated but it's easy - GiantWaffle 2022
[3:27:51] Tompop23: Like yes it might sell, but it’s not worth at all
[3:27:54] kingasasin177: That's what automation does
[3:27:54] Goldern: multiplayer would take a while @Tompop23
[3:27:54] daemonaedryn: Capitalism simulator
[3:27:59] Wazepas: in Eco you do the opposite Kappa
[3:28:05] thebubbajones1: It took a decade for cyberpunk and that was broken so, a working factory game would be at least 15-20 yeats
[3:28:07] MiraPacku: would be cool if there was a factory game in which you're trying to save the planet for once
[3:28:09] daemonaedryn: Yes
[3:28:11] The_Holas: what about ECO? Kappa
[3:28:11] kingasasin177: @Wazepas That depends Kappa
[3:28:24] Yakobro: not making a seperate drive for each fluid pepeLaugh
[3:28:26] daemonaedryn: Why not just keep every fluid in tanks?
[3:28:52] ninopanda: you can use it for rocket fule
[3:28:52] thebubbajones1: Open tanks are pretty
[3:29:11] bobolpwnz: Just use GregTech tank, it can auto void if full
[3:29:13] Corvous: doesnt super tank have a overflow void option you could use?
[3:29:25] daemonaedryn: Above 95% void
[3:29:31] itamarb77: use 1 interface for both centrifuge
[3:29:36] daemonaedryn: Yes KEKW

[4:53:44] Beergrillz: dont you only have 8 k storage ?
[4:54:06] SeaOfMadness_: "," is the decimal denominator
[4:54:09] mechoriet: pepeLaugh

[4:55:40] itsIffy: pepeLaugh he's not aware
[4:55:41] frainsbreeze: hit the left wrench
[4:55:48] aundros: Because its already stored on other disks and it won't do that
[4:55:49] GuardMoony: does it need a filter or someting?
[4:55:51] DopewasHere: Just unlocked yeagar
[4:55:52] NoisyPlays: check the number of the resonant ender to be sure it matches
[4:55:54] haqqbz: bug
[4:56:01] TheShaddo13: try priority -1000
[4:56:03] trisge: storage bus has no pull. It only puts stuff in there when new liquid enters the network
[4:56:06] end3avor_: unlock the storage interface temporarily
[4:56:08] fredam10: What kinda modpack is this?
[4:56:08] Sentinel1_9: @Giantwaffle is it putting into the upstairs tank for it?
[4:56:24] stormblaz: can u check another one that works for reference?
[4:56:28] kitty_cat20: maybe you will have to export the liquid of the system
[4:56:35] kane1941: Pati?
[4:56:39] officialhunterx: that was my thougt
[4:56:41] PeterZ_97: polymer clay?
[4:56:41] NoisyPlays: grab a rocket from the machine making it?
[4:56:42] rofl1436: elp pati
[4:57:02] mrleonehart: Put the bucket in the front and then click the left wrench
[4:57:02] Moobot: New here? Welcome! You can usually catch Waffle Mon-Sat at ~1400 UTC. Feel free to hang out in chat before the stream and/or join the !discord. waffleEgg
[4:57:03] Sentinel1_9: take the drives out see what happens
[4:57:05] stormblaz: is it connected properly
[4:57:06] Protonmat: export bus it till empty, then it should go into the tank
[4:57:10] end3avor_: temporarily unlock the storage bus (i.e. remove the resonant ender whitelist) and see if that works
[4:57:34] kaasrondje: Limiting it to 1 enderpearl is slowing it down, to much downtime
[4:57:35] lukasalbert: up the priority ?
[4:57:42] rofl1436: kaasrondje what?
[4:57:46] mechoriet: maybe cause it can't import front that side?
[4:57:53] Sentinel1_9: @Giantwaffle take the fluid drives out and check what happens
[4:57:55] Starmetal_: are you sure pati didn't change the priorities on the drives?
[4:57:59] nesse007: is going to the old system that pati made?
[4:58:02] iLu_786: Blow it up LUL
[4:58:04] officialhunterx: try unlocking the fluid tank
[4:58:06] lukasalbert: yeah higher is more important
[4:58:08] Dr_Alori: pull out all liquzid drives to test if there's a tank somewhere?
[4:58:08] Turnpoint: is there a machine that eats it maybe
[4:58:13] Sentinel1_9: @Giantwaffle that will tell you if theres another tank though
[4:58:13] NoisyPlays: have you tried turning your pc on and off again KEKW
[4:58:16] rofl1436: mechoriet the other ones are connected the same way
[4:58:16] Protonmat: export it from the system into the storage tank
[4:58:19] Koeckie: I did it with a export and storage bus. But diff. mod pack so
[4:58:24] kane1941: Is there an ME Fluid chest?
[4:58:25] rofl1436: Turnpoint no, its filling up the fluid drives rn
[4:58:25] TxMaverick88: @nesse007 basically, if the system is seeing it, it should be in that tank
[4:58:30] coolcake2: if you put more in to the tank, does the number increase in the storage system?
[4:58:33] magnus_tottrup: is the export hole on the back of the tank? maby wrench it to an other side
[4:58:33] pi70n: search with T if already is stored somewhere
[4:58:34] Vickens: high prio - insert there first and output from there last
[4:58:37] MidwayAtom: Does it work with another liquid? Then you can cross that the machine or not.
[4:58:39] 3mmpc: dont you need to configure GT machines to allow input from the back with a screwdriver? or is that different in nomifactory
[4:58:42] TPells67: Is it storing in the old storage sytem
[4:58:42] IlsaGold: memorycard needed for the bus?
[4:58:46] sorefingers: just leave it and let pati solve it😂
[4:58:47] Turnpoint: did pati maybe up the prio on the drives
[4:58:54] papatex15: FIFO
[4:59:02] AlfredTheSalmon: you can try passing your fluid drives trough an ME IO Port
[4:59:06] rofl1436: Turnpoint no we just checked its -1 for the drives
[4:59:15] kitty_cat20: yeah
[4:59:15] Moobot: Come join the Waffle House Discord! <# https://discord.gg/fhGFtMuzdS

[5:07:16] Moobot: You can find Waffle's Youtube channel here - https://youtube.com/giantwaffle
[5:07:19] dcirusc30: id say yes
[5:07:24] TelRehiad: don't you already have a system for glass?
[5:07:30] officialhunterx: i thought you automated glass already
[5:07:30] stormblaz: finish that page pls
[5:07:36] Gamernxc: completing early game Pog
[5:07:41] kane1941: dont you have obsidian furnace for glass?
[5:07:53] Daanaas: hi will be back round 4-5 PM
[5:08:15] Gamernxc: second last row
[5:08:21] frainsbreeze: in the back
[5:08:25] KnightofObv: the side with the oil bucket
[5:08:28] TelRehiad: I'm 90% sure you had a obsidian furnace system for glass already
[5:08:39] stormblaz: 10 days still gets lost
[5:08:44] HiRez45: hey guys first time chatter, i was just wondering if anybody had any advice for starting modpacks? i start them but am usually overwhelmed or dont know where to start
[5:08:50] Daanaas: LUL
[5:08:54] Daanaas: KEKW chat
[5:09:01] stormblaz: lmaoooo labels 😭
[5:09:07] kingasasin177: @HiRez45 Questbook if there is one is a good start
[5:09:21] TelRehiad: @HiRez45 try a direwolf pack. he tends to have youtube videos you can follow along with to start
[5:09:33] babyaddalyn: @HiRez45 FTB Academy
[5:09:43] stormblaz: yep do it
[5:09:54] Sentinel1_9: you can use the nichrome coils @Giantwaffle
[5:09:59] Tyvern: These homie's taking full advantage of the no-channel feature of this pack^^ Insane amounts of crating terminals everywhere
[5:10:18] HiRez45: @TelRehiad @babyaddalyn i have heard about both of these maybe i gotta give them a try. Ive been playing the 1.12.2 pack and tekkit 2 through the technic launcher
[5:10:27] Niceyyy: is it faster than obsidian furnace
[5:10:28] jayrickson87: the better coil make the multi smelter go faster
[5:10:31] lukasalbert: input output stuffs ?
[5:10:41] Sentinel1_9: @Niceyyy its like 32 at a time
[5:11:09] Sentinel1_9: Wokege
[5:11:15] Dagmoo: Wokege
[5:11:20] itsIffy: Wokege Clap
[5:11:21] alef2r: why are you using level emitter with an interface on top?
[5:11:43] eckphoenix: just do it lazy pants
[5:11:46] TelRehiad: @HiRez45 another option is looking at Sevtech Ages. it restricts what things you can even make based on "ages" which reduces the cognitive load required.
[5:11:57] Sentinel1_9: if you put it down here you should put it in its own room so you can put the HV ebfs in
[5:11:58] 00Seren: you have a glass system already
[5:12:03] Dagmoo: waffle could mute that sound but he doesnt just to keep us awake too :)

[5:12:47] mdsooter: so I tried FTB stoneblock 3 and dont like how much stuff it just randomly gives out, what's the best general pack w/ good quests you guys have tried?
[5:12:57] Bloodzure: Oh shit there's a moon?! Is that the end of the game? luniPog @Manacaym
[5:13:27] itsIffy: Wokege x2
[5:13:33] Thalmize: @Bloodzure no
[5:13:55] Thalmize: @mdsooter i recommend this one.
[5:13:56] CoolReal: @mdsooter that's the main issue with the pack however the devs say it's how they like it, "increases replayability" 🤷
[5:14:09] Manacaym: mid-early late
[5:14:31] Thegrinch6: we are now in the mid early late game
[5:14:33] Thalmize: @Manacaym going to the moon is shifting from early to mid game

[5:17:06] kingasasin177: What materials do you prefer to make those tools out of?

[5:17:13] Qbertman: bro how can you finish a c4 can within a day without having a heartattack?
[5:17:36] Butterwhales: at least for me my goal is progression and gathering resources and nothing prevents me from getting there in  like 3 days kingasasin177 :)
[5:17:36] daemonaedryn: Yknow you can just click the button, you dont have to drag the item into it?

[5:19:05] SeaOfMadness_: too far
[5:19:11] boyownik: D:

[5:19:52] CoolReal: Only 8 a second I think
[5:19:59] lukasalbert: faster extraction speeds ?
[5:20:31] lukasalbert: yeah the extraction speed upgrade
[5:21:22] Gamernxc: imagine HV monkaS
[5:21:25] memothegreat: worth it
[5:21:26] jayrickson87: it smells more per tick with better coils
[5:21:27] lukasalbert: if you use more advanced coils it smeltts even faster
[5:21:30] lukasalbert: its insance
[5:21:31] CoolReal: Do all the machines have multiblock versions?
[5:21:38] Vernash_: They are designed for lategame bases not to bring servers down lol

[6:03:34] 1killersquirrel: Why do you need an OR gate? You already filter for the inputs
[6:03:39] Lorektxl12: any idea on why when i try to luanch Nomi it crashes
[6:03:44] Zapper_777: makes perfect sense
[6:04:31] Sentinel1_9: have to filter the outputs though

[6:07:08] SirNickGaming: Make sure you limit the input to the chest otherwise it will fill with a single request
[6:07:12] Sentinel1_9: @Giantwaffle what i was saying is you have to filter the output from the me system in the conduits so it doesnt dump all the items its set to put into the smelter for the others if one item isnt met
[6:07:19] Pati: Hows the POGress been going
[6:07:23] IveBeenWandering: why not from top down to ender chest for more output
[6:07:24] officialhunterx: in his head its perfect by in reality it will be brokem
[6:07:27] mdsooter: could compress more by putting the chest in a corner instead of conduit right?
[6:07:29] Pati: Susge
[6:07:30] mechoriet: @PiratePati bad KEKW
[6:07:30] Scopes64: can use the back output too?
[6:07:32] Yakobro: COPIUM
[6:07:35] rofl1436: Copege
[6:07:37] Gamernxc: COPIUM
[6:07:40] Fufcia: COPIUM
[6:07:40] CameIMilk: chest is output
[6:07:52] Manacaym: @piratepati he's expanding power system
[6:07:57] Zapper_777: Pati we had near meltdown of the base
[6:08:22] officialhunterx: @PiratePati he hasnt made a single bit of progress towards the moon Kappa LuL
[6:08:33] mrleonehart: He ran out of power @PiratePati
[6:08:35] Pati: you WHAT
[6:08:42] Turnpoint: hahahah
[6:08:52] mrleonehart: Don't worry he fixed it @PiratePati  Kappa
[6:08:57] Sentinel1_9: @PiratePati weve almost made it so we're making more of the pulsating clay but also working on making more power
[6:09:00] Manacaym: what happened to Texas almost happened to the base
[6:09:00] Metti83: fixed KEKW
[6:09:05] evo_6: sand :)
[6:09:06] Thalmize: @PiratePati welcome back, waffle waffled everything
[6:09:17] WiPuff: Wouldn't half a stack be safer?
[6:09:19] Starmetal_: Power is FutreWaffle Problem Kappa
[6:09:20] k0ki_: PiratePati he needs you! Look at what he is doing FeelsBadMan
[6:09:37] InternetPlumber: the real answer is because EnderIO is fucking awesome
[6:09:40] babyaddalyn: it will still fill the multismelter continuesly
[6:09:48] Fufcia: Pati left for 30 minutes and Waffle is back to playing with Sand and Snad Kappa
[6:10:03] Sentinel1_9: wait
[6:10:14] Sentinel1_9: you need speed upgrades on those also @Giantwaffle
[6:10:15] mdsooter: you use global ender chest freqs? or did they change the mod?
[6:10:16] mechoriet: shouldn't it trigger on the end product and not the product you want to smelt?
[6:10:17] Tabakhase: worst placement possible YEP
[6:10:29] babyaddalyn: ok :p
[6:10:49] Tabakhase: why even mess with that chest (what can now fill up pepeLaugh )
[6:10:52] rofl1436: mechoriet it does in the lvl emitters
[6:10:58] SeaOfMadness_: can't you just use an import bus then?
[6:10:58] Gamernxc: ender chest in floor?
[6:10:58] CoolReal: It will only smelt 1 type at a time tho
[6:10:59] Yakobro: @Giantwaffle ender conduits extract real slow compared to the speed of the multismelter, might try greg robot arm + filter?
[6:10:59] Sentinel1_9: @Giantwaffle speed upgrades
[6:11:30] Tabakhase: call me lst here, but i got no clue why that enderchest is in that chain other than for making problems LUL
[6:11:35] thomasausen: why not use a import bus instead of conduit that should be faster right ?
[6:11:44] mechoriet: pepeLaugh you have all the time right
[6:12:01] Lorektxl12: how do i check what java i have
[6:12:03] rednnox: chat help me out, what was the game played on night streams 1v1 with a worm that would eat u at the end
[6:12:03] Alamose: need a few speeds on the output
[6:12:04] Sentinel1_9: @Giantwaffle you should do a 2nd enderchest into it that you can put upstairs to throw stuff into you need smelted so it gets smelted and dumped into the me system
[6:12:44] Moobot: Come join the Waffle House Discord! <# https://discord.gg/fhGFtMuzdS
[6:12:49] babyaddalyn: @Sentinel1_9 wont work with the counting filter into the smelter
[6:12:51] officialhunterx: you can bigger hatches
[6:13:03] ItsOnMax: Who in chat has never played Minecraft in his life but still loves to watch waffles stream? Because I am one of those YEP
[6:13:11] Sentinel1_9: @babyaddalyn hence the 2nd chest not the same chest
[6:13:12] rofl1436: BBQgril it just does one thing after another, but its so fast it does not really matter
[6:13:13] mdsooter: @Giantwaffle don't you need ender chest frequency protection?
[6:13:25] Filikeu: 9 at the same time, but u could have more
[6:13:26] 1killersquirrel: isn't kanthal automated by Pati?
[6:13:27] Gamernxc: @ItsOnMax not never but not in a long ass time YEP
[6:13:30] CoolReal: It's not a public server, it's fine
[6:13:31] Jastice01: @Giantwaffle are u making itr to the moon today?
[6:13:40] Pati: the smelting of it is automated
[6:13:43] Sentinel1_9: its semiautomated
[6:13:47] rofl1436: ItsOnMax i havent played for like 10 years but i still love watching it YEP
[6:13:52] officialhunterx: and ci
[6:13:55] mdsooter: @Giantwaffle anyone can use that color combo and use your stuff unless you put a diamond on your chests, then it's player specific
[6:14:01] 1killersquirrel: yeah, exactly, the smelting of ingots is automated
[6:14:05] Turnpoint: are you still on the side/main quest
[6:14:05] Tabakhase: HACKERMANS tapping into that pipe right now
[6:14:07] ItsOnMax: Glad I am not alone YEP
[6:14:14] stickman_02: @mdsooter not a public server though
[6:14:21] MrArrig: Have you started making noble gases yet? Takes a lot of time to make and huge towers that is a pain to make many of
[6:14:47] mdsooter: @mdsooter fair, but people can still use common combos accidentally
[6:14:51] NeSBigBasher1337: Chat is there any manuals/reading for mod packs? I'm trying skyfactory for the first time and I feel like so many steps are just lost
[6:15:43] piiixxx: yoo any EU eft players that wanne group up tomorrows ? feel free to add me -> piix
[6:15:45] kypudo: how are u dragging the items?
[6:15:49] TxMaverick88: @NeSBigBasher1337 some packs expect you to know the mods it uses. some packs use quests to explain everything
[6:15:56] TheShaddo13: round robbin?
[6:15:57] Sentinel1_9: round robin

[6:16:29] SeaOfMadness_: why are you making those TC coins?
[6:16:43] babyaddalyn: @SeaOfMadness_ platinum

[6:16:49] frainsbreeze: DML TO DA MOON!
