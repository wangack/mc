[0:51:14] Stragmol: they're "making it better"
[0:51:24] Derdrom_TJM: the adults are the niche community
[0:51:26] danilul9: KEKW
[0:51:26] bluedeed: Can they give DML red stone controls?
[0:51:30] itsIffy: pepeLaugh bugrock
[0:51:31] kypudo: bugrock XD
[0:51:39] itsIffy: java EZ
[0:51:40] stormblaz: @Giantwaffle Is it me or is MC updates take a LOONG time for not much they put out
[0:51:41] ChromaCym: Complex is a great way of putting it. I kinda miss how simple everything used to be and when you wanted to do something complicated you just figured it out instead of having it built into the game
[0:51:44] MaxNeedsSnacks: there's also gonna be a new questbook tab for processing lines
[0:51:50] Face_32: bugrock is only that bed because it has to run on mobile too so they are limted
[0:51:51] Venxuri: microsoft can afford to buyout companies that took the risk, they don't need to take the risk themselves :D
[0:51:51] Raphgeibuh: badrock
[0:51:52] Feartjeh: movement is so weird in bedrock
[0:51:53] stormblaz: It takes years!
[0:51:57] stormblaz: for like a few things
[0:51:59] Razorain56: pretty sure they will stop supporting Java in the near future.
[0:52:03] Mfdtgamer: early to mid dev was SO quick
[0:52:05] Mfdtgamer: wack
[0:52:06] itsIffy: secret friday redstone YEP
[0:52:07] MaxNeedsSnacks: tbf with 1.19.3 they just completely fucking scrapped how creative tabs used to work
[0:52:08] ChromaCym: oh and sometimes those updates would break absolutely everything lmao
[0:52:10] MaxNeedsSnacks: and added feature flags
[0:52:15] ChromaCym: they broke leaf decay like 7 times
[0:52:16] MaxNeedsSnacks: and all of that other overengineered bs
[0:52:18] Cstroom: bananan
[0:52:22] Babyblasphemy: it sucked for people that ran servers, always having to wait for the plugins to update then updating the server
[0:52:23] Mfdtgamer: @CJS7070 good times man
[0:52:27] bluedeed: Microsoft needs to hire gregoriousT
[0:52:29] Derdrom_TJM: the kids still love vanilla MC though
[0:52:39] HEEZON: We'll see what happens to WoW if Microsoft buys Activision-Blizzard
[0:52:39] ChromaCym: or back when fire would spread indefinitely ahaha
[0:52:50] DFron1: yes
[0:52:51] GGoodGGuy: haha what is villager doing in your office?
[0:52:55] IlsaGold: yes
[0:52:56] Derdrom_TJM: thats where Microsoft makes the $$
[0:52:57] ImNotDonut_: I mean I would argue that
[0:52:59] Face_32: vanilla MC is MUCH easier to get into when you are new to the game
[0:53:00] bcdmonkey: I mean yup
[0:53:17] Face_32: and you have to remember you have been playing this game for over 10 years
[0:53:34] itsIffy: COGGERS Clap
[0:53:35] Face_32: but kids wanna go fasty
[0:53:39] Warkless: Create is a very nice learning tool NODDERS
[0:53:42] Nilau: Nah, teach kids gregtech tbh
[0:53:49] IlsaGold: My 12yo made a server with his friends yesturday
[0:54:01] LastWarriorKing: @giantwaffle what would you recommend as a good beginner tech modpack
[0:54:15] Nilau: the attentionspan is just too low nowadays
[0:54:18] Turnpoint: thats why i moved to modded couple years back
[0:54:24] Bulltank: I have 5 kids. They all have dabbled in minecraft. None of them have ever had interest in actually beating the game, just building and stuff.
[0:54:29] Turnpoint: about 7 years ago
[0:54:42] bluedeed: What kids want is Platinum Sludge Group Residue
[0:54:43] weightmaker: tungstate and scheelite for tungsten
[0:54:51] stefan150: happy new year bud
[0:54:53] Qbertman: honestly why i enjoy modded over vanilla. i kinda hate mc combat so modpacks where you can ignore or trivialize it is great
[0:55:02] bluedeed: Both you get from tier 2
[0:55:11] fluffycow003: PogChamp only 3 days till KSP will be free on epic games

[0:55:36] Pati: Ore processing line Prayge
[0:55:40] Stillglade: didn'
[0:55:43] Schimmeldude: I feel that I have a much smaller attention span when I watch videos or twitch all day long. That get's better when I keep off screen for a couple of days
[0:55:49] RefiixGaming: @Qbertman Isnt minecraft combat just block, hit?
[0:55:55] bluedeed: Gregicality multiblock ore processing
[0:55:56] Stillglade: didn't he get a new pc? so his lag issues should be gone, right?
[0:55:57] Bulltank: @fluffycow003 with all the expansions?
[0:56:19] Timiderxbox: Have it export from the micro miner instead of through the ME?

[0:59:53] SlayerOfRealms: endstone dust gets you tungstate also
[0:59:57] ondorin: wouldnt the multiblock macerator be a good idea by now?
[1:00:05] Timiderxbox: Why not wash and macerate everything with the same production line?
[1:00:24] Bulltank: @Timiderxbox you dont want to always follow the same production line for certain mats
[1:00:28] ImNotDonut_: ye I can't keep track
[1:00:34] bluedeed: I use Hastelloy C276 at work all the time. Zirconium is better though

[1:14:28] TheJanitorMan_: @Giantwaffle could you show your AE2 crafting setup? Like crafting cpu and molecular/interface setup
[1:15:39] TheJanitorMan_: Gotcha, alright thanks!
[1:15:53] bluedeed: Shows you what’s crafting on the monitor
[1:16:01] TPells67: Where is pati ???
[1:16:13] Venamah: whats todays goal? fusion? Kappa
[1:16:16] bluedeed: Looks nice if you put it in the center of a multiblock crafter and you put your crafters central in the base
[1:16:18] Butterwhales: the crafting processors should probably have at least 4 coprocessors per :)
[1:16:18] weasel9999: FeelsBadMan
[1:16:21] Qbertman: but this is pati's job hto
[1:16:26] itsIffy: imagine doing a job as a streamer pepeLaugh
[1:16:53] bluedeed: I like 4co-processors, 4crafters, and monitor in the middle

[1:18:58] Venamah: i think in gt6, there was a tool box that held all your tools in a bobble slot
[1:19:11] cjthedjdolphin: SUSSY
[1:19:12] bluedeed: You can probably make tape at this point for the maint hatch instead
[1:19:55] MaxNeedsSnacks: well 48h of real time
[1:19:58] zynithtv: What is a good source to get a used GPU? i need and upgrade from my 980
[1:19:58] MaxNeedsSnacks: and then you have a CHANCE to break
[1:20:00] MaxNeedsSnacks: but it's low
[1:20:18] Butterwhales: I have seen a few break but its pretty uncommon
[1:20:21] MaxNeedsSnacks: i think the 48h also only starts counting when a recipe runs?
[1:20:26] JPili: @zynithtv ebay?
[1:20:30] bluedeed: With tape you don’t need to pound with the tools either
[1:20:47] bluedeed: It’s fancy sounding duct tape
[1:20:47] Moobot: You can sub to Waffle by clicking this neat link -> twitch.tv/giantwaffle/subscribe SUBprise

[1:22:22] LurkerNr5: the colors on top are different
[1:22:30] Ouroboros_LoL: is the one you just built supposed to have blue and orange in front?
[1:22:33] LurkerNr5: the right one has 2 orange
[1:22:36] LurkerNr5: does that matter?
[1:22:56] WoofWoofDude: @giantwaffle  pati is okay with interfaces. it's level emitters he doesn't like cause they make him lag and you can't autocraft properly
[1:22:59] MaxNeedsSnacks: KEKW
[1:23:23] Qbertman: i was gonna say something but i figured youd figure it out at some point lol

[1:24:58] Venamah: LUL another video panel hid in your base
[1:25:27] bluedeed: Do you have chrome automation set up?
[1:25:48] lukasalbert: ruby
[1:25:55] boyownik: Ruby which comes from redstone
[1:26:01] lukasalbert: you get it from micro miners
[1:26:08] TheGetCracked: redstojne --> ruby --> chrome
[1:26:14] bluedeed: Redstone automation is pretty easy
[1:26:26] dennis3833: how much titanium u have? cuz pati semi automated the process at the end of his last stream?
[1:26:28] SlayerOfRealms: granate -> thorium?
[1:26:28] daemonaedryn: chromite ore can be found in the end
[1:26:34] lukasalbert: redstone dml is pretty straight forward
[1:26:35] daemonaedryn: a lot can be gathered with drilling rigs
[1:27:01] lukasalbert: ruby ore ?
[1:27:02] WoofWoofDude: pati automated marble with the block breakers
[1:27:04] bluedeed: If you can get it through DML no reason to drill for it
[1:27:07] WoofWoofDude: and a couple others
[1:27:14] TheGetCracked: 60:1
[1:27:38] TheGetCracked: I swear you've made that calculation atleast 5 times already ^^
[1:27:40] lukasalbert: redstone goes really quick
[1:27:58] Tapeman83: Be careful with making chrome. I accidentally consumed a couple hundred thousand redstone when I started needing a lot of chrome. I ended up setting up an isolated DML system for it

[3:01:56] mn_sisu: I have a $1500 pair of over ear headphones and a $1500 pair of IEMs.
[3:01:59] PureSpider: Rongoel i moved from germany to norway a couple of years ago, but you just can't leave behind some things :D
[3:02:07] Rongoel: @PureSpider true
[3:02:11] inforv: @kenny_zk Lights literally make I brain glow and go crazy lol
[3:02:24] Yakobro: @mn_sisu ConcernDoge
[3:02:36] PureSpider: @mn_sisu beats? 4Head
[3:03:05] DaddyDiddy: if you do it this way you'll still have a problem because the ME system will still put the matter in the system if the drawer is full @Giantwaffle

[3:03:10] Nexhunter: YEP $4k headphones that you can't hear diff of YEP
[3:03:13] maccabeus: better than a $4k coffee grinder KEKW
[3:03:16] Jamswhat2: mine is made of shungite FeelsOkayMan
[3:03:20] Yash_88: cheap $20 ear buds is fine with me XD
[3:03:21] Face_32: same people that buy 3.8k coffee grinders
[3:03:22] DrHax_: dont forget the 3.5k coffee grinder YEP
[3:03:23] inforv: I think the biggest waste of money is the GoXLR. You use the voice effects and the MIDI keys once and then never touch it
[3:03:25] Duke1454: i feel ashamed i have corshiar and i want to be better
[3:03:26] kenny_zk: @LiveType @LiveType I just don't like it, it's invasive on my setup, MAYBE on the ceiling or the walls idk but if I can avoid it I'll avoid it
[3:03:27] The_Holas: i bet its the guz ho has 3k coffe grinder Kappa

[3:04:18] Troupster: oh you just scared me but I paid it
[3:04:20] DaddyDiddy: eviction stream POGGIES
[3:04:24] inforv: @Nexhunter And then the program breaks every other update
[3:04:58] LiveType: @LiveType I did a full rgb setup to try it out and boy howdy did I hate it. I mean it looks nice, but I don't look at my system. It sits in another room. So much unnecessary cabling and overall hassle. RGB software is a plague on the industry. Hardware only from now no matter what
[3:05:02] DaddyDiddy: if you use the new updated version of deep mob learning you could i/o from any side
[3:05:21] Yakobro: @Giantwaffle i've heard you need absurd amounts of extraterrestial matter for something endgame, so maybe store that somewhere en-mass
[3:05:26] Nexhunter: @inforv or you use wrong power cord when rewiring and blow a resister

[3:08:22] Duke1454: @jordan2185 200-300 thxs :)
[3:08:30] Bleu_Forge: @stefan150 that would defeat the goal of using python
[3:08:31] inforv: I remember when you were making reactor programs with computercraft years ago.
[3:08:38] stefan150: @stefan150 youre right
[3:08:38] LiveType: tkinter yeah. I had a great time with it.
[3:08:59] IlsaGold: Is py like Java?
[3:08:59] Moobot: You can find Waffle's Youtube channel here - https://youtube.com/giantwaffle
[3:09:10] Yakobro: KEKW
[3:09:10] PureSpider: pygame is basically lwjgl
[3:09:10] LiveType: @IlsaGold No. Higher level
[3:09:11] LethalBro: LUL
[3:09:15] LethalBro: What a question
[3:09:24] stefan150: @IlsaGold jesus what a question
[3:09:33] PureSpider: faux 3D
[3:09:33] Daryl_Kay: Building a ray tracer in C++ was one of my favorite projects Ive made, highly recommend @Giantwaffle
[3:09:38] IlsaGold: @IlsaGold Ok thx
[3:09:48] Winter_Squirrel: What do you want to do?
[3:09:54] PureSpider: Daryl_Kay i was masochistic and built a raytracer in java :D
[3:09:55] mattitu: Doom was done like that as well. I used to make maps for Doom & Doom II
[3:10:21] Jamswhat2: NODDERS
[3:10:26] LethalBro: NODDERS
[3:10:33] PureSpider: they weren't projected at all, it's all fake :D
[3:10:42] Daryl_Kay: @PureSpider SOO slow haha
[3:11:00] mattitu: Doom wasn't "real 3d", you couldn't have rooms on top of each other
[3:11:07] PureSpider: Daryl_Kay yea i optimized it quite a bit and with the proper GC settings it's not all too slow - but not native performance of course :D
[3:11:08] FuzzyOmega: Notch made a raycast game in Java called Prelude of the Chambered
[3:11:26] PureSpider: someone built that on the arduboy :D
[3:11:28] GGoodGGuy: what do you want to achieve?
[3:11:39] mattitu: Doom had actually floors and ceilings, they had textures and height attribute
[3:11:55] RoyalTL: this reminds me of a 2d game we made freshmen year
[3:12:04] Marksmen31: I think LTT did a video on that stuff showing how the visual frame rate can appear to be way better than it is
[3:12:09] Shantrix: you can click and hold on the timeline and move up with your mouse
[3:12:23] OMICRON: click the timeline and drag up and you can micro precision

[3:13:19] The_Holas: i think we even told tou already
[3:13:20] johahs95: there's an engine a guy built that renders infinite rooms within a given area. its crazy
[3:13:21] Shantrix: its good for long streams
[3:13:21] Troupster: also comma and period should step by frame?
[3:13:21] Exordium_world: wait what
[3:13:24] LiveType: It's been there since 2019 or early 2020  I believe
[3:13:26] Exordium_world: how you do that
[3:13:30] hydoto: Google hides the good stuff
[3:13:31] Quinnerdude1: thanks chat

[3:14:48] Face_32: did you listen to Lex's podcast on/with Carmack? i loved it @Giantwaffle
[3:15:02] ImDonC: talk talk talk ....
[3:15:03] OmgItsBrian: no KEKW
[3:15:16] Face_32: thats how nintindo still operates too lmao

[3:15:37] LethalBro: BRO WHAT
[3:15:42] Baske_T: no wonder why he hates games
[3:15:43] LiveType: Masochist for sure
[3:15:44] RoyalTL: WTF KEKW
[3:15:45] Baske_T: he wrote in asm
[3:15:48] Face_32: lol
[3:15:48] itsKev73: in basic too wasnt it?
[3:15:49] LethalBro: As close as you get to pure machine code dude
[3:15:50] stefan150: in assembly damn
[3:15:52] KABBL: emulating 30-year old Nintendo game on PC they no longer sell...Nintendo: I'm never gonna financially recover from this
[3:15:56] Wazepas: Drugs do produce some good results from time to time Kappa
[3:16:09] Beufff: probably because RC3 was ass
[3:16:18] Gashlex: power?
[3:16:20] Vizion_TV: Roller Coaster Tycoon 3 is such a good game, that it is a core memory for why i love simulation games to this day
[3:16:23] thunderdan11: lol
[3:16:26] Face_32: if you programmed 3 rollercoaster tycoons you would want nothing to do iwht games too
[3:16:27] officialhunterx: has that other tycoon game come out
[3:16:28] Sandistus: More power
[3:16:41] iDiezALot: Im curious if he made enough money to just say fuck it then
[3:16:42] hydoto: every time i look at assembly code i feel stupid not because i am but because it shows what i don't know yet LUL
[3:16:45] Zwazi: hey, i missed this whole series so far, can you explain everything from the start? thx :)
[3:16:50] DrHax_: too bad id software joined the club of shit tier studios by all the shit they did to Mick Gordon TrollDespair
[3:17:15] aeadon: I would burnout for life after making something like that in assembly

[3:18:02] Kamipulu: what pati doing?
[3:18:06] PureSpider: pp CatBlush
[3:18:10] Face_32: @Zwazi or make as little automation as possibvle to advance in quest log like waffle does
[3:18:11] Yakobro: @Zwazi need to automate, they're lazy about automating, technical debt keeps slapping them pepeLaugh
[3:18:18] The_Holas: PP as PiratePati YEP
[3:18:21] TheWonderLlama: PP module anneLewd
[3:18:40] DrHax_: good to know your personal crafting terminal is basically just 9 more inventory space NODDERS
[3:19:06] Face_32: @DrHax_ its kinda laggy for him, his other issues with it are fixable
[3:19:17] LiveType: Oh, john carmack apparently left facebook's vr division. Sad.
[3:19:29] Kamipulu: did pati order a cnew computer?
[3:19:37] Face_32: @LiveType he always moving onto bigger things, i think hes doing AI now
[3:19:42] Jamswhat2: good idea
[3:19:43] DrHax_: @LiveType good for him, fuck facebook/meta
[3:19:49] ohbi78: @Kamipulu no - $170 short atm
[3:19:50] Zwazi: he got his bag, and he got out. something i wish i could do
[3:19:55] Daryl_Kay: Meta is sooo bad
[3:20:15] Daryl_Kay: The graphics are absolutely a flop
[3:20:16] zzzDai: The issue with VR is it requires too much physical space currently.
[3:20:20] KABBL: VRCFhat the next 1T company Kappa
[3:20:22] PureSpider: but waffle you surely got nothing to hide 4Head
[3:20:22] ITAFily84: or Valve?
[3:20:24] NerdNik: my oculus is dead hardware starting today peepoSad
[3:20:25] arlandw: what headset do you use?
[3:20:26] Tobymcbrick: cue the plot of ready player one
[3:20:26] DrHax_: wait, people had trust in Meta at the beginning? wild
[3:20:29] Seerion: I have no interest in VR until there's a headset that works comfortably with glasses
[3:20:30] LiveType: It's sad for VR overall. Facebook pushed the boundaries of VR hardware for sure but software wise yeah, they can go under at this point.
[3:20:30] Face_32: VR wont really take off until cheap headsets get comfy enough for a new user to play for hours without pain
[3:20:32] I_n_s_p_i_r_e: I hope it will be valve that will make it
[3:20:32] Math354e: Or it's just gonna be apple
[3:20:33] STEVEFRENCH11: STEVEFRENCH11 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 21 months! 
[3:20:38] sliderspy: Or rockstar?
[3:20:38] stefan150: wtf is that buzzing
[3:20:40] RPGMadness208: valve is just vibing
[3:20:42] Yakobro: alyx is pretty pog, but short
[3:20:43] ZentilBlight: need to get past headsets
[3:20:43] ITAFily84: Makes sense
[3:20:48] faceache96: Valve would only make up to VR 2 and then leave
[3:20:49] Zwazi: when is valve releasing full dive VR that will trap me inside the game until somebody beats it?
[3:20:50] Orin_The_Sly: Valve will just seel sofware for it if they can
[3:20:53] Nibler: they are a one and done honestly
[3:20:58] PureSpider: Seerion i can use the quest 2 very comfortably with glasses for a long time, also you can get prescription lenses for it so you dont need your glasses
[3:20:59] Daryl_Kay: Revolutionizing VR comes with graphics that don't look roblocks
[3:21:00] ZyianDev: They're much more focused on Steam Deck and Proton
[3:21:11] Seerion: @PureSpider good to know!
[3:21:11] I_n_s_p_i_r_e: Vr steamdeck Kappa
[3:21:11] bcdmonkey: Probably because no one wants the debt of producing the next vr experience
[3:21:18] KABBL: but the Index is one of the best atm, no?
[3:21:23] Orin_The_Sly: Thats true, that would be Hardware. But they arent spearheading it for sure
[3:21:24] DrHax_: Valve also dont care enough about the cs skin gambling
[3:21:26] Face_32: @bcdmonkey exactly
[3:21:40] Baske_T: a system seller
[3:21:41] DemonsDawn: i don't think the VR revolution will come from any game environment
[3:21:44] LiveType: @KABBL Not anymore. When it released yes.
[3:21:44] Face_32: cheap headsets need to get more comfy to wear
[3:21:45] Psytei: i did that with beat saber
[3:21:46] daemonaedryn: so like a 3k game
[3:21:47] AlphaSchnauzer: star citizen Kappa
[3:21:52] Unwanted_Endlessness: I 100% agree with that statement
[3:21:56] MassiveFartRecycling: DIDNT HE DO FINAL STREAM YESTERDAY
[3:21:57] Orin_The_Sly: The next proverbial "Skyrim" in VR.
[3:22:01] bcdmonkey: Or make it accessible. Phone peripherals etc
[3:22:02] Vizion_TV: Like a Ready Player One Level of game
[3:22:12] daemonaedryn: unless the company that makes the game, makes the specific hardware monkaHmm
[3:22:17] Saytos1: yea
[3:22:27] DemonsDawn: i think real-world-HUDs in work environments will end up pushing the VR revolution honestly
[3:22:28] Saishu_: virtual boy
[3:22:33] Kodish: Oh god, VR headsets attached to subscription fees
[3:22:34] ninopanda: @massivefartrecycling what do you mean? he said he would finish it before new years...... 2024
[3:22:42] inforv: Facebook made almost no money on the headsets at first
[3:22:44] ninopanda: KEKW
[3:22:45] LiveType: VR is overall too expensive and extremely hard to accurately market. That's the primary reason VR adoption is so low. Like a good vr setup can be done but it costs ~!4k which is the issue.
[3:22:57] Orin_The_Sly: Imagine Steam is a Mall, where you go to shop for your games
[3:22:59] Archie8300: So VR is like Printer ink, printers are cheap but they screw you on the ink
[3:23:08] ZyianDev: How does VRChat make money?
[3:23:13] Daryl_Kay: Training people in risky jobs like doctors or underwater work I'm guessing will cause a revolution @Giantwaffle
[3:23:18] FoxTopic: VRC+
[3:23:19] Saishu_: i got the oculus quest, image quality is so bad i hate it
[3:23:27] PureSpider: so like second life
[3:23:30] Face_32: they need to take a cut like roblox
[3:23:30] Andersxa: like Roblox for VR?
[3:23:43] trabadam: so micro-transaction in VR, great FeelsBadMan
[3:23:45] bcdmonkey: They need a steam but VR. A place to walk through that you decide to hope in other games. The starting software is cheap but contains secondary transactions
[3:24:19] Face_32: so how do you "pay" for it if not ingame?
[3:24:27] agoody77: agoody77 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 6 months! 
[3:24:32] Orin_The_Sly: Anyone ever read the Otherland series by Tad Williams? Its very Ready Player One like but a fair bit darker
[3:24:53] daemonaedryn: agreed
[3:25:00] Face_32: i have a feeling that if the company cant get a cut of that money it will eventually get shut down
[3:25:02] Zwazi: give me full dive vr
[3:25:03] The_Flembo: My favorite copyrighted content are the movie worlds with patreon links LUL
[3:25:13] Saishu_: for 2 grand?
[3:25:13] bcdmonkey: It needs to be comfortable and accessible
[3:25:14] daemonaedryn: id love a vr headset, but not only do you need a good vr headset but also a good pc, and enough room to move around
[3:25:16] Lemon__peel: 126 players ahead in queue for foxhole TrollDespair
[3:25:16] Moobot: You can sub to Waffle by clicking this neat link -> twitch.tv/giantwaffle/subscribe SUBprise
[3:25:20] Face_32: headsets just need to not hurt your head/face after 1 hour of play
[3:25:23] Yash_88: hand tracking eye tracking mouth tracking etc
[3:25:36] PureSpider: dick tracking, too
[3:25:37] LiveType: @DaemonSzyman Yep, that's the issue. Too expensive. Way too expensive for most.
[3:25:46] Face_32: cheap headsets*
[3:25:49] CocoScruff: mouth tracking Kreygasm
[3:25:54] trikkilol: if that is true i might consider buying that
[3:26:05] daemonaedryn: @LiveType Exactly, most people also dont have a space in their house they can dedicate specifically to vr
[3:26:33] Yakobro: me conduits are so good
[3:26:36] zzzDai: Yes
[3:26:37] AIex_0: YEP KEKW
[3:26:37] ZyianDev: yea a little bit

[3:26:44] Firstnecron: KEKW True
[3:26:44] Dodoke: you think? :))
[3:26:45] LiveType: I mean you did a before I tried it yes, but now I get it.
[3:26:45] kenshin2666: VR NFTs when?
[3:26:51] Brakebein: NFT bros TrollDespair

[3:27:40] OMICRON: hamsam3NERDGE
[3:27:52] LiveType: @bcdmonkey That seems outright impossible at the moment. The technology to do that doesn't exist. But yeah, that's the dream.
[3:28:33] xDeadBringerx: 1.4.4 will be using DME instead of DML

[3:31:03] mattitu: @Giantwaffle Do you need void upgrades for the drawers so they don't overflow to the ae-system?
[3:31:05] kenshin2666: im still stuck with the covid 2022 peepoSad
[3:31:16] maccabeus: this is not a starter modpack :)

[3:31:37] TheWonderLlama: Its called shell shock
[3:31:41] hydoto: Well if you play fast with this modpack, you are doing it wrong
[3:31:46] ArbitraryHubris: What is a great first modpack?   Stoneblock?

[3:32:02] Urovah: Skyfactory is fun
[3:32:03] Markus11982: i usually recommend ftb infinity evolved expert, but its 1.7.10
[3:32:06] ArbitraryHubris: E2E is also not a good first modpack
[3:32:07] LANFrog: what would you say is the best Tech mod pack to get into for a brand new modpack player
[3:32:12] DaddyDiddy: play something that's not expert mode
[3:32:13] deandosss: another row right in front lol
[3:32:15] DaddyDiddy: that's a good first pack

[3:40:46] ninopanda: ok it is now at the lowest part
[3:40:49] theboris95: correct. makes you sore
[3:40:49] RoyalTL: lactic acid
[3:40:50] Tabrizz99: it gives you extra energy and ability to run really far
[3:40:50] LiveType: Lactate is what you produce in anerobic respiration
[3:40:50] OfSchlagenheim: Lactase
[3:40:53] DrYProtoss: lactic acid
[3:40:54] PureSpider: lactic acid, yea
[3:40:55] ninopanda: should be good now
[3:40:56] drsnaki96: there is also L-alanine Kappa

[3:41:07] IamtheJK: Same as lactate
[3:41:07] akmazero: i think when they have run out of oxygen in the cell
[3:41:09] AshhanX: lactate is boob milk
[3:41:10] stefan150: didnt finish grade 10?
[3:41:13] Rongoel: lactate is to breake down lactose
[3:41:20] Daryl_Kay: @Giantwaffle Yes, but it only builds up when dooing strenuous activity, most of the time it is buffered out
[3:41:20] Overheadace: LOL
[3:41:22] RoyalTL: KEKW
[3:41:24] LuciferSpirt: YEP lactic and lactate is same chemical

[3:41:53] IamtheJK: Lactase = Breaks down milk, Lactic acid = lactate, to lactate is the act of secreting milk
[3:41:57] DtDragon417: @Rongoel lactate is making breast milk
[3:42:13] Duke1454: its been 4 hrs stretch
[3:42:17] PureSpider: lactate is lactic acid salt... it's not the same thing
[3:42:30] drsnaki96: technically all human amino acids are in L isomere so you could say we were born to take the Ls Kappa
[3:43:01] ninopanda: I officially am making 200 mil isk a day.  scanning null-sec is fun

[3:44:58] daemonaedryn: level emitter right?
[3:45:08] Winstonrocks: use a pattern?
[3:45:12] The_Holas: drawer without voiding?
[3:45:16] daemonaedryn: oh right patis been waiting on his new pc for a year Kappa
[3:45:24] Variosit: hmmm
[3:45:25] jo_beorn: @Giantwaffle store it in a storage drawer with specific capacity and restrict it to only that drawer
[3:45:27] Variosit: comparator?
[3:45:29] Zyie: Did he end up ordering a new PC yet?
[3:45:31] highlandermccloud: @giantwaffle just put the pattern inside the auto crafter

[3:46:34] Jamswhat2: pepeLaugh
[3:46:44] n3wtpond: Gaslit was so 2022
[3:46:52] highlandermccloud: @giantwaffle you can put in one working pattern per item you wanna make and the system will then know how to make it if you ask for it
[3:46:57] boyownik: It actually is
[3:46:59] RockyMountainHiThere: wasnt that the point of using the item fliters?
[3:46:59] maccabeus: terrafirmapunk is a great pack, adding greg sounds.. not
[3:47:01] boyownik: It's pure pain
[3:47:05] Wazepas: @Daryl_Kay I started playing it, might start a nice and steady alcohol addiction
[3:47:25] kane1941: it would keep 64 and craft more when asked
[3:47:35] Daryl_Kay: @Wazepas Is it worse than gregtech new horizons?
[3:48:01] highlandermccloud: that's because of the crafting card
[3:48:06] kypudo: check the book, there is an adon to the machines like the level emitter
[3:48:09] ItsOnMax: minecraft magic
[3:48:10] lukasalbert: crafting card yeah
[3:48:11] Winstonrocks: interface pushs
[3:48:12] Corvous: bottom conduit
[3:48:14] kane1941: Pati is a 5Head
[3:48:17] LuciferSpirt: what does the conveyer do?
[3:48:20] lukasalbert: and pointing the interface down ?
[3:48:22] kypudo: no
[3:48:27] HappyPizzaLife: What did you get for Christmas this year?
[3:48:33] Wazepas: @Daryl_Kay Haven't played GT: NH but it's difficult to start if you never played terrafirmacraft
[3:48:39] kitty_cat20: use a wrench on an interface
[3:48:40] Winstonrocks: interface pushes patterns
[3:48:40] Corvous: for crafting recipies they do push
[3:48:41] daemonaedryn: you can set an interface to push into a specific direction with a yeta wrench
[3:48:42] Timiderxbox: They push if you use the recipe mode and point it towards the machine
[3:48:47] HappyPizzaLife: *this year*
[3:48:49] kbigLiar: crafts push... maybe standing items dont push
[3:48:51] LiveType: I got myself a thermal camera. Very fun to use
[3:48:54] stefan150: you didnt buy yourself anything?
[3:49:08] Cooper_XX: i wouldn´t do christmas either but i have to

[3:49:40] Moobot: You can sub to Waffle by clicking this neat link -> twitch.tv/giantwaffle/subscribe SUBprise
[3:50:06] HappyPizzaLife: @HappyPizzaLife wasnt really recieved too well :p
[3:50:06] kane1941: automate crafting crads?
[3:50:10] Chupun: keep in mind that crafting cards take a cpu slot when running and you can runn out of cpu fairly quickly if you use a lot
[3:50:11] CodeMonkeyV1: what is the item list on the bottom of JEI?
[3:50:22] Timiderxbox: Now it will create that when you do the recipe
[3:50:22] lukasalbert: need to point the interface into the machine right ?
[3:50:30] Timiderxbox: Why do you want to store it at all times?
[3:50:33] stefan150: @HappyPizzaLife it was taken as intended, he understood the joke, dont apologize if you havent done anything wrong :D
[3:50:38] Akiron_rafa: dont think you need to output the items it will place them when doing the recipe
[3:50:46] kitty_cat20: this will do it always
[3:50:49] kbigLiar: I don't think you need the rods in there
[3:51:00] d3st3r123: d3st3r123 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 2 months! Hello
[3:51:01] jordan2185: Dust in the top no ?
[3:51:02] Akiron_rafa: the recipe knows
[3:51:03] daemonaedryn: just test it
[3:51:04] lukasalbert: pati did the finished thing in there
[3:51:05] kane1941: you are not outputting
[3:51:08] Corvous: you stock the endresult not the ingredients
[3:51:08] Timiderxbox: It needs to be the dust that you keep 64, so the output not input
[3:51:09] kypudo: u want the output not input
[3:51:11] lukasalbert: not the rods in your case
[3:51:16] kitty_cat20: this way it only does by requesting
[3:51:19] lukasalbert: its what i saw at least
[3:51:32] dennis3833: noo

[3:51:59] Corvous: i would set the storagebus to extract only
[3:52:03] dennis3833: the things u put in the top is for "storage"
[3:52:13] dennis3833: to keep in stock
[3:52:16] kbigLiar: patty has a 2 piece thing - first, the patterns so the AE system can say to "Craft X". second, he stores a stack of ingredient + crafting card, so there is always a passive craft of a stack in the AE system
[3:52:20] LiveType: @n3wtpond @n3wtpond Nah. It was $140 from alibaba OMEGALUL . Got lucky and seller agreed to sell one at that price. Not great resolution but good enough for most things
[3:52:23] 0x4273: missing blitz
[3:52:40] kypudo: this is so overcomplicated XD
[3:52:58] lukasalbert: does waffle need to point the interface down ?
[3:52:58] TheShaddo13: blitz is german for lightning
[3:53:02] Archie8300: is this new way less intensive to render?
[3:53:06] dennis3833: and u cant autocraft with ur old system
[3:53:06] n3wtpond: Nice @livetype , that’s a hell of a deal. Wish mine was that cheap. Super cool even if it remotely does what it’s supposed to though
[3:53:18] 0x4273: mana dust not primal mana
[3:53:22] LuciferSpirt: typed it in wrong
[3:53:26] highlandermccloud: @giantwaffle him storing the finished product in there with a storage bus on the back is a  weird way to do the storage emitter but you could just have it craft on command not make extra ?
[3:53:34] kitty_cat20: you can put upgrad on the interfaces for more space for the patterns
[3:53:47] lukasalbert: @Giantwaffle you can use expansion cards in the interfaces for the molecular assemblers so you can fill them with recepies
[3:53:47] kane1941: now try to craft 1 mil
[3:53:55] lukasalbert: it takes way less space but is slower
[3:54:20] daemonaedryn: NODDERS
[3:54:34] daemonaedryn: so essentially the next 3 upgrades
[3:54:41] dennis3833: @lukasalbert depends on the type of recipes u put into

[4:24:26] stormzwest: wtf?
[4:24:33] kypudo: breaak and replace
[4:24:35] daemonaedryn: break it NODDERS
[4:24:36] stormzwest: it should be workking normally
[4:24:41] maccabeus: @RockyMountainHiThere he's done like 12 minutes of mining in this whole run
[4:24:41] Polystyx: check a working machine
[4:24:42] lukasalbert: ???
[4:24:47] The_kid_as_a_teen: no
[4:24:50] kitty_cat20: @RockyMountainHiThere just use the vending upgrad on the drawers for the infinity materials
[4:24:55] Timiderxbox: Put a terminal there to see if it sees the items
[4:24:55] CantTouchDisNow: fuzzy cards?
[4:24:56] WERT_ASDF: try different items?
[4:24:57] jo_beorn: crafting card?
[4:25:00] stormzwest: nbt?
[4:25:01] Winstonrocks: crafting card?
[4:25:01] tnthurts: Do you have enough channels?
[4:25:03] RockyMountainHiThere: @maccabeus I know but Im lazy LUL
[4:25:08] L0rd0fHeaven: check processors?
[4:25:19] raccia: it needs a storage bus
[4:25:19] PureSpider: nothing in the system?
[4:25:23] lukasalbert: is there more in the system ?
[4:25:24] Bwangoh: are you out of channels?
[4:25:28] kane1941: it doesnt actually exist?
[4:25:32] PureSpider: oh, odd
[4:25:36] RockyMountainHiThere: no channels in this mod pack
[4:25:59] lilgangstagoth1: LOL
[4:26:05] Sandistus: KEKW
[4:26:05] maccabeus: Susge who did this
[4:26:06] The_kid_as_a_teen: susHmm why
[4:26:11] smilaf: LUL
[4:26:12] Foobaah: pati broke it
[4:26:26] The_kid_as_a_teen: Pepega
[4:26:39] Overheadace: I miss immersive engineering days
[4:26:43] kane1941: all of it goes in that interface
[4:26:48] kane1941: above 100 goes to smeltery
[4:26:50] The_kid_as_a_teen: monkaMath
[4:26:53] kypudo: once that fills the other dhould too
[4:26:54] Purecrew: Lower the priority?
[4:26:55] ShadowBlade72: Priority issue because it was requesting all of it there?
[4:26:56] L0rd0fHeaven: try with different priority
[4:26:58] lukasalbert: configure it ?
[4:27:01] CantTouchDisNow: maybe it was an item in the crafting queue and it waited for them to be crafted
[4:27:03] stormzwest: put the storage bus touching the interface processing the dust to read only mode
[4:27:03] Purecrew: on the machine holding the stack
[4:27:04] TheIrishGuy: did power go?
[4:27:07] SailorWS: cuz 7 8 9
[4:27:12] Timiderxbox: Put priority of interface you are looking at to 2
[4:27:16] Foobaah: it has to make 100 first to fill up this, no?
[4:27:19] jdude20202: Set the ebf as higher priority
[4:27:20] WERT_ASDF: if you make the smelter inferface higher priority?
[4:27:22] kane1941: all of it goes in that crafting interface until there is 100 dust
[4:27:23] kypudo: insert the ones you have in the me
[4:27:25] ninopanda: @SailorWS DUDE
[4:27:26] orangecreamsicle3: cuz you're holding the dust Pepega
[4:27:28] Timiderxbox: Or atleast higher than storage bus limited 100 stainless steel
[4:27:30] ninopanda: Long time no see
[4:27:31] RockyMountainHiThere: @SailorWS Nice one
[4:27:33] dylan0806: Does the io interface have an higher priority?
[4:27:41] TPells67: Is it supposed to be 2 on the circuit??
[4:27:51] ninopanda: @SailorWS how you doing mah dude
[4:27:55] ShadowBlade72: Maybe it does priority by proximity? So the machine nearest gets it first.
[4:28:01] lukasalbert: if the interface is higher in prio it will take the dust yeah ?
[4:28:21] SailorWS: im surviving
[4:28:29] Xenon_Fidelity: only had 30 hrs on my last paycheck.... #brokeboystatus
[4:28:34] CantTouchDisNow: or full
[4:28:35] Timiderxbox: Its the interfaces that are using the items from "Patis level emitter"
[4:28:47] goelzolero81: !mc
[4:28:48] TelRehiad: could also add a crafting card, no?
[4:28:54] WERT_ASDF: other way would be to make the ones with storage bus with a lower priority
[4:28:55] ninopanda: I feel ya there. @SailorWS been on the grind irl as well
[4:29:03] kane1941: just add crafting card with ingot here
[4:29:03] ShadowBlade72: Couldn't you also just set the terminals crafting them to -1 priority?
[4:29:08] lukasalbert: @Giantwaffle cant you lower the priority on the interface with the 100?
[4:29:18] stormzwest: making a lot of crafting cards will get laggy, really quick
[4:29:20] hoghad: hoghad subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 59 months! Woohoo 59
[4:29:36] L0rd0fHeaven: basicaly: the buffer is filled first, before any other demand is handled @giantwaffle
[4:29:48] Winstonrocks: crafting cards are more laggy than level emitters
[4:29:48] Sui_Ume: @ShadowBlade72 no, then it prioritises the me-system storage over the interface
[4:29:51] lukasalbert: lowering priority on the interface that stores the 100 should work i thinnk  less configs to think of
[4:29:59] maccabeus: NODDERS mhm
[4:30:01] TheWonderLlama: peepoHmm hmmm
[4:30:10] Slymph: hm susHmm
[4:30:12] RandomLibrarian: yea that many craft cars is gonna be an issue later
[4:30:12] L0rd0fHeaven: lowering priority on the interface that stores the 100 should work i thinnk  less configs to think of
[4:30:30] lukasalbert: ^
[4:30:31] Moobot: Come join the Waffle House Discord! <# https://discord.gg/fhGFtMuzdS
[4:30:52] lukasalbert: yeah and you dont have to think of the other interfaces all the time ^^
[4:30:56] RandomLibrarian: yup
[4:30:59] dylan0806: Wouldn’t it go then into the drives?
[4:30:59] blaksmil: that game was the shit
[4:31:03] ninopanda: to your doors are not 3 x 3.  you could use the screens to tell you what each area is
[4:31:09] jdude20202: probably can't lower the priority because it will fill the storage drives
[4:31:20] jo_beorn: @Giantwaffle youre going to be infinitely making stainless steel if thats what you want
[4:31:30] Nilau: Crafting cards can make the ME system super slow if you use them too much. The issue is that they simulate an entire craft to check if the ingredients are in the system. It's fine for small crafts but using it on entire machines is yikes
[4:31:33] SailorWS: ninopanda ive been doing a lot of school and work mostly chilling with vods and shit
[4:31:47] ninopanda: @SailorWS I thought you graduated
[4:32:00] kakiewakie_: we have 20 cpus
[4:32:11] Nilau: Level emitters are way better than crafting cards though
[4:32:23] ninopanda: just automate making CPU's
[4:32:33] kane1941: switch to drawer with storage bus above each machine
[4:32:39] ImposterArchitect: Probably just modify the poll rate on them.
[4:32:50] dylan0806: Side quest?
[4:32:59] jayerbuu: hey waffle hey chat

[4:36:57] DaddyDiddy: accel cards COPIUM
[4:37:06] kane1941: 8 pure = 1 block = 4
[4:37:21] IamtheJK: The phytogenic insulator wont use the seed will it?
[4:37:57] Caech: server dev should disable afk messages
[4:38:00] DaddyDiddy: easier to set a subnet with a formation plane and a water source
[4:38:04] BookNerdTim: Right I had to use the inscribers in AE t double the dust
[4:38:10] dylan0806: Should have put a wager on it 🫡
[4:38:23] CutlasFury: @Giantwaffle that is a good way to make wasting time and energy go infinite tho

[4:57:29] ShadowBlade72: You were missing 4.
[4:57:32] Koeckie: is it the wrong red coal?
[4:57:39] DaddyDiddy: no its because red coal is player locked so you have to manually change the recipe
[4:57:44] daedmissica0: 2 per 9
[4:57:45] ninopanda: @DaemonSzyman i set it up for new years fireworks KEKW
[4:57:51] weightmaker: red coal has NBT data that breaks autocrafting.

[4:57:52] lukasalbert: yeah manually change the red coal
[4:57:54] Niruzo1: Is there a problem with NBT data?
[4:57:56] DaddyDiddy: take out the red coal in your system and put it in the recipe
[4:58:00] DaddyDiddy: its NBT problems
[4:58:01] lukasalbert: since it stores values with your gp
[4:58:05] ninopanda: each deployer has 9 stacks of fireworks in it @DaemonSzyman
[4:58:07] GGoodGGuy: GG
[4:58:08] gartoks: @Giantwaffle Red coal is player bound, so it has different nbt data depending on who crafted it
[4:58:22] gartoks: @Giantwaffle You can look how we did it on the sub server to properly automate it
[4:58:26] Koeckie: to make it more fun! KEKW

[4:58:55] ShadowBlade72: You didn't request the craft did you?
[4:59:12] Seerion: the crafting card is all you need in that interface to craft them
[4:59:33] daedmissica0: you have a card
[4:59:34] Koeckie: does it really work in the same interface?
[4:59:34] DaddyDiddy: i don't think crafting cards work with red coal
[4:59:34] dylan0806: Prio
[4:59:37] ninopanda: i had eve to play @DaemonSzyman and didnt want to do it every time lol
[4:59:41] ninopanda: so i set it up for them
[4:59:45] Shantrix: set prio to 10 ?

[5:00:11] SoloArcher: Damn waffle I haven't seen you since last year. how you been man
[5:00:19] PureSpider: stickman_02 damn what an original joke, never heard that the entire day today
[5:00:32] weightmaker: its trying to start autocrafting 64 of them at a time and cant. It happens all the time on the sub server
[5:00:46] gartoks: @Giantwaffle What you can do is make an interface that provides coal and conduit it into the resonator then extract the coal into a drawer. That coal can be used
[5:00:53] stickman_02: @PureSpider I mean I just got here so tbf didnt know it was said that much haha
[5:01:08] PureSpider: NODDERS
[5:01:09] kbigLiar: it might've waited until it could craft the full stack before requesting it?
[5:01:10] Kuma_Taru: @stickman_02 Still worth
[5:01:11] DaddyDiddy: i would recommend making like 4 or 5 more resonators for coal crafting just to keep up @Giantwaffle
[5:01:13] Zero_Dragon: it must be waiting till you have a certain amount of stuff to do it
[5:01:25] AlinksPast: should leave that joke in last year, this year! NODDERS
[5:01:35] inforv: @PureSpider Could you say you havent heard that joke all year?
[5:01:41] DaddyDiddy: and then one for enderium eventually
[5:01:42] LethalBro: resonators aren't too expensive are they?
[5:01:42] octopusgrime: @PureSpider memes are meant to be repeated. keep it up stick
[5:01:45] stickman_02: @Kuma_Taru true true gotta make sure he knows he didnt complete it before the new year LUL

[5:04:18] DaddyDiddy: lowkey the best part of this pack is that channels are disabled because imagine all the p2p and controllers you would have had to make to do all this interface and storage bus shenanigans
[5:04:41] stickman_02: Ci is making a flying machine

[5:37:16] Apparentthreat: civr2Fishbang
[5:38:19] DaddyDiddy: i had 17 nuclearcraft reactors running almost every fuel you can make just to keep up with the power I needed to run everything I had going just to tell you how much more work is ahead of you
[5:38:31] RefiixGaming: Hire Ci and Panda to start automating faster
[5:38:48] lukasalbert: @jayrickson87 check a youtube channel named "Threefold" he has a nomifactory lp where he builds such a reactor
[5:39:05] Saishu_: weird, LEA242 should not need that much coling

[5:41:49] cjthedjdolphin: Wokege
[5:41:54] dcirusc30: Wokege
[5:42:01] RefiixGaming: Wokege Again
[5:42:02] DaddyDiddy: @RefiixGaming solars are good but you need nuclearcraft fission for all the by products and solidifed elements so its worth just making the power from it anyway
[5:42:05] daemonaedryn: @Tapeman83 monkaS how amy dynos did you have
[5:42:06] Koeckie: @lukasalbert Neva happend KEKW
[5:42:09] Razorain56: you still use a jetpack?
[5:42:18] Tapeman83: Idk, like 30 I think @DaemonSzyman
[5:42:19] daemonaedryn: many*
[5:42:25] jayrickson87: @starmetal_ I have looked it up several time. every calculator is very confusing and doesn't tell me what blocks to place where
[5:42:28] daemonaedryn: oh thats not even many
[5:42:40] InTheLittlePro: Chat! Waffle!! I havnt seen you since last year KEKW
[5:42:46] Tapeman83: nah, I used the power augments, so they each produced like 70k RF/tick @DaemonSzyman
[5:43:01] daemonaedryn: Oh nice
[5:43:11] lukasalbert: dont they like use diamonds per second then ?
[5:43:16] lukasalbert: instead of minutes
[5:43:35] Tapeman83: it uses a lot of diamonds, but it's not that hard to automate a lot of DMLs, and I ended up producing an excess of diamonds, which were useful later
[5:43:56] lizard__lips: Hey waffle is starting to get cold
[5:44:01] lukasalbert: yeah its insane
[5:44:02] Moobot: Come join the Waffle House Discord! <# https://discord.gg/fhGFtMuzdS

[5:44:05] DaddyDiddy: for late game
[5:44:13] TheWonderLlama: Should not say Diamonds are Forever, you may get sued
[5:44:22] DaddyDiddy: yeah true so you have to invest in nuclearcraft eventually
[5:44:27] lukasalbert: ii remember the Buildcraft days where like 5/second on a dynamo was hella fast
[5:44:30] lukasalbert: xD
[5:44:36] sp4wn999: what cable comes next when the current one only get 32k RF ?
[5:44:43] Koeckie: @Itz_Progamer he should close his door KEKW
[5:44:44] Kachel: Kachel subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 10 months! 
[5:44:45] weightmaker: reinforced dynamo filled with efficiency augments still only last a few seconds at full power draw
[5:44:47] Starmetal_: @jayrickson87 on that page you can specify the cooling blocks you want to use, or just default settings. It will show you the design as layers with indicators where zo place what type of block
[5:44:50] Tapeman83: I never used nuclearcraft for power. is it better in numi than omni? cause it wasn't used for power in omni @DaddyDiddy
[5:45:01] lukasalbert: next vcable is like 512k per tick
[5:45:12] lizard__lips: @Itz_Progamer i know right we need someone too send him 5 dollars but i dont use paypal
[5:45:20] DaddyDiddy: @Tapeman83 oh yeah its super useful in nomi
[5:45:27] DaddyDiddy: it actually produces a lot of power
[5:45:37] Tapeman83: that's cool, they barely produced power in omni @DaddyDiddy
[5:45:39] weightmaker: @jayrickson87 it also tells you how to import the desing to buildinggadgets for automaticly building the reactor
[5:45:58] HonZoR: I don't play a lot of minecraft. what's the difference to project ozone 3?

[5:51:18] ThePixelbrain: @Traverus98 Interesting. It was yesterday for me in Germany. It doesn't matter if it's a Sunday, it's just bad luck for working people if such days are on weekends
[5:51:22] Flobu_: didnt someone said last year that you could share blocks for multiple EBFs how does that work?

[5:56:18] kane1941: how is the questbook doing?

[5:58:00] Flobu_: wouldnt it be a good idea to automate those steps via crafting card and patterns, instead of looking it up again and again
[5:58:23] daemonaedryn: Just pattern it
[5:58:30] lvyEartman: where is Pati?
[5:58:43] Timiderxbox: Blocking mode on the interface makes it smart enough
[5:58:52] SailorWS: what is Pati?
[5:58:54] Timiderxbox: will stop it from doing 2 recipes with same interface
[5:59:04] kypudo: u can pattern it and make the interface in "blocking mode", so it doesn't screw up the recipies
[5:59:10] Koeckie: COPIUM
[5:59:13] broseph_larz: Pati having lunch or something?

[5:59:20] kypudo: yes
[5:59:22] ninopanda: @SailorWS PiratePati
[5:59:25] daemonaedryn: because if it requires a resource, itll make that resource first
[5:59:36] SailorWS: When is Pati? ninopanda
[5:59:38] ninopanda: @SailorWS the person who fixes waffles fuck ups KEKW
[5:59:39] TheWonderLlama: Maybe he is taking care of business susHmm
[5:59:40] kbigLiar: it only does full recipies... so if B requires A, it has to make A first
[5:59:53] Sui_Ume: everyone asks where is Pati, but no one asks how is Pati sadKEK
[6:00:06] daemonaedryn: pati seems to be making a lot of wire patterns
[6:00:16] Orin_The_Sly: I bet Pati is pretty good, he just got his PC funded LUL
[6:00:17] ninopanda: future waffle problems turn into pati'

[6:03:56] GoodOldXijan: are they faster if they arae bigger or produce more?
[6:04:08] Tetsomina: <o/
[6:04:29] daemonaedryn: @GoodOldXijan size is fixed, speed is determined by power input, capability by its coils
[6:04:37] GoodOldXijan: oh thats sad
[6:04:51] GoodOldXijan: no big ass smelters :D
[6:04:55] TPells67: Is EV faster than HV when it comes to the EBF’s??
[6:04:58] daemonaedryn: im surprised the pig hasnt escaped yet
[6:05:06] lizard__lips: why is there a pig in the clean room ?
[6:05:30] dcirusc30: pig is getting clean
[6:05:38] jmm548: the pig keeps it clean'

[6:47:18] lvyEartman: he has 32 Gb of RAM though...
[6:47:25] ForgottenTime: i have a 3080 ti and a 3930k Cpu KEKW
[6:47:31] PureSpider: that would tear the lada in half, yeesh
[6:47:34] MrJavyxD: well at least he will be able to do a duo pc set up soon
[6:47:38] Zyie: @ForgottenTime That's even worse KEKW
[6:47:39] PureSpider: @ForgottenTime bottleneck alert
[6:47:39] Koeckie: @ForgottenTime and DDR 3 ram? KEKW
[6:47:39] inforv: @lvyEartman at 1333 mhz of ddr3
[6:47:40] ForgottenTime: i need money to build new cpu
[6:47:40] TheWonderLlama: Stop making me think I need to upgrade PepeHands
[6:47:44] AlphaWarrior987: You should start making more TugSteel On the TugSteel EBF once its made, will speed the crafting for more
[6:47:44] dylan0806: So Ferarri engine with a lada gearbox?
[6:47:54] TheBobby1: Are you visiting the patreon server before you end?
[6:48:05] Dagmoo: @Koeckie yeah ddr3 LUL
[6:48:07] ForgottenTime: im aware lol, yes bottle neck, yes 64 gigs ddr3 lol
[6:48:10] MrJavyxD: 5
[6:48:14] GuardMoony: don't forget his sata diskdrive
[6:48:16] kjx1: I have a 1080 Sadge
[6:48:21] JVM91: 1070 gang
[6:48:28] Narcotical: 1060 gang FeelsBadMan
[6:48:31] PureSpider: 3070 Ti 👌
[6:48:36] zynithtv: im on my 980 Sadge
[6:48:39] suitedtiger123: 1050tu here
[6:48:41] inforv: upgraded to 3060 this after being on a 950 for years
[6:48:41] MyFutureBoyfriend: 1070sc still holding on strong
[6:48:42] lilgangstagoth1: 2060 hurr
[6:48:42] suitedtiger123: ti*
[6:48:45] ForgottenTime: my 1080 was bugging out so i bought a card for my next rig lol
[6:48:49] Banme4it: 1080ti here
[6:48:49] SailorWS: 3060 :D
[6:48:52] Zero_Dragon: funny enough, my old computer i just upgraded from was same as his 4790k, but it didnt have no 3080 in it, it had a 970
[6:49:11] Zyie: @ForgottenTime Quite certain you're not able to get even close to fully utilizing your GPU with that CPU, lol. Even buying a used mobo, cpu and ram for a few hundred would be a huge upgrade, lol.
[6:49:12] lizard__lips: has it got twin turbo ?? KEKW
[6:49:15] Sui_Ume: 2080 got for 400$ the week before prices went to the sky
[6:49:22] PureSpider: fuck me man i upgraded from a 6700 and that was ancient, can't imagine using something even older
[6:49:24] Zero_Dragon: just built my new one a couple months ago, 12700k with 3080
[6:49:45] inforv: @SailorWS i feel like im on heaven compared to the 950 at 4gb lol
[6:49:45] lvyEartman: a 4790k vs a 12700k is not that much faster thougf, the boost clockspeed is almost the same
[6:49:55] cosmicblip: are you going to be watching the Nvidia event tomorrow apparently gaming GPU news its at 8am PT
[6:50:10] 8R00KS: i just went from 8700k to 13900k its amazing
[6:50:11] CeeDreamer: Do you think that there will ever come a time when reach the end of ability to innovate new pc components? Like they just don’t have the science and engineering for it?
[6:50:22] Sui_Ume: @lvyEartman it's only like 8x the cores LUL
[6:50:33] PureSpider: @CeeDreamer moore's law
[6:50:34] simoncs: @lvyEartman bruh
[6:50:39] maccabeus: I mean, there is a physical limit to lithography, right?
[6:50:43] kane1941: quantum computing soon COPIUM
[6:50:44] LiveType: That's already a limitation
[6:50:52] ForgottenTime: no GDDR6 is nutty
[6:50:52] lvyEartman: @Sui_Ume but minecraft uses one...
[6:50:57] CeeDreamer: I’ll have to go read up on moores law
[6:50:57] Zyie: @lvyEartman Oh, but the difference is huge, can't just look at boost clock. Look at lists comparing the two, it's like a 50% improvement or something like that.
[6:51:00] MeZorZ: I need to build a new pc this year as well :)
[6:51:04] PureSpider: @maccabeus people have surpassed that limit, the current gen hardware is smaller than a beam of light
[6:51:06] jmm548: untill we can move to different types of computing
[6:51:11] ModestGlottis: quantum level stuff tho
[6:51:15] Stormflare: physical limitations will force people to innovate and create more efficient computing rather than just more transistors
[6:51:16] DemonsDawn: just casually switch from a binary to a trinary system
[6:51:26] dylan0806: And signal integrity
[6:51:26] ticket2hell88: @giantwaffle what was the law you mentioned?
[6:51:31] iloveplants: maybe we'll get optical transmissions within a board
[6:51:34] PureSpider: ticket2hell88 moore's law
[6:51:35] Sui_Ume: @lvyEartman it's also 80% faster single core
[6:51:38] Zyie: @ticket2hell88 Moorse law?
[6:51:39] Goldps1: eventually will have to move to phototonics
[6:51:40] ruthlessrellik: That means one day we'll need to pass the speed of light, and once we do that, we're able to travel space
[6:51:40] Stormflare: i cant even comprehend how they can make chips that small
[6:51:43] All_Tech: we develop different methods of computing then
[6:51:43] Moobot: You can find Waffle's Youtube channel here - https://youtube.com/giantwaffle
[6:51:44] CurlySC: i think there is an end
[6:51:48] Killerman1997: i think we will find a new medium, something where we will need to start large again
[6:51:50] Zonear: I could see SLI and co-processing coming back
[6:51:51] Zyie: @ticket2hell88 *morse law
[6:52:00] Smithii: 4 states if I remember correctly
[6:52:00] PureSpider: no, quantu, computing is about probabilities, not finite states
[6:52:04] sogerr: need more sugar cane
[6:52:05] ticket2hell88: @purespider @zyie that one - thank you both :)
[6:52:09] CeeDreamer: I’m just waiting for our computers to all come with their own pocket dimension for data storage
[6:52:11] maccabeus: Moore's Law isn't a law though, it's just a figure of speech
[6:52:14] tiberiom: the speed of light only allows so much information per clock cycle
[6:52:18] lange__: It's called super positions
[6:52:26] LeKami: hey @Giantwaffle What mod pack should i start to get into modded MC ? <3
[6:52:31] Razorigga: Pati?
[6:52:39] AndyX94: !mc_pack
[6:52:39] Moobot: The December modpack, Nomifactory (GTCEu Port) is in full swing !!! | https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/nomi-ceu | Nearly 2 weeks in, are they on track to complete the pack by Tomorrow? Tune in to find out!
[6:52:47] EricTheGenericCleric: Waffle u will BE Out of Polymer Clay soon or ?
[6:52:48] PureSpider: PCIe 4.0 is already heavily affected by trace length on the board, so yea i think you have a point waffle
[6:52:52] dennis3833: hatch?
[6:53:02] DemonsDawn: if it draws more power in a tick than the size of the battery it gets wonky sometimes iirc
[6:53:20] Archie8300: Optical computing looks interesting
[6:53:49] spyrayias: arent 4a enough for 2 mv hatches?
[6:54:18] SailorWS: im getting kimchi chicken ramen for dinner tonight :D
[6:54:28] Zyie: @Sui_Ume Yeah, +75% single-core performance for a 12700K compared to a 4790K. Over all about +44% performance boost. Can't just look at Mhz and compare the two and say that they're very similar, it's more complicated than that.
[6:54:28] AlphaWarrior987: Ya ME is crazy when you have lotts of things autocrafting and running on it, can An Autocraft can Tick and Spike power
[6:54:29] PureSpider: @SailorWS phoooar sinpurFat
[6:54:38] weightmaker: he is right waffle. we had that problem and after building some ME Controllers that can "handle" 8k AE/t each, we no longer had any power issues
[6:54:49] lateknighthero: Wokege
[6:54:56] Slymph: Wokege
[6:54:59] Boonie828: Wokege
[6:55:01] RefiixGaming: Wokege hooolyy
[6:55:04] Dagmoo: Wokege
[6:55:04] PureSpider: Zyie to be fair, MHz havent meant anything since the pentium 4
[6:55:08] maccabeus: Wokege damned kids and their mincerafts
[6:55:18] CeeDreamer: @sailorws That sounds interesting I’ve never had kimchi I’ve always wanted to try it I just want to try it with someone who knows about it
[6:55:36] PureSpider: kimchi is so fuckin good
[6:55:53] PureSpider: truuuuue
[6:55:55] maccabeus: YEP sounds like a fermented food
[6:56:02] PureSpider: i feel like it's like that with most fermented stuff?
[6:56:10] PureSpider: maccabeus yea exactly hahahaha
[6:56:20] All_Tech: same thing with wasabi, i haaate wasabi
[6:56:27] lilgangstagoth1: this has prob been asked but is this gonna be the last day of nomi?
[6:56:28] CeeDreamer: @purespider What’s it’s flavor profile does it have something close that you can compare it to?
[6:56:31] Troupster: I dislike cucumbers but I love pickles 🙃
[6:56:34] Zyie: @PureSpider I mean, it does and it doesn't. On it's own, it can be misleading, but compared with other information it for sure has a meaning. "It's complicated" lol.
[6:56:39] kbigLiar: nice floors to those machines
[6:56:43] faceache96: American Wasabi is fake
[6:56:49] PureSpider: CeeDreamer uuuuh very umami, very cabbage-y but also spicy
[6:56:58] PureSpider: Zyie NODDERS
[6:56:59] SailorWS: Kimchi is one of those things that you try at a place and only get again if its good
[6:57:21] Traverus98: I think it's dried mustard not horseradish?
[6:57:29] CeeDreamer: @purespider Ahhhh I’d have to slowly try it cause im a wimp with spicy
[6:57:30] Archie8300: if they didnt grate it in front of you and it disn't account for half the cost of the meal it ain't Wasabi
[6:57:51] PureSpider: CeeDreamer imagine crunchy, a little spicy, a little tangy cabbage
[6:57:51] Dagmoo: yeah real wasabi is expensive af
[6:58:07] CeeDreamer: @purespider That does sound good
[6:58:09] ruthlessrellik: Why don't they farm more wasabi?
[6:58:20] Zyie: @Archie8300 Yeah, "wasabi" is almost never actually wasabi Sadge
[6:58:38] PureSpider: CeeDreamer and just LOADED with umami, which is my favorite part
[6:58:51] Sui_Ume: @Giantwaffle real wasabi is good for 20-30 minutes after grating, that's why you can't buy it as a paste
[6:58:51] RefiixGaming: Wokege yet again
[6:58:58] Archie8300: @ruthlessrellik They can't industrialise it so the quantities made are small
[6:59:08] lange__: @ruthlessrellik I believe it's rather needy to produce
[6:59:18] maccabeus: @ruthlessrellik it's an extreme diva about growing conditions
[6:59:22] xDeadBringerx: @Zyie @PureSpider Nowadays it's the combination of the MHz/GHz speeds, Instructions Per Clock, Instruction Latency, Available ALU/Vector ports etc etc
[6:59:27] Nilau: your inventory ae still has a frame
[6:59:31] PureSpider: xDeadBringerx yep
[6:59:51] poop_nukem: They grow it in Oregon
[6:59:51] Moobot: Come join the Waffle House Discord! <# https://discord.gg/fhGFtMuzdS
[6:59:51] lvyEartman: clarkson made those at his farm
[6:59:54] hockeygoaliechris: grown in a river in japan
[7:00:06] PureSpider: @lvyEartman tried to, anyway :D
[7:00:11] Troupster: dea gonna go after wasabi farms
[7:00:12] CurlySC: Hydro and vertical farming is so intresting
[7:00:14] PureSpider: clarkson's farm was so good
[7:00:19] Zapper_777: it takes 2-3 year for the root to mature.
[7:00:24] lange__: Clarksons manged to produce it
[7:00:26] LethalBro: "misty mountain stream beds" What LUL
[7:00:37] PureSpider: lange__ yea but like, questionable quality
[7:00:43] Nilau: @Giantwaffle I think your inventory ME crafting still has a frame saved
[7:00:52] LiveType: @xDeadBringerx This is the answer. It's essentially active transistor count * active duty cycle* frequency = net performance. There's a little more to it but that's the gist of it.

[7:01:02] Zyie: @xDeadBringerx Yeah, as I said, it's complicated, lol. Most ppl can't just look at the numbers and make an educated guess, we have to go by tests, synthetic or more natural ones, to make a judgement of what the actual performance difference is between two CPUs.
[7:01:20] PureSpider: Zyie i just use cpubenchmark danYes
[7:01:47] iLu_786: Day next year Yep.

[7:03:03] Zyie: @PureSpider Yeah, when upgrading myself, or helping others, I tend to check different reviews, and sites such as cpubenchmark
[7:03:15] kane1941: Old Waffle was smart
[7:03:26] Zyie: ^
[7:03:39] xDeadBringerx: LUL Pati just discovered the Vacuum Freezers can't keep up anymore

[7:07:22] Narcotical: @SailorWS Technically power is not a problem.. It's the power delivery that is KEKW
[7:07:26] maccabeus: dynamos are a good scalable solution, but they do not scale infinitely
[7:07:34] LiveType: Fusion will be fun
[7:07:40] PureSpider: fusion igaPog
[7:07:47] SailorWS: power deliver != power generation got it :)
[7:07:55] SailorWS: delivery*
[7:07:55] Moobot: You can sub to Waffle by clicking this neat link -> twitch.tv/giantwaffle/subscribe SUBprise
[7:07:59] PureSpider: have you seen there is a new fusion configuration that seems a lot more promising than the tokamak?
[7:08:04] NemesisXKL: draconing revolution fusion?
[7:08:05] adamcirillo: well i found with plasma turbines you can't auto insert the rotors so you can't automate the replacement of them
[7:08:31] CeeDreamer: Is there an interdimensional way to transfer power? Like to make a huge power generation in the end.
[7:08:35] bsmithduke: is this day 11?
[7:08:41] Koeckie: we have time? End of this week i think KEKW
[7:08:46] PureSpider: @bsmithduke 14
