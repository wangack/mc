[1:21:19] maccabeus: @jambag0 ooh what'd you get?
[1:21:23] CyberrPickle: @nimae Yeah it could’ve ended a lot worse.

[1:27:33] Purecrew: Dont you need like 3-4 connections to that?
[1:27:44] CurbSerpent: I grill at 2 c
[1:27:48] P00nDozer69: We just put it in the garage and open the door halfway in the winter

[1:27:56] Bunjimus: i live in michigan we grilled the other night and it was -1
[1:27:56] FoxeVR: me with it being straight 32F
[1:27:56] Dushtala: @luvistra no it's not. on 1.1 you grill, no matter what degrees it is. in Germany we call that angrillen (start of the BBQ season)
[1:27:59] Larklen: power KEKW
[1:27:59] JimTheShark: rip power
[1:27:59] GracelessDonkey: You can grill in any temp with gas/propane
[1:28:01] daedmissica0: look at power
[1:28:01] Tro95: rip power
[1:28:02] matori666: the power KEKW
[1:28:03] maccabeus: it's only too cold for grilling when the propane won't vaporize
[1:28:05] Yakobro: KEKW
[1:28:05] KnightofObv: it'll be alot longer as your converter does not have enough power
[1:28:06] xDeadBringerx: RIP power
[1:28:07] InternetPlumber: just move the grill closer to the patio window
[1:28:08] Jaydepps00: KEKW

[1:28:18] owl_guardian: more connections ??
[1:28:19] Markoala: Can you purify enough for 6 alloy smelters ?
[1:28:20] kane1941: Better use Blast Smelter
[1:28:20] DragonApoc: so is the ME emitter a laggy solution for controlling quantities in storage or not really ?
[1:28:20] Tetsomina: Connections
[1:28:31] Janzert: It's actually pretty hard to grill with propane at -40 because it's boiling point is -42
[1:28:34] IReality_: sometimes it hit 48-50c in my country crashv3L6mh
[1:28:47] Larklen: yup
[1:28:49] InternetPlumber: its compressed
[1:28:50] Face_32: i thought you had to use cables to connect power to machines? or is that just to not get shocked?
[1:28:51] Tetsomina: Yes
[1:28:51] GracelessDonkey: Yeah
[1:28:52] orangecreamsicle3: just upgrade the conduit Kapp
[1:28:53] Janzert: yep

[1:29:11] GuardMoony: Just use coals then ;D
[1:29:14] WARHERO322: Propane and propane accessories
[1:29:23] ItcHy__FiNgER: Hank Hill Shatting himself right now
[1:29:24] kane1941: @Face_32 there are several types of wire for each tier, superconductor type doesnt shock you
[1:29:27] P00nDozer69: I got a wood pellet BBQ/ smoker. It's amazing
[1:29:28] Tetsomina: Use wood peepoHappy
[1:29:33] xDeadBringerx: LPG in europe is Liquefied Petroleum Gas (mixture of propane, propylene, butylene, isobutane)
[1:29:35] Face_32: @Face_32 WTF, why didnt i learn this sooner, ive been cabling EVERYTHIGN
[1:29:49] GracelessDonkey: Gas and propane are bad when you don't have vents
[1:29:51] owl_guardian: parallel thing for multi smelter?
[1:29:53] KICKKJ: lol wut
[1:29:54] mechoriet: pepeLaugh well they just let it run 24/7 for some stupid reason too
[1:29:54] poop_nukem: Hank Hill would like a word
[1:29:59] arcticae: but the current thing
[1:30:01] GracelessDonkey: Some new house are not putting in hodos fro ranges to save cpst
[1:30:04] Zornd: So.. the reason behind the stove drama is that some of the stoves break and gas constantly leaks out.
[1:30:04] highlandermccloud: taste the meat not the heat @giantwaffle
[1:30:05] Larklen: gas stoves release carcinogens inside if you have shit ventilation
[1:30:13] DarkbuilderX: The government is looking at indoor gas stoves causing accidents, and people are flipping out
[1:30:14] bugsplatter23: tik tok just being used to push administration narrative since they want to ban gas stoves
[1:30:16] JimTheShark: Natural gas is odorless in nature. The gas companies add a scent to it so that you can tell if it's leaking.
[1:30:17] Face_32: propane with cast iron grates on the BBQ is actually really good once the grill gets seasoned
[1:30:20] FoxeVR: wanted to ask, as I haven't seen the rest of the playthrough, what tier are you at right now? LuV?
[1:30:24] maccabeus: if you taste propane something is wrong with your grill
[1:30:26] dennixfailalot: hank hill shames you
[1:30:29] orangecreamsicle3: @maccabeus YEP
[1:30:31] WizardSeQ: which one is cheaper?
[1:30:34] GracelessDonkey: People and builders are cheaping out on ventilation and it's causing a big problem
[1:30:37] hisdue: also don't stand close to your microwave so what
[1:30:37] StormTiberius: propane being odorless they add smelly stuff to it
[1:30:37] Larklen: but thats exactly what you use OMEGALUL
[1:30:39] Shounanek: @Giantwaffle i need to get an electric grill to bbq at my balcony as its prehibited to use anything else
[1:30:49] mechoriet: monkaS cleaning it you mean
[1:31:02] maccabeus: KEKW
[1:31:03] Soulif: its illegal to clean the grill
[1:31:06] Jaydepps00: probably KEKW
[1:31:07] spiffykai: dont do it
[1:31:10] Face_32: just dont do the grates
[1:31:12] WARHERO322: Dont
[1:31:12] Shroadie: DONT
[1:31:17] zero3juan: waffleNo
[1:31:20] RoninStorm: what you gonna do after that? wash your cast iron?
[1:31:21] verm1111: NO WAY
[1:31:30] maccabeus: cleaning it is fine if you also re-season it
[1:31:31] nvrmissashot: it's not hard to re-season a cast iron though
[1:31:31] KICKKJ: @Giantwaffle just turn it on and let burn for like 30 minutes
[1:31:36] GRAWLICKz: :3
[1:31:47] Face_32: thats sacrilege
[1:31:50] Larklen: using a bit of soap on cast iron nowadays isn't giga bad, soap isnt as harsh as it used to be, but ye....dont scrub hard lmao
[1:31:54] Tro95: scrub them with beef tallow
[1:31:54] bird404: do it and buy new flavorizer bars
[1:31:58] RoninStorm: i do agree with that part...
[1:32:01] Face_32: @Tro95 this
[1:32:22] xDeadBringerx: I always wash my cast iron with soap and water. Just don't use a too abrasive sponge/brush/etc
[1:32:28] mechoriet: don't think so
[1:32:29] d3vrand0m: you can buy a piece of chain mail to clean your cast iron
[1:32:33] KnightofObv: you do want the parallell upgrade
[1:32:38] splix661: how many sunnrium is needed ?
[1:32:44] BigClown264: Id definetly use the parallel upgrade
[1:32:46] mechoriet: else the mecarator would drain like all the base power
[1:32:46] frainsbreeze: wouldn'T the parallel upgrade increase the speed by 4?
[1:32:52] splix661: all LUL
[1:32:54] daedmissica0: swoff

[1:33:23] drsnaki96: that stleel wool thing?
[1:33:23] Moobot: You can find Waffle's Youtube channel here - https://youtube.com/giantwaffle
[1:33:27] Novaht: if you want to keep flavor on your grate for the grill just use a stainless brush
[1:33:42] darthrithen: chips bad most the time
[1:33:48] Sander20011: depends on what you are doing.
[1:33:48] dennixfailalot: depends on the matrial
[1:34:03] Tetsomina: Metallurgy is different for each element
[1:34:05] Novaht: i have kept so much flavor just by brushing the grate of the grill
[1:34:06] maccabeus: machining is a deep, deep rabbit hole
[1:34:07] Bunjimus: dont know much about metal lathes but its good on wood lathes or epoxy
[1:34:12] d3vrand0m: i prefer my chips made of potatoe
[1:34:14] Face_32: chips are harder to control what cuts
[1:34:27] Zucate: d3vrand0m not corn?
[1:34:29] Jaydepps00: @d3vrand0m 5Head
[1:34:41] d3vrand0m: @Zucate or corn
[1:34:42] AkitaTau: I like the good ol backyardsientist
[1:34:51] NoVodRajj: chips are better the long stands can get caught up and scratch the workpiece
[1:35:00] TheCairon: As a sheet metal worker theres nothing more satisfying than drilling out a hole and its all one long coil
[1:35:10] mechoriet: pepeLaugh for now
[1:35:13] Mick1555: Generally a big long chain of means you've got the speed of the tool and the feed of the tool correct
[1:35:16] splix661: chips at start not after a grove is formed
[1:35:19] mechoriet: till we add another ebf room
[1:35:19] dennixfailalot: machining a potato sounds difficult Kappa
[1:35:42] mechoriet: supervising
[1:35:44] Sander20011: remember that you will need the high tier solar panels for mining drone eventually
[1:35:45] GracelessDonkey: He catJAM
[1:35:54] Kyogerfan: name the cow
[1:36:04] Tro95: cowJAM
[1:36:22] mechoriet: cowJAM emote when?
[1:36:32] KnightofObv: it got auto eported
[1:37:07] kbigLiar: curium 243 or whatever probably needs a compacting drawer
[1:37:22] FoxeVR: do you enjoy doing the nuclearcraft related stuff? I always get confused when it comes to fission fuels XD
[1:38:12] Minardi_: wtf need to go to college for that shit
[1:38:15] SubbDogg: I mean you dont need to, this is just optimal
[1:38:16] jayrickson87: I love it i have 14 different reactors. I make all them myself without that site
[1:38:18] GracelessDonkey: PoE builder is a good example
[1:38:30] kane1941: This is the most efficient design possible
[1:38:32] FoxeVR: I find it odd that fusion reactors from the same mod, are better power produces and are way easier than going through all the different fuels
[1:38:39] urbanjack_: @Giantwaffle   Have you heard anything about the Art of the Rail Games release ?
[1:38:40] Face_32: would you like it better if that file was available in game
[1:38:57] Kamipulu: no i think waffle likes min/maxing everything he does
[1:39:22] Face_32: ?
[1:39:27] FoxeVR: fair XD
[1:39:28] Face_32: no its not
[1:39:52] kbigLiar: waffle - if this lecm fuel is what you are supposed to use, why isn't the previous curium tier not in a compacting drawer to auto-condense for bulk lecm crafting?
[1:39:52] RationalLies: rude
[1:39:53] mechoriet: NotLikeThis oh god
[1:39:56] Face_32: NO
[1:39:59] AIex_0: thats actually evil lol
[1:39:59] splix661: i build the max size but it looks like a reactor IRL so outputing 3/4 power
[1:40:00] GracelessDonkey: You monster
[1:40:00] GoodOldXijan: its so hard to start in new games with the min max mindset i have it too but my wife is overthinking everything and read like 10 guides before starting a game. Sometimes its a bad thing :D
[1:40:00] aundros: waffle why
[1:40:03] dennixfailalot: just to fuck with peoples head?

[1:46:28] Flame010: 2 hr up time 5 minutes minecraft content lol
[1:46:50] PureSpider: so like uh... the xbox did years ago? :D
[1:46:54] kane1941: Imagine getting EVA in KerbalVR with this suit
[1:46:57] LVhurricane: too processor intensive
[1:47:08] PureSpider: @LVhurricane it's not
[1:47:16] DrYProtoss: thats the way they do it in nfl games
[1:47:21] DrYProtoss: to put the lines on the tv field
[1:47:25] MDSZilla: Would it work in low light?
[1:47:29] PureSpider: yea but we've progressed so far since kinect days, AI can synthesize depth maps from 2D reasonably well these days
[1:47:30] Tasar_: Doesnt tesla do that?
[1:47:36] SanquaL: @Giantwaffle FaceTrackNoIR did that about 5 years ago for your face. It is available even today.
[1:47:38] anothersadpleb: PepoThink
[1:47:42] FoxeVR: is a slimmed down of this idea like the quests finger tracking?
[1:47:42] chaoskub: IR
[1:47:56] PureSpider: so you're talking skeleton tracking?
[1:47:57] 619srt: @Tasar_ yes they do tesla vision
[1:48:00] punkgeek: So Kinect?
[1:48:00] itsKev73: no xbox kinect then?
[1:48:03] MDSZilla: IR Camera would work in low light but we would need IR Blasters as well
[1:48:11] CodyAsano: Driver4vr?
[1:48:13] Janzos: A lot of road mapping is completed that way
[1:48:20] Stonan: HURR DURR USE THE CONNECT
[1:48:25] PureSpider: you dont need depth, you can synthesize it reasonably well from 2D these days
[1:48:28] Tasar_: my oculus could track my fingers with four cameras
[1:48:39] Face_32: arent cameras distance sensors too?
[1:48:47] PureSpider: yea should be doable
[1:49:04] Face_32: shh
[1:49:04] mechoriet: DoF sensors right?
[1:49:05] owl_guardian: did you make enough liquid plutonium and curium?
[1:49:06] Face_32: ahh*
[1:49:15] TheShelfman: Something like what the Youtuber Jelle did for football?
[1:49:17] PureSpider: i've done a bunch of shit with the kinect and opencv in college, and we could do a lot then already, like 10 years ago :D
[1:49:25] MDSZilla: What if we just used LiDAR and then mapped skeleton onto human using software alot more accurate no?
[1:49:26] dennis3833: how far are u from creative tank?
[1:49:30] Harmar: i know there is a few programs out there in development but i havent seen to much with them in a wile
[1:49:30] Moobot: You can sub to Waffle by clicking this neat link -> twitch.tv/giantwaffle/subscribe SUBprise
[1:49:47] DarkbuilderX: I feel like using little indicator straps would make that a lot more reliable
[1:49:49] PureSpider: replace depth sensor with AI synthesizing, and you basically have a kinect with 2D data only
[1:50:22] GracelessDonkey: A lot of phone cameras do something similar to what you want
[1:50:23] banshay3: queue all the movies with the NSA hacking into the cameras and observe the guy in his room in VR
[1:50:26] DKJensen98: Im a bit bummed that they disconneted the use of the kinect
[1:50:33] PureSpider: that sounds like a really cool project tbh
[1:50:41] FoxeVR: SlimeVR has a wifi based tracking but I feel its also unreliable atm
[1:50:44] LiveType: yep, infrared tracking. It's the most reliable and accurate tracking you can do assuming you can see the trackers.
[1:50:44] Harmar: closest i know of availible right now is WalkinVR
[1:51:01] splix661: @PureSpider all that stuff that sethbling did was nuts , so something like that?
[1:51:04] FoxeVR: tundra is light house based
[1:51:04] Zwazi: Call me when full dive vr exists
[1:51:10] PureSpider: splix661 yea kinda
[1:51:18] Traverus98: are we good on tungsten now
[1:51:37] Smileynator: i can guarantee you they do some smoothing already
[1:51:42] mechoriet: maybe something like the lens correction profiles
[1:51:42] FoxeVR: tundra has an unreliable dongle to pair with
[1:51:42] BrewCat1215: So it’s going to be like ready player one soon then @giantwaffle waffleHeart
[1:51:45] banshay3: proximity to average
[1:51:46] MDSZilla: Nvidia DLSS 3.0 Frame Generation Morphed for Movement Generation
[1:51:58] LiveType: In intelligent interpolation method using accelerometers as well as the infrared? I'm almost certain that already exists unless it's way more complicated that I'm assuming
[1:52:00] Smileynator: problem is, that too much smoothing causes pain to motion sickness, there is too much delay if you start smoothing
[1:52:03] daedmissica0: Ai will be super cool for this
[1:52:03] LaroStar007: A quick fix would be to normalise the sensor data
[1:52:14] LaroStar007: @giantwaffle
[1:52:18] Face_32: do you have speed upgrades on your dark steel pants? @Giantwaffle
[1:52:20] Askjong: SpaceX launch delayed Sadge
[1:52:23] FoxeVR: it is the same technology as Vive's trackers, as its apparently made by the same people who made those trackers for Vive
[1:52:30] mechoriet: @Askjong Sadge NYOOOO
[1:52:34] LiveType: @Smileynator The delay shouldn't be that bad unless your polling rate is atrocious.
[1:52:36] daedmissica0: @Giantwaffle gpt chat it lol
[1:52:43] splix661: @PureSpider SeemsGood
[1:52:50] DrYProtoss: need a drawer for californium
[1:52:52] Smileynator: @Smileynator youd be surprised what speed you need for it to feel not sickening
[1:52:56] WARHERO322: LECM 245
[1:52:57] frainsbreeze: you made 1
[1:52:59] ExumeTV: you are just havent Centrifuge
[1:53:00] kane1941: You need 245, you mad 243
[1:53:02] FoxeVR: it might be in the interface
[1:53:04] TheShaddo13: 245
[1:53:12] FoxeVR: ohhhh
[1:53:19] mechoriet: @Askjong you sure cause I can't find a tweet stating that
[1:53:20] Protonmat: Im totally making my own engine using chatgpt rn KEKW
[1:53:21] Smileynator: the vive tracker mechanics are not that much dark magic either. They are just HDD motors with a laser on it. And then some triangulation math
[1:53:22] officialhunterx: check power room since hooking up the new alloy smelters
[1:53:29] BBQ1: sadKEK oh no
[1:53:32] Askjong: tomorrow
[1:53:38] Askjong: 27 hours
[1:53:38] Bertandbum: Has it been confirmed now?
[1:53:55] LiveType: @Smileynator The amount varies, but I'm good at ~350 hz tracking from my experience with this stuff. But that was using a wired connection...
[1:54:09] J0hanAndersson: @Askjong where is this info? cant see it on their twitter
[1:54:24] mechoriet: no tweet so strange
[1:54:41] Askjong: Just saw it on Everyday Astronaut
[1:54:44] philipkatis: This was the latest https://twitter.com/nextspaceflight/status/1614330084424581120
[1:54:59] Smileynator: @Smileynator Ok, now imagine a laser, going at roughly 7200RPM around your room, and try and do the programming to make that run at 350Hz, it's not going to be easy :P

[2:42:46] SailorWS: GTA rp lawyer Pog
[2:42:53] geraldtgnome: @Giantwaffle late 40 is still fun, kid at heart with music and tech keeping me young
[2:42:58] Glacial_Indifference: It is
[2:43:04] kakiewakie_: it passed the bar
[2:43:09] mysts_07: like as a defence lawyer?
[2:43:10] FinnYellowbelly: it passed the bar, barely.
[2:43:13] daemonaedryn: KEKW
[2:43:16] Harmar: there is a special chat AI, it wouldnt be legal since most courts you cant have eletronics
[2:43:17] AIex_0: some company wants them to try it but they can't bring electronics in right?
[2:43:17] daemonaedryn: thats terrifying
[2:43:17] mrleonehart: Yes and also it’s actively being used in contract law @giantwaffle
[2:43:21] FoxeVR: holy crap
[2:43:21] LiveType: Yeah it did, barely but passing
[2:43:24] Mackmora: An AI lawyer
[2:43:24] tomey36: Wow
[2:43:31] Bronain: Dude will defend himself with it's help @Giantwaffle
[2:43:33] Tuskon15: I know some AI is offering $1m to argue a case before the supreme court
[2:43:33] hisdue: lawyers lie though monkaS
[2:43:36] BBQ1: passing bar doesn't equal good lawyer tho
[2:43:37] Glacial_Indifference: Law is just natural language processing and pattern matching. Far easier for a computer than a human.
[2:43:43] Mr_Warsta: Why terrifying? Free law advice anywhere everywhere!!
[2:43:46] lukasalbert: isnt it good that we can have at least some compentence i guess ?
[2:43:46] ayaya_prime: Wasn't that without the essay part?
[2:43:49] Allmostdone: No it will read all the stuff heself
[2:44:01] BBQ1: bar is just rote memorization
[2:44:05] BBQ1: not creativity
[2:44:12] gikei: isn't that impossible cause there is the character part of it?
[2:44:13] BBQ1: 50% essay, 50% multiple choice
[2:44:16] Akunin_EQ: Old firm I worked at, one of the IT middle managers passed the bar to just stick it in the lawyers faces.
[2:44:18] AlphaSchnauzer: be a bad lawyer but good at paralegal
[2:44:25] dollar_cave: It's hardly free to run GPT-3. Thing takes millions of dollars worth of hardware.
[2:44:26] BBQ1: essay is just regurgitating law tho
[2:44:29] Allmostdone: and you can't practive law in every state. It's regulated
[2:44:38] chaoskub: @Akunin_EQ Honestly, I respect it
[2:44:41] WARHERO322: Its Ambiguous
[2:44:50] InternetPlumber: Law is subjective not objective
[2:44:53] FoxeVR: yeah law is very vague
[2:44:59] Mr_Warsta: Ah yeah.. perhaps its fine for simple cases, like for answering "can I do this" or so
[2:45:00] Glacial_Indifference: But you have precedent to help you, which the machine had reams of to reference as it has no memory limit.
[2:45:13] Akunin_EQ: @Akunin_EQ I looked at doing it, but I'm really damn lazy
[2:45:33] hisdue: we updated our ToS YEP
[2:45:39] geraldtgnome: @Giantwaffle if you want a hard exam have a look at the check team leader penetration testing exam, 4 hours of essays, 4 hours of multiple choice and an a whole day of blind network testing aaargh never again !
[2:45:45] mysts_07: i just realized we can use chat gpt to sum up terms of agreements so we actually can read them!
[2:45:46] Archie8300: it doesn't have to be perfect, just better than a human
[2:45:46] Zwazi: Just copy and paste all contracts into chatGPT. Easy
[2:45:51] Glacial_Indifference: That may be why it barely passed. Nothing novel in its answer.
[2:45:51] Moobot: You can find Waffle's Youtube channel here - https://youtube.com/giantwaffle

[2:47:18] Bronain: he had to "put her down" @Giantwaffle
[2:47:20] Lopoloos: his game was so weak he couldnt even get an AI to be interested in him
[2:47:21] LiveType: The big models cost millions to train
[2:47:25] Stonan: Kind of like a real wife
[2:47:28] WARHERO322: Ultimate Wifu
[2:47:33] TigerLuv: cheaper than a real one!
[2:47:36] Kevincav: That's cheaper than a real life wife
[2:47:39] hohujknh: Ok
[2:47:49] FoxeVR: I find chatGPT to be scary in the prospect of education, the fact that you can generate an essay so easily
[2:47:49] daedmissica0: is almost cheeper then the real one
[2:48:02] CanYouDigIt7: uhhhh
[2:48:03] Megaddd: Cheer300 Yeah who would give money to talk to someone they don't know in person, gosh.
[2:48:04] phatallen: ya its called rent

[2:57:51] sorefingers: pretty sure the panels connect to each other so you technically only need 1 conduit if it has enough troughput @giantwaffle
[2:57:52] AngeloIonucz: why u dont use a wand to place them
[2:57:58] lukasalbert: they do
[2:58:02] KICKKJ: someone check the vod

[2:59:10] thexvar1able: and get magnet
[2:59:13] kypudo: try connecting the dimensional receiveres directly to the solar pannel
[2:59:20] frainsbreeze: its FE not rf
[2:59:22] lukasalbert: maybe its per panel ?
[2:59:26] Timiderxbox: Can you upgrade the transdimensional thing with a better capacitor
[2:59:26] Novaht: thats only per solar panl
[2:59:35] frainsbreeze: yes
[2:59:36] ExumeTV: @frainsbreeze  FE and RF are the SAME
[2:59:39] Novaht: you have 128 times 8k per tick
[2:59:39] MrSlagle: thats in FE\
[2:59:52] Novaht: yeah
[2:59:53] jayrickson87: fe not eu
[3:00:00] Fnack: cant you put upgrades in?

[3:00:44] Invalidm_: Wokege
[3:00:44] SailorWS: letMeCi
[3:00:47] Face_32: building wand just requires a few bookshelfs and gold ingots
[3:00:47] gamabunt: I used a Capacitor bank to increase transfer rates.
[3:00:48] Salico: Wokege
[3:00:49] hisdue: letMeCi
[3:00:50] mechoriet: Wokege
[3:00:54] mechoriet: Wokege war
[3:00:56] Glacial_Indifference: Refill 02?
[3:00:59] Narcotical: How does something drop in space though
[3:01:00] owl_guardian: dont forget your osmiridium dust
[3:01:09] prairydog: KAPOW
[3:01:18] chaoskub: Osmiridum EBF is fucked

[3:01:32] SailorWS: letMeCi
[3:01:36] LethalBro: letMeCi
[3:01:37] Harmar: either ci or a machine went full power and blowing everything up xD
[3:01:38] YOUCEP: can you replace the solar panels in the crafting recipes with a random item like cobble?

[3:02:37] daedmissica0: o2 @Giantwaffle
[3:03:10] daedmissica0: 10 sides
[3:03:37] daedmissica0: and at base
[3:03:38] geraldtgnome: @Giantwaffle on a fun thing, new volume control for my monitors coming, £300 for a volume pot hehe
[3:03:44] Purecrew: Dont you also need that on the other side
[3:03:47] daemonaedryn: Pog
[3:03:53] daemonaedryn: solar panels ftw
[3:04:06] thecodealive_original: that's from batteries
[3:04:09] Timiderxbox: In the base you can probably input this to the vibrant capacitor bank and input to you system that way
[3:04:27] sorefingers: the panels have an internal buffer snd can transfer 4x they are generating so it might look faster than it is
[3:04:29] chaoskub: not connected?
[3:04:38] DX_Plates: No extract on battery
[3:04:38] frainsbreeze: use signalum?
[3:04:59] mahoriiii77: power bank full
[3:04:59] CoolReal: Remove extract from battery
[3:05:01] The_kid_as_a_teen: LuL
[3:05:14] LethalBro: On the I/O
[3:05:25] daedmissica0: x4
[3:05:30] thecodealive_original: isn't battery a backup only?
[3:05:31] daedmissica0: is io
[3:05:48] LethalBro: KEKW
[3:05:50] The_kid_as_a_teen: KEKW
[3:06:05] dylan0806: Add a capacitor to the transfer system
[3:06:18] Francisco_Scaramanga: chefsKiss
[3:06:19] KnightofObv: nops
[3:06:19] LethalBro: Not enough LUL
[3:06:30] KnightofObv: time to upgrade to lumium
[3:06:42] BlueVariant: Can just slap tesseract against capacitor
[3:06:43] tomey36: Why not use better cables?
[3:06:47] onkelkonkel: Can you move the transciver to be directly connected to the battery bank?
[3:06:57] orangecreamsicle3: @tomey36 lazy YEP
[3:07:02] CoolReal: Time to recable the entire base then Pog
[3:07:06] jmm548: the new cab.es are not connected tot he front at alll
[3:07:07] Purecrew: Need to extract only
[3:07:12] tomey36: @orangecreamsicle3 makes sense lol
[3:07:13] jmm548: cables*
[3:07:17] Stillglade: are conduits on back connected to the ones in front?
[3:07:19] woodlaphroaig: you need to connect it to the base as well I think
[3:07:27] Zapper_777: the back side is not connected?
[3:07:29] mechoriet: pepeLaugh the back cables are not connected right?
[3:07:33] orangecreamsicle3: I replaced my entire base with enderium conduits
[3:07:42] thecodealive_original: how about a dimensional transceiver close to ebfs?
[3:07:47] orangecreamsicle3: it took us 20 minutes
[3:07:56] Minelmonia: is the next level cable THAT much expensive?
[3:07:58] gamabunt: no, you don’t you only need one connection with a better Kabel right?
[3:08:00] LuciferSpirt: check the internal battery of solar
[3:08:06] BlueVariant: Why not just hug the cube with the capacitor bank for full transfer throughput
[3:08:12] navalship55: Just attach solar to giant capacitor directly, no cables
[3:08:13] LinkHub_Pro: @Giantwaffle your max from solar is only 500k due to only one transceiver
[3:08:30] orangecreamsicle3: @LinkHub_Pro ^
[3:08:36] Grav1s: I think those top cables patti had on the battery are set to insert only.
[3:08:36] chaoskub: 3 in, 1 out
[3:08:38] kypudo: hum just start using the dimensional tranceivers
[3:08:41] FinnYellowbelly: does a building gadget work?
[3:08:42] Sam_1443: main conduit trunks firt
[3:08:49] DarkbuilderX: The space station has 3, but does the base have 3?
[3:08:51] MrSlagle: only 1 on the base
[3:08:54] kolbias_13: You only have 1 tranceiver recieving from the 3
[3:08:59] thecodealive_original: only 1 at the base
[3:09:03] LinkHub_Pro: does the base have in iin
[3:09:04] mechoriet: 3 in space but only one at the base tho
[3:09:15] Aripa: he uses higher tier conduits in the base to extract more
[3:09:20] Narcotical: He is using better conduit at the base though
[3:09:22] jmm548: shouldt u add more tot he battery bank to transfer it ?
[3:09:25] ExumeTV: @Giantwaffle  you only have 3 in space and one in the base. so base is limiting you
[3:09:27] Aripa: the conduits in the base use 500k each
[3:09:29] jmm548: all on there own conections
[3:09:41] jmm548: like moon1 moon2 and moon3
[3:09:45] Gh3ttoboy: waffle didnt you say it was useless to upgrade the dynamos to signalum and then enderium
[3:09:45] owl_guardian: spent 3 days making a block youre not using KEKW
[3:09:48] jmm548: so 500k each
[3:10:05] navalship55: Directly attach solar cube to giant capacitor, no cables
[3:10:06] Moobot: You can find Waffle's Youtube channel here - https://youtube.com/giantwaffle
[3:10:10] Madarion: @Gh3ttoboy he means to upgrade the conduits to enderium, not the dynamos
[3:10:13] chaoskub: You have 2 patterns
[3:10:20] theheatwaveisback: This looks really fun but I think playing this mod pack would make me really sad
[3:10:23] officialhunterx: go back into vod and get a list
[3:10:28] jmm548: u had 2 fgreen ones
[3:10:42] MrSlagle: @Aripa but the capacitor he is using is limited to 500k max output for the cube. so he is only getting half of the max output
[3:11:07] daZonk: You need more transceivers in the base side, you have 3sending but one receding.
[3:11:25] LordElrond64: this pack is just pure chaos KEKW
[3:11:35] GracelessDonkey: Pati is
[3:11:35] daemonaedryn: samarium rods
[3:11:39] daemonaedryn: for luv stuff
[3:11:40] Purecrew: ask pati he just swapped it
[3:11:43] Methanee: ask pati
[3:11:44] FoxeVR: you said you wanted to make extra sunnarium
[3:12:03] Miracleshot: KEKW
[3:12:16] AbyssDepth: everyone luvs electric motors
[3:12:26] jmm548: yeah shouldn't each transceiver have a separate connection to get the full 500k each cube ?
[3:12:33] ExumeTV: How do you get that little Dotted line box of recipes behind your cam?
[3:12:54] tomey36: Doesn’t that need luv to smelt?
[3:12:57] FoxeVR: gotta luv gregtech

[3:36:30] DaddyDiddy: @bozzozz2021 try ftb academy or stoneblock if you're just starting out

[4:48:13] Smileynator: the drivers? wat
[4:48:15] MaIlchad: Sony has a really good noise cancelling pair of cans. Senheiser has some ok ones but I have some complaints. you can get a bluetooth transceiver for any headphones which you might prefer
[4:48:18] mechoriet: https://www.techpowerup.com/303124/audio-technica-introduces-ath-m50xsts-streamset-models-worlds-first-streaming-headsets
[4:48:27] Dibbsu: Bought the ATH-AD700X for Tarkov and love the quality on them
[4:48:28] PureSpider: i think you HAVE to get aftermarket pads for the m50 though, otherwise they clamp your head to bits
[4:48:34] Lemures322: I've had mine (without the plug, earlier version) for like 15 years. Still sound great.  Refreshed them with new cups and a headband, good as new.
[4:48:43] Smileynator: oh, PHYSICAL drivers, i was like what.. windows isn't that bad with drivers on headphones
[4:48:51] Kamipulu: I have repurchased dr scholls sandles 4 times over 10 years
[4:49:06] 0x4273: are the m50x hinges made out of plastic because my 40s squeak like a bitch
[4:49:06] Smileynator: I live in IT world man, my view is scewed
[4:49:09] weightmaker: gotta update your drivers man
[4:49:13] lymb2: Having a dedicated sound card also makes a difference
[4:49:19] heymarkhansen: thought the same tbh lol
[4:49:21] haitham506: HD650/6XX is the best but they are Open-Back
[4:49:23] PureSpider: @lymb2 just use a DAC
[4:49:38] PureSpider: @haitham506 yea sennheiser is fantastic as well
[4:49:42] MaIlchad: ngl one problem I've found with all headphones is they either stay on your head or don't clamp. both is rare or impossible...
[4:49:43] Maynid: HD 6XX here
[4:49:43] CrackaBTW: they are @0x4273
[4:49:51] hyperion6767: @Smileynator Dont worry, i had the same tought when he meantiond drivers KEKW

[4:50:19] PureSpider: @ALv100Slowbro yes
[4:50:25] Tasar_: oh boy
[4:50:28] MaIlchad: @lymb2 Depends how good your soundcard was to begin with. mine is indisginguishible from an external
[4:50:30] d3vrand0m: during high school i worked for a concert audio company and i just re-coned speakers all day

[5:14:58] Mike190Twitch: NOw imagine Hard Mode KEKW

[5:15:17] dianaspencer017: shut
[5:15:18] ExumeTV: open it to lan and just never close MC XD
[5:15:19] MaIlchad: pretty much all tech modpacks require AFK farm lol.
[5:15:21] Mike190Twitch: I run the MC server on a local small form factor computer dedicated just for it
[5:15:24] LuciferSpirt: YEP just open to lan then it will stay open even if u press esc
[5:15:24] Sayiber: can you just local host it on your machine?
[5:15:27] MaIlchad: much as well setup a raspberry pi and let the server idle all day
[5:15:33] d3vrand0m: yeah server is the way to go, you can run the server on your lcoal computer so you dont have to keep the client open
[5:15:37] Zenkas: This pack isnt running on a pi
[5:15:40] MaIlchad: Can you can local host on your machine, but then you have to pay for electricity instead of serer hosting
[5:15:55] kane1941: Didnt MC switch to local servers for SP like years ago?
[5:15:57] ExumeTV: I just started a solo Game and i just got my First EBF built.. cant do anything else with what i have lol
[5:16:02] MaIlchad: @Zenkas its server code only it doesn't have to run at full speed with graphics. Especially when you're offline.
[5:16:20] Zenkas: There's so many tile entities though
[5:16:23] Zenkas: It would never keep up
[5:16:33] ExumeTV: and i also started playing PO3 solo XD
[5:16:47] IHaveShirts: xdd
[5:16:52] MaIlchad: How many calculations do you think computers can handle a second? wolfsLURK getting arm server code would be harder that making it run
[5:17:06] DrunkenMunkie: you could craft lead dust faster using iron mortar
[5:17:30] kane1941: 1 motor = 64 ruridit wire
