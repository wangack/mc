[0:16:22] 0ntan1o: @shadowsfaerie I can't believe Bugs Bunny lied to me
[0:16:40] MistyOctobrr: they also can’t have yarn because it can wrap around their intestines and if you end up pulling it it can kill them
[0:17:10] 0ntan1o: well I was gonna work out later but now I'm gonna go fight bugs bunny for lying to me as a child only my parents are allowed to do that
[0:17:42] shadowsfaerie: it was meant as a stand-in for a cigar as a visual joke

[0:21:52] 0ntan1o: HI MV CatBlush
[0:22:00] NotKaciel: the setting is post apocalyptic and everything is pretty much underwater so you have to dive for most of your resources and theres base building, raids, hostile factions, its still being developed but im having a good time
[0:22:00] DM_Berry: favourite survival game will always be 7 days to die. I dunno, it just holds a special place in my heart <3

[0:25:40] mvjv__: gosh, i wanna learn how to crochet properly so bad
[0:25:43] 0ntan1o: WOAH
[0:25:44] 0ntan1o: true
[0:25:55] shadowsfaerie: ...I was not expecting kitchen scissors to be used for crafts. but if you don't have issues with yarn unraveling, whatever works
[0:25:57] chelsymm: Yep, those are kitchen scissors all right.
[0:26:13] HfxTenor: Granny Squares sound like what happens to your No-No Sqaure once you get old
[0:26:58] mvjv__: yeah, i totally get that
[0:27:31] shadowsfaerie: Do you sew your own cosplays?
[0:28:14] shadowsfaerie: Ok, in that case you probably want to get regular office supply scissors for paper and some craft scissors for your thread.
[0:28:44] shadowsfaerie: Things that fabric and yarn dull the blades faster
[0:28:57] 0ntan1o: Hey Cass guess what
[0:29:24] 0ntan1o: your mother
[0:29:27] shadowsfaerie: if you are making 90 granny squares, you will probably notice it being harder to cut with
[0:29:29] 0ntan1o: BRRR BRRR  BRRRR
[0:29:31] mvjv__: damn
[0:30:51] shadowsfaerie: the sun shines, the kitty sleeps
