[1:42:55] SaylorMimi: Is it fine to just put a trapdoor into the hole?
[1:43:04] RonitG1204: smant try using iron bar as standing platform
[1:43:07] lordpufferfishh: P e r f e c t
[1:43:09] FurnaceMC1: remember wither skeles are 3 blocks tall

[1:43:33] jazzygirl013: I wish I was helpful in this…
[1:43:33] p0int_crow: CHEATS
[1:43:38] lordpufferfishh: If you can make a 2x2 hole it'll work
[1:43:39] poptartf: @wiblewoblee yeah hes been faking this whole serious, you didnt know?
[1:43:42] daiichan_: hes edging

[1:43:54] fierycatwastaken: when are you and pcrow doing a collab again
[1:43:55] motomus64: what hack client is he using?
[1:43:55] The_Kind_idiot: walls work great
[1:43:57] mcbaloosta: could you not put the piglin at the bottom of the hole under a trap door?
[1:43:58] p0int_crow: use fence gates
[1:43:59] susses: remove the other trapdoor
[1:44:03] awesomeman689: vines and ladders
[1:44:08] martyboy13: make it 16x16 then with 2x2 hole instead of 15x15?
[1:44:11] TrueDelta: coral fan
[1:44:13] SuperTheUnderDog: is it this drastic if they're on the edge, with the amount that spawns?
[1:44:15] mlb1626: You know what works better than wither roses on dirt?
[1:44:16] RiskOfTea2: Can you put the target pigling partway down the hole?
[1:44:20] p0int_crow: fence gate my dude
[1:44:24] randomstuff0714: Is he making a farm?
[1:44:25] PyjamaMole: wont the other skeletons just push eachother in?

[1:44:38] jasminekazooie: smolCook smolCook smolCook
[1:44:40] NickelW: he dont wanna'
[1:44:45] sevenbee: @wiblewoblee english only pls
[1:44:48] susses: ye try many withers
[1:44:48] granimated: wither skeleton might be able to keep a better line of sight if the piglin is on an iron bar
[1:44:54] bigdaddykarlern: what r u trying to make
[1:44:54] furious851: try spawning more than 1
[1:44:58] srmajou: smant always wearing that w hat
[1:45:00] bean1e_b0i_: he no no wanna :'(
[1:45:01] sqhween: won't 3x3 still have really good rates anyway?
[1:45:06] arrxstd: so the way the trapdoors work is that the skeletons think that its a full block and try jumping to it and end up falling instead
[1:45:06] RiskOfTea2: Could you just use mob-push and a barren hole?
[1:45:10] FilipRoque: Yo Smant. Is there a reason for wanting more beacons or is it just a flex?
[1:45:15] susses: works semi well
[1:45:17] sevenbee: @srmajou smolSpin
[1:45:19] RonitG1204: smant try using iron bar as standing platform for piglin
[1:45:21] jasminekazooie: they want uppies
[1:45:22] satinall: Hellarrrrr
[1:45:27] wiblewoblee: traffic jam
[1:45:33] P_Zero: seems you need the same drop chute gnembon uses
[1:45:33] randomstuff0714: "They jump"
[1:45:39] lavender_sunsets: they want uppies
[1:45:42] Sukyaki: what happens if you put the piglin on an upper slab?
[1:45:43] SaylorMimi: This is for bones lmao
[1:45:43] Avid_Gaming_: i feel like a 3x3 hole would be worth it
[1:45:54] susses: yeah funneling probably isnt the best approach
[1:45:55] goldenwindrequiem76: this is the weirdest wither skeleton said someone who never bulit one before
[1:45:56] oversquare: shouldn't the 'peer pressure' be enough?
[1:45:59] MigherHind: The skeletons yearn for the void
[1:46:01] poptartf: do a 3x3 yeah
[1:46:03] lordpufferfishh: Yes, it's easier to make a 3x3
[1:46:09] NickelW: you wouldn't need a 3x3, just a 2x2 right?
[1:46:09] memeprism: how ru FLYING?
[1:46:12] PyjamaMole: theyll probably spawn fast enough anyway
[1:46:15] NickelW: maybe I'm crazy
[1:46:21] poptartf: @NickelW was about to say that

[1:46:32] Xeroandcookies: DinoDance DinoDance
[1:46:33] random1040: Are we winning
[1:46:35] 81dovahkiin: 4x4?
[1:46:39] Jenix106: What about carpets? Does that work?
[1:46:39] electraminer: maybe the middle block is needed?
[1:46:40] NightcoreBunny: make them run into nether portal
[1:46:41] gart751: i'd use portals
[1:46:43] SaylorMimi: It's cause the piglin isn't centered?
[1:46:44] jazzygirl013: I know this song! DS game right?
[1:46:48] PyjamaMole: them waiting will only be a problem if it fills up the mobcap, but there will never be 70 waiting on this tiny platform
[1:46:48] TheFireDem0n: try placing the piglin on a slab
[1:46:49] some_stupidusername: catJAM
[1:46:52] RiskOfTea2: center the piglin with fence-pistons?
[1:46:53] Avid_Gaming_: there will be a constant flow of them though so i doubt it'd be a big issue
[1:47:14] Snooke212: @jazzygirl013 nsmbU
[1:47:17] TheFireDem0n: you can center it with stained glass
[1:47:20] susses: that would indeed work
[1:47:21] didi10001: put him in a cart
[1:47:22] FilipRoque: Rip Piglin o7

[1:47:36] jazzygirl013: @snooke212 thanks!
[1:47:40] RonitG1204: smant try using iron bar as standing platform for piglin standing platform
[1:47:42] regan_rw2: hi smant
[1:47:44] P_Zero: if you do a solid block up the sides of the piglin, then grindstones in front of that with one open chute in front of the piglins, they can fall in without cclogging, since the grindstones allow a few pixels more space
[1:47:44] wiblewoblee: advanced architecture rn
[1:47:44] PyjamaMole: smolLUL
[1:47:47] Nyoubi: D:

[1:47:54] poptartf: @wiblewoblee yes
[1:47:56] furious851: minecart?
[1:47:58] RiskOfTea2: build a ring above the hole with pane glass
[1:48:06] CelloBeetle: 3x3?
[1:48:09] lordgregory42: Maybe they won't walk off if it's higher?
[1:48:11] SaylorMimi: It's cause they take no fall damage
[1:48:15] random1040: smolChunkyrunky smolWop smolChunkyrunky smolWop smolChunkyrunky smolWop
[1:48:16] The_Kind_idiot: wall make the skelly think they cant reach it, it may waste some spawn space but it also solve the getting stuck problem
[1:48:23] logan_the_gamer_guy: 😂
[1:48:24] BlueSkyBreezy: is there a seed for a skyblock world or do you have to download it or something?
[1:48:41] SuperTheUnderDog: wiki says they run away from wolves, as long as they're not attacked. what happens if you have some sit around the perimeter?
[1:48:44] RonitG1204: smant use iron bar as standing platform for piglin
[1:48:47] crunchyrai: put it on string
[1:48:47] RandomCat82: How old is this world?
[1:48:56] poptartf: i think mobs in carts still despawn
[1:49:02] susses: looks promising
[1:49:03] martyboy13: he put a sniper in there KEKW
[1:49:12] gart751: go higher
[1:49:12] furious851: sideways chain
[1:49:22] omarfrompalestine: yo
[1:49:22] poptartf: nevermind they dont
[1:49:27] lordpufferfishh: I think you should sacrifice the spawning space for a 3x3 hole
[1:49:29] crunchyrai: does string still work to hold stuff?
[1:49:29] hmmmMonkeyy: 3x3 is better i think
[1:49:31] Diggles11: 3x1 hole with the piglin in the middle maybe?
[1:49:38] donutboy13: hatsune miku :>
[1:49:39] NickelW: copy rays (unfathomably based)
[1:49:45] logan_the_gamer_guy: put piglen under?
[1:49:45] poptartf: suicidal piglin
[1:49:45] UrethraFranklin___: feel like you need a 3x3 hole so you can center the guy

[2:13:21] PenguinoTux: it would give you money, fame, power, xbox, etc
[2:13:24] electraminer: it probably wouldn't do anything that an update suppressor couldnt do, just like, easier
[2:13:29] iansonofthor_: You can use the debug stick on slabs to make them vertical
[2:13:34] lordgregory42: That hole is driving me nuts.
[2:13:35] Nydaxe: You should try skyfactory ant!
[2:13:38] AlexaYimnir: It's just a stick with every enchant
[2:13:42] Slowpooch: the three pillars of success money, fame , xbox
[2:13:48] P_Zero: you could get permapowered lightnight rods
[2:13:50] SaylorMimi: Sadly not, but if they add the stick to survival, might as well add vertical slabs too
[2:13:52] RiskOfTea2: The biggest thing IMO is to make armor stands with arms & pose data
[2:13:54] RandomCat82: Just tested it, debug stick doesn't work in survival
[2:13:56] thanos12345635: catJAM
[2:13:56] P_Zero: which are a waterloggable power source
[2:14:03] TrueDelta: Perma powered lighting rod could be a fancy redstone torch with the debug stick

[2:33:05] memeinspektor10: Hey
[2:33:06] 7sevenarrows: oh no?
[2:33:06] RiskOfTea2: @Zediax890 because the top needs walls, so he needs to make sure nothing gets stuck
[2:33:10] cardboardhed: I don't know what that thing is, but it has MY gold inside it so now I'm MAD
[2:33:15] memeinspektor10: Banger music

[2:34:23] EagleNumberOne: can't they fall down the back corners?
[2:34:29] purpledragon_pd: @winderain mobs cant spawn on blocks that damage them, so within a fortress area, only wither skeletons can spawn inside the wither roses. Then, the wither skeles are agressive to and move towards the piglin, where they fall down to be killed
[2:34:31] iansonofthor_: KEKW
[2:34:33] jazzygirl013: may your crops grow strong and beacons be many! huzzah!
[2:34:34] bean1e_b0i_: @poggers_73 videogame music is almost never copyrighted
[2:34:37] arrxstd: cant the wither skelles still fall from the backside of the piglin
[2:34:39] knoodler: the what?
[2:34:40] RiskOfTea2: would it be worth removing the two edge nether rack on the top layer, just to make sure it doesn't cause pathing issues, because it technically could be close enough to favor as a route?
[2:34:40] awsmrs: Madge that dang cjya copyright

[2:36:00] thsgrn: that looks fine yeah
[2:36:00] 7sevenarrows: ok
[2:36:06] RiskOfTea2: Will those two nether brick blocks on the top cause issues with pathing, because they allow mobs to get close to the piglin by route not over the hole?

[2:57:16] Nightbot: In a beta test build, the player would respawn with a stack of bookshelves, enchanting tables, end portal frames and end portal blocks so the devs could easily test their functions. That's why everything is built out of bookshelves and enchanting tables. smolWow

[2:59:51] jazzygirl013: life is complicated and then we tend to make it more complicated…
[2:59:53] Tackleman: depends on what the interest rate is for ... if it's for a regular loan 7% is good, if it's for a house 7% is bad
[2:59:54] ccause0: @maxthechillbot this is usually true
[2:59:54] poggers_73: smallant, i bet my friend some cash that u would read my message out loud, pls read it

[3:23:17] Nightbot: In a beta test build, the player would respawn with a stack of bookshelves, enchanting tables, end portal frames and end portal blocks so the devs could easily test their functions. That's why everything is built out of bookshelves and enchanting tables. smolWow

[4:20:38] jugardecisiveable: they effectively do absolutely nothing but theyre cool to have though
[4:20:43] the_lucky_artificer: they don’t spawn in most versions
[4:20:45] DeadNight_4: they give you a new experience of fighting them
[4:20:49] beefsurfer: Illusioners are neat. I remember when they were added in 1.12 thinking they were gonna be an awesome boss fight... and then Mojang never used them :(
[4:20:51] GabryKiane99: Didn't a guy found a dimension that spawns cave spiders on mushrooms blocks?

[4:22:26] Booperdooper443: infested stone from the enderman? from that weird update where they have every block?
[4:22:34] PyjamaMole: remi cats would most certainly lie

[4:23:06] ihncwmuni: are you planning on finishing more than half of this in this stream?
[4:23:07] beefsurfer: Could you just place blackstone in where a bastion would be in the seed for this world for a brute to spawn?
[4:23:12] jazardly: can you do the pushing blocks into unloaded chunks thing for elder guardian?
[4:23:18] dukeofburgerz: Chugging along!

[4:24:22] GabryKiane99: Oh no powdered snow trauma, again
[4:24:22] ayan0z: i eateted it sorry
[4:24:25] CapDeathWish: do you still have the powder farm?
[4:24:36] beefsurfer: Do piglin brutes even spawn? Because if so, yeah - you could probably find where a bastion spawns on the seed you're in and then build a blackstone platform there for brutes to spawn on, yeah?
[4:24:53] xswagsoldier70: help my balls feel off
[4:24:58] t0bsmashersss: how did you get elytra i wasn't here for that part
[4:24:59] michaelman3117: @beefsurfer brutes only spawn once
[4:25:00] kaimyop: how are you gonna get netherite
[4:25:01] kilatoss: thats not the advancement you're making
[4:25:02] DeadNight_4: brutes don't "spawn", they "generate"
[4:25:05] gutgyk123: @seaneyyyyyyyy wdym
[4:25:11] iansonofthor_: BAHBAH
[4:25:17] PyjamaMole: bwaaaagh

[4:25:22] jugardecisiveable: what a pleasant noise
[4:25:24] beefsurfer: So they generate with the world? In that case, the blackstone platform wouldn't work
[4:25:24] livipup: @xswagsoldier70 That sounds like something to ask a doctor about
[4:25:25] ShygalCoco: the opened end portal in skyblock with no ender eyes is so cursed

[4:26:25] Darkcool123: Is torturing the Enderman population like that not against Minecraft Monsters Rights?
