[3:35:36] lukasalbert: its like 40 hours of vids or more xD
[3:35:48] SairuNai: do his videos have the same editing style?
[3:35:50] Invalidm_: @faireplaie I'm pretty sure this pack was inspired by new horizon
[3:35:51] kisudawisu: why are you waiting so long to start the pack? i think the command said something about starting in 2 weeks?
[3:35:57] Allmostdone: Why were the people being so mean to each other?
[3:36:01] Larklen: So is Ci...Zack? KEKW
[3:36:01] gregcee: The modpack is about MASS destruction of friends

[3:37:12] psilentath: @psilentath lack of mobs, recipes defined, automation. i don't see it as hard. if you had to figure out the recipes, or the materials were locked behind skill-based challenge like combat or the such. long/complex != hard. it equals long and complex
[3:37:13] LidlFrog: NOTED

[3:44:34] DX_Plates: @sentient_pancakes Nah, Ci will handle that
[3:44:43] psilentath: saying RLCraft isn't as hard because things are too powerful, and a resource collection/ crafting/ automation w/out mobs is harder becuase recipes are complex and time consuming. i'm not saying rlcraft is good, but it is hard(early game), this modpack is time consuming
[3:44:53] BadLa: COPIUM

[3:46:55] DaddyDiddy: @UhWhatWellUhmm when the original owner stopped working on it, a team took over, and then the owner came back and didn't like the direction of the discord and pack, so they split and this is the result
[3:47:02] Asneakyninja1: no mobs at all?
[3:47:03] blickyglizz: any wildlife?
[3:47:10] phoss2k: are there towns in this modpack?
[3:47:14] Spacelicker: Well that makes it much less difficult without mobs
[3:47:15] Morey_ballstien66: you dont need food and there is no mobs?
