[0:29:42] CanYouDigIt7: HOPIUM
[0:29:44] brightcandle: Yes because debug is removed and optimisation is on
[0:29:45] BarryCarlyon: Finalize build removes all the debugging/console logging/etc
[0:29:46] punkgeek: Debug builds will include logging/etc that slows performance a bit
[0:29:47] Vandalayy: its running all the debug
[0:29:48] sogerr: COPIUM
[0:29:51] sneakyHoovy: COPIUM
[0:29:52] BarryCarlyon: And that shit is slow af
[0:29:56] staccatone: They probably have all the debug stuff enabled that takes resources
[0:29:57] cartloyal123: Its true, production builds are optimized to not include logging and debug stuff
[0:30:10] sneakyHoovy: COPIUM they will fix it
[0:30:22] brightcandle: But I also suspect it will still run poorly initially
[0:30:37] kenny_zk: The actual build is much more performant that the project itself, just by taking out the Game Engine itself

[1:18:45] YaBoiDreamy: Make a safety energy cell with redstone control to turn on in case of emergency
[1:18:51] SebastiaanO: upgrade dynamos to be safe for even longer?
[1:18:53] sp4wn999: cant wait for the solar panels
[1:18:54] SailorWS: mechoriet it was connected to the old system trying to drain the excess. He just had to connect the power back the the main system
[1:18:56] pinhead_larynx: might be good to create a diamond backup storage so you can restart the system in case

[1:20:23] aundros: Would it be an idea to build a battery to handle excess power, to act like a buffer if this happens again? @Giantwaffle
[1:20:28] Timiderxbox: You can hover diamond and it says how much it generates
[1:20:32] jmm548: leave the battery blocvk in a chest t hook up later if u ever run out

[1:21:16] HyperKitty_: ^ was going to say surely do that
[1:21:17] cjthedjdolphin: I mean there is a total energy a diamond makes and a max rate the power can be taken from it, from those you'd be able to calculate diamond usage per second

[1:30:11] sp4wn999: or get a hamster wheel and put Ci in it for more powah
[1:30:14] Gh3ttoboy: just place 1 max solar panel on every tile in the world infinite power

[1:30:35] Superswag3211: @Giantwaffle what do you need this for
[1:30:42] TheBonBon_: is solar any good?
[1:30:44] The_Stone_One: are there filters on the top inputs?
[1:30:44] jayrickson87: @deadgolfer I have 6+ different fission reactors (small ones) totaling 2.5 mil rf per tick
[1:30:46] kbigLiar: I think you left one uncrafted in the one terminal
[1:31:03] frainsbreeze: maybe a couple of extra ender DMLs as fail safe?
[1:31:06] 1StClassAlcoholic: waffleLily

[1:31:21] dcirusc30: is shulker matter going up or down ?

[1:54:02] banshay3: @ninopanda shhh all the popular kids like to hate on windows
[1:54:06] Nexhunter: @PureSpider AMD is relying upon the OS thread director yep
[1:54:17] PureSpider: "thread director" is an intel technology
[1:54:18] vexed_out: 8x wires look so puny compared to 16x KEKW
[1:54:24] PureSpider: amd i misunderstanding something?
[1:54:29] arkun_: Strange times
[1:54:29] Nexhunter: @PureSpider you bozo the clown did you not watch the AMD presser KEKW
[1:54:36] IlsaGold: Connect fluid?
[1:54:37] PureSpider: i did not
[1:54:37] Nexhunter: @PureSpider thread director is the MS name KEKW
[1:54:45] PureSpider: is it? DansGame
[1:54:48] Superswag3211: how will I know if windows 11 can do thread director?
[1:54:50] ninopanda: @banshay3 I use both windows and linux, win 11 runs perfectly everything i need.
[1:54:53] DX_Plates: @Larklen Our Mac guys had more issues with VMs after updates than the Windows crew did. One of the new Mac OS updates borked VirtualBox
[1:54:53] maimvice13: i heard that beffor new year i think "we are almost there"
[1:55:03] aundros: he ment connect your fluid interface
[1:55:07] Larklen: @DX_Plates oof
[1:55:10] IlsaGold: Connect on the back
[1:55:12] Nexhunter: @PureSpider but the new x3d 7900 and 7950 rely upon Microsoft to schedule threads onto the CCD with the extra cache using thread director
[1:55:24] ninopanda: @prostoseva1 english only
[1:55:25] PureSpider: Nexhunter yea it makes sense
[1:55:39] MisterRabbitHead: !bestmod
[1:55:41] Moobot: Invalidm_ knows that pineapple belongs on some pizzas. Moobot doesn't agree.
[1:55:41] Superswag3211: is te 7900x3d will be better then 13900k for gaming?
[1:55:47] prostoseva1: @ninopanda okay 🫡
[1:55:51] Nexhunter: @Superswag3211 depends if Microsoft doesn't fuck up
[1:55:54] PureSpider: Nexhunter does the 5000 series have the same issue?
[1:55:56] prostoseva1: Russkie est?
[1:55:58] MisterRabbitHead: @Moobot ew
[1:56:14] Nexhunter: @PureSpider no cause it was only 5800 and the 7800 wont have same issue due to being single CCD in general
[1:56:21] daedmissica0: @Giantwaffle did you see osrs got new boss today?
[1:56:32] LokiRulez: @Nexhunter MS not fucking something up...your dreaming lol
[1:56:36] PureSpider: Nexhunter gotcha danYes
[1:56:39] mechoriet: monkaS
[1:56:44] SyriiAdvent: when the pack is too fun
[1:56:45] arkun_: @nexhunter sorry, didn’t understand a word you said after “depends if Microsoft doesn’t” KEKW
[1:56:48] cjthedjdolphin: I dreamed about you playing minecraft
[1:56:52] lvyEartman: nice dreams, or nightmares?
[1:56:52] cjthedjdolphin: I'm in hell too
[1:56:54] Superswag3211: @Nexhunter you use windows 11?
[1:56:58] DragonApoc: Same lol
[1:57:01] Nexhunter: @LokiRulez KEKW that why im surprised AMD didn't build a thread director in hardware... Intel learned the hard way and updated raptor lake cause of it
[1:57:04] mechoriet: COPIUM will take off
[1:57:06] Tasar_: wind-down game at end of stream
[1:57:07] CoolReal: Temporary Pog

[1:57:49] LokiRulez: @Nexhunter AMD will learn the hardway as well
[1:57:57] mechoriet: pepeLaugh !!!Epoxy
[1:58:30] Superswag3211: I dont understand this thread director and stuff related to it
[1:58:57] kane1941: EP OMEGALUL XY
[1:59:15] jberk26: How tough is it to automate quests?
[1:59:23] chaoskub: Foil.
[1:59:52] RefiixGaming: @Nexhunter Didnt they already show that it is even 20%fps increase vs 13900k?
[1:59:56] Nexhunter: @Superswag3211 basically for the 7900 and 7950 they have two disconnected chiplets. Due to that only one chiplet has extra cache added in the x3d setup to save on money. So Microsoft has to direct work onto the correct chiplet to take advantage of that cache otherwise its a useless feature
[1:59:57] TheWonderLlama: PepegaCredit p2w pack
[2:00:08] Nexhunter: @RefiixGaming it was against their own stuff and internal testing means jack shit
[2:00:12] RefiixGaming: @Nexhunter Or is it pure BS and they didnt achieve that
[2:00:42] Nexhunter: @RefiixGaming we learned with the initial alder lake release that internal testing means jack shit when Microsoft has to push an update to the OS YEP
[2:00:45] lvyEartman: is there no other way to get vanadiium
[2:00:45] IlsaGold: Have we not lerned not to take short cuts?
[2:00:45] Superswag3211: @Nexhunter Thank you I appreciate the long message now I fully understand. :)
[2:00:50] PureSpider: if only we had standard, comparable benchmarks YEP
[2:00:52] LokiRulez: @RefiixGaming it was internal testing, which doesnt mean RW performance.
[2:01:10] kbigLiar: would it be good to increase that input hatch? you seem to manually dump invs worth in there periodically
[2:01:10] Moobot: Come join the Waffle House Discord! <# https://discord.gg/fhGFtMuzdS
[2:01:30] Nexhunter: also that means Win10 users who buy these higher end x3d chips will not get any performance boost cause Win10 doesn't have the thread director PepLaugh
[2:01:32] pinhead_larynx: find the final product and work backwards to remind yourself what you need
[2:01:38] RefiixGaming: Well I guess we will know on feb 14 4Head
[2:01:41] nick43087: monkaS @kbigLiar
[2:02:04] mechoriet: @Nexhunter pepeLaugh and ofc msft will not backport said changes
[2:02:07] LokiRulez: very true, you need win11 to take advantage of it, its not optimized what so ever in win10
[2:02:08] Superswag3211: @Nexhunter so I should update my pc?
[2:02:19] tomey36: Check if you can make the tiny phosphorus dust. Might be the only way to get it right now
[2:02:31] Nexhunter: @Superswag3211 if you are intent on going the 7900x3d you will need to move to 11 to take advantage of your chip to the fullest YEP
[2:02:40] Nexhunter: @mechoriet which is why raptor lake has an internal thread director KEKW
[2:02:47] Superswag3211: awww man
[2:02:52] deadgolfer: how many hours until the creative tank?
[2:03:01] b0ltz12: you might need to upgrade the power cables of the base to be able to have the throughput for the LuV
[2:03:01] daemonaedryn: COPIUM
[2:03:05] Superswag3211: @Nexhunter whats your pc specs cpu and gpu?
[2:03:06] primo_qwe: surely your power will enough to support that EBF
[2:03:07] daedmissica0: @deadgolfer 2025
[2:03:07] Nexhunter: and that just Windows talk just imagine trying to run linux widePepeLaugh
[2:03:07] hisdue: monkaMath
[2:03:07] mechoriet: COPIUM if no more sidequests arrise to the surface
[2:03:10] ikkarus01: What is the "win condition" of this pack?
[2:03:10] lvyEartman: 3 hours later of automating... very clos to LuV
[2:03:12] Timiderxbox: Should you just make 16A iv energy because cable is easy?
[2:03:13] LokiRulez: i refuse to move my gaming PC to win 11
[2:03:46] Nexhunter: @LokiRulez then you should avoid at all costs alder lake and the 7900 7950 x3d widePepeLaugh
[2:03:55] RefiixGaming: @Giantwaffle How did you solve that you produce 5.5diamonds and use about 10?
[2:04:06] b0ltz12: how much power does IV need? do your cable connections have enough throughput
[2:04:25] Dibbsu: Nerdge actually
[2:04:32] Superswag3211: !specs

[2:04:45] HyperKitty_: @RefiixGaming maths Okayge
[2:04:57] chaoskub: Power and liquid
[2:04:58] mechoriet: pepeLaugh when the E pepeD B pepeD F get booted tho

[2:05:18] Larklen: downgrade the drawer already?
[2:05:19] LokiRulez: @Nexhunter i dont trust MS as far as i can throw them lol
[2:05:32] arkun_: @lokirulez same
[2:05:37] Nexhunter: @LokiRulez then I would avoid going the x3d and just go pure 7950 KEKW
[2:06:02] Superswag3211: I would go i9-13900K

[2:13:12] Nexhunter: @LokiRulez but those benches are for testing with other components to ensure there isn't some weird bug with say a specific nvidia card
[2:13:32] Pati: you can remove the left two circuit assemblers
[2:13:37] Nexhunter: @LokiRulez something AMD seemingly didn't do before releasing which caused PCIe bugs with certain nvidia cards pepeLaugh
[2:13:56] Pati: they dont need a cleanroom and we are making them elsewhere

[3:33:34] PureSpider: chat, he'll have a small system just to make ludacris YEP
[3:33:46] Dagmoo: isnt the problem that if you dont automate some of these things then you arent really making progress? because you are going to have to go back and do it anyway later?
[3:33:49] frainsbreeze: today is not automation day chat. today is POGress day

[3:39:30] Sir_Darkstar: Yeah, i noticed that there was a brief silent part in yesterdays vod
[3:39:31] RafaLorenzo: @Cyberwire69 for that reason everyone should stop streaming
[3:39:31] pt0ughneigh: yeah the vod frog life is tough one
[3:39:45] IronGajeel: YEP Ball
[3:39:45] Moobot: Come join the Waffle House Discord! <# https://discord.gg/fhGFtMuzdS

[3:40:07] MechaDom: Only two MC songs were DMCA'd for a short while.  That's been cleared up
[3:40:09] Jaydepps00: and then the stream from 2 days ago doesn't even have the intro and outro muted KEKW
[3:40:12] ZodiacXi: @Cyberwire69 Monster Cat Music. All DMCA free.

[3:41:33] MisterRabbitHead: turbo ftw
[3:41:34] Intohimos: downgrade
[3:41:38] aundros: it really depends. Some websites still show you ads
[3:41:41] jezusnuts: ads get through my mobile ad block sometimes
[3:41:49] Koeckie: twitch is good at breaking add blocker
[3:41:50] RafaLorenzo: Adblocker user and 0 ads in vods and streams
[3:41:52] inforv: My adblock sucks on twitch lol
[3:41:56] AIex_0: twitch is good at getting past adblock these days
[3:41:59] daemonaedryn: mobile sucks ass, but sometimes you gotta use it
[3:42:05] IronGajeel: wtf mobile adblock? just use purpletv
[3:42:07] Tapollo: Tapollo subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 13 months! Here for the good vibes
[3:42:11] LsTheRoberto: I watch off my PS5 a lot, so I needed to get Turbo
[3:42:13] BroCreed1: Twitch is pretty aggressive with circumventing adblockers.
[3:42:18] jezusnuts: twitch tries their absolute hardest to get through ad block
[3:42:18] Dirtyharryce: jaibreak and no ads
[3:42:19] Hemry64_: Yeah Twitch is able to by pass UBlock Orogin even
[3:42:25] Funken_: get to pati

[3:42:34] OMICRON: the best trick on mobile is putting your device in airplane mode then you get no ads in games chevel3Hype
[3:42:36] splix661: some people have vods only seen by subs that sounds so weird for this platform
[3:42:38] rododendro: how much argon do you have in your system now? Kappa
[3:42:38] inforv: Ads on YT for TVs are horrendous
[3:42:38] Zenkas: Dont they do that
[3:42:39] ns0z: Adblockers seems to not always work.. I just got tired as fuck getting a million ads when opening a stream. So I just got turbo instead
[3:42:40] pt0ughneigh: they do dont they?
[3:42:40] IronGajeel: purpletv is twitch with 7tv+ffz with no ads
[3:42:40] AIex_0: they get past so many adblockers
[3:42:42] HyperKitty_: ublock origin is fine for me
[3:42:44] 0sem0: That is what they do
[3:42:45] willcj: i thought they did
[3:42:45] TheNamlit: I don't get any with ublock origin
[3:42:47] Jaydepps00: origin is fune
[3:42:48] Jaydepps00: fine*
[3:42:52] AIex_0: not on vods but streams
[3:42:52] daemonaedryn: Just download 10 different ad blocks KEKW
[3:42:56] SelIout_: im on ublock origin and i got an ad just before i clicked on this stream
[3:42:56] dylan0806: They do for big events
[3:42:58] Purecrew: Twitch Turbo fixes ad problems
[3:43:01] Yakobro: I was getting ads with ublock, have to use another extension to block them
[3:43:08] Hemry64_: Oh we're talking Vods. No yeah ad free with Vods
[3:43:08] TheSparMan: turbo is the best adblocker xD
[3:43:10] CyberrPickle: I get ads on vods and during streams with ublock
[3:43:12] jezusnuts: @Purecrew but its not free :)
[3:43:14] Atzgee: Only one you need is ublock origin
[3:43:16] Arbszy: ublock origin has been great, but sometimes something slips through some how.
[3:43:17] ninopanda: @dylan0806 x to doubt
[3:43:18] fbritoferreira: Twitch used ad smart which embeds the add in the video stream so it looks like a normal video feed
[3:43:19] Peeeeeeeeeep: twitch has been working on blocking ad blockers. there's other extensions that can block it though
[3:43:19] Zenkas: You'll never catch me paying twitch money for turbo
[3:43:23] ZentilBlight: get TTV lol  works easy
[3:43:24] GameDadel: @giantwaffle can you run an ad so we can test our adblocks? PogChamp
[3:43:32] NemesisXKL: @Purecrew wow another sub model in between the other 1231231 quadrillion

[3:43:57] pt0ughneigh: @GameDadel Corpa Clap
[3:44:11] kane1941: At least you can just auto input it with + and not fill in manually
[3:44:19] Spirevipp: if yall didnt know, ublock origin have several different strictness settings, default is pretty lenient
[3:44:21] Zenkas: @MechaDom I use someone elses Jebaited Jebaited
[3:44:27] Purecrew: I spend 8+ hours a day with a twitch stream up and running on my second monitor while im either working or relaxing. Paying for no ads on the entire site on any stream I watch is worth it
[3:44:29] MisterRabbitHead: member when ad-free viewing was a part of prime? rooOld
[3:44:33] urh111: lol i have no ad block and i dont get adds i just set up my cokies so i dont get adds on twitch )
[3:44:58] DX_Plates: Advertising AdBlockers in chat is a bad idea mmmkay
[3:45:04] jezusnuts: or just use ad block lol works the same
[3:45:07] ninopanda: @sevn7th lets not post that in twitch chat
[3:45:08] jezusnuts: except on mobile
[3:45:20] IronGajeel: @jezusnuts use purpletv

[3:45:43] DareDeFlug: Nah
[3:45:44] jdog0616: lmfao im using it rn
[3:45:45] Sandiro1: Not for me
[3:45:46] daemonaedryn: You need an extensions for ublock i think
[3:45:47] maccabeus: you are literally wrong
[3:45:47] trabadam: YEP it works
[3:45:47] ninopanda: @CyberrPickle then it is not set up correctly
[3:45:49] BroCreed1: You have to add scripts for unlock
[3:45:52] GGoodGGuy: just install and it works

[3:45:55] gifmeabreak: Edge superior

[3:46:21] ApexHolland: ApexHolland subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 10 months! 
[3:46:24] BMYGRLFRND: if you see ads in twitch while using UBlock Origin you're doing something wrong
[3:46:24] destroyerx97: AchkaeL yo send me the filter list :)
[3:46:31] 1StClassAlcoholic: I'm on the brave browser. It automatically blocks all ads on twitch
[3:46:32] Peeeeeeeeeep: ublock origin is hit or miss on twitch. twitch has been trying to fight it. It works for some but not others
[3:46:35] ninopanda: @CyberrPickle google it please
[3:46:38] DemonsDawn: or you downloaded the wrong ublock
[3:46:48] ApexHolland: Anyone else think the FFA issue was a cyber attack? hmm
[3:46:54] RoyalTL: I use AdBlock
[3:46:57] jezusnuts: ttv lol is way better than ublock origin anyway. thats what i use

[3:47:33] DX_Plates: KISS
[3:47:33] IAmJester: systems still running on COBOL or some shit.
[3:47:36] aundros: Both seem realistic
[3:47:38] TheNothingness: it's software written like 30 years ago
[3:47:39] Arbszy: out of date tech prbly
[3:47:39] tomey36: Tech debt in gov systems?!!!
[3:47:42] 1StClassAlcoholic: governments with tech debt???? NO WAY
[3:47:44] Tabakhase: its roots are from 1924 or so KEKW
[3:47:45] SelIout_: good looks on the ublock scripts for twitch! i had no idea, i just assumed it didnt work on twitch

[3:47:46] Koristbuh: Future Farmers of America KKona
[3:47:49] DrHax_: @fbritoferreira just fyi adnauseam is NOT a privacy addon, it still connects you to ad/tracking domains, unlike ublock origin
[3:47:49] Kuroiorb: LUL southwest
[3:47:49] TheUsefulDistraction: Most likely the second, infra is getting torn to shreds because of lack of investment
[3:47:53] deadgolfer: just have chatGPT re-write it all, easy
[3:47:53] DatSparrow: I just find it a bit odd there was no backup system if it wasn't a cyber attack, but who knows @Giantwaffle
[3:47:55] msfWEBdude: probably windows 98 computer with a dial up modem and a pentium
[3:48:01] jdog0616: canadian goverment hired 200+ COBOL programmers when COVID hit cuz the healthcare site melted
[3:48:02] GuardMoony: Sounds like y2k all over again :D

[3:48:39] Shounanek: @Giantwaffle i work as a travel agent for Amaozn corporate it was a nightmare KEKW
[3:48:39] Sir_Darkstar: The government is still tied to really old systems, a lot of people would be shocked. I mean, when you get tape drives when you request something, you realize how bad it is.
[3:48:53] DX_Plates: Occam's Razor - The simplest answer is most likely the correct one.
[3:48:56] Allmostdone: COBOL is the bomb. No literally its the bomb
[3:48:56] Purecrew: I mean I have insider information on that because I work for the software company that works with FAA on many different levels.
