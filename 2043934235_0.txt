[0:45:47] hgsmallz: idk how that worked

[0:48:21] Vallowz: @Ferb879 oh probably
[0:48:23] djchampion4116: it could have been theobald guy who tnt minecarts in hoplite (not sure though)

[0:48:55] djchampion4116: there was sky above you I think
[0:48:58] Lipthulip: not even a minute has passed
[0:49:30] djchampion4116: @Lipthulip you don't need time to tnt minecart if you are really good at it
[0:49:30] Lipthulip: wait
[0:49:32] Vallowz: maybe you just spontaneously combusted and thats that :tf:
[0:49:36] Lipthulip: maybe you were entity crammed
[0:49:43] Ferb879: @Lipthulip by what lol
[0:49:47] djchampion4116: @Lipthulip there is a kit in which u can get it
[0:49:53] djchampion4116: @Lipthulip not possible
[0:50:00] Lipthulip: it looked like he was spamming something
[0:50:15] Lipthulip: like when you spam tnt minecrafts idk
[0:50:19] Lipthulip: but that would give you the deaht message
[0:51:05] Lipthulip: yeah you had to of been entity crammed its the only way to get the death message
[0:51:13] Lipthulip: anvil will say in chat if you die to it
[0:51:29] Lipthulip: it would have said "squished by a falling anvil"
[0:51:30] djchampion4116: @Lipthulip but how ?
[0:51:32] kitcantfrost: LMAOAOOA U WILL BAN HG BUT NOT ME W

[0:52:15] djchampion4116: yes it is
[0:52:22] djchampion4116: but how though
[0:52:26] Lipthulip: it would say squashed if in anvil
[0:52:27] jayrosadori_: goodnight chat i might be back later if i cant sleep
[0:52:33] Lipthulip: but this one said squished
[0:52:35] jayrosadori_: 🥱
[0:52:51] jayrosadori_: hope everyone has a nice day/night
[0:53:23] kitcantfrost: yea it was entity LOL
[0:53:53] Saberknightlive: good morning
[0:53:54] djchampion4116: "<player> was squished too much" this is the msg for cramming
[0:54:07] Lipthulip: squished to death
[0:54:14] Lipthulip: sqaushed is the anvil one
[0:54:25] raenavolante: <player> was squished too much Appears when the player is killed by the maxEntityCramming gamerule. <player> was squashed by <player/mob> Appears when the player is hurt by a player or mob then killed by the maxEntityCramming gamerule.
[0:54:26] Vallowz: thats so weird wtf

[0:56:47] Ferb879: duh
[0:57:03] Lipthulip: i think the most likely cases are dripstone or some weird entity cramming thing
[0:57:35] raenavolante: stalagmite kill says “impaled by stalagmite”
[0:57:48] Lipthulip: yeah that would make sense
[0:57:56] raenavolante: and “skewered”
[0:58:08] raenavolante: which is weird that the death message didn’t say that
[0:58:13] Fraudfrost: Taylor Swift, Kendrick Lamar - Bad Blood
