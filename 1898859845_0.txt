[0:14:58] bojadoo: whats yogscinema"2"? Did they fix the bug where the videos always freeze
[0:15:15] JaffaMod: We're now going for an ad break that will last up to 5 minutes. Make sure you subscribe ( twitch.tv/yogscast/subscribe ) to not see them anymore!
[0:15:44] oregonmandave: oregonmandave subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 11 months! Yay!!!
[0:16:41] T2Needles: @bojadoo 2 has been a thing ever since they revamped Cinema to vote using a UI rather than voting in chat.
[0:16:52] republicofpixels: damn cinema started early today
[0:16:55] T2Needles: !howtovote @bojadoo
[0:16:56] JaffaMod: @bojadoo > YogsCinema 2.0 is here! To vote use the new Twitch extension. On PC you will find it below the stream: https://imgur.com/a/VGQG8N1 and on some mobile devices you'll see a small box above chat called 'YogsCinema'
[0:17:08] JaffaMod: While we're offline, check out: shadowatnoon playing Minecraft: 🌸minecraft all advancements w/ @meloncolliee over at twitch.tv/shadowatnoon !
[0:17:23] RadicalLynx: @republicofpixels testing if the voting works
[0:17:44] T2Needles: NODDERS this is still just a test, it may still not work properly and be shut down
[0:17:45] RadicalLynx: @bojadoo it's been called that for a while now
[0:20:22] bojadoo: ah thanks guys. i guess i never paid attention to the 2 in the name. probably just hoping the freezes were fixed

[0:29:55] Nightjar: Nope, no luck. Automatic voting should've started by now.
[0:30:08] Nightjar: I'll set the vote up so you can have one more video after this, then I'll shut it down
