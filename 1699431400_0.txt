[1:06:48] matori666: oh, right, there you had 2 fluids
[1:06:52] Smithy1294: it broke it in the distillery i think yeah
[1:06:52] Flobu_: liquid filter is only neede because of two different fluids
[1:06:55] Amraki: mods, can i paste twitch clip?
[1:06:56] Surge43: You only need a filter if you have 2 fluids
[1:07:01] Amraki: related to this topid

[1:09:27] kaasrondje: Just throw 2k clay in the system
[1:09:28] jordan2185: You have 1000+ pulsating dust in the top draws
[1:09:28] dennixfailalot: @Zapper_777 old school ham but pepperoni also sounds good
[1:09:29] Larklen: HUH
[1:09:33] PureSpider: is your lube water based?
[1:09:45] Smithy1294: empty half of the enderchest to kick start the me system?
[1:09:46] matori666: @smokymtnred where's the lube when you need it?

[1:14:56] DarkKnghtt58: @novaht Use the energy converter block
[1:14:57] TigerLuv: Theyvel_ I am old, not stupid LMAO
[1:15:00] ShionSinX: @TigerLuv if your life is yours, you are free to get drunk if you want to?
[1:15:04] Smithy1294: @novaht just connect enderio cables from RF dynamo into a gregtech converter
[1:15:15] kane1941: expand your existing setup?
[1:15:16] Larklen: pepeSmoke
[1:15:18] KritterIsBack: if it's a closed loop it kinda makes sense
[1:15:21] kaaniimani: @TigerLuv HAHAHA, even better. Then you know where your limit is!
[1:15:24] kaasrondje: Just cleared it

[1:15:28] kaasrondje: NotLikeThis
[1:15:30] PureSpider: this is now a clathrate stream
[1:15:34] Tapeman83: Once you get to IV or LuV (idr), a single alloy smelter that constantly makes polymer clay is sufficient
[1:15:42] TigerLuv: @TigerLuv yes but I am old enough not to want the after affects :D
[1:15:46] woodlaphroaig: Don't you want a separate system so that you can never eat all resources in the main system?
[1:16:04] TPells67: Use one of the empty areas
[1:16:05] Koeckie: 2 set ups?

[1:16:27] Larklen: but what about the wood waffleEE
[1:16:30] Novaht: @smithy1294 @darkknghtt58 how do I do that? Like I have the converter I just need the cables for it but I can't figure out what cables
[1:16:30] kaaniimani: @TigerLuv Oh you've reached that age, sorry for your loss
[1:16:37] Oyelander: !mc_pack
[1:16:47] frainsbreeze: make a completely separate setup for DMLs including enderpearls. it'll be easier to debug if something goes wrong
[1:16:52] BronzKneeeCap: we've abandoned the wood pepeSmoke
[1:16:54] Einar88: set up a separate enderman DML for the pulse clay?,
[1:16:55] MagnesiumOxide: Use two drawers and put a storage bus on one of them that way you have an "overflow"
[1:16:55] Smithy1294: @novaht cant remember what they are called but its something conduit
[1:17:02] Purecrew: What is that ticking noise
[1:17:04] greggarry: make an Isolated and integrated system
[1:17:05] TigerLuv: @TigerLuv LUL I am not, I had a lot of great memories along the way
[1:17:06] Tapeman83: Ngl, what I did was have an alloy smelter passively crafting polymer clay, then an export bus into a normal chest that fed into my sim chambers, since it would only craft more clay when the chest had space
[1:17:07] GFQPR1882: Can  u just  level emit everything
[1:17:20] lukasalbert: what are you trying to do ?
[1:17:22] kaasrondje: Put a stack of clay just in the enderman chambers
[1:17:23] Novaht: @smithy1294 is it the conductive iron conduit?
[1:17:25] DarkKnghtt58: @novaht You can use enderio conduits to go into it (conductive iron etc.) and then use the super conductor wires to come out (also conductive iron is first one you'll have access to)
[1:17:28] TPells67: Make it separate
[1:17:28] kingjord: And If you use a separate room you can upsize it instead of just using one machine
[1:17:36] daemonaedryn: YEP
[1:17:37] Smithy1294: @novaht probably if you're just starting out yeah
[1:17:38] kakiewakie_: Smort
[1:18:04] TPells67: YES 🙌
[1:18:05] brenner1265: Isnt that what yall were doing before?
[1:18:16] Novaht: Okay so I use it for the  dynamo to the converter and it's not working @smithy1294 @darkknghtt58

[1:19:07] DarkKnghtt58: @novaht Make sure the conduit going from the dynamo to the converter isn't going into the converter's output side (yellow square iirc). It should fill the converter then
[1:19:14] jdude20202: Just make a separate row for enderpearls
[1:19:15] lvyEartman: cant you use a level emitter to only let the overflow of enderpearls go the rest
[1:19:23] GuardMoony: As long if you're prio are set correctly it will work
[1:19:38] frainsbreeze: that makes more sense. easier to debug for future waffle
[1:19:40] Surge43: waffleEE
[1:19:46] cmmeth: waffleEE
[1:19:49] Smithy1294: @novaht you connecting to the top of the dynamo (the glowing red bit) into any of the sides of the converter that have multiple dots not the single dot
[1:19:49] splix661: @novaht the dot is the output the 5 othersides are input
[1:19:52] TigerLuv: I love pictionary
[1:19:53] fapohogu: use the overflow system, its what I said before have the usable me system use only the overflow
[1:19:56] TPells67: Isolate it seperatly into two different places
[1:19:56] Novaht: @darkknghtt58 ohhhhhhhh okay I may need to add you on discord to see if you can help me depending on whenever you can
[1:20:07] dcjrracing11: Can’t you just put a storage bus on the overflow drawer?

[1:20:59] sneakyHoovy: MONKERS

[1:24:05] MagnesiumOxide: can't you just use the ME system priorities to simplify this?
[1:24:07] GFQPR1882: just make 3 of everything 4Head
[1:24:13] lvyEartman: shouldnt power be stand alone?
[1:24:15] CoolAcid: I might also suggest a crate of raw materials not connected as a backup to restart the system?
[1:24:22] TPells67: You need to make enderpearls to make diamonds, polymer clay, and resonant ender
[1:24:46] GuardMoony: and diamond overflow towards main storage?
[1:24:51] MaverickSpore: MaverickSpore subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 38 months, currently on a 31 month streak! Nah this thing lyin... I was at like 10 months like 2 weeks ago, I swear!! monkaCozy

[1:25:44] xxxsuperman34: looks good boss
[1:25:45] IlsaGold: Yeah this is way to complex imo

[2:33:39] SeaOfMadness_: make the productionline design flat so you can scale it up into a tower
[2:34:04] TelRehiad: @stickman_02 it doesn't really need to be. storage bus on drawers instead of drives. and can then have a 2nd storage bus from the original ME. doesn't matter. he's decided.
[2:35:10] frainsbreeze: check for chunk boundary for multismelter

[2:51:53] headtr1ck: higher prio for clay and quartz?
[2:51:55] msfWEBdude: does this pack have a void dimension? hrmmm

[2:51:58] b0ltz12: what is the point of round robin, if you prioritize?
[2:52:00] frainsbreeze: round robin is useless then?

[3:16:33] Stormflare: its such a small majority it doesnt take many to stop it up
[3:16:40] xelijahj: This whole election poses a good question: is the definition of insanity not going the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result? \
[3:16:42] roguetrooper2: only in the usa
[3:16:43] thenaylander: imagine if in any of our jobs we took 1.5 hrs per vote and kept voting to decide on something
[3:16:43] Thalmize: it was 20 now to 6
[3:16:47] brewerdc: Down to 6

[3:17:07] Dagmoo: eventually with democrats are gonna make a deal with repubs or repubs will eventually make a deal with themselves
[3:17:09] woodlaphroaig: I still don't know why they keep voting if they have not gotten guarentees that the 20 will change their vote
[3:17:10] ImNotDonut_: arent the republicans voting trump as a joke? lol
[3:17:12] Stormflare: @Kjoelby lol plenty of euro countries have the same thing with forming a government

[3:17:30] atamala: oh it was definitely expected lol
[3:17:33] dahntat: But it is good and it is what we need to do... that is why our govt was set up this way....
[3:17:38] b0ltz12: that being said, if the opposition votes in favour for whatever reason, then it can succeed with the majority party being more split
[3:17:39] lazyhot: In belgium we are used to that, we voted and then political majority forming a gouverment took 1.5j before we had a new gouvernement.
[3:17:40] bugsplatter23: Speaker doesnt have to be a member of congress either

[3:18:52] GuardMoony: The longest formation talks in the EU was 208 days
[3:18:56] CanadianHealthCare: McCarthy got the freedom caucus on his side

[3:36:37] lukasalbert: it makes it go faster but you dont need that for glass i think ?
[3:36:51] Sentinel1_9: coils dont change speed power does
[3:37:02] blizzardmagic: cant you make a toolbox so you you can do maintenance in one go all the time
[3:37:02] Sentinel1_9: coils just change temp and what you can smelt
[3:37:03] CommanderUrsus: yeah I thought it was for EBF
[3:37:11] GuardMoony: the coils decide what it can smelt. The power how fast
[3:37:18] lukasalbert: @Sentinel1_9 they dont in this ? normal nomi had a thing saying coils change the multiplyer of items smelted
[3:37:25] yonikasz2: is this a new smelting system?
[3:37:26] ninopanda: @AleXanDreMau oh i will
[3:37:28] Yakobro: @Giantwaffle coils definitely increase multismelter, better coils process more items
[3:37:38] lukasalbert: on an EBF its the temp but the multi smelter ?
[3:37:52] AleXanDreMau: @ninopanda Nice!
[3:38:15] Flobu_: wasnt there a problem with NBT with the clatherite?
[3:38:16] InternetPlumber: max temp doesn't mean faster heating. just like velocity isn't the same as acceleration

[3:43:51] baconburgerfries: bingKiss
[3:43:53] owl_guardian: just tear apart the old system for loot fabs
[3:43:59] TheNamlit: @Giantwaffle Don't forget to chunkload that area, it just said you're in the "Wilderness"
[3:43:59] Sentinel1_9: or
[3:44:04] pinhead_larynx: filter is probably better than trying to mess with all the colors
[3:44:04] Traverus98: make a buffer chest then export from that with a color
[3:44:05] deadgolfer: just use another output, and filter on the ouput side
[3:44:07] WARHERO322: Or extract from the controller on a diff color
[3:44:07] OhTick: pull out of other side of controller?
[3:44:08] Viviids: yea input top and output wherever
[3:44:09] Kcd23: should automate the fabricators and chambers because you will need to add to the system throughout playing
[3:44:10] bluedeed: Different side
[3:44:11] Yakobro: they can only take clay in the top, and only clay, you shouldn't need a filter?
[3:44:15] Flobu_: you could go from the drawer directly
[3:44:15] bluedeed: Of controller
[3:44:16] dylan0806: Why not filter the extract
[3:44:16] her0zer0: can't you just extract on a different color on the bottom?
[3:44:21] Sentinel1_9: @Giantwaffle just take out from another side of the drawer system with a color
[3:44:25] Soul12eaver: can you filter clay into a drawer and then have it go out to the system from that drawer?
[3:44:29] officialhunterx: loot fabs dont need pulsating
[3:44:30] Koeckie: can't you output one more time with an other color? @Giantwaffle
[3:44:32] The_Holas: clay is not for fabricators ... Waffle
[3:44:33] InternetPlumber: you could use a buffer chest to split the top input conduit
[3:44:33] DynamixBoon: You could extract from the drawer on an new channel
[3:44:34] KingPuller: Just do another extraction on drawer that only pull polymer clay
[3:44:36] officialhunterx: only simulation chamber
[3:44:39] deadgolfer: instead of filter the input side, filter the output side
[3:44:44] GuardMoony: set prio
[3:44:51] DynamixBoon: fair enough :)
[3:44:51] The_Holas: clay is not for fabricators ... @Giantwaffle
[3:45:04] DragonApoc: You could ME the clay into the fabricators
[3:45:18] officialhunterx: its only sim chambers need pulsating
[3:45:18] Koeckie: do one more output, use a different color for the clay and filter the output of the controller @Giantwaffle
[3:45:25] lazyhot: simulation chambers only accept pulsating clay from top, so you don't need to filter that input.
[3:45:33] tomey36: Isn’t the priority backwards?
[3:45:37] JonnyL: monkaHmm
[3:45:44] deadgolfer: doesn't pristine matter go in there? no the clay

[5:05:32] Kcd23: @ThatOnneGuy gregtech has like 20 versions, as well as having 3 or 4 versions of nomifactory/ omnifactory, the book has been pretty good for me for learning everything specific the this pack though
[5:05:38] ThatOnneGuy: yonikasz2 ^ there's your answers lol

[5:10:41] suicidebolt: Isn't that because the cards to insert take a pulsating mess
[5:10:45] sccrfreak: buy uranite
[5:10:45] Moobot: You can find Waffle's Youtube channel here - https://youtube.com/giantwaffle
[5:10:54] Schutter07: Any chance you have uranite? You can melt that into pulsating dust
[5:10:57] DarkKnghtt58: what about uraninite?
[5:10:59] NemesisXKL: huh isnt it basicly 1:1 then
[5:11:03] boogerbomb01: He was accused so he retired from streaming
[5:11:12] jordan2185: Is there any left upstairs ?
[5:11:14] KnightofObv: don't you have a load upstairs now you are not using the polymer clay?
[5:11:17] Invalidm_: @Eagelspp I would suggest you google it to understand it better, rather than ask chat
[5:11:39] Flobu_: did you already took the othe sim chambers of the other room?
[5:11:58] pinhead_larynx: can you go from clay "ingots" to dust
[5:11:59] kaasrondje: Can you take the clay from downstairs to start backing everything up
[5:12:17] Eagelspp: will do my b
[5:12:26] Nahkurii: its the price we pay to have the game play itself
[5:12:34] Sentinel1_9: @Giantwaffle you probably have enderpearls backed up for the diamonds in power room
[5:12:35] Eagelspp: just saw the minecraft and thought of him
[5:12:38] Traverus98: just turn off the multi smelter and the pulsating dust will accumulate rather than turning off extract
[5:12:50] shinycar: Don’t you still have some left over simulation chambers in with the dynomos?
[5:12:53] xTOT3Nx: 1 stack?? dont you need 256 @Giantwaffle

[5:13:01] Flobu_: setup loot chambers while you waiting?
[5:13:27] SailorWS: that could cause an issue if it puts carbon and charcoal dust in at the same time
[5:13:32] Zucate: didnt pati want you to use charcoal?
[5:13:38] Gashlex: calling it now he is going to run out of string in that and it puts both in

[5:54:37] aleksa_nbg: i am new to this mod, do you have any suggestion what videos to watch to batter understand it.
[5:54:38] Traverus98: these ones should maybe be prio -1 since the items are less important?
[5:54:51] Bulltank: @aleksa_nbg Deep Mob Learning, or this modpack?

[6:02:14] her0zer0: if you need all the types of thermal for nether stars, probably going to need more thermal stim chambers
[6:02:26] frainsbreeze: yoink it out

[6:02:32] Domnonos: why not yoink some
[6:02:32] Shank_nasty: Grab a stack
[6:02:35] Sentinel1_9: why did pati turn off the output @Giantwaffle Kappa
[6:02:52] GuardMoony: it needs to fill the prio lines first
[6:03:24] frainsbreeze: enderpearl dust macerator
[6:03:30] Purecrew: Remember with the pristine guardian thing it will not put the pristine data into the loot fabricator unless it is designated to make an item
[6:03:36] pinhead_larynx: does the clay system need storage upgrdes
[6:03:44] bar10dr: KEKW
[6:03:55] Amraki: @Giantwaffle maybe put chest at start of each row (ideally for each type) to give round-robin a chance to work better
[6:03:59] Daryl_Kay: Pati woke up and chose violence
