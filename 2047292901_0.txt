[0:42:52] jammanty: yeet them back into a cactus. nice
[0:43:24] tsukkana: one piece the series of all time. the most characters ever. love is stored in these characters along with excellent social commentary and writing and story arcs.
[0:43:35] ggTessic: Is sky vaults harder than regular  vault hunters?
[0:43:36] tsukkana: if you havent read/watched one piece you absolutely should

[0:46:41] vadskamanta: OMEGALUL Sam
[0:47:01] tsukkana: if anyone watching is bugged by the pacing later on, theres a fan project thats editing episodes together to better match the manga pacing! irs called one pace if you look it up. it fixes a lot of pacing issues
[0:47:28] Thirdeyechakra69: skypeia is good in retrospect but a lot of people used to just say skip it
[0:47:28] edawt: @samwich1991 hbomb94What

[1:09:57] blackwidowdps: @BigFlameWolf its means 400x dmg and 200x health on mobs
[1:10:02] BigFlameWolf: @CaptainJasshands He's playing hardcore, so unaliving = world loss. Fragged is a VH setting that makes mobs a lot stronger and gives them a lot more health. Sky Vaults puts you on an island at the start; raw vaults are free let you get vanilla resources.
[1:10:15] BigFlameWolf: @blackwidowdps I think you have some extra 0s.

[1:12:50] BigFlameWolf: @blackwidowdps No, but they're stronger than normal because of fragged difficulty. He can usually only take 2-3 hits.
[1:13:01] cptcinnabunny: @BigFlameWolf Think you should get arrested anywhere for it
[1:13:12] blackwidowdps: @blackwidowdps i know. its crazy
[1:13:20] tyto13alba: i've missed the hardcore streams peepoHappy
[1:13:25] BigFlameWolf: @cptcinnabunny They use the value for theft as the basis for it, and $20 is the lowest for theft here.
