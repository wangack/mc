[0:48:18] Shadowbounty: They made it casual and accessible to everyone
[0:48:23] DarkSpooon: I mean an easter egg is some little "thing" you find. It's not really a chain of events. That would be a quest like you said.

[0:48:29] Joshuapetch: I think the cutscene was good
[0:48:34] dystav: Yea, easter eggs are like "look at this pixel for 10 seconds and then do a 360 and a rabbit will spawn"
