[0:13:56] Spirevipp: https://github.com/screepers/screeps-typescript-starter is a nice screeps starter template
[0:14:03] Allmostdone: build process is almost different process than coding
[0:14:04] BANNIS: @crimpymaple No. Waffle said he would need a good reason to stream using the racing rig. So I asked if the new F1 game would be a good reason :)
[0:14:05] Orin_The_Sly: How long must One BE a "Person" to no longer be considered"New"?
[0:14:23] Tylerbuell16: what have you been doing on minecraft lately?
[0:14:31] Tech: The thing that makes it difficult is other than that, you can just dive into a project and learn things as you go. To set up a project, you have to understand everything before doing anything.

[0:36:17] aundros: Yes
[0:36:17] haitham506: NA Wood houses N OMEGALUL
[0:36:18] Grilledminer: very few people would make it through the immediate impact, and less the following weeks
[0:36:19] Kyjjen: human can barely handle a power outage KEKW
[0:36:20] Ruan_A: @Larklen LUL
[0:36:21] Mandorake: @Giantwaffle your power just went out and its only like 100 out.
[0:36:21] NoodledPanda: i boill at 30c already KEKW
[0:36:21] ruccoa: humans as a species would probably make it, but not us personally
[0:36:25] Hunterwar: inside you house you are dead
[0:36:25] mephisto__ttv: just the fire alone...
[0:36:25] Fxwz: hide in the shower
[0:36:26] AleXanDreMau: @Giantwaffle texas power grid hill die in 1 milisecond
[0:36:26] Nexhunter: no one house would survive

[0:36:48] DrymSP: @Jeylists fridge don't work at 200degre
[0:36:51] Jeylists: We would survive as a species, houses are a no go, windows let everything through if not destroyed by falling debris
[0:36:52] Becky15675: about 400F
[0:36:53] golden_canadian: I would grab my scuba equipment and sit at the bottom of my lake for an hour
[0:36:54] DaGMC: your house would just burn

[0:37:10] Humphr3y: wouldn't it burn the oxygen in the air
[0:37:11] MasterBelial: Most people are inside buildings. They would absorbed most of the heat, they would catch fire, but the heat would dissipate before it got too bad.
[0:37:17] daemonaedryn: New apocalypse movie idea YEP
[0:37:18] Nexhunter: @Giantwaffle the best 3m foam tape for heat applications is up to 200c KEKW
[0:37:19] outofpizza: It would take longer than a few minutes to heat up houses
[0:37:23] aman36000: @Giantwaffle Ironically enough, your best bet would be to get in your oven. Since they are just big insulators
[0:37:25] DaGMC: rotating bbq
[0:37:36] deviantdeviations: there's MORE?!
[0:37:38] WilliamWeist: blood boil at around 100c, no way we survive 2min at 200c
[0:37:38] subfin: @aur1so relative to 200c, antarctica isn't much colder than anywhere else
[0:37:41] golden_canadian: @mandorake water wouldn’t heat that fast at 60ft deep

[0:44:32] Nexhunter: we are 200k in and already tried to end humanity twice PogChamp
[0:44:33] Grave110: points
[0:44:36] daemonaedryn: YEP Humanity kills itself
[0:44:38] AshhanX: an astroid of the same magnitude could come tomorrow, or never
[0:44:39] Becky15675: there's tons of space debris and rocks falling to earth every year
[0:44:43] daemonaedryn: Dieing with a whimper
[0:44:46] Mandorake: humans are like cockroaches.  very adaptable
[0:44:49] Nexhunter: too late KEKW
[0:44:51] KABBL: like the roman empire
[0:44:52] qoob: MONKERS
[0:44:53] Mash_Tactics: We'll almost certainly see it ahead of time. We won't be surprised by an asteroid overnight.
[0:45:00] TheMelodicMuse: If we're lucky enough to still be here and advanced enough, we might have a way to stop the next big one
[0:45:03] Klorell: interstellar?
[0:45:06] helios34: or we go extint completely
[0:45:08] Phelnax: Phelnax subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 60 months! 
[0:45:19] Hunterwar: there's a game called neo scavenger that the plot is about earth slowly killing itself with stupid decisions
[0:45:21] pikabuhhh: very bearish on human curve
[0:45:27] Wulthan_: Please get your harvester out of my area, its bugged on my energy source DansGame @Giantwaffle
[0:45:29] Chronoes: Dogecoin didn't go to the moon, the moon came to Dogecoin
[0:45:35] Becky15675: not if I have anything to do with it. ENGAGE THE METEOR REDIRECTOR!
[0:45:44] helios34: interstellar travel is way toooooo far for us atm
[0:45:44] ssidii: but even if we detect a big asteroid, we can really deflect or destroy it yet
[0:45:45] peemoa: It’s like throwing a 2mm pebble at a marble and trying to hit it from like 100 ft
[0:45:52] helios34: we're not even close to travel interstellar
[0:45:54] sliderspy: We can survive on Mars
[0:45:58] Nexhunter: god dammit UPS stop delivering to businesses near me get to my package already mehdiREE
[0:46:03] AshhanX: our most likely downfall is disease
[0:46:06] daemonaedryn: Its crazy when you realise IRL is easy mode on plague inc KEKW
[0:46:09] AshhanX: we were almost wiped with the black plague
[0:46:14] mr_25eight: Watching Waffle play MC brings me back about 8 years ago when I first started watching Twitch :O
[0:46:20] dotphantom: Any amazing changes in this new version @giantwaffle ?

[0:46:29] CurlySC: I feel "Idocrazy" isnt far away widePepeLaugh
[0:46:33] Spirevipp: @Wulthan_ make an attacker and kill it 😈
[0:46:47] VoylRL: @nexhunter I work at ups I am there now loading there planes :)
[0:46:48] Moobot: Come join the Waffle House discord https://discord.gg/G5FeeveP3c and chat with the community! Remember to link your Twitch account in the Settings (gear) > Connections for subscriber channels.
[0:46:49] peemoa: So true
[0:46:59] Battokage: km/s
[0:47:05] Wulthan_: @Spirevipp Dont want enemies already after starting just a few hours ago LUL
[0:47:06] Nexhunter: @rLUL no wonder why the flight from kentucky was late this morning KEKW
[0:47:06] SirExum: universal energy scales are so abstract because the sheer magnitude of events is incomprehensible
[0:47:07] DorionLatronis: My money is on mankind being wiped out after Waffle decides to make a cold fusion reactor in his basement. NODDERS
[0:47:10] TheTrueGaysian: Concepts for redirect missions always excites me.
[0:47:12] BenHoneyman_: !datapack
[0:47:12] Moobot: Waffle is using this 1.17 datapack for the caves and cliffs | https://bit.ly/3g3heux
[0:47:15] Chyrion: is there a game about colonization of space in a city builder style? like surviving mars but for a whole solar system (or more)
[0:47:18] VoylRL: @nexhunter That's the one I work at PogU
[0:47:19] DOOMinion: the milky way travels through the universe at 1m km  per hour if I'm not mistaken
[0:47:20] helios34: well its actually what made world habitable also Waffle :D
[0:47:23] theflyingamerican74: no LUL
[0:47:35] Nexhunter: shit you actually made the flight to Rhode Island late god dammit @rLUL KEKW
[0:47:37] DaGMC: its because of gravity
[0:47:38] Becky15675: if I did a smelly enough fart, would it wipe mankind out?
[0:47:48] sp4wn999: imagine beeing on the iss while an steroid destroys the planet LUL
[0:48:00] VoylRL: @nexhunter I would not doubt it. it was a shit show yesterday. we were here for 10 hours Sadge
[0:48:00] andersen2311: One of the leading experts on orbital movement and astronomy said once "To make interstellar travel feasible, we will have to move fast than planets, or we'll be smacked
[0:48:29] Nexhunter: @rLUL yea the package tracking said that the flight left Louisville late kyleisHmm
[0:48:29] CorSPACE: just warp space EZ
[0:48:29] VoylRL: @nexhunter I do remember hearing about tail swaps so that may have been it KEKW
[0:48:35] DaGMC: remember the last kurz video KEKW
[0:48:36] helios34: there might be some in B.C i remember seeing in some old egyptian paintings
[0:48:59] DaGMC: no interstellar voyage for humans
[0:48:59] Nexhunter: @rLUL monkaS
[0:49:06] Becky15675: to change direction at those speeds would liquify you
[0:49:06] VoylRL: @nexhunter KEKW actually I do remember that what a crazy thing you had a package here
[0:49:13] DOOMinion: gamma rays Pog
[0:49:18] Chyrion: @BBQgril something like that yeah
[0:49:21] Solitude411: sun farts are always silent and deadly
[0:49:22] DaGMC: carrington event
[0:49:23] MyOG222: Solar flare
[0:49:26] Nexhunter: @rLUL sir that my 3080ti that was on that flight monkaS
[0:49:45] VoylRL: @nexhunter monkaS I wonder who loaded the package in the belly
[0:49:55] Joshuapetch: @Nexhunter HACKERMANS my 3080ti now
[0:50:03] theflyingamerican74: oh thanks
[0:50:12] peemoa: This is fascinating
[0:50:13] CorSPACE: tardagrades would
[0:50:20] Becky15675: yeh, Carrington studied it and linked the sunspots to CMEs and electrical faults on earth
[0:50:22] VoylRL: @nexhunter referring to the small under area for smaller packages :) I hope if was someone nice
[0:50:29] andersen2311: You mean when is has more potential energy that then gravity holding the gasses in place?
[0:50:29] VoylRL: it*
[0:50:39] DaGMC: a gamma ray burst could also end life on life
[0:50:59] Becky15675: it's death, jim, but not as we know it
[0:51:12] pikabuhhh: yellowstone monkaS
[0:51:14] golden_canadian: I want a zombie apocalypse
[0:51:16] DaGMC: we are overdue for so many things
[0:51:23] Tylerbuell16: CME?
[0:51:23] VoylRL: @nexhunter If it was late it was either loaded late or had to swap planes so someone may have loaded that twice monkaS
[0:51:26] Larklen: It all comes back to Blackjack pepeLaugh
[0:51:29] Becky15675: 2024 is an active year for the sun
[0:51:33] golden_canadian: GME
[0:51:33] helios34: but the light that reaches us must be like thousand of years old right?
[0:51:35] Solitude411: rip texas infrastructure
[0:51:38] helios34: so we might get hit anytime
[0:51:38] Its_Only_Rocket_Science: Instead of counting cards, we're counting stars.
[0:51:41] Nexhunter: monkaS pls stop endangering my card from UPS loader abuse D: @rLUL
[0:51:43] urbanjack_: get your farming skills ready !
[0:51:45] NinjaRazor: After 2020 i wouldnt be surprised
[0:51:45] DaGMC: humans and prepared KEKW
[0:51:53] ninopanda: it will be like Y2K @Giantwaffle
[0:51:54] aman36000: We almost got fucked in 2012 by one
[0:51:54] DrHax_: OMEGALUL you know we wont be prepared
[0:51:55] andersen2311: Except Bill Gates.
[0:51:56] Myekos: some people still don't think it's a thing
[0:51:57] DewDragon: no one expects the spanish inquisition
[0:52:00] omar_i_: thanks for letting us know Waffle, thats what we needed on top of covid KEKW
[0:52:02] Nexhunter: ummmm except for the last pandemic KEKW
[0:52:03] VoylRL: @nexhunter I try to load those things very gently widepeepoHappy
[0:52:05] TheTrueGaysian: hey waffle, I work at CIRES if you ever have any CME or flare questions, lmk! Also if youre ever in Boulder, Id love to give you a tour
[0:52:09] Nvearen: except Bill Gates
[0:52:12] Nexhunter: which we controlled before it could hit hard KEKW
[0:52:15] P0tat0killer: plague inc KEKW
[0:52:18] KamiSkript: many people thought a pandemic was very, very realistic and normal
[0:52:21] Alydalie: leylaa2HahaAries leylaa2HahaAries
[0:52:23] xdog60: Man, we will kill ourselves with how ppl weren't wearing masks lol
[0:52:31] Shoderra: We expected it just hoped it wouldn’t happen
[0:52:50] NinjaInSpandex: The thing missing from all apocalypse movies is a large chunk of the population calling the apocalypse a hoax
[0:52:52] Nexhunter: oh yeah in other dread news
[0:52:53] dabeda1: i mean
[0:52:53] Alem_Sinner_pt: not if im paid big bucks to think about it Kappa
[0:52:57] Nexhunter: we surpassed 600k deaths now in the US
[0:52:58] GadaboutG: @Myekos yeah, and i still dont understand how they actually believe sars2 doesnt exist, while i literally had 7 family members in the hospital
[0:52:58] DaGMC: we are going to die with CME or without
[0:52:59] peemoa: Thanos in real life
[0:53:00] dabeda1: is a hardreset really that bad for earth tho? Kappa
[0:53:01] KamiSkript: Pandemic aren't even that surprised. All of human history is paved with it.
[0:53:02] Becky15675: the Kessler syndrome is more probable than a huge CME atm
[0:53:03] pikabuhhh: people already do that without LUL
[0:53:04] DaGMC: makes no difference
[0:53:16] DrHax_: just make CME resistant electronics, one less thing to worry about 5Head
[0:53:17] Myekos: the only way we get people to prepare is if they're getting paid from a government contract
[0:53:17] KamiSkript: yes
[0:53:18] VoylRL: @nexhunter Population control monkaS
[0:53:22] The_time_is_out_of_joint: you should stress when you go to bed, because most people die in it oinkStare
[0:53:24] Mandorake: its comic book logic
[0:53:27] ssidii: but viruses are not really threat for for civilization, if they are very deadly, then they are not so fast spreading as the patient dies before he has a chance for spreading
[0:53:29] helios34: lol
[0:53:30] Deadfox74: Caving > strip mining IMO
[0:53:32] xMikie: cuz plot
[0:53:32] xdog60: too big brain
[0:53:34] DewDragon: cause he is purple
[0:53:34] Desupls: 5Head
[0:53:37] artykQBR: because its a movie LUL
[0:53:38] Nexhunter: cause Thanos is too big brain to let folks live
[0:53:40] VoylRL: well he ended up living on his own?
[0:53:41] YaseenDIY: because then theres no marvel movies to make money off of
[0:53:41] helios34: that is a lol
[0:53:43] andersen2311: The theory of Life and Greed??
[0:53:45] GadaboutG: MOVIE 2
[0:53:45] Hibame: He wanted others to suffer like he did
[0:53:47] qoob: Cuz population would grow and he'd have to do it every like 1000 years
[0:53:48] MrHashbrowns: because scripting
[0:53:49] xMikie: then he isn't a villain then
[0:53:50] helios34: ok no spoiler alert?
[0:53:50] DecoyOcelot: cause that would just make more people, that use the resources. to him that would just continue the cycle
[0:53:51] Alem_Sinner_pt: We would probably wish for real 3d waifus @Giantwaffle so i see why thanos wished for that :P
[0:53:51] Nilau: Because Thanos is based and doesn't care
[0:53:52] aman36000: Cuz they cant make matter only store it
[0:53:53] msfWEBdude: he was obsessed, thats the only solution he was fixed on
[0:53:54] punkgeek: Yeah, that's a pretty big plot hole
[0:53:55] calvinisonline: because theres no infinite sequels in that
[0:53:55] Originalfudge: becaus ehe wanted peace and quiet on his farm planet :)
[0:53:56] Sander20011: Because we would get greedy and use those resources even faster
[0:53:58] Spirevipp: thats why he was the "mad titan"
[0:53:58] KamiSkript: This is because Thanos wanted to impress the personification of death in the comics. They just didn't do that in the film.
[0:53:58] galaxy_berry: because the orginal story that got the idea from his hes trying to get in lady deaths pants but thats not family friendly sooo half life dead
[0:54:00] Kable10TV: he wanted other people to face the loss that he had to
[0:54:01] helios34: no spoiler alert i'm leaving
[0:54:07] zroom28: wasn't his point to make people realize the way they lived was selfish
[0:54:08] Becky15675: he wished for extra cheese on his burgers
[0:54:08] Grave110: he did it for lady death
[0:54:10] oxidexd: are the pog caves in MC now?
[0:54:13] punkgeek: In the comics he's trying to get with Death herself
[0:54:13] Larklen: Wasnt it mainly cause he say his home planet get destroyed from overpopulation, so thats why he wanted to kill 50% instead of resources doubling?
[0:54:14] Aarimous: Maybe he understood conservation of matter physics laws?
[0:54:14] DewDragon: side note. why do people hate on the marvel movies because they arent "proper" cinema?
[0:54:18] Larklen: *he saw
[0:54:22] peemoa: He said the world needed correction and get rid of the ‘bad eggs’
[0:54:23] qoob: Wish for unlimited wishes!
[0:54:25] DecoyOcelot: also yeah he was pretty much trying to get with Death
[0:54:26] CheesusTheCrust: found alot of iron strip mining at y10 in 1.17
[0:54:27] ssidii: its a comic, no point for logic searchind
[0:54:29] MrHashbrowns: in the comics he did it because he was in love with death and wanted her to notice him
[0:54:31] Lorilath: in the comics he does it to get lady death to love him
[0:54:31] omar_i_: stop ruining movies waffle, pls
[0:54:35] Deadfox74: They couldn’t bring scarlet Johansson back from the dead
[0:54:36] peemoa: Lol
[0:54:36] Lukesux: wanted to get with death
[0:54:39] panic_inducing_citrus: He played omnifactory so ore doubling wasn't a priority
[0:54:40] NinjaInSpandex: doubling the resources is a benevolent choice, but at the end of the day hes not a hero.  He is psycopathic
[0:54:49] Moobot: You can find Waffle's Youtube channel here - https://youtube.com/giantwaffle
[0:54:53] ThatWeirdoGuy: Waffle you know if the Earth suddently had twice the amount of resources, it would only benefit like the 10% riches people..
[0:54:54] Larklen: yeah if you wanna get technical, its because he was in love with Death YEP
[0:54:57] SmokeyElm: Actor commented on that and basically said Thanos was fixated on the idea of cutting the population. The idea was callused in his mind.
[0:54:59] xdog60: @BBQgril lol
[0:55:00] Larklen: but thats a comic book plot
[0:55:03] MiloBeann: \
[0:55:03] BeastboySAW: He wanted to impress his GF who was DEATH.
[0:55:06] Deadfox74: The glove I don’t think was “all powerful” as in it could create from nothing
[0:55:13] galaxy_berry: he was just trying to get laid with lady death
[0:55:13] Nexhunter: technically doubling of resources doesn't help slow down the issue he saw of too many beings consuming finite resources @Giantwaffle
[0:55:24] LastCares: ideology
[0:55:26] gruxthewarlord: He tried to stick his literal dick in death sooo i dunno
[0:55:29] Zoinx: catJAM
[0:55:31] Myekos: like Homelander?
[0:55:38] ninopanda: ironman
[0:55:38] aur1so: catJAM
[0:55:38] Feist_: like the jedi Kappa
[0:55:39] andersen2311: I think the theory of the stones was that they couldnt go against what they represented?
[0:55:41] ninopanda: KEKW
[0:55:42] DrHax_: thinking about logical flaws in the Marvel Universe is probably not a good idea if you enjoy it KEKW
[0:55:43] DewDragon: that show is amazing
[0:55:43] omar_i_: methodology?
[0:55:47] Mandorake: Or Invincible
[0:55:48] MiloBeann: catJAM
[0:55:48] DecoyOcelot: was? still is
[0:55:48] Wulthan_: So your harvester is still chilling in my area, bugged at the energy source without farming it, cant kill it since I dont have an attacker creep @Giantwaffle
[0:55:51] DewDragon: and relevant!
[0:55:53] Shutaverage13: I'm so ready for season 3
[0:55:57] Kable10TV: have you seen loki, it is fantastic
[0:55:59] Mandorake: @Giantwaffle did you watch Invincible?
[0:56:04] DewDragon: and super ironic that it was on prime
[0:56:16] Aarimous: Didn't Seth Rogen write that?
[0:56:17] snardmuggins: Sadge no super powers
[0:56:18] andersen2311: You world is really ore poor.
[0:56:22] omar_i_: Sadge
[0:56:22] Nexhunter: that why the X-Men government speaks to me
[0:56:32] Nexhunter: fuck the mutants especially since I am not special sadKEK
[0:56:40] DorionLatronis: I'm already a nothing. Sadge
[0:56:49] Klorell: what are you watching?
[0:56:50] Brainbottle: @DorionLatronis same sadge
[0:56:52] VoylRL: Spider wifu is good
[0:56:52] KamiSkript: Invincible better then anime.
[0:56:55] BeastboySAW: Have we talked about Batman not going downtown on Catwoman cause he is a Hero?
[0:56:58] lookouttttt: sup
[0:57:04] Nexhunter: what
[0:57:04] produkteriswf: Nagatoro Love, Nagatoro Life
[0:57:08] ninopanda: @Giantwaffle CATCH UP ON SLIME!!!!
[0:57:19] NinjaInSpandex: Also, with more resources the populations would also increase exponentially and run into problems within a generation or 2. By culling it you guarantee decades of "prosperity".
[0:57:23] Myekos: Catwoman is Batmans kryptonite
[0:57:25] VoylRL: new MHA is alright
[0:57:28] ninopanda: 2 weeks
[0:57:31] Asphoron: Slime was too wholesome for me
[0:57:31] Mandorake: can we all agree that poison ivy was right
[0:57:37] golden_canadian: When will the second season of AOT be on Netflix in canada
[0:57:41] lookouttttt: is this 1.17
[0:57:48] Myekos: I have a feeling Catwoman is going to be Batwomans kryptonite, too
[0:57:50] ssidii: whats the final goal for copper? only for decoration?
[0:57:54] dabeda1: waiting for the last 86 episode monkaS
[0:57:55] RedDiablos: Have you watched Tokyo Revengers? Its so good
[0:57:55] Nexhunter: @Myekos just cause Bruce wants to go to bat with her Kappa
[0:57:57] Deadfox74: @lookouttttt yes, it’s in the title
[0:58:04] KamiSkript: @Myekos Batmans cock is his kyptonite :D
[0:58:04] ChemEnginerd: sorry, I'm new to minecraft.  Is he just making all these tunnels for ore?
[0:58:09] Myekos: Nexhunter exactly
[0:58:24] Larklen: 40 year old looking middle schoolers KEKW
[0:58:25] ninopanda: i wonder if I will have 10-12 anime's to watch next season

[0:59:02] Deadfox74: Waffle, are you going to go after any farms in this world? It’s annoying, but they’re the “meta”
[0:59:04] Nexhunter: skidds
[0:59:06] OrangeW2: hooligans
[0:59:08] Dibbsu: delinquints
[0:59:10] Asphoron: are you 80 lol

[0:59:20] DewDragon: god damn degens
[0:59:25] TylerBueno: Sup waffle
[0:59:31] Becky15675: idiots?
[0:59:48] mittensthekillerbunny: peepoHmm
[0:59:57] lookouttttt: you  should make a spyglass
[1:00:00] RedDiablos: I love the time travel mechanic. Pretty unique

[1:00:52] blisteringcold: yeah,thanks but no. I skip all the anime,movies,tv shows with the "time travel mechanic" since it has more holes than julius caesar has in his back
[1:00:52] ninopanda: Nagatoro!!! watch it
[1:00:56] Deadfox74: If you want that free diamond pick, villagers sell diamond tools at max trading level

[1:09:02] aCookienot: the problem with flat design is everyone's using it now, so it's starting to look generic xD
[1:09:05] Tech: If you do react, material has their own components
[1:09:10] DaGMC: you should try linux with gnome desktop

[1:09:13] Feist_: can we trust this leak, i mean the last leak from China was covid Kappa
[1:09:19] Nexhunter: no
[1:09:19] Kuroiorb: no orange D:
[1:09:21] Mandorake: @Giantwaffle adaptiveness is when you have breakpints at different screen sizes.  Responsive is when it changes to the change in size continiously
[1:09:27] Nexhunter: react isn't your UI styling
[1:09:32] Joshuapetch: susHmm
[1:09:33] BennyF_Jr: react is CSS
[1:09:34] K3ll06s: you can do that with css aswell, you just need to define the display: grid with % padding
[1:09:38] Nexhunter: no
[1:09:38] BennyF_Jr: react isnt CSS
[1:09:40] 0x000000: nope
[1:09:41] BennyF_Jr: sorry
[1:09:45] Nexhunter: you can make garbage with react
[1:09:47] Trilex: i am rocking android 11
[1:09:49] Nexhunter: it is all CSS
[1:09:51] Mandorake: containers are css
[1:09:51] DaGMC: either bootstrap or tailwind, or manually
[1:09:52] Nexhunter: that makesthat shit
[1:09:52] TheNeonian: you still use CSS with react
[1:09:54] TilableToast: all css
[1:10:00] qoob: Wonder how much windows 11 would cost
[1:10:03] Nexhunter: no
[1:10:05] 0x000000: sure
[1:10:07] PeachyTheG: Bootstrap?
[1:10:10] CantTouchDisNow: scss just helps a bit :)
[1:10:10] Mandorake: Css is how you style things on web
[1:10:10] MyNameIsTobii: Tailwind
[1:10:14] GioG7: noooooo
[1:10:16] Nexhunter: well you can use things like tailwindcss or heavy duty shit like bootstrap
[1:10:18] Mandorake: Tailwind or bootstrap is your best bet
[1:10:20] Nexhunter: that not a lot
[1:10:21] EX0stasis: SCSS or LESS are frameworks for CSS
[1:10:21] Nexhunter: KEKW
[1:10:24] Originalfudge: SASS makes css a lot easier
[1:10:28] SakaMiep: Tailwind, Chakra UI, Material UI are not bad
[1:10:28] MyNameIsTobii: Tailwind ist pretty nice
[1:10:28] 0x000000: just use "less" or "scss"
[1:10:31] Aspssp: Bootstrap is the best option, then.
[1:10:31] bintanraver: squarespace?
[1:10:34] Nexhunter: SCSS/LESS/SASS are supersets
[1:10:36] Tech: CSS is such a crucial thing to learn though
[1:10:37] wpprrz: Can be done in less CSS @Giantwaffle
[1:10:37] 0sem0: You can use tailwind @Giantwaffle
[1:10:37] NonSix: less is good
[1:10:40] Mandorake: scss is just css but even more of it
[1:10:43] Tech: But most react component sets ship with their own styling
[1:10:54] Tech: since you can bundle css locally with your components
[1:10:55] DaGMC: @Nexhunter bootstrap and heavy duty shit? isnt bootstrap lightweight?
[1:11:00] Wulthan_: @Nexhunter Wtf now there are two of his harvesters herer DansGame
[1:11:02] Nexhunter: @DaGMC nah it heavy for me
[1:11:05] GioG7: might be annoying but its EZ
[1:11:11] Crizzle777: so many devs suck at css
[1:11:18] Nexhunter: like I use tailwindcss so it is just utilities and nothing else really @DaGMC
[1:11:18] Moobot: You can sub to Waffle by clicking this neat link -> twitch.tv/giantwaffle/subscribe
[1:11:24] Crizzle777: I hated css but took like a week to learn it
[1:11:26] Tech: Media Queries
[1:11:27] 0x000000: nobody writes raw css nowadays
[1:11:33] Tech: Use Clamp
[1:11:33] Aspssp: ^
[1:11:35] Crizzle777: is it responsive?
[1:11:36] subfin: you will always need a bit of CSS, but if you use libraries (React + MaterialUI, for example) the css is minimal, and its always confined to a specific component
[1:11:38] Nexhunter: media queries
[1:11:38] HyperHydroX: that's why mobile first is better
[1:11:39] Spirevipp: @Wulthan_ KEKW
[1:11:40] TilableToast: flexbox mvp
[1:11:43] Wulthan_: Waffle your harvesters are invading my area and stay bugged at the energy source, pls fix DansGame @Giantwaffle
[1:11:46] Steele_Boi: Bootstrap and Tailwind are okay but your HTML tags can get out of hand
[1:11:46] EX0stasis: "Responsive design"
[1:11:48] GioG7: responsive
[1:11:48] HyperHydroX: yes
[1:11:49] Mandorake: @Giantwaffle adaptiveness is when you have breakpints at different screen sizes.  Responsive is when it changes to the change in size continiously
[1:11:50] Trilex: if you use dreamweaver you can use GUI to design your site and you dont have to do alot of programming
[1:11:55] Nexhunter: the theory is responsive design but you use media queries in css to handle it
[1:11:55] DaGMC: @Nexhunter strange I got the opposite impression
[1:11:57] Tech: Responsive just means it can resize with breakpoints
[1:12:08] Toruk_UK: try sass
[1:12:10] Spirevipp: @Wulthan_ they cant mine because you own the room
[1:12:13] Crizzle777: media queries are used for responsive
[1:12:13] ssidii: respect for writing pure css. you get to learn it properly, everybody uses css frameworks and don't understand it, and call themself developer
[1:12:14] 0sem0: use Tailwind CSS Waffle
[1:12:17] Nexhunter: https://tailwindcss.com/ this is what I use at work for all of the utilities
[1:12:18] Jordan_allen13: squarespace?
[1:12:20] Crizzle777: you can set it to iphone in dev tools
[1:12:24] HyperHydroX: I love the satisfaction
[1:12:25] Tech: Tailwind isn't learning though chat
[1:12:26] Wulthan_: @Spirevipp Ah, still annoying having them there LUL
[1:12:28] Fimbululfr: no css? time to use a single canvas for the page KEKW
[1:12:33] Nexhunter: @Tech learning cheating it all the same KEKW
[1:12:34] 0x000000: you just need to take a look at css frameworks or pre-compiler
[1:12:35] infucio: how did you check to cross-browser support for all of that css ?
[1:12:38] iweartights: Just use punch cards man! what are u doing
[1:12:45] Nexhunter: @Tech i still passed my spanish class Kappa
[1:12:47] TheNeonian: If you don't like css just avoid front-end development:)

[1:13:30] Wulthan_: @Spirevipp Im also doing it in TS but struggling with it, plain JS would be easy but I got some weird ts config that makes it hard for me
[1:13:32] Deep_Frozen: iOS does some things weirdly rendering wise, we've had several bugs where we had to make iOS exceptions..
[1:13:35] Wetware: IE is still a thing?
[1:13:36] Nexhunter: edge is chromium now
[1:13:37] ssidii: ie need to die, people should you stop caring about it
[1:13:38] andersen2311: Isnt edge chromium based?
[1:13:40] Crizzle777: lol I wish I could say that
[1:13:40] Nexhunter: edgeHTML is dead

[2:39:09] Nexhunter: yea it was the ISO that got leaked
[2:39:20] PxlSauce: center would be ok for a pad, but for desktop it feels weird
[2:39:21] RazorOPS_: RocketDock circa. 2008 LUL
[2:39:24] Tech: I mean I prefer center align when I'm on multiple monitors
[2:39:28] pais_vl: nooo we dont need win 11
[2:39:35] DinnerBeef: i would not mind the icon center
[2:39:37] TheOmyNomy: Yeah I don't mind the centred taskbar.
[2:39:37] TapdancingNinja: i thought the idea was to continously update windows 10
[2:39:37] Tech: because I put my task bar on one screen, and it's my center of my 3
[2:39:40] skokpo: wtffff
[2:39:44] TheOmyNomy: TaskbarX already exists for this exact purpose.

[2:40:56] tinspin: I'm still on Windows 7...
[2:40:56] Tech: Leaks don't give a chance for the product people to either refine their final product, or convey what their intention was with something
[2:41:00] mrtraxx: Mac feel to it
[2:41:01] Tech: They remove all context
[2:41:01] Veirdan: I miss the aero design.

[2:41:03] Solitude411: is that waffles logo as the profile picture
[2:41:04] nxusr: I don't like leaks cos it makes management not share things in future
[2:41:14] Ladon_Dragon: Yeah it’s discount OS X tbh
[2:41:15] Chronoes: I certainly don't like the full-size start menu, I barely even use the current small one
[2:41:15] HiPN0TiKx: what happend to windows 10 being the last windows.....
[2:41:19] Amraki: how very mobile
[2:41:21] nxusr: so now all employees have no idea what their company is working on either
[2:41:22] ChetSteadman_: ugh

[2:45:11] Taifi: Center is ass
[2:45:13] fafuja: true
[2:45:13] slothfarms: tru, I was thinking that
[2:45:15] Andy_975: No it belongs on the left
[2:45:16] Tech: Nah, I dig it
[2:45:16] Nexhunter: that the same design in Win10 already KEKW
[2:45:18] BayouCaneBoy: why keep the taskbar? Just show the icons.
[2:45:18] CorSPACE: why is snip and sketch still there KEKW
[2:45:20] ItsOnMax: it is a THICC
[2:45:22] ItsOnMax: bar
[2:45:24] Tech: because now it doesn't need the top bar and the bottom dock
[2:45:25] DigitalVortex92: Copying iOS DansGame Leave it on the left DansGame
[2:45:26] Madarion: ok, that looks like 100% spotlight
[2:45:29] LOBO_85: weird ? I felt relieved that's back on the left
[2:45:30] SebbDev: bar is too thicc
[2:45:30] aCookienot: you can make it thinner
[2:45:34] ScarceLoot: needs more transparency to the bar so you can see the graphic behind it
[2:45:38] Emjay1979: Mac os is the best graphically
[2:45:39] Akiron_rafa: I dont like th THICC bar
[2:45:39] ZyianDev: I hate how the mac dock doesn't go all the way, that's why I auto hide the mac dock

[2:45:54] f3110w_hum4n: do you know powertoys?
[2:45:55] Nexhunter: @Tech big brain
[2:45:59] drsnaki96: yeah true
[2:46:05] nativeW01f: did you see Windows tweet?

[2:46:12] Internot: I dont like change DansGame
[2:46:16] richie385: spotlight
[2:46:19] Chronoes: windows key and type is the way to go. do it for almost everything

[2:46:21] Nexhunter: PogChamp fuck timeline

[2:46:47] rko3_ga: @Giantwaffle Check Tom Warren's twitter he just showed how you can personalize the task bar
[2:46:52] Tech: @Solitude411 Opposite
[2:46:52] Becky15675: have they messed up the desktop?
[2:46:55] RazorOPS_: The real question: Will Windows Search be not absolute garbage?
[2:46:55] Andy_975: Removed that day 1
[2:46:59] DatoPotatoDato: i dont see myself using widgets
[2:47:00] morreeuh27: an ad widget board

[2:47:33] Solitude411: @Tech @theCaptainJack haha thats surprising to me
[2:47:33] fafuja: nice
[2:47:34] Tech: @Tech I've never had an issue with the current search tbh for what I use it for

[2:48:20] thecodealive_original: i really don't like that it's becoming more like mac
[2:48:22] orion3373: @Vangelis716 ahhh okie
[2:48:23] skokpo: i don't like that
[2:48:25] aCookienot: i don't know how long it'll take me to get used to new sounds...
[2:48:25] rarelybegaming: the sounds are better they're not that harsh as the ones on windows 10
[2:48:33] Tech: More Yoinking Pog
[2:48:36] RazorOPS_: Gesures POG
[2:48:37] Nexhunter: this is the biggest thing that Apple needs to do to get MacOS for the iPad
[2:48:37] mechoriet: KEKW
[2:48:40] Becky15675: imma change it to a fart for connect and a poop plop for disconnect
[2:48:42] Amraki: ahhh. recording in bathroom
[2:48:45] SodiumDoggo: 3 Figers Kreygasm
[2:48:46] mechoriet: aah yes yoinkies
[2:48:47] Gelil: Is that my iPad?
[2:48:47] Nexhunter: they have to work on support of touch and mouse HID at same time
[2:48:49] Joshuapetch: Chat don't try this on your monitor
[2:48:51] Emjay1979: this os is more tablet oriented
[2:48:55] Tech: Virtual Desktops on Mac is easily my favorite feature for work
[2:48:58] Solitude411: This is gonna be a lawsuit from apple
[2:49:01] Driitzz: OMG 3 TO 4 FINGERS YAGOO
[2:49:02] Tech: I use mine for coding all the time
[2:49:07] Nexhunter: that is Microsoft goal to get touch and mouse HID working together
[2:49:09] BayouCaneBoy: again, let's make the taskbar taller so that I need a 4:3 ration display again.
[2:49:14] CorSPACE: windows 11 is windwos 10 + windows 10x
[2:49:15] BasedLemur: Centered instead of left justified task bar FeelsBadMan
[2:49:19] Gelil: @tech danSgame
[2:49:20] TheOmyNomy: @Giantwaffle The UI is basically the Windows 10X UI brought over after they canned that OS.
[2:49:27] haitham506: @Tech Windows 10 has it too
[2:49:29] Askjong: Finally!
[2:49:30] Nexhunter: I hope they took the core changes @CorSPACE
[2:49:30] silv: coding in 2021 DansGame
[2:49:32] TheOmyNomy: Windows 10X was supposed to be a Chrome OS competitor.
[2:49:45] Tech: Yeah, but gestures make it natural to use
[2:49:47] Emjay1979: but the bottom bar is huge!!!
[2:50:03] Tech: gestures are what make things feel natural
[2:50:04] Nexhunter: this is a big thing having dedicated tablet natural
[2:50:08] Snibblespliff: Obvious they aiming for fluid integration / seamless transitions between devices
[2:50:15] Nexhunter: @Snibblespliff exactly
[2:50:17] Becky15675: can you still auto hide that massive bar?
[2:50:25] Amraki: defrag lmao
[2:50:26] mechoriet: :)
[2:50:28] Eolri: Do I really have to get a tablet now as well this seems too nice fml

[2:50:39] Gelil: :)
[2:50:48] Internot: ver nice =)
[2:50:52] ruccoa: this seems like it isn't meant to be a desktop OS at all
[2:51:01] Amraki: that's not smooth
[2:51:05] Amraki: still jerks
[2:51:06] BayouCaneBoy: Sorry, I can see your aweful powerpoint Peggy - can you make the taskbar bigger? Thanks. LUL
[2:51:09] LOBO_85: this reminds me how they tried to make the desktop look more like a smartphone puke
[2:51:14] DuctTapeNinja_: I refuse to believe that windows is actually doing a Win 11
[2:51:16] slothfarms: its nice
[2:51:19] CorSPACE: windows 11 better have all jerkiness removed
[2:51:20] DuctTapeNinja_: *microsoft
[2:51:21] fafuja: It's nice indeed
[2:51:23] fafuja: I dig it
[2:51:24] Driitzz: ewww they changed the Recycle Bin icon again NotLikeThis
[2:51:29] Vangelis716: The little delay in re-spacing the task bar icons is annoying as hell
[2:51:30] Tech: Looks good and is easy to digest IMO
[2:51:33] Gelil: Windows is a bit ahead in terms of the OS behavior between desktop and tablet
[2:51:35] Twigie_: peepoSip
[2:51:37] IcyCrudeDuck: need dark mode tho
[2:51:40] BasedLemur: So far, the only complaint I have is the taskbar
[2:51:42] Toxicplasm4: i dont like it, but i cant tell why
[2:51:42] Becky15675: i hate it
[2:51:44] ZyianDev: You should take a look at the unixporn subreddit, so many nice desktop customizations
[2:51:45] aCookienot: dudes complaining about a fucking taskbar lol which you can make thinner anyway >_<
[2:51:46] Rawb_: 1234
[2:51:46] CorSPACE: @Driitzz they;ve updated all legacy icons
[2:51:47] Grecha99: not a fan
[2:51:49] Emjay1979: 1234
[2:51:51] BasedLemur: Otherwise it looks nice from what I saw
[2:51:52] madmeix: I think it just another win10 update not 11
[2:51:52] CantTouchDisNow: the future for the next 4 years again :)
[2:51:54] SeaOfMadness_: 1234
[2:51:59] haitham506: @CorSPACE It will Kappa
[2:52:02] BayouCaneBoy: where's the part where they sell my privacy without my agreement?
[2:52:04] Becky15675: it's app marketplace oriented bullshit
[2:52:05] wsd7: PogChamp so fast reader
[2:52:09] Stonan: Remember when Apple's UI used to look like leather?
[2:52:10] slothfarms: asdf EZ
[2:52:13] skokpo: nooooooooo
[2:52:14] mechoriet: DansGame mc account
[2:52:14] Chronoes: screw MS account, I hate that shit
[2:52:16] Gelil: But they have a long way to go in terms of usability when compared to a Mac / iPad
[2:52:25] Tech: Did they even try sign-in options?
[2:52:25] Nexhunter: @madmeix given we got 10 for free for owning 7,8,8.1 we will probably get 11 for free it just like how Apple does big name changes for major changes
[2:52:30] BayouCaneBoy: his password is "nipple"
[2:52:32] Driitzz: you got internet ? OK no local account :tf:
[2:52:34] Emjay1979: 12345 pin :D

[2:52:42] Nexhunter: monkaS
[2:52:44] LOBO_85: they had round corners in Battlestar Galactica everywhere...I guess its the future
[2:52:45] Nexhunter: never do that monkaS
[2:52:46] Tech: Restore from one drive?
[2:52:51] Tech: interesting
[2:52:54] Gelil: I have the same combination on my luggage!
[2:52:57] Amraki: not sure what this is, let's try it and see..
[2:53:00] CiVR: It’s not on sign in options, they removed local acts if you have internet
[2:53:04] Larklen: monkaHmm
[2:53:08] Becky15675: his pin is the same as my luggage!
[2:53:10] UnrealUndead: 10 had that too
[2:53:11] slothfarms: interesting
[2:53:13] Driitzz: if you pick any of those choices , you fucked up
[2:53:14] aCookienot: that's not new to win 11...
[2:53:14] BayouCaneBoy: that determines what crapware gets installed
[2:53:27] aCookienot: it gives you that customization on windown 10 pro now
[2:53:38] CorSPACE: one drive is nice if you have many pc's
[2:53:39] Veirdan: Lots of UI changes, I wonder what the back end changes are?

[2:54:16] I_n_s_p_i_r_e: what the price ?
[2:54:17] Chronoes: If I can reduce the size of the bar and the start menu, I'm good
[2:54:18] fafuja: It will have ARM support too
[2:54:21] fafuja: nice
[2:54:21] Emjay1979: it's very clean, but the bar is very huge and too long
[2:54:24] CorSPACE: theres alot of technical improvements aswell

[2:54:59] Driitzz: I_n_s_p_i_r_e i am , but i'm not surprise if it is , they always been in that price range

[2:56:02] ruccoa: you just have a uniformly colored wallpaper
[2:56:12] Driitzz: I_n_s_p_i_r_e im talking about official from microsoft not some shady retailer that sells key
[2:56:13] DaGMC: it just a skin

[2:56:26] wsd7: Early access OS Kappa
[2:56:27] wizsarton: i wish you could turn on like an edit mode for the toolbar and reorder and snap even the system widgets left right center
[2:56:28] haitham506: Dark Task Manager??
[2:56:31] Nexhunter: it a reskin and cleanup
[2:56:36] f3110w_hum4n: do you know powertoys?
[2:56:38] Andy_975: As long as I can customize it to look like what I have now I'm fine with it
[2:56:38] Mapleton: EZ
[2:56:40] Askjong: was win 8, 8.1 and 10 ready for launch? No
[2:56:45] DaGMC: the functionality was already in win10 or earlier
[2:56:45] Kompreni: Looks like a kid Tablet so :/
[2:56:48] Nexhunter: if they use the core changes from 10X that was supposed to be developed then there is going to be a lot of security and update changes
[2:56:50] Amraki: The Day the Dinosaurs Died BibleThump
[2:56:52] ruccoa: if current w10 apps don't run flawlessly on it I'll be annoyed
[2:56:53] Joshuapetch: can i get a link

[2:57:16] Brainbottle: KEKW

[2:57:17] aur1so: KEKW
[2:57:19] DaGMC: have you ever tried a desktop on linux @Giantwaffle ?
[2:57:20] Madarion: what the pricing looks like, that is the important question. everybody has win10 because of the free upgrade from win7 and win8
[2:57:21] Amraki: ohhh these walls are nice
[2:57:23] Dagmoo: KEKW
[2:57:30] PliusInfo: LUL
[2:57:32] Tauruntino: all of windows 10 has felt like a skin devised by marketing, Windows 7 was the pinnacle of functionality
[2:57:33] Joshuapetch: @Nexhunter I don't want it :)
[2:57:34] Veirdan: Win 10 was a little haphazard so if this is more complete it'll be nice.
[2:57:41] Allroundnoise: KEKW
[2:57:42] CorSPACE: stfu window boomers
[2:57:45] wsd7: well its like trying to reinvent wheel
[2:57:46] cosmicblip: I wonder if it will be a free upgrade like Windows 10.
[2:57:50] LOBO_85: some screeps today?
[2:57:55] jkmcameron: mans making his walls out of roofing shingles
[2:57:57] slothfarms: @Driitzz just keep win 10 until official support ends in 2025 LUL
[2:58:00] Nexhunter: probably will
[2:58:02] ruccoa: it for sure will be
[2:58:11] Nexhunter: given they will want to continue folks on latest mainline for security
[2:58:12] Joshuapetch: PepegaChat i use linux
[2:58:13] Amraki: @LOBO_85 i wish. he has it in background
[2:58:15] Alem_Sinner_pt: Until they go the gaming industry way of here a skin for 30bucks i'm fine with the change LUL
[2:58:16] UnknownFrenzy: Mc music widepeepoHappy
[2:58:17] CorSPACE: no way it wont
[2:58:17] fafuja: It needs to be free I think
[2:58:19] ruccoa: if you have a windows 7 key, you get windows 10 for free. right now. still
[2:58:19] haitham506: it is free
[2:58:22] Limpeklimpe: Hard to get people to upgrade if its not free
[2:58:28] nxusr: that's the one thing Apple does better, free OS upgrades
[2:58:29] salty_mouthfulls: it will be a sub service
[2:58:30] I_n_s_p_i_r_e: but the upgrade from win 7 to 10 was free
[2:58:32] rko3_ga: best way to combat piracy is to make it free
[2:58:33] Emjay1979: If win will have the possibility of personalization as linux will be great (don't know if this is write correct) :D
[2:58:36] Internot: i cant wait for hand gestures and all that super transparent UI of the future
[2:58:44] Amraki: "temporarily" free forever
[2:58:44] Nexhunter: it actually is an issue for Microsoft in the past
[2:58:44] Madarion: like i said, win10 is only used because upgrade from win7 was free
[2:58:47] TapdancingNinja: I guess it will be multicore minimum specs
[2:58:47] fafuja: new intel chips needs features the new windows have I think
[2:58:50] mechoriet: cause else you get the whole windows 7 extended security shit again
[2:58:51] LOBO_85: @amraki did he play already
[2:58:52] ZyianDev: nope, there are people who will refuse to upgrade regardless
[2:58:54] Becky15675: best to give it away free for maximum app marketplace coverage
[2:58:54] BleedKappa: That's a dumb comment @Limpeklimpe
[2:58:55] fafuja: and the new ARM support too
[2:58:56] jkmcameron: @Madarion wrong
[2:58:56] Askjong: Should be free to upgrade from 10 to 11
[2:58:57] Nexhunter: a lot of resistance to upgrades due to pricing
[2:58:58] CorSPACE: windows 10 was free and that was a way bigger os change than this
[2:58:59] Joshuapetch: Nobody would move from 7 to 8 so 10 was free
[2:59:03] Rawb_: maybe the upgrade will be in a lootbox with a bunch of shit like a new Cortana voice and a pack of WinXP wallpapers
[2:59:10] nativeW01f: MacOS is free Kappa
[2:59:12] Akiron_rafa: to vista you mean KEKW
[2:59:13] Karnaxx: It's as if millions of IT departments screamed out in terror and were suddenly silenced
[2:59:13] RelentlessOnPC: no one will convert if its not free IMO
[2:59:14] Nexhunter: Win7 had issues that 8 and 10 fixed under the hood
[2:59:15] ピッザダディ: Vista was better Kappa
[2:59:17] Chronoes: yeah, so why would people want Win11 now if they have to pay for it
[2:59:17] GreyFly: when the stop supporting it ppl will move
[2:59:18] DaGMC: same applied to WinXP
[2:59:20] Nexhunter: and 11 will do the same to 10
[2:59:21] TheOmyNomy: @nativeW01f Any OS is free if you look hard enough Kappa
[2:59:23] ThunderdoomX: It'll be free for new PCs that are purchase after Win11 is released. If the NEw PC has 10 preinstalled.
[2:59:24] CorSPACE: other than the outdated look of win 7
[2:59:25] milan1miki: Windows 10 is also great, I don't see a single reason to ditch windows 10 in favor of 11
[2:59:28] MrWizard1974: Agreed win 7 was very good
[2:59:28] Vangelis716: if it's not free, the support for W10 is till 2025. Not too bothered
[2:59:32] Joshuapetch: Someone clip that YEP
[2:59:35] nativeW01f: @TheOmyNomy True EZ Clap
[2:59:36] SergentPeaches: Its free but you have to install bathroom cams
[2:59:40] blisteringcold: ehh,i had more problems with games under win7 than win10
[2:59:41] Internot: i still sometimes miss XP
[2:59:46] podwe: not all  Mac upgrades were free either
[2:59:47] bhatti_: after playing modded so much, do you not get bored of vanilla?
[2:59:50] Amraki: @LOBO_85 no coding today. he just had it up when he was opening mc
[2:59:54] Cafn8247: The only reason I upgraded to Windows 10 was to get my monitors to work with freesync which required Windows 10 drivers
[2:59:57] ruccoa: microsoft makes way too much money off people just using windows for them to not give it away
[2:59:57] FlammAlpha: PepeHands XP
[3:00:01] aur1so: widepeepoSad xp..
[3:00:03] DavidB620: xp was god tier
[3:00:05] Bulva: @Giantwaffle I also expect to be free as well at least the regular or educational version but they would definitely charged money for pro version
[3:00:07] CorSPACE: shit teir
[3:00:10] wsd7: xp sounds PepeHands
[3:00:11] Allmostdone: Everything should be free until you have to get paid
[3:00:14] mechoriet: vista was a shitshow
[3:00:15] Internot: its just those grass fields PepeHands
[3:00:16] CantTouchDisNow: vista KEKW
[3:00:17] DaGMC: everytime I boot windows I feel like I'm missing a limb
[3:00:19] GingerPowder: True one day i woke up and they force updated me to 10
[3:00:20] dompa93: xp and lovely sound error
[3:00:20] Joshuapetch: It was a leap!
[3:00:21] MrWizard1974: Vista was crap
[3:00:22] TheOmyNomy: Windows Aero (Vista / 7) was peak theming.
[3:00:23] Chronoes: Vista was just bad overall
[3:00:26] haitham506: Windows 10 is Free right now just have to deal with the Watermark
[3:00:27] slothfarms: vista OMEGALUL
[3:00:28] Madarion: @NE0P0D rly? i thought if ur model was ok with the update u always got it free...
[3:00:29] ruccoa: this feels like another vista. vista had widgets for the first time
[3:00:32] Nexhunter: Vista was great if you had a computer than could support it
[3:00:35] Nexhunter: and had drivers that support it
[3:00:40] CorSPACE: vista was shit cause it was a rewrite
[3:00:41] wsd7: they even ruined minesweeper and solitaire Sadge
[3:00:42] Appotux: god I switched off vista ASAP
[3:00:45] jaspur: i still use windows 8 bruh
[3:00:51] Amraki: vista was so bad my friend went back to xp and still hasn't gotten 10. what a nub
[3:00:51] Allmostdone: No love for 8?
[3:00:54] DavidB620: It was only good for Halo 2
[3:00:56] Nexhunter: under the hood XP was a complete shit show KEKW
[3:00:58] Tauruntino: windows xp was a turd  by then end, all the updates made it run like absolute poop
[3:00:59] TapdancingNinja: @haitham506 this might be my comment of the year LUL
[3:01:09] ZombieInaCostco: I think you did
[3:01:09] Becky15675: i never had a problem with Vista. it never crashed, even weeks of continuously being on
[3:01:11] Dagmoo: almost no one used 8
[3:01:11] sayko77: windows 8.1 was ok
[3:01:11] TheOmyNomy: 8 was flattened 7.
[3:01:17] aman36000: Most swapped from 7 to 10\
[3:01:18] DaGMC: 8 was like ME
[3:01:19] Chronoes: I used 8 and it was pretty poor
[3:01:19] ItsOnMax: 8 was also a shitshow
[3:01:20] Internot: win ME monkaHmm
[3:01:22] Tauruntino: What about ME?
[3:01:23] iandsilent: 8 was shit
[3:01:23] slothfarms: I never touched 8, win 7 -> win 10
[3:01:27] TapdancingNinja: 8 was blocks everywhere
[3:01:27] CorSPACE: i used 8 and 8,1
[3:01:35] ZombieInaCostco: Pretty sure you had an orange and black theme on windows 8.1
[3:01:35] DaGMC: there shitty intermediate windows versions
[3:01:36] I_n_s_p_i_r_e: Direct x 10 and Vista was supposed to change everything LUL
[3:01:36] TheOmyNomy: Windows 2000 though YEP
[3:01:37] ruccoa: rip windows ME
[3:01:38] Veirdan: Vista was bad but I skipped 8 and 8.1
[3:01:39] Becky15675: 8 infuriated me with its start menu
[3:01:40] Nexhunter: the biggest problem I had with vista was one video driver failed at the very start cause of the driver not being compatible KEKW
[3:01:41] DavidB620: 7 -> 10 gang
[3:01:42] MrWizard1974: I also went from 7 to 10 and regret it
[3:01:46] Mapleton: did someone just mention windows ME ?
[3:01:46] nFteddy: Does anyone know waffle's wallpaper? I'm guessing he has it through wallpaper engine?
[3:01:48] herritic1: WIndow's ME KEKW
[3:01:49] pSkinner: I used 8.1 and liked it, kinda
[3:01:51] reconTV: I was using ME KEKW
[3:01:52] Internot: win ME... had a hard life
[3:01:54] slothfarms: LUL
[3:01:55] ruccoa: my family upgraded from windows ME to windows vista
[3:01:55] Tauruntino: windows 2k was a great version
[3:02:00] Becky15675: Windows 3.0
[3:02:07] DaGMC: just look at windows 3.1
[3:02:09] Nexhunter: Win ME was not NT it deserved to die
[3:02:12] Tauruntino: especially if you were supporting 95
[3:02:16] Madarion: @Allmostdone hard for love, win8 introduced tablet and phone features that plaine didnt work for desktop. thats why 8.1 introduced the option to go back to desktop mode
[3:02:17] mario1199: @Giantwaffle Do you have a goal in mind with this playthrough?
[3:02:19] TheOmyNomy: @Giantwaffle Windows still has legacy code from Windows 3.1 LUL
[3:02:23] TapdancingNinja: nah minimilistic has its values
[3:02:25] Chronoes: it's very charming to see the Win95/98 style buttons that actually look like buttons
[3:02:27] CorSPACE: windows 8 was microsoft trying to hard to switch to an all mobile interface wayyyy to soon, looks like windows 11 willl be a solid middle ground for both desktop and mobile applications
[3:02:33] Nexhunter: yea that the NT kernel KEKW @TheOmyNomy
[3:02:43] elpogo: Hi the iron in new update work with fortune ??
[3:02:51] Nexhunter: NT was introduced with a side version of 3.1 and became mainline with XP ltraveHmm
[3:02:59] podwe: @Madarion now all free i think but prev some were paid
[3:03:01] SergentPeaches: Do you keep screeps up while you play minecraft?
[3:03:13] cevi123: could anyone tell me what the major thing is in this update
[3:03:25] Allmostdone: @madarion It’s a joke. Held all my certs up till a couple of years ago
[3:03:26] Becky15675: I've used NT and Linux in a work environment and Linux was way better IMO
[3:03:28] TheOmyNomy: They binned DOS / NT version separation for NT with Home and Pro to keep the separation.
[3:03:31] Geex204: i dont know the numbers but you are not getting crazy amounts out of it.
[3:03:33] cevi123: mc
[3:03:38] TapdancingNinja: sleek and round ui and on tablets
[3:03:58] TapdancingNinja: sorry thats for micro
[3:03:59] Moobot: Support Waffle by using his Epic creator code: Giantwaffle
[3:04:00] jaspur: moss too
[3:04:00] sayko77: and here i thought windows 10 was the 'last' version LUL
[3:04:00] CorSPACE: 1.17 is a block update for 1.18
[3:04:01] Tauruntino: @Nexhunter i hadn't heard that before
[3:04:05] Nexhunter: yea and DOS last leg with ME was a fucking shit show KEKW
[3:04:09] Nexhunter: @TheOmyNomy ^
[3:04:10] TYYoungKing: what's your favorite thing from this version you're playing on?
[3:04:13] TheOmyNomy: YEP LUL
[3:04:19] cevi123: Pog
[3:04:27] Warkless: Sub server for 1.18? KomodoPause
[3:04:27] TheOmyNomy: It's why 2000 was insane and ME was a disaster.
[3:04:33] TheOmyNomy: Sorry DOS but your time is over 👋
[3:04:39] Nexhunter: 2000 was a shit show also KEKW
[3:04:42] xfrozev2: who really even uses that much space ? its useless imo
[3:04:45] Protonmat: But u will need 30gigs more of ram
[3:04:46] Internot: goats YEP
[3:04:50] Allmostdone: Any way Windows 10 is dead. This update will be the last major update
[3:04:58] cevi123: oh that sucks, i'm a dom
[3:04:59] Becky15675: DOS is relegated to Nostalgia lovers
[3:04:59] Tauruntino: 2000 an ME are so different, did ME even have a HAL?
[3:05:01] cevi123: Kappa
[3:05:05] TapdancingNinja: Waffle is there a point to a bigger world hight
[3:05:06] Warkless: @xfrozev2 more efficient farms NODDERS
[3:05:08] slimjet6498: when/where is vacation?
[3:05:09] TheOmyNomy: I thought 2000 was a lot more stable as opposed to ME? 🤔
[3:05:10] mechoriet: i hope they add some more stuff to 1.18 or it willl be a very disapointing update of its only the height
[3:05:12] TapdancingNinja: from your pov
[3:05:17] TwoPluzTwo: I tried playing create mod, my brain is too smooth for that. =/
[3:05:19] ThatOnneGuy: ThatOnneGuy subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 37 months! ඞ Waffle is big sus ඞ
[3:05:21] Geex204: you can actually feel the cave changes already to be honest. going caving can get you lost for hours since they are so much better now.
[3:05:24] Nexhunter: @TheOmyNomy it had some issues due to that version of NT being a semi rush job
[3:05:27] haitham506: Why is it hard for MICROSOFT to make the Task Manager Dark Mode??
[3:05:30] richie385: are we finishing the mudpack you started
[3:05:33] Askjong: peepoGulag i want to digg in the gulag
[3:05:38] ThatOnneGuy: I'm not late you're late
[3:05:44] Tauruntino: @TheOmyNomy i supported it for years, ran like a champ
[3:05:52] Protonmat: @Giantwaffle how is ram going so far? I would imagine if they add more Y levels it will be unplayable eventually on a server
[3:05:54] CorSPACE: they ran into performance issues on bedrock when expanding the world limits, atleast thats the rumors for delaying it
[3:06:04] ThreeMoonTide: When is 1.18 supposed to come out at this point?
[3:06:04] CorSPACE: for like switch and mobile etc
[3:06:22] Warkless: bedrock hiroREE
[3:06:38] TheOmyNomy: @Tauruntino I'd still be on 7 if it supported my hardware. Sucks that we're forced to move on, but it makes sense.
[3:06:42] Allmostdone: The reason is MS has a hard time making everything flow together. Hence the reason you can find window panes from win 3.1
[3:06:52] Geex204: pretty sure they said you will be able to update your worlds even from before 1.17
[3:06:57] mechoriet: idk just wait for the modded guys to convert the datapack to a mod and no more problem :)
[3:07:04] Becky15675: Runescape is on mobile. thought that info should be out there
[3:07:05] IamWambo_: Drink water channel point reward?
[3:07:06] TheOmyNomy: @Geex204 Not if you use the datapack!
[3:07:10] Tauruntino: @TheOmyNomy I felt the same way for a long time, i still hate how Windows 10 feels like a skin
[3:07:16] Geex204: ooooh gotcha
[3:07:30] Warkless: gachiBASS
[3:07:31] uniquewisdom: gachiBASS
[3:07:31] So_Stormy: out of interest I ask this, if modders can create mods that can do everything that these future updates can do, in only a few weeks, why does it take mojang so long to develop these updates?
[3:07:34] Yogithebaer: he did that with monster
[3:07:36] Internot: wear a camelbak
[3:07:39] DerpyFlerpy: Does that go for realm servers too?
[3:07:40] mechoriet: gachiBASS
[3:07:41] Nexhunter: @TheOmyNomy just wait the best thing is the drivers have already been changed in Win10 so hopefully Win11 doesn't support older drivers to continue removing kernel holes kyleisHmm
[3:07:42] Madarion: PogChamp
[3:07:43] slimjet6498: like the oozinator

[3:08:02] richie385: I thought you where going to say how much you drank like the piss cup but in reverse
[3:08:02] IamWambo_: Just put in an IV 24/7 EZ
[3:08:05] TheOmyNomy: @Tauruntino Exactly! Windows 10 and the introduction of the Metro UI destroyed the "almost" consistent UI Windows had (ignoring the few 3.1 UI apps).
[3:08:05] Allmostdone: Or you could just drink water
[3:08:10] Becky15675: we talking about water or something else ;)
[3:08:14] CocoScruff: if you're on 1.17 vanilla and upgrade to 1.18 the new terrain generation will only affect unloaded chunks?
[3:08:19] Nexhunter: you fucking idiot
[3:08:24] DerpyFlerpy: oh ok I misheard my bad
[3:08:25] So_Stormy: @CorSPACE sometimes they dont feel like it LULW

[3:09:07] Johnson_2004: @Nexhunter just wanted to make a joke about Lttstore, but didn't realise you couldn't type it
[3:09:08] Nexhunter: @TheOmyNomy that one thing they need to just spend time working through instead of going for release as soon as possible literally find every single icon file in the repo and fix it
[3:09:13] M1k3D3l7a: ThatOnneGuy true peepoH

[3:09:53] M1k3D3l7a: Kuroiorb definitely widepeepoHappy
[3:09:53] TheOmyNomy: @Nexhunter I thought that was the idea behind the new theme tbh. Apparently I was wrong LUL
[3:09:54] trapys: @CocoScruff they want to include unvisited chunks aswell, since the blending, that they are working on, would be smoother that way
[3:09:55] kingkiller47: sea level and bedrock
[3:09:56] TimmyVRC: is this the new update?
[3:10:00] CorSPACE: go cave spelunking youll find them way faster

[3:13:42] Becky15675: any new underground dungeons and stuff?
[3:13:46] SlyFall: !datapack
[3:13:46] Str0ngPaprika: I found five diamonds in three hours of mining with datapack installed. Only found more by caving

[3:14:59] Geex204: vein
[3:15:00] Asellus10: Diamonds that spawn to open air will only spawn in veins of 1-3 while underground/water veins spawn more frequently and with more per vein
[3:15:01] ItzPLP: what
[3:15:02] Warkless: X marked ones can grow crystals NODDERS @Giantwaffle
[3:15:05] DerpyFlerpy: yo thats dope
[3:15:05] Deadfox74: Don’t mine the blocks with x on it
[3:15:08] DatoPotatoDato: thats part of the vein
[3:15:09] Wetware: Don't break the blocks with x's on them, that's where the crystal grow
[3:15:12] I_n_s_p_i_r_e: it grow
[3:15:14] kingkiller47: iron blocks generate in large veins
[3:15:18] ItzPLP: their used to grow the amethyst
[3:15:22] DatoPotatoDato: they generate amethyst
[3:15:22] Hitoearth: porp
[3:15:23] muddogjake51: Pog
[3:15:25] CorSPACE: those are the blocks they grow from
[3:15:27] gladflo: Don’t destroy the stuff with a x on it they spawn the crystals
[3:15:33] MechaDom: The ones that grow the crystals,  Do not break them.  They cannot be harvested @Giantwaffle
[3:15:36] dr_destiny: Those are the budding amethyst
[3:15:41] kingkiller47: the cracked ones grow the crystals, but can't be moved
[3:15:42] Warkless: they just take hours to grow KEKW
[3:15:56] dr_destiny: Yup
[3:16:00] drsnaki96: @MechaDom  not even with silk touch?
[3:16:02] lomein43: pepeJAM
[3:16:03] MechaDom: Not even Silk Touch,  Trying to move them with a piston also breaks them
[3:16:14] gladflo: You have to farm them on site
[3:16:15] DatoPotatoDato: Clap
[3:16:16] Gokunerk: ratJAM
[3:16:19] Askjong: Can you move them with a piston?

[3:16:28] Askjong: ..
[3:16:42] PxlSauce: by piston only 2, with pick more than 2 and woth fortune even more
[3:16:46] CorSPACE: you can make a farm with pistons, but breaking with hands give more
[3:16:51] Nt_Jason: waffleAYAYA
[3:16:52] Reydar51: Yes
[3:16:56] DatoPotatoDato: yeah pretty much
[3:17:08] Reydar51: Now you can make Tinted Glass
[3:17:08] IamWambo_: What is amethyst used for?
[3:17:09] DatoPotatoDato: you can craft telescope and tinted glass Pog
[3:17:11] Geex204: this is really scary if you using a eff5 netherrite pick... they break so fast ^^
[3:17:11] Kornel_M: so its a crystal spawner peepoHmm
[3:17:22] PxlSauce: they grow so slow it's honestly more worth to just come by with a fortune pick every few hours
[3:17:25] TheOmyNomy: @Nexhunter This! I remember playing games on Windows 7 non-fullscreen and not having input delay. The DM turned to utter garbage in Windows 8.
[3:17:28] ChadTBiggums: fortune 3 can drop 16 crystals kekw
[3:17:55] SeaOfMadness_: does lava still generate at Y = 10?
[3:17:59] produkteriswf: what can you make with those crystlas?
[3:18:03] slyjedi: when did you start this world? i think i missed it
[3:18:15] TheOmyNomy: It's looking like Windows 11 needs Trusted Platform Module and Secure Boot which is absolutely disgusting.
[3:18:17] TapdancingNinja: so waffle how long before you start making your own minecraft mods
[3:18:21] PxlSauce: ou found a iron vein btw, HUGE veins are also new in this generation
[3:18:21] eternal_divide: im an og, hey waffle
[3:18:22] Str0ngPaprika: Caving is the way to go. The only way I found decent amounts of iron and diamonds
[3:18:39] eternal_divide: !followage

[3:18:58] DoolmasterD: How are you liking the update?
[3:19:05] Driitzz: you pulled a roronoa zoro
[3:19:11] Nexhunter: @TheOmyNomy secure boot and tpm i can get behind on consumer devices but not for gamer stuff sadKEK
[3:19:26] PxlSauce: yes
[3:19:33] SeaOhDee: couldnt you have just died and respawned back at the castle
[3:19:37] YOhodges: these textures are pog jut putting it out there
[3:19:42] CorSPACE: you've found a couple of them
[3:19:45] PxlSauce: there are some tweets by a dev that show the vein gen pretty well
[3:19:46] CoolReal: Yes, regular ones are clusters but now there are also huge veins, not like gregtech but similar
[3:19:50] DerpyFlerpy: Building the beacon is gonna be so much easier now...
[3:19:56] DatoPotatoDato: @Giantwaffle do you feel like the progression with ores feel the same compared to before or different the ores seems more easy to find
[3:19:58] Nexhunter: only cause I don't wanna figure out sourcing a tpm pepeLaugh @TheOmyNomy
[3:20:09] kingkiller47: where you found the iron block was a large vein, some have like a hundred iron
[3:20:09] Moobot: Come join the Waffle House discord https://discord.gg/G5FeeveP3c and chat with the community! Remember to link your Twitch account in the Settings (gear) > Connections for subscriber channels.
[3:20:47] YOhodges: the new generation will be cool looking forward to part two
[3:20:59] Eolri: They are over multiple chunks in this too I think
[3:21:04] DerpyFlerpy: LUL

[3:21:11] eddie_lover: Clap
[3:21:11] mechoriet: KEKw
[3:21:12] SeaOfMadness_: but gregtech also requires  that many resources
[3:21:16] YOhodges: chain reaction
[3:21:17] TheOmyNomy: @Nexhunter Even if they are beneficial to consumers, they shouldn't be enforced. it shouldn't be a requirement because older hardware can't run Windows 11 (see Thinkpad users).
[3:21:19] Crossed_legion: copper
[3:21:23] I_n_s_p_i_r_e: Hardcore run?
[3:21:24] mechoriet: SSSsss
[3:21:25] Automatizer: I've found a few deposits with blocks of raw ore
[3:21:28] Wetware: This is fine FrankerZ CurseLit
[3:21:30] TheOmyNomy: @Nexhunter pepeLaugh
[3:21:30] CoolReal: Gregtech has like 1.6k ores per vein or something ridiculous
[3:21:33] Grinchy_: I like that you don't really NEED an iron farm like you used to
[3:21:52] Nexhunter: @TheOmyNomy thinkpad stuff should of had TPM for a while now my laptop from college back in 2011 had a TPM module and it was thinkpad
[3:21:53] Str0ngPaprika: There is not enough COAL.
[3:22:02] TheOmyNomy: It needs TPM 2.0 @Nexhunter
[3:22:03] PxlSauce: remember the iron ore was surrounded by tuff? if you dig through tuff if there is a lot of iron in it you can continue through the tuff for the vein
[3:22:05] Ruan_A: yes
[3:22:05] Str0ngPaprika: SAME
[3:22:08] itsjustjudge: there is less coal
[3:22:11] PxlSauce: coal is aboe 0
[3:22:11] itsjustjudge: 100%
[3:22:11] Nexhunter: ohhhhh fuck yes but fuck KEKW @TheOmyNomy
[3:22:19] CorSPACE: coal is higher
[3:22:19] dasboot5093: yeah I have zero coal
[3:22:23] Grinchy_: Bedrock's terrain generation is bugged and diamonds are insanely rare
[3:22:24] KuramaTheF0X: yes have to mine at higher levels
[3:22:28] Geex204: i found so much coal that i skipping it.
[3:22:32] TheOmyNomy: @Nexhunter LUL
[3:22:43] itsjustjudge: im making a tree farm for fuel
[3:22:45] PxlSauce: not mountains, just above 0
[3:22:46] Igneous3: you have a whole stack of coal at base
[3:22:46] YOhodges: you used to be able to mine coal on the fly
[3:22:46] itsjustjudge: coal is annoying
[3:22:49] Itzjacki: Yeah, wither skeles
[3:22:52] RazzAllGhull: I'm playing this packet and coal and iron seem much more limited in general
[3:22:57] Nexhunter: now for the windows server and new consumer devices def should be hard requirement @TheOmyNomy
[3:22:59] Ruan_A: can always make a ton of charcoal
[3:23:16] Nexhunter: @TheOmyNomy but yea basic win 11 shouldn't be hard requirement
[3:23:18] pontus_hockey: sticks in inventorty
[3:23:18] kingkiller47: you should look up the ore distribution, ores are spaced out a lot
[3:23:19] PxlSauce: iron can be fortuned
[3:23:22] PxlSauce: now though
[3:23:30] DeadeyeWolff: i have gotten to the point of using trees to make alot of charcoal
[3:23:30] Larklen: pepeSmoke
[3:23:33] PxlSauce: so iron is way easier to gert now
[3:23:44] pavelow85: everything can be fortuned now which is PogChamp
[3:23:49] Driitzz: the sound coming from mining the stone feels off , why does it sound wet
[3:23:52] TheOmyNomy: @Nexhunter I'm sure people will find ways to disable / bypass it in the installer.
[3:23:53] Yumzoi: still so much easier to just build an iron farm though
[3:24:07] mechoriet: or just get that enchant that repairs with xp
[3:24:17] kingkiller47: I think iron is 16 now
[3:24:22] PxlSauce: iron didn't have a prefed layer before, now it does
[3:24:27] Cedge: its 46 for copper, 16 for Iron. 0 for lappis -16 for gold and bedrock for diamond and redstone
[3:24:28] itsjustjudge: moist YEP
[3:24:35] TapdancingNinja: i'm more of a Y10 for diamonds
[3:24:38] UnknownFrenzy: Telescope gameplay incoming widepeepoHappy
[3:24:43] Ras2709: what is amethyst used for?
[3:24:58] Nexhunter: I know windows server 202x gets it for sure but idk if tpm would get put into win 11 @TheOmyNomy

[3:26:55] eddie_lover: Java LUL
[3:26:56] TheOmyNomy: @Nexhunter I think LTSC 2022 is based on 20H2 so it shouldn't need TPM 2.0 or Secure Boot.
[3:27:02] PxlSauce: minecraft doesn't use the graphics card as much I thought?
[3:27:04] kingkiller47: calcite is very rare
[3:27:06] TheOmyNomy: Downside is it won't have the new UI 😭
[3:27:11] Driitzz: Sadge all this money invested for naught

[4:06:59] Internot: that dish is gonna make paste out of those birds
[4:07:09] xaytana: @Giantwaffle what about launching a Snowrunner shortcut through Steam as a non-Steam game to gain access to Steam's input API that supports the DS5 as an input device? I used to do this to get Steam's custom controller mapping/inputs on non-Steam games

[4:09:34] DaGMC: elon the tr0ll
[4:09:36] hassanov112: Elon Musk is a Yikes
[4:09:39] Slimshame: I actually agree
[4:10:06] rodeo_jones: elongated muskrat
[4:10:11] Wazix11: Elon is yikes and Tesla is being a lot like Apple when it comes to repair options and warranties
[4:10:27] M1k3D3l7a: if you attach your winch to a truck you can "drive" two at the same time
[4:10:40] mechoriet: YEP essay time
[4:10:55] Internot: the whole dgaf attitude musk has looks cool in public, but in a company it hasnt gone well
[4:11:00] eddie_lover: Would buy that hybrid mavrick if it didnt cost 30k for the AWD. 4ft bed sucks too
[4:11:01] imShnaz: all innovators become the enemy. but we can all agree Elon is the only reason electric became cool
[4:11:01] M1k3D3l7a: oh ok, I usually use two trucks for that

[4:11:30] Warcry1000: yw
[4:11:32] digitalfalcon: !latency

[4:12:10] mechoriet: coronaS
[4:12:14] itsjustjudge: you're also getting more grip because of your tires im assuming
[4:12:15] mechoriet: Kappa
[4:12:16] StOrMy1100: When i'm on another tab the quality automatically changes to lower and this causes issues with audio going back constantly. Latency is off tho
[4:12:21] orion3373: coronaS
[4:13:01] FalleNM3rC: @StOrMy1100 are you on auto quality?
[4:13:28] mechoriet: YEP bandwidth saving
[4:13:29] M1k3D3l7a: YEP
[4:13:32] hassanov112: True
[4:13:33] wondox: you can avoid it with a userscript
[4:13:38] StOrMy1100: No i'm not on auto quality
[4:13:39] b3nk3nobi: YEP
[4:13:44] mephisto__ttv: yes
[4:13:45] rodeo_jones: yeah and it fucks with the audio bad for me
[4:13:46] doma356: yup
[4:13:47] mephisto__ttv: if you have it on auto
[4:13:51] SmartDoll: google "disable visibility detection" extension to disable that behavior
[4:13:53] itsjustjudge: huh
[4:13:54] N4RCO5: Just use the Alternate Player Browser Extension, much better
[4:13:59] Warkless: There is a workarrounf with scripts which is basically telling twitch "i'm still active tab bruv"
[4:14:01] mechoriet: @StOrMy1100 it even happens on forced quallity
[4:14:13] fafuja: yeah same issue here
[4:14:21] itsjustjudge: jesus that was over an hour ago lol
[4:14:25] TheOmyNomy: I don't think it's an issue on Firefox.
[4:14:27] IamWambo_: Yeah audio starts to lag when im tabbed out
[4:14:43] fafuja: I'm using Edge browser
[4:14:51] wondox: why should they decide that? at least give us an option
[4:14:57] FalleNM3rC: i dont have any issues with it so i guess i never noticed lol
[4:15:14] dennixfailalot: i checked my audio but it wasn't me this time
[4:15:41] rodeo_jones: I'd honestly prefer they buffer the whole video lmao
[4:15:44] Beeerg94: Submitted my masters thesis today. Feels good man
[4:15:49] eddie_lover: PogChamp
[4:15:57] TheOmyNomy: @Beeerg94 EZ Clap
[4:15:59] Maximim01: I think it only became an issue because there were so many people at home with nothing to do at the beginning of the lockdowns last year
[4:16:18] TheSparMan: i also think at alot less load on the server the new way they do it
[4:16:24] Beeerg94: No Phd for me. Need to start working
[4:16:36] TheOmyNomy: LUL
[4:16:36] Moobot: You can sub to Waffle by clicking this neat link -> twitch.tv/giantwaffle/subscribe
[4:17:00] rodeo_jones: or you're VERY passionate about that topic
[4:17:07] marlkarx_: I only began my undergrad in philosophy, without PhD there's not really a lot to do in the field
[4:17:08] ThatHairyGuyOG: PHD can be useful if you want to do research or teach in your field, otherwise it's useless in most fields
[4:17:09] Trobdor: im 2 classes from my robotics masters, I went back cause I couldn't get a job in covid
[4:17:11] Sceda: As someone who spend the last 5 years working on my phd: don't do it
[4:17:18] DaGMC: meth is always pepeSmoke
[4:17:19] tomperino: I just dont understand how anyone can do a PHD in anything else but chemistry and biology
[4:17:19] TapdancingNinja: its amazing for me how diffrent coutries handle it , here in south africa you only go phd and up if you want to go into teaching
[4:17:23] Extremebuddha: better to be a sheldon than a howard?
[4:17:29] bextract: i wouldn't get a phd for the same reason you do your masters, it's not for employability.
[4:17:38] xavier2119: i had a calc teacher that was one of the best teacher's i have ever had. he was incredible
[4:17:44] marlkarx_: A phD is three but you can put it on hold
[4:17:44] Jordan_allen13: they take 3 in the uk
[4:17:52] tomperino: I thought you get paid as a PhD student
[4:18:05] eddie_lover: My sister got a phd in physics/swarm robotics. She loves her research work for Cornell but is miserable working remote
[4:18:14] marlkarx_: A master is kinda mandatory in any field where I live, Bachelors don't really matter anymore
[4:18:17] FalleNM3rC: @tomperino yeah that doesnt happen in the us
[4:18:21] Sceda: depends on the topic. and the country. in germany phd students are paid employees of the university.
[4:18:34] M1k3D3l7a: PepeHands
[4:18:34] bextract: @tomperino you get paid very little and it's for the work you do
[4:18:35] robbie423: @Giantwaffle how did you enjoy gauntlet?
[4:18:52] rodeo_jones: trades gang EZ
[4:19:00] marlkarx_: Well, my father did only High School and after some new laws he was kicked out of Police cuz he didn't get the final exam in High School
[4:19:12] Tanledang: I never finished my Bachelor's Degree, worked my way up at Software Company buy joining their customer support team, and I've now been a Software Engineer for over two years. It's doable, but you have to do your due diligence some way or another.
[4:19:16] xavier2119: xavier2119 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 49 months! my coworker has his bachelor's and he is a fucking moron. I didn't even finish school, it's what you know not who you know.
[4:19:16] DroidBoy: good evening ladies & gentlenerds
[4:19:24] marlkarx_: After he worked like 5+ yeats
[4:19:26] imShnaz: very dimb
[4:19:30] imShnaz: dumb
[4:19:31] xavier2119: fuck i messed that saying up haha
[4:19:44] DroidBoy: germany lost although they made the only goal :D
[4:19:44] imShnaz: work experience is soooooo much more value
[4:19:48] tomperino: @Tanledang very admirable
[4:20:09] FalleNM3rC: @xavier2119 im sure he'll get it
[4:20:15] TapdancingNinja: here you just need a degree if you go in a management position
[4:20:15] MrWizard1974: Sounds backwards
[4:20:27] BobPatience: is hw wrecking poor grandma's fence again? D:
[4:20:28] ChrisHimself: @DroidBoy who asked
[4:20:32] Chronoes: actual credible work experience triumphs over the education received, generally. I don't get it
[4:20:33] marlkarx_: Really weird how educationa systems work together with actual jobs, at least in Romania
[4:20:33] Elliottstwitchlogin: well im fucked then i went straight from secondary school(UK) to working
[4:20:34] JekktStrife: @DroidBoy good game though
[4:20:37] ChrisHimself: KEKW
[4:20:40] NorthernEv: "Welp looks like we'll have to let you go. You learned Pluto was a planet in school"
[4:20:47] imShnaz: school barely prepared me for shit. I learned way more in just a year of work
[4:20:55] DroidBoy: @ChrisHimself I dont care, I did especially for you, because I knew it would piss you off :D
[4:20:59] Yizzles: D:
[4:21:05] DroidBoy: @JekktStrife indeed!
[4:21:06] marlkarx_: But at least where I live university is free
[4:21:08] Sceda: After almost 10 years at university for my bachelor, master and phd i am still treated as a rookie because i have "no industry experience"
[4:21:31] FalleNM3rC: and people go into debt for that KEKW
[4:21:33] Tanledang: It's funny right - I'm a software developer who has finished his bachelor's and I think a ton of CS graduates can't code worth shit, but the more I've been a developer, the more I wish I had those strong computer science, data structure and algorithm fundamentals.
[4:21:44] Tanledang: So it's something I'm not going back to learn
[4:21:45] eddie_lover: My associates in IT couldn't even get me an interview LUL
[4:21:53] ChrisHimself: @DroidBoy good to know that i get pissed off about sportsball
[4:21:54] K3ll06s: thats not school, thats university at least in germany, they dont give a damm before that. Just rinse and repeat the teacher
[4:21:54] Tanledang: Who has never finished his bachelor's rather*
[4:22:01] brenner1265: For me, school was to learn about how to do stuff and then on the job is learning specific topics and applications
[4:22:03] IamWambo_: School is to understand the basics to have a sturdy foundation and then work is to build on that foundation but it always feels like the work teaches so much more
[4:22:05] Orin_The_Sly: IDK why I love this Snowrunner content so much LUL
[4:22:08] marlkarx_: Well, depdends, in my field you really kinda need the teacher to review your work and help you work it out
[4:22:15] DroidBoy: @ChrisHimself you did because of me talking about it :D Wonder why
[4:22:29] ThatHairyGuyOG: Damn US education is expensive
[4:22:32] FalleNM3rC: @Giantwaffle cpcc is about 1k a semester
[4:22:32] Larklen: sheesh
[4:22:36] stadius3737: that assumes you have free housing and food
[4:22:36] Larklen: pepeSmoke
[4:22:42] marlkarx_: Thank God where I live it is free so you can do kinda whatever u want
[4:22:44] Sceda: lol, paying for education. laughs in EU
[4:22:49] CurlyRichard: around 33k is national avgerage
[4:22:55] fafuja: for me degree is only useful if u want to be a doctor or something related coz the equipment is really not cheap and it transmit reliability
[4:22:59] marlkarx_: @Sceda true
[4:23:08] JekktStrife: 300 per semester in Germany ~ average
[4:23:09] 0sem0: study in Europe it's way cheaper
[4:23:10] TapdancingNinja: us education is 10x the cost for a degree here
[4:23:18] ThatHairyGuyOG: I pay 1k euros per year for vet studies in uni (Belgium)
[4:23:19] Chronoes: @Sceda you'll be paying for it when you have a job though
[4:23:22] IamWambo_: Other way I guess it can be said is that school is proof that you arent a slacker as well as give you enough knowledge that you can pull some weight at your first job
[4:23:27] OlivarTheDog: Get a degree no matter what. It gets you past the checkbox on the website
[4:23:31] Sceda: @JekktStrife and thats mostly administrative fees
[4:23:34] FalleNM3rC: the one thing?
[4:23:36] kylexy3: To me it was, six figures in my industry after about 6-7 years working.  More than paid for itself
[4:23:37] mechoriet: WutFace paid to go to school huh ?
[4:23:39] Doomwyte: they pay for college through taxes regardless of how cheap it is
[4:23:39] Lam1799: Yeah I’m currently $100,000 in debt
[4:23:40] Mandorake: The cost is the biggest issue
[4:23:46] N4RCO5: same with Health Care
[4:23:46] brakognite: Common math....LMAO
[4:23:46] daniel1505: Im lucky, in the uk. i did an apprenticeship. So my work taught me on the job but then paid for my degree where i got to attend one day a week while working
[4:23:50] Toxers: Free college, but pay 40-50% in taxes :S
[4:23:51] Mxylopink: it does shittily healthcare aswell
[4:23:52] marlkarx_: Well, my country sucks too, but education is something good
[4:23:57] CurlyRichard: US has ridiculous college debt, EU has low wages
[4:24:01] wartoschi: Also free healthcare LUL
[4:24:02] Yumzoi: Imagine thinking education is the only thing wrong with america Kappa
[4:24:08] TapdancingNinja: @Giantwaffle I am in a 3rd world country namely South Africa and our tertiary education costs less
[4:24:11] Mxylopink: also gun control problems
[4:24:12] pengeg: @Giantwaffle XMR go though?
[4:24:14] marlkarx_: I mean Romania is a pretty weird country with low pay if you are not a programmer
[4:24:20] Veirdan: Free education and health care is definitely hard to compete with.
[4:24:27] njaureg: no education is free
[4:24:27] Larklen: Nothing wrong up here in Canada Kappa
[4:24:28] Protonmat: Argentina : Free education, shitty governants and taxes are insane
[4:24:34] njaureg: anyone who says free education doesnt understand
[4:24:36] eddie_lover: My wifes got 60k+ so far i think. Will never pay it off LUL
[4:24:36] aminkingg: how u dnt get damage when crash with rocks!!!!?????

[4:24:37] imShnaz: let's also admit the world relied on the US funding the development of the vaccine
[4:24:42] GuardMoony: cheap / free education doesn't mean its good education

[4:25:14] Larklen: moon2HUH
[4:25:24] pengeg: @Giantwaffle KEKW those ring sizes will fuc kyou
[4:25:35] marlkarx_: The things is with healthcare (I may be wrong), they take a big cut out of your monthly salary which should go to the government so you get healthcare (which in a way is still paid)
[4:25:35] PeggsterNO: oh god, which insane truck is this
[4:25:40] FalleNM3rC: @Giantwaffle it took days for mine to finish downloading
[4:25:46] ItsOnMax: imagine fucking your datacap if you have one with that
[4:25:56] dennixfailalot: gamer much
[4:26:05] FalleNM3rC: no clue why mine took so long, i have decent internet
[4:26:15] CurlyRichard: are you looking at remote dev jobs  I assume waffle?
[4:26:17] OlivarTheDog: Wait, what is your cap?
[4:26:17] brakognite: what do you think of Crypto?
[4:26:21] imShnaz: no one has free healthcare. your paying for it in some way.
[4:26:34] Mc_Daniel: @Giantwaffle how is your MFS company doing
[4:26:50] njaureg: they use the word free to manipulate the population
[4:26:54] John_Seaman: True
[4:26:55] Mandorake: also healthcare can be done cheaper than the US.  We pay way more than other places for the same services.
[4:26:56] mechoriet: @FalleNM3rC maybe unlucky with only slow nodes
[4:27:00] ThatHairyGuyOG: US pharma is the worst in the world lol
[4:27:05] SqueezeAlicious: i did
[4:27:05] eddie_lover: 1/5 of my income goes to a plan with a 11k out of pocket
[4:27:05] ItsOnMax: I am so glad that eu (or atleast my country) does not have datacaps for home internet
[4:27:07] FalleNM3rC: @imShnaz id rather pay a little every month than have a 100k bill if i get hurt
[4:27:09] pixfix2k2: Socialism KEKW
[4:27:11] CurlyRichard: It cost me like 1k to do a normal routine blood test lol
[4:27:22] imShnaz: we do need to admit that the world relied on the US to fund the dev of the vaccine. but yeah US healthcare is not good
[4:27:27] MrHashbrowns: saw a tip today a lot of hospitals will forgive your m,edical debt if you are near the poverty line
[4:27:28] marlkarx_: The only thing not covered in EU is the dental care
[4:27:36] kingkiller47: an ambulance KEKW
[4:27:37] dennixfailalot: 1k vs 1 mil is sometimes the case
[4:27:39] N4RCO5: if you dont need to use the healthcare in eu its bad for you, but if you need to use it its good cause its cheap
[4:27:47] Drak0v: My aunt who lives in Canada just came to Detroit for surgery.
[4:27:53] Mandorake: @MrHashbrowns step 1: be poor.  step 2: beg for forgiviness
[4:27:55] wannewanwanban: @Giantwaffle i pay 70€ total and i got everything covered even the dentist Pog
[4:27:56] ItsOnMax: 3 HUNDRED 70? per month?
[4:27:58] mechoriet: @mor0mete but you can get a addon that like 10 euros that covers like 75% of the total billl
[4:27:59] hassanov112: Dude, My friend did study in the US, she broke her leg and had to fly back to EU to do a surgery and fly back to the US to continue her study, that is fucked up
[4:28:00] Sceda: the problem with healthcare is not who pays but how much the hospitals charge. prices are way to high compared to the same service in other countries
[4:28:02] tomperino: @mor0mete Speak for yourself, in Belgium dental care is paid for completely for children and yearly visits to get them cleaned/checked
[4:28:12] ThatHairyGuyOG: Imagine losing your house over an ambulance ride
[4:28:20] mechoriet: KEKW 370
[4:28:28] n8level: don't use it*yet* still have a Vegas trip to survive and under 30
[4:28:28] Mandorake: my company helps cover and its still in the 180s i think.  I have a 4000 deductible lol
[4:28:28] Tengokuuu: Do agencies offer anything like that? @Giantwaffle
[4:28:29] eddie_lover: Thats cheaper than my company plan
[4:28:29] ItsOnMax: JFC
[4:28:32] OlivarTheDog: Then $370 is cheap  for self employed
[4:28:39] njaureg: there should be a system for rich people to give extra money to pay for lesser people then rather than requiring everyone to pay for it
[4:28:41] Scullzyy: oh thats just stupid
[4:28:42] Larklen: sheeeeeeeesh
[4:28:46] MrHashbrowns: i dont have insurance because the options they offer are complete shit
[4:28:48] 0sem0: I pay 15 euro a month
[4:28:50] nAZAr1uS: Boooo SOCIALIST ALERT!!! Boooo fucking herd mentality. You look at the world and realise how fucked democracy is
[4:28:52] Runic2584: I had a simple operation and had to stayed in hospital for 3 weeks. I payed nothing
[4:28:52] Cpt_Grunt: Yeah but it comes down to the US system needing to have a checks and balances for people not to abuse the system if we were to implicate a system where we help other people
[4:28:53] CurlyRichard: what kind of deductible do you have then?
[4:28:56] Mandorake: @njaureg lol
[4:28:56] marlkarx_: @mor0mete well for kids in Romania is also free, but when you are over 18 you have to pay (unless you have some sort of deal with the company ur working at)
[4:28:57] njaureg: if they really want to give more money
[4:28:59] tommyfod: my gf got too pissed in Vegas and had an ambance and a brief hospital stay. £3500 oof
[4:29:04] Nifusion: Company pays for 2/3rds and I still pay 200 a month for baseline HDHP health insurance.
[4:29:04] KingKittenDK: I live in Denmark, and yes, we got really high taxes, but our salaries match them. And having free healthcare and education is worth every penny. Having friends and relatives going through hard health issues and not being bankrupt afterwards is worth it
[4:29:05] Larklen: @njaureg ...progressive taxes you mean?
[4:29:09] Kornel_M: in my cauntry if you pay the whole for yourself its 150 for year
[4:29:11] Pbjtime54: benefits of being in the union
[4:29:15] Pbjtime54: dont have to pay shit
[4:29:20] mechoriet: @Giantwaffle i pay like half of what you pay in euros in the netherlands for basic + dental
[4:29:25] Speedkill3r: Shit… my insurance with my company is 400 a month waffleDead

[4:29:46] babyaddalyn: if i go to the doctor i pay exactly 1euro :p
[4:29:54] LeoBM: i pay 30 usd for full cover in Brazil :)
[4:29:57] Elovz: Elovz subscribed at Tier 2. They've subscribed for 9 months! will you say my name right this month, here's a hint (E-Love-z)

[4:30:20] haradok: @Giantwaffle cant say for all countries but here im paying tax and we have pub medical healtcare, for some medical checkups i need to wait half year or pay to go next day
[4:30:21] Driitzz: wtf it's 50$ in canada vs 500$ in the US , for single person
[4:30:44] ThatOnneGuy: They charge my insurance like $200 per shot
[4:30:55] Giubz: So if you didn't have insurance, you'd have to pay for the vaccine?
[4:31:00] thanthio: Yea... i just didn't give them insurrance info
[4:31:01] davethulhu: i thought the shots were free
[4:31:02] Larklen: @njaureg also thats exactly what progressive taxes are, based on level in income. Don't worry, you won't make enough to be affected by it. I'm in Canada, so im happy with out healthcare and how its funded by taxes
[4:31:02] korsk_: mines free in the uk wtf
[4:31:02] TapdancingNinja: worse is insulin
[4:31:02] ThatHairyGuyOG: I read an iconic line a while ago: 'I used to dream about moving to the US, now I'd never move there'
[4:31:03] Tanledang: Not in the US
[4:31:03] Mandorake: well dont forget we need to profit
[4:31:03] ivyee: the shot price is around 2-3 bucks
[4:31:04] thanthio: they dont need that.,...
[4:31:07] Drak0v: I never had to provide any insurance or even a photo id for my shot in the US.
[4:31:07] CurlyRichard: Well they are trying to get back the R&D investment
[4:31:09] hazMatt42069: It's way more e4xpensive to transport thasn produce
[4:31:10] samger0: logistics is expensive
[4:31:12] GuardMoony: its like 15 for the pfizer
[4:31:14] Myekos: Didn't the govt pay the pharmas $300 per dose?
[4:31:15] Syrenthra: its also the production line entirely, not just the cost of the ingredients
[4:31:20] Tanledang: They're gonna charge your insurance unless you don't have any, then the federal government covers it
[4:31:23] marplan94: The research costs money, not the shot itself @Giantwaffle
[4:31:27] Hoofery: i didn't even have to show insurance stuff, never asked for it
[4:31:30] Larklen: pepeSmoke
[4:31:32] Nifusion: @Larklen but what if I'm a repressed millionaire who will someday start making millions Kappa
[4:31:32] Mandorake: research funded by the government lol
[4:31:33] mephisto__ttv: this sounds so scuffed
[4:31:41] ThatOnneGuy: American healthcare in a nutshell. Cost $10 to produce something... make up a price, someone's gonna need it.
[4:31:46] Larklen: @Nifusion OMEGALUL
[4:31:48] LeoBM: pfizer sold for 10 per dose for Brazil
[4:31:51] Extremebuddha: vs pennies for HCQ
[4:31:55] n8level: the raw cost is small but then theres the admin fees of all the health insurance / health industry "management" and billing / profits
[4:31:58] KingKittenDK: Just got my first shot today. Easy walk in, show id, get jabbed, get out..
[4:32:04] Larklen: @njaureg then continue enjoying expensive fucking healthcare I guess??
[4:32:13] Mandorake: @n8level all those things are made to make it hard and expensive by design
[4:32:23] Larklen: KEKW
[4:32:26] vordican: yeah i didn't even have to get out of my car
[4:32:30] Yemtron: drive vaccine and BBQ KomodoHype
[4:32:34] NorthernEv: they are doing drive thrus here in eastern Canada as well
[4:32:41] Larklen: @njaureg OMEGALUL
[4:32:41] Moobot: You can find Waffle's Youtube channel here - https://youtube.com/giantwaffle
[4:32:42] TheSparMan: im so glad we have "free" healthcare here in denmark lol, alot of pressure gone
[4:32:42] Larklen: oh twitch chat
[4:32:47] Myekos: hey Waffle, just getting in after all my errands.  I see your gear in the back is all off.  I guess you saw the power issue stuff.  Good job on shutting down extras.
[4:32:48] SheepsAholy: too convenient... sus
[4:32:51] Runic2584: Pfizer shots are free in my country
[4:32:53] Mandorake: @Larklen no let us fight
[4:32:57] n8level: the reduction of administrative overhead is one of the biggest arguments for socialized healthcare, no more forms, no more billing cycles, no more % profits on every transaction
[4:33:06] Twigie_: i got the vaccine now i give off a wifi signal
[4:33:24] Yumzoi: @njaureg why because it's got the word socialism in it?
[4:33:31] Yemtron: drive up vaccines and BBQ in texas KomodoHype
[4:33:31] CurlyRichard: if I could be a 5G hotspot I would inject that into myself
[4:33:33] Larklen: @Mandorake it's like teaching a wall how to sit Kappa
[4:33:33] Mandorake: if only we could've predicted the increase in population in texas.  dangit.
[4:33:36] N4RCO5: How are tthey not ready for heat in texas?
[4:33:40] crossjoint_: I love how just dying is a better option to ppl than moving tax money from military to healthcare
[4:33:41] Chronoes: My dad used to say when he was in US, that the family there went to visit the graves of their relatives and it was literally just a drive-through graveyard, they never got out of the car
[4:33:44] fafuja: 45c? holy shit
[4:33:52] enderslug: Only in America, imagine having to get out of your car pppft
[4:33:55] ItsOnMax: look, that powerline in game looks like the powerlines of Texas
[4:33:56] Driitzz: LUL USA is so weird
[4:33:57] Brisson: i wish it was like this here in brazil
[4:33:57] Extremebuddha: that is still better than Cali for brownouts
[4:34:02] FalleNM3rC: rip trees
[4:34:05] FlammAlpha: D: the poor trees
[4:34:08] Kamis0ri89: its what i did. I walked to go get a pop and shot lol
[4:34:11] n8level: swimming in vaccines because red states wont get the shot
[4:34:12] mmmint: HolidayTree wtf
[4:34:14] Sceda: @n8level in germany we have mandatory healthcare but still aroun 100 different providers
[4:34:16] mechoriet: oh yeah i can't wait to have swamp seat again when we get 45c again here with super high humidity
[4:34:26] CurlyRichard: Couple states have 70% adults immunized so the demand is swindling down in our country
[4:34:28] Yemtron: free burger!
[4:34:29] TheSparMan: @Larklen i like all the american aguments for against healthcare and stuff, its so weird for someone like me that lives in EU/Denmark
[4:34:32] man1cmike: not true
[4:34:40] man1cmike: I was just in vegas...
[4:34:47] Twigie_: un american KKona

[4:35:07] Myekos: every place I went today in Austin didn't require a mask if were vaccinated
[4:35:10] Bandoslord: My work gives $75 to workers that got both shots
[4:35:13] Nexhunter: @Chronoes depends upon timing like my grandparents grave sites they try and keep folks from the land during the thawing of the ground to reduce damage
[4:35:18] n8level: @Sceda mandatory != socialized healthcare? you've got a public/private system right? everyone can get the basics or you can buy more coverage?
[4:35:19] Nifusion: @TheSparMan  I'd hate to pay 20% of my paycheck in healthcare taxes when instead I could being paying 20% of my paycheck on paying for insurance directly Kappa
[4:35:19] Larklen: @TheSparMan who knows. ITs like someone asking for help, you offer it, and they get mad at you LUL
[4:35:21] mechoriet: @Giantwaffle i mean just take it with you so you atleast have it KEKW
[4:35:27] skiflowtowski: I live in Vegas, you don’t have to
[4:35:27] EeyoretheLost: I have been playing omnifactory and i just feel so slow at doing it
[4:35:31] TapdancingNinja: From what I understand even with the vax you won't get sick but can still pass it on to other people
[4:35:33] Drakoleech: The vaccine is not an end all be all, they still advise you to not be stupid
[4:35:35] TarMonA: haa that saying where your papers @Giantwaffle
[4:35:41] Nexhunter: and or if they recently mowed the grass and are prepping for veterans day @Chronoes
[4:35:47] DannyAwsume: i was there beginning in may and they required masks pretty much 24/7
[4:35:48] TheSparMan: @Larklen so true
[4:35:53] Nifusion: @Drakoleech you saying the vaccine isn't a greenlight to resume licking doorknobs? Shit.
[4:36:10] Chronoes: @Nexhunter yeah I don't know the details but it was during summer. it's just hilarious to think, no such practice exists here
[4:36:13] John_Seaman: THICC MASK
[4:36:30] JadedOnyx19: what do u get @Giantwaffle? i need some good ones
[4:36:33] crossjoint_: I'm guessing most people that don't have an issue with US healthcare are either still on their parents or just rich anyways so doesnt' matter
[4:36:37] TheSparMan: @Nifusion but when you live in it, its not that bad, im not trying to sell it, it just a weird thing for someone born in it to think about it
[4:36:41] Piper_Primed: So thic you cant breathe?
[4:36:48] mechoriet: yeah i got one of those made of that swimsuit kinda stuff
[4:36:53] Nexhunter: @Chronoes maybe if it veterans or memorial day timing they might of been doing some grass maintenance but yea that odd to not get out and actually ya know visit the grave kyleisShrug
[4:36:53] Georyn82: With free healthcare in Germany. I got my second shot of Biontech/Pfizer 28th April this year
[4:36:55] mechoriet: thats washable
[4:37:00] TarMonA: if they need to know.  they should be able to get that info before asking you for your papers
[4:37:23] Nifusion: @TheSparMan Oh I completely get it. Numerically, Americans don't get that it's literally the same, if not better, for everyone making less than buku dollars in salary, which is statistically all of us LUL
[4:37:26] Mandorake: @Giantwaffle did you ever get all that shit that spilled out when you went the wrong way and had to get a crane?
[4:37:31] KingKittenDK: We just lifted the mask requirements everywhere than when standing up in public transport. So weird going grocery shopping without a mask..
[4:37:35] mechoriet: back when it began i just 5 different types online hoped one or 2 where good fitting

[4:39:09] TheSparMan: @Nifusion yea i get it, we laugh alot about it here in EU, but i understand the fear of change, so its probaly just that, if they forced the change i think they wouldnt mind it
[4:39:10] Syrenthra: @seannyy_ I mean, it sounds it said like that, but you need to pay to do everything
[4:39:10] Myekos: I'm paying 10% of my very high salary for healthcare.  I'd rather give that 10% so everyone could have healthcare
[4:39:19] DatoPotatoDato: man i aint payiin 24k ima just have my wife give birth in the tub Kappa
[4:39:20] n8level: 24k to have a kid, how much for a vasectomy ? SeriousSloth
