[0:28:02] JommyBee: is constantan the best pick right now?
[0:28:16] ninopanda: @ItWasHarry quit attention seeking like i said in the response. you keep it up and we will remove you permanently.
[0:28:25] daemonaedryn: @Sn00zr Essentially a field that if you put specific blocks in it wil minitiarize it and create new blocks
[0:28:40] JommyBee: PogChamp
[0:28:48] daemonaedryn: I literally made my second large room in like 20 mins

[0:29:40] daemonaedryn: Maybe check out the calculator ingame @Giantwaffle
[0:30:08] Narcotical: @ItWasHarry "Hur dur check my followage" is not the way
[0:30:11] Immp: @ItWasHarry you are not the only person in the stream that has been "following years" but not all of us are seeking validation for said follow age
[0:30:18] kingdigun: It looks like there's a miniturazation recipe for each cube

[0:30:47] daemonaedryn: Cheap as hell
[0:30:53] Invalidm_: Nino we must be crazy
[0:31:13] kingdigun: does the 7x7 also need the 5x5?
[0:31:31] ninopanda: @Invalidm_ its almost like i should start pointing out my sub number since that is so high KEKW
[0:31:41] drsnaki96: are pearls doable atm?
[0:31:50] daemonaedryn: You can make one with this method

[0:34:35] ninopanda: @obtoe_ when is it?!?!?!?!
[0:34:36] mechoriet: @Narcotical not false KEKW
[0:34:37] zh_n_s: Like yelling, "im not resisting!", while resisting?

[0:35:13] SobekRuffian: imagine using twitch chat KEKW wait
[0:35:26] Invalidm_: susHmm @UltraScientism
[0:35:36] obtoe_: @ninopanda they are doing it 3 times first in silverstone, then monza
[0:35:36] Moobot: Support Waffle by using his Epic creator code: Giantwaffle
[0:35:42] ninopanda: @mechoriet oh my monza sprint race..... i wanna see it!!!!!!!
[0:35:43] JommyBee: i twisted my ankle this morning peepoSad
[0:35:53] Invalidm_: peepoSad
[0:35:54] JommyBee: stepped of a step ladder and landed awkardly
[0:35:59] mechoriet: @ninopanda better then a clusterfuck of a quali
[0:36:10] pupupuputter: im not resisting! (trys to kick officer loose so i can run)
[0:36:11] ninopanda: true
[0:36:33] JommyBee: but more time spent watching streams while i rest peepoBlonket
[0:36:50] mechoriet: not this weekend
[0:36:52] JommyBee: yeah im not sure im a fan
[0:36:54] Narcotical: Not this weekend
[0:36:58] Hazeeed_: they didnt confirm this weekend?
[0:37:01] RussianRainbowTV: ???
[0:37:02] Narcotical: Silverstone
[0:37:02] 0x4273: race to set the order of race KEKW
[0:37:13] OvershotTae: basically a heat race
[0:37:16] SobekRuffian: qualifying for qualifying OMEGALUL
[0:37:16] JommyBee: its weird
[0:37:24] mechoriet: "silverstone monza brazil" they are saying here
[0:37:26] obtoe_: july 18th
[0:37:26] RussianRainbowTV: bruh I'd just quit
[0:37:34] Rangetuur: i think you were making lava already somwhere
[0:37:34] Hazeeed_: ngl, i see the exact same result happening compared to normal quali
[0:37:34] obtoe_: then monza
[0:37:35] pupupuputter: whens f1 gonna do dirt track like nascar did
[0:37:37] x_Crawley: To be fair, they aren't planning on a permanent change, they are just trying it out at a couple specific races.
[0:37:38] Ikzijndenjos: its more f2 like
[0:37:39] Hakmann23: Hakmann23 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 10 months! 
[0:37:45] Bkmoto28: coould be good but is mor for tv time
[0:37:46] jorenvdw: what do they think to achieve with this ?
[0:37:48] PsPiN: 1 lap pace is so much different from race pace, imo it could be a good idea
[0:37:49] 0x4273: making F1 cheaper with cost caps then adding anoother race to the weekend KEKW OMEGALUL
[0:37:50] mechoriet: portugaaal
[0:37:50] Narcotical: Portimao
[0:37:55] TheKnopex: portimao this weekend
[0:38:17] Kintano392: Portugal CARALHO
[0:38:20] The_SilentGuardian: Stupid idea in my opinion. Just makes the normal race longer by the length of the sprint race.
[0:38:20] mechoriet: D: quali is fun
[0:38:22] Narcotical: I don't get it though. I think qualifying is great
[0:38:33] obtoe_: @0x4273 yeah that's the only thing im confused about
[0:38:40] The_SilentGuardian: Quali stays, but on friday
[0:38:43] Ikzijndenjos: F2 has a sprint race for some years now
[0:38:45] Narcotical: Only time we get to see these cars on new tyres with 0 fuel going all out
[0:38:45] Rangetuur: i think you were making lava already somewhere
[0:38:47] 0x4273: lets be honest qualifying is boring except the last lap of each session
[0:38:48] Kintano392: It's all about the money. They want to increase viewership fridays and saturdays
[0:39:09] Totoshimoto: damn
[0:39:31] jorenvdw: do you think they will try to pivot only to sprint races and no qualy ?
[0:39:38] TheKnopex: that would be nice :D
[0:39:40] 0x4273: that sounds like a good weekend KEKW
[0:39:42] The_SilentGuardian: @0x4273 Disagree, quali has jeopardy, especially in changing weather.
[0:39:43] Kintano392: *Mazespin sorry to correct you
[0:39:46] Narcotical: They usually bring spare chassis though, at least the bigger teams
[0:39:55] brenner1265: Mazepin 👉 monkaCrash
[0:40:04] mechoriet: KEKW budget cap also KEKW
[0:40:05] obtoe_: @brenner1265 lmao
[0:40:10] Narcotical: The mechanics are crazy though
[0:40:19] warlock_1984: o/ all
[0:40:28] x_Crawley: And all the set-up work gets thrown out the window.
[0:40:36] Narcotical: I mean, it's a valid concern but they can actually fix a car if need be
[0:40:36] Lajnuss_: hi Waffle, played your game last night and it was awesome! ^^
[0:40:49] SobekRuffian: ye, no way of making the spare car setup identical without testing
[0:40:50] mechoriet: @Narcotical true they rebuild max's overnight one time ages ago
[0:40:52] Kintano392: I read somewhere that a nose is 200k if you account for R&D
[0:41:01] obtoe_: if it goes well it could be the new format
[0:41:05] UltraScientism: Can someone link Waffle's LD game?
[0:41:08] The_SilentGuardian: @x_crawley_ Not really, set-ups should be copied onto new car.

[0:42:48] punkgeek: It's not even just accidental differences. Max likes a slightly unstable car cause he can manage it and it turns faster
[0:42:49] Rangetuur: @Giantwaffle what is in the room next to the tank of lava?
[0:42:58] TheKnopex: @ooBigRedoo 1000hp out of 1.8L is crazy
[0:43:02] Narcotical: 1.6 I thiunk?
[0:43:03] Kintano392: 1.6L
[0:43:04] NoSkillAnt: of what engine?
[0:43:04] SobekRuffian: 1.6
[0:43:05] Keoonik: 1,6l
[0:43:08] Azafure: Pogcraft

[0:44:28] Ruver3D: lub
[0:44:28] mechoriet: lube ?
[0:44:30] Narcotical: And cooling
[0:44:30] UltraScientism: oil cooling?
[0:44:31] punkgeek: warm oil is a great lubricant/protectant
[0:44:31] FraKo23: oil my doodle
[0:44:41] The_SilentGuardian: Oil
[0:44:47] zh_n_s: Fast as fuck boi
[0:44:49] Tabakhase: not even thaaaat fast...
[0:44:51] Twin5un: yes
[0:44:59] fujinblaze: what are we working on right now?
[0:45:00] AtchTwoOh: a dentist drill goes crazy fast, i think like +20k rpm
[0:45:02] The_SilentGuardian: Carries the heat away
[0:45:06] pupupuputter: think about the timing adjustment at that rpm
[0:45:09] Cozmo300: 266 revolutions per second
[0:45:10] arcticae: some cnc spindles run 80000+ rpm
[0:45:11] SobekRuffian: damn thats almost hamster on wheel speeds
[0:45:16] punkgeek: Rotary / wankel engines are the real mind fuck
[0:45:26] GenerlKat: the machining is just insane
[0:45:37] nick43087: probably true about that. @monkeypalmstrike
[0:45:39] AtchTwoOh: like up to 800k+ rpm
[0:45:44] AtchTwoOh: dentists drills
[0:45:45] CesarVentura: oh! and add a whole hybrid system into it. no big deal
[0:46:07] Fnack: you realize the turbo spins at 100k to 200k rpm with temperatur on one side of 800K and 340K on the other side?
[0:46:09] Frozen_Shadow1: make a computer craft robot for this to place it's self :)
[0:46:09] arcticae: high frequency machining
[0:46:15] Tabakhase: medical centrifuges can hit 100k
[0:46:25] isot0nic: Platter HDD goes to 20k
[0:46:28] Jcweaver: the hardest part about spinning things that fast is breaking the sound barrier, which is why plane props don't spin over 4k rpm
[0:46:35] UltraScientism: And HDD heads float about 10 nanometers above the platters. Bobbles my mind.
[0:46:43] mechoriet: peepoShy there looking under sn15's skirt it makes me uncomfortable
[0:46:59] The_SilentGuardian: 1000 degree c brake pads
[0:47:01] SobekRuffian: KEKW
[0:47:02] Tabakhase: and now think of a first gen ipod KEKW
[0:47:08] NoSkillAnt: a turbine in a turbo can spin up to 150k rpm depending on turbo
[0:47:11] Shuruzou: Hard drive technology is way more advanced than people think
[0:47:24] SC2_DeeJayWoo: !eth
[0:47:24] Invalidm_: @mechoriet susHmm
[0:47:24] Sander20011: How about a black hole at 2 million rpm
[0:47:27] Klorell: i heard some politicians can turn their jacket at hundreds of thousands rpm
[0:47:37] Twin5un: KEKW ^
[0:47:37] Tabakhase: you can do a lot mechanical, so its not that hard rly...
[0:47:44] SobekRuffian: not to mention that 16k rpm is moving something that is inconsistent, like using the clutch bumps in the road ect
[0:47:45] OccmsRzr: Hard drives also rely on a cushion of dense air so they don’t function above certain elevations with out modification @giantwaffle
[0:47:45] isot0nic: HDDs are helium filled and platters are ceramic or special aluminium grade
[0:47:53] tee_orion: is more like rhythm for engines
[0:48:00] SC2_DeeJayWoo: @Giantwaffle have you heard about new sprint quali for F1 ?
[0:48:08] orillion: @Giantwaffle less drag
[0:48:10] UltraScientism: or the fact that HDDs correctly work for almost a decade 24/7 at 5600+ rpm
[0:48:10] orillion: LUL
[0:48:11] Shuruzou: No smoother opperation
[0:48:12] SobekRuffian: less "air" resistance too i think
[0:48:15] Shuruzou: Less friction
[0:48:18] Miestro: it also reduces wear
[0:48:19] UltraScientism: helium is for cooling
[0:48:22] Hedera_tH: @SC2_DeeJayWoo We talked about it just
[0:48:25] Varnstuf21: sn15 test flight this week?
[0:48:30] Tabakhase: all drives are sealed anyhow
[0:48:32] FairePlaie: i already see a tool turn to 15k rpm and is very fast, but 150k is crasy for me
[0:48:34] SC2_DeeJayWoo: @Hedera_tH ok i will check the vod
[0:48:36] DecoyOcelot: longevity of SSDs is probably the last hurdle
[0:48:38] mechoriet: why 2 ?
[0:48:42] dogma802: Giant data centers are going to use disk drives until SSD is cheaper
[0:48:42] aylamar: It's going to be a while until SSDs will reach the same data density of platter drives
[0:48:46] drissical: Some business still use tape
[0:48:47] Andee2: Platters also have longevity going for them
[0:48:55] Shuruzou: @DecoyOcelot I have never had a problem with that yet
[0:48:55] mechoriet: oh yeah main and header?
[0:49:00] orillion: @marqueezus and good ol magnetic tape :p
[0:49:03] Twin5un: 2 static fires ?
[0:49:05] Twin5un: why ?
[0:49:05] dogma802: @DecoyOcelot SSDs are inherently more reliable than disk sicne there are no mechanical parts
[0:49:17] tee_orion: hdd will always be kind on cold storage
[0:49:26] daemonaedryn: Ok... do you remember how to switch tanks so it can collect water like a bucket pepeLaugh
[0:49:27] AComfyKnight: you can use the copy-paste gadget to make that go a bit faster
[0:49:28] DecoyOcelot: @Shuruzou most people dont, im talking like NAS systems and server storage that do more than most
[0:49:28] UltraScientism: @aylamar I think they are already better on density. They are losing on megabytes per $
[0:49:29] The_SilentGuardian: Depends how you use the memory, dont need high speed for rarely accessed data, density is a big factor though.
[0:49:30] Twin5un: oh ok
[0:49:34] fujinblaze: what are we making and why please
[0:49:47] mechoriet: falcon is only once tho i think
[0:49:50] SobekRuffian: @aylamar primarily ssd's are already better than hdd density wise
[0:49:56] fujinblaze: thank you strimmer
[0:50:06] grimmn: @marqueezus they still currently have shorter average lifespans before wearing out
[0:50:07] UltraScientism: non volatile
[0:50:10] McFatbutt: zes
[0:50:13] SobekRuffian: technically no, but lasts a long time
[0:50:15] dogma802: Yes, all drives are non volatile
[0:50:16] lvyEartman: can someone link me to the ludum dare games?
[0:50:17] Karumaru_: Depends on the kind of flash memory
[0:50:20] Shuruzou: @Shuruzou Ah yes I see it could be a problem there
[0:50:22] Janzert: nonvolatile and yes
[0:50:24] Jcweaver: there are both volatile and nonvolatile flash memory
[0:50:24] tee_orion: people also forget ssd are can lose data due to power cuts and higher fail chance
[0:50:27] Tabakhase: yea ssd is "better" in every single regard including space & reliability - just not price KEKW

[1:10:25] Rawb_: TheResinger nope
[1:10:27] lalashkin_G: @Giantwaffle  IMO it's like with new science discoveries. Scientists (Valve) discovering and making proof of concepts and others find a way how to profit and market from it
[1:10:27] WGG25: there are 2 major games using source 2: dota2, cs:go
[1:10:29] WGG25: but that's all
[1:10:32] arcticae: smells like a parabolic tech debt problem
[1:10:33] Stormflare: valve is full GaaS now

[1:11:00] Akunin_EQ: It's bad optics for the company to fail on their flagship product.
[1:11:00] mechoriet: @WGG25 csgo uses elements of source2 but still runs on source 1
[1:11:03] Rawb_: CS:GO only uses Source 2 for the UI, not the actual game engine
[1:11:04] Azafure: csgo isn't on source 2 tho only the UI is source 2
[1:11:18] WGG25: oh i forgot about alyx, cause i don't have VR Sadge
[1:11:20] Frag_Magnet_: So it's like Kali for game Devs
[1:11:23] Diavolio: If the corporate culture at Valve is still "work on what you want", and Valve is still insanely profitable, then I suppose it adds up.
[1:11:28] babyaddalyn: we need more games like half life
[1:11:30] Stellrow: but how much will the engine cost to use sumW

[1:20:56] coolcake2: my needle is 1/99th burger of a washing machine
[1:21:00] mechoriet: 0.63mm is 23 guage
[1:21:03] Yogithebaer: gauge like shotgun shells?
[1:21:12] PlaguedV: how much is 28 gauge in loan payments ?
[1:21:15] Rawb_: can't you use mm for that?
[1:21:35] OgivaNuclear: AWG = American Wire Gauge
[1:21:35] mechoriet: KEKW there is not even a 28G needlle
[1:21:35] winnerab: isn't guage also barrel, as in shotgun barrels?
[1:21:37] DakotaFoxes: or earings are in gauge
[1:21:38] Conductor41: gauge is commonly used for thickness in wire/sheet metal . higher gauge = thinner
[1:21:39] Allmostdone: yea the US gauge system is really really old and weird
[1:21:39] obylix: gauge also used for thickness of sheet metal
[1:21:40] Janzert: catheters are in gauge as well
[1:21:43] grimmn: gauge is one of those silly units thats derived really strangely
[1:21:48] SobekRuffian: imagine calling 28 gauge "0.36 mm" pepeLaugh
[1:21:48] deathbytray16: yes shotguns also use gauge

[1:22:34] TuxLafitte: No frenzied coding today...  danSad
[1:22:38] Larklen: would a 12 guage shotguin just refer to the size of the pellets?
[1:22:42] mechoriet: They originated in the British iron wire industry at a time when there was no universal unit of thickness
[1:22:47] r3dshig: 1lb of lead / gauge = weight of 1 pellet for shotguns
[1:22:51] Chronoes: what
[1:22:56] Rawb_: in the US yeah but not in EU
[1:22:58] Tabakhase: mm² devCheck
[1:22:59] grimmn: gauge is measured as the number of lead balls of the same diameter that weigh one pound
[1:23:00] EZTEQ: You say: i need 2.5mm² wire LUL
[1:23:05] tawknboutwillis: @Larklen no. shot is measured a different way.
[1:23:12] SobekRuffian: Gauge generally just means using some form of non-standard or non-direct measuring. Such as 12 gauge means it takes 12 lead balls to equal a pound
[1:23:20] winnerab: mainly diameter, but for wires it's also a measure of how much current it can safely handle
[1:23:21] bovabova: gauge is so wierd
[1:23:22] Alucard_KOD: Shotguns are just big needles
[1:23:24] Rawb_: @grimmn2 yo wtf KEKW

[1:23:56] minegryf9: it depends onthickness as well
[1:23:57] Leb_ghost: You 100% right, that’s the proper way to use the American wire gauge for calculating wire size
[1:23:57] BIRDFRUIT: increases
[1:23:59] cooljas19: increases

[1:41:34] Setinal44: Aqueous doesnt need power?
[1:41:46] kommendorfindus: I saw Genna Bain streaming earlier and got really sad bout TBs death again Sadge
[1:41:48] rvg15: it needs augments
[1:41:54] bovabova: How come you have materials to make a nuclear generator but not a simple coal powered generator
[1:41:55] Reach_Beyond: feel like this pack encourages going afk

[1:42:08] DecoyOcelot: nuclear craft water gen is cheep as well

[1:48:37] Surge43: time to automate
[1:48:46] Setinal44: first enderpearl to make a crucible and put thorium dust in an isotope separator, make a block of thorium *30 for 61x melting

[2:04:10] daemonaedryn: Have you built the fusion core?
[2:04:13] Larklen: KEKW
[2:04:13] Setinal44: turn it sideways, put a chest next to it, enable auto import and export and then load it up like your smelting setup
[2:04:29] JBourden: KEKW cooks into nothing
[2:04:54] CultOfNeurisis: are waffle's vods unavailable? wanted to watch this stream from beginning
[2:05:04] germanmikrowave: @Giantwaffle did you purge your vods?

[2:06:20] Larklen: 35 yup
[2:06:23] CultOfNeurisis: are vods purged because of the music during ludum dare?
[2:06:28] akapuddinpop: what's that?
[2:06:29] Larklen: It do be
[2:06:33] eCosit3: Happened in 86
[2:06:49] mechoriet: @CultOfNeurisis don't think so
[2:06:54] Foooks: 26 April 1986
[2:06:54] Chronoes: nope
[2:06:57] Weras57: nope
[2:06:57] vuuriswarm: yes
[2:06:59] akapuddinpop: is that the place that's still abandoned in europe?
[2:07:00] Lord_arcon: Nah
[2:07:00] Sui_Ume: not at all
[2:07:01] Shaggy_Lives: no
[2:07:03] aundros: It started it i think?
[2:07:08] LikeAKnife: That's what they said at the end of the miniseries
[2:07:10] Cobrian: Barely a blip.
[2:07:12] TheIrishGuy: Underlining thing
[2:07:13] teej_dv: pretty sure it was cause of communism KEKW
[2:07:16] Allmostdone: It was the dawn of mutant kind
[2:07:20] Chronoes: cold war is just a period, not an actual war
[2:07:23] Lord_arcon: it was they started to opening up more to the outside world that did it @Giantwaffle
[2:07:25] mechoriet: KEKw twitch broke there vod explorer
[2:07:25] CultOfNeurisis: @mechoriet vods aren't available though
[2:07:35] CultOfNeurisis: ah
[2:07:36] LikeAKnife: Chernobyl accident was a huge blow to the soviet union
[2:07:39] mechoriet: @CultOfNeurisis i think its broke
[2:07:46] CultOfNeurisis: okay, sweet
[2:07:49] LikeAKnife: I'm quite sure it triggered the downfall
[2:07:54] mechoriet: "These videos are temporarily unavailable." with the ghost image
[2:07:59] Invalidm_: Imagine if Chernobyl never had the accident though susHmm
[2:08:19] NordESA: hello truljiHappy
[2:08:20] Shaggy_Lives: Nuclear energy is safe .. opponents use Chernobyl but cut corners
[2:08:20] Kaylome97: but an rbmk reactor cant explode
[2:08:23] Larklen: yeah but we didnt really know that scope until fairly recently though, right?
[2:08:26] HurricaneHenry: Work some more on Dig Deep man
[2:08:27] mechoriet: widepeepoHappy hi nord
[2:08:28] Invalidm_: NORD PETTHECUTIE
[2:08:30] Larklen: like wihtin past 10 years
[2:08:34] StOrMy1100: They didn't make the explosion public for a couple days or a week right?
[2:08:38] aundros: @Giantwaffle If we are to believe the miniseries, it made the general public loose faith in the perfect system, hence contributing to the fall. Don't know if its true or not
[2:08:41] a_brink: I think it impacted their image which they were more worried about. Like how it showed they were weak
[2:08:45] Allmostdone: Wasn't the first time we saw Magneto?
[2:08:47] NordESA: @mechoriet @Invalidm_ widepeepoHappy
[2:09:06] NordESA: watched your VOD from yesterday for the deadline, cool stuff
[2:09:11] UECNSNemesis: they're playing their own version of deeper and deeper, but it's bigger and bigger instead
[2:09:11] Merc_Roy: soviet union was collapsing cause of internal corruption and literally trying to copy everything America made or invented and either having the incomplete plans or subpar materials in both military and commerical applications
[2:09:23] Solitude411: the chernobyl mini series was so good but idk how accurate it was
[2:09:30] PudTV: You seen the footage of the transport chopper flying over the reactor site and melting? That was crazy as hell
[2:09:40] a_brink: But it seemed internally they were crushed over it
[2:09:42] Lord_arcon: One thing that is funny is that Sweden was one of the countries that "found out" something happend cause the radiations detectors went of cause the wind had blown the radiation over Scandinavia @Giantwaffle
[2:09:45] Shaggy_Lives: wait .. did he refer to the soviet union as the perfect system or nuclear energy?  lol
[2:09:46] Larklen: China widePepeLaugh
[2:09:47] a_brink: I mean I know we would be
[2:09:49] Weras57: it was a factor that was added on top of bad reforms that made it fall
[2:09:58] crazyryan090909: I heard that the miniseries was somewhat inaccurate, especially in their depiction of radiation burns and sickness
[2:09:58] Sui_Ume: @Giantwaffle well, ussr was as big as half the worl KEKW
[2:10:05] Allmostdone: all so was Soviet Union trying to keep up with the US military spending?
[2:10:26] remess0: they van clean radiation  its all a lie
[2:10:44] hallis21: 3.6, not good, not terrible
[2:10:45] Nincy1986: it was
[2:10:54] a_brink: @hallis21 I get that reference KEKW
[2:10:56] seargeantbilko: it can cause heart failure
[2:10:56] mechoriet: @CultOfNeurisis if i filter by Past Broadcasts i can see all the vods :)
[2:10:57] Allmostdone: cleaning rads? hmmm that seems unlikely
[2:11:00] LikeAKnife: @crazyryan090909 yes, they overemphasized that a bit. Plus exposed people don't truely remain radioactive like that
[2:11:06] Merc_Roy: the radiation penates your cell walls and destroy the walls so the cells just literally like melt since theres nothing there to contain the insides of cells
[2:11:13] Larklen: You ever watch the Kyle Hill video on the guy whose head got struck in a particle accelerator?
[2:11:16] XhipGamer: how about a hopper to collect the items?
[2:11:16] SkywardDev: How r u liking this pack Waffle
[2:11:17] Markoala: Markoala subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 17 months! Hi <3
[2:11:35] remess0: look at released cia docs. its all there
[2:11:38] Navist: He was a scientist I thought.
[2:11:40] Larklen: Nah it was one of the researchers/scientists
[2:11:40] hallis21: no, he was a tech
[2:11:43] theunseen010: he was a tech
[2:11:48] avatar_94: basically a five hour movie.
[2:11:59] Navist: He went blind the next day or something.
[2:12:03] Larklen: He saw the bright white/blue flash but had vision
[2:12:04] babyaddalyn: wats the name of that movie
[2:12:07] Allmostdone: ouch. Can he move things with his mind?
[2:12:13] Fourseason_: The light bulb that was supposed to be on to indicate the accelerator was in use burnt out seconds before he got to the door
[2:12:15] Navist: Recovered vision ect but he was messed up for the rest of his life.
[2:12:15] Fourseason_: Talk about bad luck
[2:12:16] Larklen: Finished up his duties then went right home KEKW
[2:12:16] Xicer_TV: He turned into Dr. Manhattan
[2:12:22] theAxmAN: have you watch trial of the chicago 7? first moveie in a long time too capture my attention
[2:12:28] winnerab: temporarily, i guess dead people aren't blind, that's true
[2:12:28] Navist: Even lost coverage for his treatment ect. It wasn't pretty.
[2:12:31] robsta107: did he get the power to run extremely fast too?
[2:12:36] Larklen: Yeah this one, its wild
[2:12:45] Allmostdone: if he just went blind then he was lucky
[2:13:12] Fourseason_: Have you watched his video on the demon core? So good
[2:13:12] Mr_Perril: The "Shortyy & Waffle Tentacle Diaries" best fanfic on the we(e)bs
[2:13:12] Moobot: Support Waffle by using his Epic creator code: Giantwaffle
[2:13:18] Tahj____: Russia and their low security science experiments
[2:13:27] santosh_1007: wow
[2:13:34] Not_Tomas1: I JUST WON DIG DEEP, i didnt even know it was possible
[2:13:44] Apparentthreat: I've always been wondering that YEP
[2:13:52] AtchTwoOh: don't you get that everyday with literal light?
[2:13:52] winnerab: @Tahj____ other countries were'nt better, look up devil's sphere
[2:13:59] remess0: they have stuff you see in star wars. the gov has stuff you woudnt believe me if i told you
[2:14:00] Larklen: yeah, he did a video on that too KEKW
[2:14:01] grimmn: I mean that happens all the time to all of us, this was just a larger particle
[2:14:03] BenW_Tv: yea
[2:14:05] Tahj____: True true @winnerab
[2:14:06] theunseen010: photons do it all the time KEKW

[2:14:10] avatar_94: Wow, never heard about it
[2:14:12] Larklen: KEKW
[2:14:12] ElTankoJoe: It was a couple accidents
[2:14:15] theunseen010: monkaS
[2:14:17] ragequittertrol: demon core was all about directing the radiation
[2:14:22] Fourseason_: The dude was using a screwdriver
[2:14:25] santosh_1007: demon core
[2:14:27] winnerab: yeah, the stupid idiot with his screwdriver
[2:14:32] Akiron_rafa: HE did one on the elefant foot also
[2:14:33] HurricaneHenry: We all get hit by photons at the speed of light all the time ;)
[2:14:33] PudTV: The dude used a screwdriver to stop them touching KEKW
[2:14:35] crazyryan090909: They were messing around with it using a screwdriver to prop it up and it slipped.
[2:14:37] Yogithebaer: could you weaponized a particle not like a bomb more like a gun
[2:14:43] PxlSauce: only killed 1
[2:14:46] remess0: its from heaven. fallen angles stole  it
[2:14:52] PxlSauce: as far as I remember
[2:14:53] Alsabatini: guy wiggled a nuclear core with a screwdriver
[2:14:58] Larklen: nah, killed 2
[2:15:03] remess0: its a lie
[2:15:05] Larklen: then a few more "long term" deaths
[2:15:09] alek_199: What happened to the guy with the particle accelerator?
[2:15:21] Nexhunter: "secure" my ass pepeLaugh
[2:15:25] Larklen: KEKW
[2:15:30] mechoriet: KEKW holding by hand "secure"
[2:15:44] theunseen010: DansGame don't touch it
[2:15:47] grimmn: "most"
[2:15:50] Surge43: "most"
[2:15:51] Nicktendo1986: we're all on a list now, chat
[2:15:55] PudTV: The lead scientist calculated how many years the 3 second blast took off everyone’s life In that room by the distance of how far away they were from the demon core
[2:15:57] mechoriet: YEP mushroom
[2:16:04] LikeAKnife: Another scary one to learn about is the Tokaimura nuclear accident
[2:16:14] LikeAKnife: They were pouring isotopes into a barrel and it went critical
[2:16:19] Nexhunter: math
[2:16:30] a_brink: YEP energy
[2:16:35] Akiron_rafa: THink that the space inside an atom is really really big
[2:16:37] Nexhunter: lots of german and italian math that escaped the nazis before they fully took control danBlank
[2:16:47] santosh_1007: wow
[2:16:54] TuxLafitte: Yeah this is crazy...
[2:16:54] mechoriet: "no use"
[2:16:58] Nexhunter: nope
[2:17:11] 0x4273: it saved a lot of lives
[2:17:12] Shaggy_Lives: the second one .. not the first
[2:17:13] kenshin2666: as low as 2016-2020 Kappa
[2:17:15] aman36000: It sucks completely, but i agree with the decision 100%
[2:17:15] Nexhunter: the tulsa massacre is the lowest point
[2:17:19] KavokCollective: It would have lost a lot more lives on both sides otherwise
[2:17:20] Fawnz_: trail of tears is pretty bad too
[2:17:21] Fawnz_: US is fucked
[2:17:24] boltzmanC: it was estimated that it would have cost ~1.5MM casualties
[2:17:24] produkteriswf: weebs would never existed KEKW
[2:17:25] mugge___: We wouldnt have had Godzilla Kappa
[2:17:26] boltzmanC: if we invaded
[2:17:28] Cozmo300: how many more years would the war have gone on
[2:17:28] Klorell: the man in the high castle
[2:17:31] splix661: what was that matthew broderick movie that he made a nuke it was so good
[2:17:34] nAZAr1uS: remember holy crusades? that's another fun
[2:17:37] CurlySC: 9/11 is still used
[2:17:40] SheepsAholy: never heard of demon core before
[2:17:40] RhinoWrEcKs: @Giantwaffle its more that it targeted civs
[2:17:42] PxlSauce: bombing civillians I think is the problem
[2:17:43] Lord_arcon: I would say forcing away people from their homes when they started to exapnd "west" is one of the low points to
[2:17:43] Beeerg94: Poor civilians
[2:17:49] UECNSNemesis: still the only nation in the world to have dropped a nuclear weapon on a civilian population
[2:17:49] a_brink: Native Americans?
[2:17:49] Xicer_TV: more people died from the firebombings than the nukes
[2:17:53] winnerab: the war would barely have changed, germany had lost and japan was on it's own
[2:17:55] buy_and_hold_bitcoin: I've been to the Hiroshima Nuclear Museum, its sobering
[2:17:56] boltzmanC: @Giantwaffle we killed more ppl with napalm than the bukes in japan
[2:17:58] Tahj____: Yeah it's definitely a big ethical issue
[2:18:00] ValgrindG: saving lives is a strange argument when its civilians killed and not soldiers
[2:18:01] simbate55: native americans maybe
[2:18:02] Nexhunter: industrial centers
[2:18:05] Scojan: It was a war crime
[2:18:15] germanmikrowave: Britain carpet bombed first
[2:18:15] Crazyfox55: I wasn't alive so I have no opinion. I trust my ancestors to make good choices.
[2:18:25] KOKeowner: It was a show of power
[2:18:29] Lord_arcon: @germanmikrowave still does not make it right KEKW
[2:18:31] LeonThaLoser: wait what did I just walk in to lmao
[2:18:31] mugge___: Have you heard the story of this one man, that survived both blasts? He went from Hieroshima to Nagasaki after the first bomb.
[2:18:32] theunseen010: 100% a power play
[2:18:33] Nexhunter: a lot more dead in WW2
[2:18:35] Nexhunter: and a split Japan
[2:18:38] Fourseason_: Didnt the pilot who dropped the bomb think he wasn't actually dropping an atomic bomb?
[2:18:39] Merc_Roy: dealing with a fanatical country, its whole population, where the whole population was trained and brainwashed to fight to the death for an emperor, to every man, woman, and children were trained to
[2:18:43] germanmikrowave: @Lord_arcon not at all.
[2:18:48] omar_i_: Nagh, its just MURICA spreading some FREEDOM LUL
[2:18:49] Arimil: Your capital is now uninhabitable.
[2:18:58] Shank_nasty: The firebombing was worse. Today the reason we have the number we do is to ensure we can target military and not have to go after civilian targets.
[2:19:03] DakotaFoxes: MAD
[2:19:06] EnburN1: @Giantwaffle the atmosphere burning was a claim made by politichiuans who knew nothing about it
[2:19:06] Nexhunter: yea
[2:19:07] babyaddalyn: greed
[2:19:11] UECNSNemesis: That's why GPS was a major gamechanger. It enabled precision strikes on individual facilities
[2:19:14] BeastboySAW: They should have dropped it on the side of Mt. Fuji and they say a city is next so surrender. Would have worked.
[2:19:14] grimmn: not justifying it but Japan would have fought a brutal way of attrition had they not done it
[2:19:15] AtchTwoOh: aren't there enough nukes for like 11 nuclear winters?
[2:19:17] Nexhunter: chat that not greed that is assuring no one does it anymore
[2:19:18] Orin_The_Sly: Thats real AF thos
[2:19:18] simbate55: thats politics
[2:19:19] santosh_1007: waffleGrump
[2:19:23] crazyryan090909: Yeah but then we get IRL fallout :)
[2:19:30] Alsabatini: @itsfuntolose are you high?
[2:19:38] StOrMy1100: America couldve threaten to drop the 2nd bomb instead of nuking japan the 2nd time
[2:19:41] Not_Tomas1: @crazyryan090909 irl fallout vr :)
[2:19:41] Shaggy_Lives: thats what those in power want you to worry about .. while they kill millions in other ways below your radar
[2:19:44] CanadianHealthCare: Don’t poke the troll
[2:19:45] RussianRainbowTV: time to take the FEV so I can survive the radiation
[2:19:48] Allmostdone: Later, when questioned whether Trinity was the first-ever detonation of an atomic device, the inscrutable Oppenheimer replied, “Yes, in modern times.” Since then, much has been made of Oppenheimer’s words that beg the question, “And prior to modern times?
[2:19:49] chuckg0tstuck: More people died from carpet bombing. But to have 200k people almost instantly obliterated, makes it hit harder.
[2:19:51] babyaddalyn: and all it takes is 1BAD leader to start a nuclear war
[2:19:54] omar_i_: you know whats even more crazy than that? a person like trump having the power to authorize a nuke lunch KEKW
[2:19:59] KOKeowner: Crazy to think about how close the world was to ending with Cuban Missle Crisis
[2:20:00] Tabakhase: Plainly Difficult dropped a 40 minute Chernobyl vid gachiBASS

[2:20:23] theunseen010: like Enderium YEP
[2:20:35] remess0: you ae blind to history
[2:20:53] Orin_The_Sly: @ItsFunToLose I believe a lot of things, YOU are an idiot
[2:20:53] Alsabatini: @itsfuntolose how is it 1940s cgi? have you seen cgi from 2000, that shit doesn't even look real and it's 60 years later

[2:30:18] HappyLilToast: YEP
[2:30:19] dabeda1: yes
[2:30:19] Larklen: yeah
[2:30:20] dexbits: Yep
[2:30:22] Cozmo300: as soon as you remove the reflector
[2:30:22] AtchTwoOh: exacly
[2:30:23] omar_i_: YEP
[2:30:23] EnburN1: yrp
[2:30:24] LeonThaLoser: correct
[2:30:25] Nexhunter: if you go supercritical you unleash the dragon eys
[2:30:25] BIRDFRUIT: also yes
[2:30:27] LikeAKnife: True Story of the Demon Core @EIete_
[2:30:27] a_brink: timmacLIST
[2:30:28] LtCol_Carter: Yeah they remove it super quick
[2:30:29] theunseen010: it's only sustaining the reaction because it is full reflecting
[2:30:35] EIete_: @LikeAKnife thanks
[2:30:36] Cyberwire69: just like control rods in a reactor
[2:30:38] Allmostdone: yea that what broke off
[2:30:41] stefbuwalda: Supercritical just means it can sustain itself
[2:30:41] Nexhunter: the casings are much stronger
[2:30:44] Solitude411: and if its contianed that is a bomb
[2:30:58] Crazyfox55: Those have more mass
[2:31:00] TheResinger: it takes time for the core to fully go off when it goes super critical @Giantwaffle
[2:31:03] AtchTwoOh: it is basically, you insert 1 neurtron and you get 2 / 3 back, which they themselves multiply which leads to a big boom
[2:31:09] Dontjo: What are we watching?
[2:31:15] TexxLive: danHmm
[2:31:16] winnerab: it's a sub-critical mass, so without the reflectors it can't sustain sriticamity @Giantwaffle
[2:31:24] Allmostdone: remember a atom bomb is much easier to make than a nuke
[2:31:28] grimmn: an atomic bomb just keeps the core super critical long enough to start the chain reaction
[2:31:36] WGG25: the difference between this and the atomic bombs is the density, the weapons have a way higher density, thus the neutrons that leave hit other atoms with a much higher chance
[2:31:36] ThatOnneGuy: air molecules be like superhypersupercatJAM
[2:31:42] Stoods_: These experiment are under critical density, because they are using reflectors to reach criticality. But bombs use mass to go over critical density, and so the reaction cant be stopped
[2:31:47] AtchTwoOh: yes
[2:31:48] EnburN1: yes
[2:31:50] Shank_nasty: Yes
[2:31:50] Nexhunter: yes
[2:31:51] theunseen010: yep
[2:31:53] KOKeowner: So if he failed to get the sphere off would it have blown?
[2:31:55] Stoods_: yeah
[2:31:55] Janzert: yes
[2:31:55] dexbits: yup
[2:31:55] Myekos: yes
[2:31:56] HappyLilToast: hypersupercatJam
[2:32:03] EnburN1: its not an amount of mass but a density of mass
[2:32:04] AtchTwoOh: NODDERS
[2:32:05] Crazyfox55: yes
[2:32:06] Akiron_rafa: pretty much yeah
[2:32:09] Lidl_Username: yes
[2:32:14] Nexhunter: and that where German and Italian math that left their nations before the war got us to NODDERS
[2:32:17] BIRDFRUIT: @KOKeowner , no it would have just been extremely reactive and decayed for lifetimes
[2:32:21] EnburN1: Yes exactly
[2:32:22] Nexhunter: yea yea
[2:32:25] Allmostdone: look at eh diagrams for fatman and thinboy
[2:32:32] Stoods_: it also releases more energy per atom
[2:32:34] SobekRuffian: Yes, that's why there are specific shaped containers for nuclear fluids too
[2:32:40] kelleymcches: @Giantwaffle remember when you were complaining about chat replies? i found out how to turn them off with bttv. go into chat settings on the bottom -> chat appearance -> replies in chat -> minimum
[2:32:40] bugsplatter23: I think its the refinement level
[2:32:44] Nexhunter: less material is easier to produce
[2:32:46] EnburN1: Plutonium is made in nuclear reactors from Uranium
[2:32:49] Surge43: *knock knock* This is the FBI
[2:32:53] simbate55: suddenly everyone in chat is a nuclear physicist
[2:32:54] crazyryan090909: While foolish and certainly carefree he was brave to immediately remove the reflector and preserve the immediate lives of everyone else in that room
[2:33:01] omar_i_: I have to be honest, i have no clue but am just gonna nod NODDERS
[2:33:03] pidjiin: @Giantwaffle watch this guys videos on bikini atoll it explains the physics of detonation pretty well
[2:33:16] Myekos: the explosion to initiate detonation is to increase the density way beyond super critical point
[2:33:20] Tabakhase: this whole "all containers at the facility are so small that it cant become critical mass" thingy is insane-ish too LUL
[2:33:31] Nexhunter: so isotopes that powers MRTGs could go critical but requires a fuck ton compared to other isotopes of plutonium @Giantwaffle
[2:33:34] robvi: OO
[2:33:35] Allmostdone: Oak Ridge anyone
[2:33:38] HeatKiller: So.... when is the "radioactive science with Waffles" stream? LUL
[2:33:44] EnburN1: Oak Ridge ftw @Allmostdone
[2:34:11] dogma802: Doesn't perseverance just use a nuclear battery
[2:34:34] TimmyVRC: tsar bomba KEKW
[2:34:35] SobekRuffian: "welp hope we're far enough away"
[2:34:40] grimmn: they would guess for safe distances and stuff
[2:34:48] EnburN1: @marqueezus RTGs are commonly used in space things
[2:34:53] TheBanishedKing: I think the scientist knew
[2:34:55] Wazepas: just yolo it, what could go wrong kekw
[2:34:56] Alsabatini: I mean they had Einstein helping out
[2:34:58] Wazepas: KEKW *
[2:34:59] Shank_nasty: Castle Bravo test was one that went way bigger than they thought. Ruined a lot of inhabited islands.
[2:35:03] keksinyymi: russian roulette on steroids
[2:35:05] UECNSNemesis: I still remember how Oppenheimer nearly gave the calculation for whether or not they'd set the atmosphere on fire to an intern LMAO
[2:35:06] Stoods_: Also its not necessarily critical mass or density. Because if you think about it the reaction is about neutrons hitting other atoms, so if there is more mass the neutrons will hit other atoms, or it it is more dense they will hit more atoms
[2:35:15] Allmostdone: Oak Ridge is the secret city where they made a machine to make weapon grade plutonium
[2:35:16] The_SilentGuardian: science is always educated guessing is it not?
[2:35:16] kskskskskskskssss: working with radioactive stuff barehand is just crazy
[2:35:18] Crazyfox55: Same thing with gun powder though and dynamite. Just larger numbers and ranges.
[2:35:26] Cyberwire69: its not a lot of energy its just long term sustainable..  like 150watts
[2:35:28] theunseen010: have you ever heard of EPFCGs? @Giantwaffle
[2:35:29] stefbuwalda: Thermoelectric effect
[2:35:30] Nexhunter: well not really a guess for how much is needed to go critical unless you're figuring out how much output power through the design of the weapon itself danBlank
[2:35:31] dogma802: so it's a thick thermoelectric generator
[2:35:31] Tabakhase: YEP
[2:35:31] zacpdx: isn't that the thing, if they knew what they were doing they wouldn't have done it?
[2:35:37] EnburN1: @kskskskskskskssss no it is not crazy. As long as you do it right, nothing will happen
[2:35:37] KOKeowner: The bikini atoll is the best example of that, bomb did 1000 times more damage than predicted lol
[2:35:59] Nexhunter: cause it was a new design
[2:36:00] Larklen: yeah there were ships that were way too close given how explosive it was
[2:36:06] Wetware: Didn't carry the one
[2:36:09] Allmostdone: and don't poke at with a screwdriver
[2:36:15] Tabakhase: yep
[2:36:18] EnburN1: yep
[2:36:19] TheBanishedKing: interns calculated that one Kappa
[2:36:30] RodriCraft93: yes
[2:36:30] Driitzz: which bomb are we talking about did i miss something ?
[2:36:32] Stoods_: someone got fired
[2:36:33] Shank_nasty: Test is called castle bravo
[2:36:36] robvi: yikes that happend
[2:36:37] Nexhunter: we refine and design new designs all the time but the actual core is still the same density for the criticality monkaS
[2:36:37] avatar_94: no
[2:36:38] Doenerfan5: they were checking if they can use against navy tho
[2:36:40] Weras57: i mean at that time mechanical calculators weren't a big thing even
[2:36:42] UECNSNemesis: If you think about it, a standard cm^3 of metal has 10^23 atoms in it. You know about charge carriers from EE, you know how easy it is to be off by 2-3 orders of magnitude
[2:36:45] Apparentthreat: They were trying to kill Godzilla wym
[2:36:48] Allmostdone: fired or a promotion

[2:38:04] Cozmo300: beirut
[2:38:05] EnburN1: beirut
[2:38:07] Janzert: those boats are test targets
[2:38:09] NordESA: yeah that was nuts
[2:38:09] Wetware: The boats were captured I think, they wanted to see the effects
[2:38:11] Doenerfan5: yeah they wanted to see the damage done to ships
[2:38:13] UECNSNemesis: Those were condemned ships to be tested on damage effects
[2:38:14] Fourseason_: Beirut
[2:38:14] Nexhunter: @Giantwaffle operation crossroad was a yield of 22 to 23 kilotonnes
[2:38:17] Allmostdone: what air?
[2:38:22] Lord_arcon: @Giantwaffle I think they were boats with no one in them they were gonna get scraped either way
[2:38:27] itsmotiion: @Giantwaffle https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLOmxg4249w
[2:38:29] KOKeowner: Someone got fired for that one
[2:38:30] Shank_nasty: They were testing weapons effects against capture wwii boats
[2:38:33] Stoods_: you can see clouds forming and disappearing too lol that's cool
[2:38:41] Nexhunter: castle bravo which is another bikini atoll test produced a yield of about 15 megatonnes  @Giantwaffle
[2:38:43] RodriCraft93: theres a worse video about the tests, you can see the men sitting in the boats
[2:38:45] Cyberwire69: target boats
[2:38:46] pyhispahis: that place is probably still pretty irradiated
[2:38:59] brotatowin: Those were test boats to see effects of explosion right?
[2:39:06] Nexhunter: that was operation crossroad
[2:39:08] Nexhunter: not castle bravo
[2:39:09] LtCol_Carter: Yeah, weren't the boats for testing to see what effects were on the boats?
[2:39:09] crazyryan090909: Lets throw radiation in the ocean Pepega
[2:39:10] kefyrasFTW: wasnt there fishing boats?
[2:39:11] Scojan: I wonder what last effects that did to the marshal islands
[2:39:11] RhinoWrEcKs: @Giantwaffle and we get made for fukushimai Kappa
[2:39:19] Allmostdone: and think of all that wasted metal
[2:39:20] daedmissica0: https://youtu.be/wkVwWtRUqq4 5 min video waffle on rtgs
[2:39:20] XiaoBaiMalz: just think of all the wildlife that had its life ended
[2:39:24] Nexhunter: castle bravo wa sthe 15 megatonne
[2:39:24] Weras57: if there is a Battleship there you can calculate the distance most of them are 200m~
[2:39:26] Nexhunter: fuck up
[2:39:32] Pain_cuit: wasn't godzilla under that bomb ? Right ?
[2:39:32] winnerab: @pyhispahis probably not, ocean currents an wind would have dispersed it
[2:39:34] dexbits: I mean, they poisoned a bunch of islands nearby with people living there too.
[2:39:35] Stoods_: I wonder if there was fusion too because they did it underwater
[2:39:38] Ceratic: Now imagine what the Tsar Bomb looked like
[2:39:38] Nexhunter: operation crossroad was like 23 kilotonnes
[2:39:38] avatar_94: I saw it on Spongebob
[2:39:45] L4ncster: In the UK, we're still trying to get justice and recognition for servicemen who witnessed our nuclear tests and had all sort of health problems as a result.
[2:39:57] Nexhunter: yes both tests in bikini atoll
[2:40:07] Nexhunter: but castle bravo didn't have boats to test the effect on ships
[2:40:13] Nexhunter: for a nuclear detonation against an enemy fleet
[2:40:17] Allmostdone: Really? still trying to get money for watching the big bang?
[2:40:24] FlyingVillage: @Giantwaffle Have you seen this tweet? https://twitter.com/Twitch/status/1386759048406708225
[2:40:27] Tabakhase: @pyhispahis @winnerab there is a whole shitshow on this... with fliped winds and still ongoing legal shit
[2:40:43] Myekos: at that point they knew the effect on ships based on distance from blast front, they just wanted to see how much bigger it was
[2:40:46] Larklen: Twitch monkaHmm
[2:40:49] winnerab: @Tabakhase yeah i know, it's absolutely wild
[2:40:50] Larklen: moon2HUH
[2:40:57] Nexhunter: wtf twitch KEKW

[2:42:23] Nexhunter: and this was one of the first thermonuclear weapon designs being tested
[2:42:24] ValgrindG: thats real time??
[2:42:27] crazyryan090909: Humans are scary monkaX
[2:42:30] TheBanishedKing: good job humans
[2:42:34] KOKeowner: Imagine looking out your window and seeing something like that
[2:42:35] Nexhunter: so it was a true we didn't know how much yield would be produced
[2:42:39] JerryLubrano: its the colossal titan!
[2:42:40] Foooks: That fireball.... wow
[2:42:40] daemonaedryn: Maybe its the massive weapon of mass destruction?
[2:42:41] DecoyOcelot: the music maybe lol
[2:42:44] YoBroWazzup: that would be the creepy music in the background
[2:42:45] TexxLive: jesus
[2:42:47] itsmotiion: @Giantwaffle If youre interested, check out a video called "What an nuclear bomb feels like"
[2:42:48] JoniSusi: it is perhaps the doomsday weapon and low droning sound
[2:42:48] Orin_The_Sly: It is monkaS Like just seeing it makes me feel uneasy
[2:42:52] grimmn: they've built much larger bombs since this
[2:42:52] EZTEQ: Check the zarr bomb too!
[2:42:52] BIRDFRUIT: @DaemonSzyman maybe... monkaHmm not sure though
[2:42:54] kefyrasFTW: its not music, its plane engine
[2:42:55] dexbits: I mean, those tests irradiated the entire planet lol. Sooooo.
[2:42:56] Nexhunter: that was the plane
[2:42:56] zynithtv: thats not music
[2:42:59] winnerab: new leaguestarter, fireball max aoe build
[2:43:00] Driitzz: yeah this mushroom cloud screams "DEATH"
[2:43:01] tioberto: this is like, playing with fire, but in a completely different level
[2:43:02] Nexhunter: there was audio recordings
[2:43:02] avatar_94: biggest explosion the US ever created
[2:43:07] DecoyOcelot: oh its the plane lol im dumb
[2:43:08] Nexhunter: cause the DoE needed all of the data
[2:43:09] theunseen010: can you imagine watching that and thinking, 'what the fuck did we just do?'
[2:43:16] StOrMy1100: @Giantwaffle Did you already watch the new Ingenuity flight video that got posted in chat yesterday?
[2:43:23] Weras57: they would record audio yeah if would slow mo no audio
[2:43:25] JerryLubrano: some is real, gav made a video about it
[2:43:35] TheBanishedKing: @theunseen010 instead they went "lets do thousands of these"
[2:43:41] theunseen010: KEKW true
[2:43:44] FairePlaie: that is part of changing N pole (like chines huge barrage)
[2:43:44] TimmyVRC: Ive had nightmares where I see a mushroom cloud in the distance. That feeling of hopelessness is incomparable
[2:43:57] Feritexus: bigger than that was just the tsar bomba, wich actually was at half the potential strength cause the scientist who build it got scared it might eradicate the hole region. @Giantwaffle
[2:44:26] hoffs: just zoomin
[2:44:29] grimmn: bye
[2:44:33] Weras57: just zooooomed
[2:44:46] littlestitiovs: it's flying back to earth
[2:44:56] NordESA: danP
[2:45:04] Alsabatini: crazy that we have video from mars
[2:45:06] Feist_: is ingenuity doing any science or only providing data for future science helicopters?
[2:45:07] mechoriet: so steady too
[2:45:09] stefbuwalda: CGI KKona
[2:45:09] RodriCraft93: @Giantwaffle  search this on youtube "What Does a Nuclear Bomb Explosion Feel Like?" and youll see an actual human test
[2:45:10] Tahj____: Bruh to think this is Mars
[2:45:10] TexxLive: whats that exactly? didnt understand
[2:45:11] Myekos: how close to takeoff spot was landing?
[2:45:13] The_SilentGuardian: whats that shutter speed to get crisp rotor blade shadows

[2:46:16] wulfnorek: blow dust from solar panels of rover :D
[2:46:24] Tabakhase: every rover gonna have a swarm of bots NODDERS
[2:46:28] calhanb: do they have a system to put it back onto the rover?
[2:46:33] Tabakhase: like factory drones widepeepoHappy
[2:46:36] Tabakhase: o
[2:46:36] daedmissica0: i think the last one is to run the battery to  0 going up
[2:46:49] Okkelsskov: @Giantwaffle have you heard about a-bomb test Desert Rock
[2:46:56] grimmn: capable of 25kg
[2:46:59] grimmn: I thought
[2:47:04] Sanduckchan: droneception
[2:47:04] KOKeowner: Lets just launch nukes on mars
[2:47:07] Alsabatini: mothership
[2:47:11] dotLAN: Ya that thing looks so tiny in the videos but it's surprisingly big
[2:47:12] crazyryan090909: Drone mothership monkaW
[2:47:22] grimmn: I could be misremembering too
[2:47:28] PrometheusProject: something insane is that a drone could potentially find new elements exposed in the crater that we've never seen before
[2:47:34] EZTEQ: But is it 25kg on mars? Kappa
[2:47:38] mechoriet: i think it was to llft 25kg
[2:47:43] Scojan: Does Elon need US Approval to send humans to mars?
[2:47:45] Doughnut911: Drone mothership? Bezos Approved Kappa
[2:47:59] daedmissica0: with starship why not 1t

[2:48:15] Nicktendo1986: .... kilograms is mass, not weight.
[2:48:16] grimmn: to launch from American soil
[2:48:18] Nexhunter: yea payloads gotta be approved also
[2:48:22] Cozmo300: and nasa has the astronauts
[2:48:23] NovemberCo: thats because its on us soil?
[2:48:30] Alsabatini: Elon should buy a country so he can just do anything he wants
[2:48:40] TheBanishedKing: elon should buy his own island and launch from there
[2:48:44] Cyberwire69: country on the equator preferably
[2:48:47] 3pic_Ozone: international waters Kappa
[2:48:47] daedmissica0: why the oil rigs are offshore
[2:48:48] EZTEQ: Aren't astronauts technically part of the military?
[2:48:49] littlesp0on: so if they lunch in international water.... non approval needed ?
[2:48:50] calhanb: but from there new oilrig in international water they could
[2:48:50] Nexhunter: but SpaceX if they started launching off american soil to bypass safety checks would lose government contracts very quickly
[2:48:58] theunseen010: float the whole launch pad out to international waters
[2:49:03] Myekos: govt would give them parameters and the list of bribes, then probably change the list and add more bribes
[2:49:04] YoBroWazzup: chat it's not exactly like the FAA is saying no
[2:49:06] Sanduckchan: TheBanishedKing thats probably why hes shilling Dogecoin all the time Kappa all leads to this plan
[2:49:28] Myekos: concord
[2:49:28] NovemberCo: concord?

[2:49:47] mephisto__ttv: sexy one
[2:49:50] NovemberCo: best plane ever
[2:49:52] Cozmo300: that thing was sooo loud when it used to fly over my house
[2:49:53] alek_199: Why not
[2:50:04] Wetware: It wasn't allowed to go supersonic until it was out over the ocean for just that reason
[2:50:10] alek_199: Just cover your ears OMEGALUL
[2:50:16] Weras57: the loudest aircraft ever was Thunderscreech it would make crewmen near it vomit
[2:50:24] theunseen010: I thought concord went mach 2?
[2:50:46] daemonaedryn: Might be faster to make ender pearls then make the normal rooms
[2:50:55] Traaxus: just launch it sea dragon style.
[2:50:58] Sanduckchan: @theunseen010 Mach 2,23
[2:51:04] YoBroWazzup: it's not necessarily that they can't be that loud, its just not too loud in the proximity of populated areas - source am ATC
[2:51:17] winnerab: mach 2 (2388 km/h) for top speed
[2:51:24] fadedredx: How did Dare go?
[2:51:27] Nexhunter: also chat remember you would need to be outwards of like 200 nautical miles to be outside of US claims so have fun pepeLaugh

[3:00:58] itzSimondr98: DaemonSzyman same Sadge
[3:01:01] dogma802: Why would they use lua? Dual universe also uses lua for scripting
[3:01:13] Arksam: Imagine a future where we can create functional Quantom computers inside Minecraft PunchTrees
[3:01:16] coolcake2: they are just far enough to not load the other one

[3:01:29] teej_dv: Lua is fantastic to embed into things. So it is commonly used for scripting

[3:02:27] dogma802: I guess if you're a self taught programmer before the python hay day, then lua would of been a go to
[3:02:37] winnerab: wafflecraft mod when? @Giantwaffle
[3:02:52] teej_dv: short answer: simple language designed to be easily embeddable. Long answer: Lua has very few constructs compared to other languages, and a very straight forward c API that is fixed. This makes it incredibly easy to use. I can link a video (hehe, self promotion) but probably can't send in chat
[3:03:12] BurnedAether: magic YEP
[3:03:12] teej_dv: python is probably 1000x harder to embed
[3:03:21] Bleu_Forge: Lua is ResidentSleeper

[4:43:57] Nexhunter: math yo NotLikeThis
[4:44:03] weasel9999: spying and surveillance have a lot of money being dumped into it.  its where your tax dollars go
[4:44:12] DroidBoy: TheIlluminati
[4:44:12] Larklen: what now YEP
[4:44:13] M1k3D3l7a: you take a "picture" after "picture" and lay them on top of each other
[4:44:15] Happzimus: i don
[4:44:16] masztufa: if i got that right, polarization is only for getting more information, not the actual imaging
[4:44:19] dotLAN: It's like a mega composite image
[4:44:25] Gelil: Kinda, you need some very "smart" image processing AI, to pair it with the Radar images
[4:44:35] Nexhunter: or infrared spectrum
[4:44:40] Happzimus: i dont know how they will deal with refraction and diffraction though
[4:44:46] Nexhunter: but the US military little black book is hard to figure out KEKW
[4:44:47] masztufa: like polarization would be a different channel
[4:44:48] Orin_The_Sly: This new satellite is supposed to be an upgrade of this tech isn't it
[4:44:51] Gbusrt: you can also use interferometry for use 2 separated mirrors to act like one big one and the NRO gave NASA 13 sats = to hubble
[4:44:59] Gelil: Think of it more like layering in Photoshop
[4:45:00] TinyBicycleTom: i had a smoke befor that vid, YEP
[4:45:00] bleulight: @masztufa It is indeed a different channel
[4:45:03] masztufa: like hue, instead of intensity
[4:45:12] M1k3D3l7a: YEP
[4:45:30] Codidley: polarization is a form of imaging - you combine images of different polarization states to get a "full intensity" image
[4:45:51] topekkTV: You can combine all sort of different wavelengths for imagery. Not only radio
[4:46:15] Nexhunter: also a SpaceX launch in december time frame for NRO is signal intelligence so it gets even more fucky on what you can do with satellites pepeLaugh
[4:46:21] masztufa: what i don't get is how they can tell the difference between two points. You'd need an aperture for that, right?
[4:46:22] bleulight: @Giantwaffle For the visual spectrum, look up atmospheric windows to see which wavelengths we can image on Earth.
[4:46:26] Hengo: Are those really see trough? i think its more an artefact of that the "camera" is moving and then taking more than one image-> combining those
[4:46:28] obtoe_: first intue
[4:46:29] obtoe_: minute
[4:46:30] grimmn: it's not seeing through the buildings, it's figuring out what's behind due to reflections around the buildings
[4:46:36] Lands8142: it was like at the very beginning
[4:46:38] masztufa: spherically propagating waves need an aperture to form an image

[4:54:19] TLV_TV: the old method was really bad, now you can calculate it by hand easier
[4:54:23] mudman56: You can proove its never ending
[4:54:30] CorSPACE: for all intents and purposes
[4:54:34] masztufa: assuming you could calculate the end of it leads to contradiction
[4:54:36] Gelil: Couldn't your prove it with calcus?
[4:54:41] MiraPacku: because we're dumb KEKW
[4:54:42] SergeantTaco: super quantum.
[4:54:45] Janzert: that's what irrational means it cannot be represented by a ratio of two integers
[4:54:45] Happzimus: you cant prove its ending
[4:54:45] QuesoBad0nga: between 0 and 0.1 there are infinite numbers
[4:54:45] ItsOnMax: A computer that would be capable of simulating a universe Kappa
[4:54:48] Goldps1: infinite computation maybe?
[4:54:49] steeIeknight: the computer just keeps giving us a few numbers every year to keep us going LUL
[4:54:51] Happzimus: therefor its never ending
[4:54:54] UECNSNemesis: "In the 1760s, Johann Heinrich Lambert proved that the number π (pi) is irrational: that is, it cannot be expressed as a fraction a/b, where a is an integer and b is a non-zero integer. In the 19th century, Charles Hermite found a proof that requires no prerequisite knowledge beyond basic calculus."
[4:54:58] BurnedAether: reposting cause the guy wasn't a sub https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_that_%CF%80_is_irrational

[4:55:05] Hengo: Im wondering whats the longest known repeating sequence is
[4:55:05] Moobot: Support Waffle by using his Epic creator code: Giantwaffle
[4:55:06] grimmn: pi never repeats either
[4:55:17] Janzert: that's rational
[4:55:23] htky_s: if pi ends that means it can be represented as the ratio of 2 numbers
[4:55:23] Janzert: i.e. 1 over 3
[4:55:24] steeIeknight: some simulation tech is probably like "watch this, theyre fascinated by this number" LUL
[4:55:26] grimmn: repeating decimals are rational
[4:55:27] drago1598: its never ending only in base 10, maybe pi could have an end in other bases
[4:55:35] weasel9999: never ending pie sounds gread! FeelsAmazingMan
[4:55:36] UECNSNemesis: if it repeats, it is rational
[4:55:37] masztufa: irrational numbers don't have an end and never repeats. Assuming pi to be a rational number leads to contradiction

[4:56:19] Honeth: Waffle how would pi 's number have anything to do with us being in a simulation or not? if they can run a simulation capable of holding this much detail and info they could probably create numbers like pi

[4:56:35] MiraPacku: what? monkaHmm
[4:56:38] htky_s: some infinities are bigger than others
[4:56:38] masztufa: cardinality
[4:56:39] fb_slim: @drago1598 yes, pi in base pi is equal to one
[4:56:42] Wetware: Some infinities are bigger than others
[4:56:44] mudman56: quick google search: Lambert proved rigorously that pi is not equal to a fraction of integers, so that its decimal expansion not only does not terminate but is also not periodic. Unfortunately, the proof, though not requiring too much higher math, is too complicated to be given here.
[4:56:53] masztufa: there's more than 2 "infinities", actually
[4:56:58] MiraPacku: PepeHands wtf
[4:56:59] grimmn: the inifinity of natural numbers is twice as large as the infinity of even numbers

[4:59:14] masztufa: exponentials, logarhithms
[4:59:17] Crazyfox55: e
[4:59:20] IsThatThatIs: waffle have you seen, All the Numbers - Numberphile
[4:59:21] The_SilentGuardian: Not showing Das’ channel?
[4:59:24] masztufa: it's derivative is itself
[4:59:29] mudman56: basis of the complex set
[4:59:30] Chris_Cross_Crash: isn't that the only number who's exponential number is the derivitive of itself?
[4:59:36] streyder: there pi e sqrt(2) any other endless numbers?
[4:59:40] fREAST: siren heard they said, t-10min ~
[4:59:41] drago1598: the integral of e^x is e^x which is neat
[4:59:51] grimmn: yes the derivative of e^x is e^x
[4:59:52] FenixTheSnolx: It's supposed to sf today
[4:59:52] obtoe_: idk tbh, new testing
[4:59:57] The_SilentGuardian: Tri vent means 10 mins i believe
[4:59:58] mechoriet: you can't hear it from here
[5:00:01] masztufa: sqrt(n), where n is not a square number is always irrational
[5:00:08] Honeth: is this another hop test or actual space flight?
[5:00:10] UECNSNemesis: No one is sure, with the SN15 revisions
[5:00:30] txwild: How are you not completely fried from the weekend @Giantwaffle ? I'm nearly dead just from watching. Lol
[5:00:36] Joshuapetch: PauseChamp
[5:00:46] mechoriet: @Giantwaffle Wednesday is the re-scheduled fight day from faa advisory
[5:01:13] Honeth: imagine instead of a quick burn it just goes boom and the top part flies into space
[5:01:14] TinyBicycleTom: Has it got real legs yet?
[5:01:24] b4db4dg3r: a lot more tiles too
[5:01:31] Janzert: so that's sn16's nosecone?
[5:01:32] mechoriet: i think legs are already installed
[5:01:53] Feritexus: still the bad legs i believe
[5:01:58] obtoe_: nosecone venting for flight Kappa
[5:02:05] pwrreset: they put more layers of duct tape on this one
[5:02:05] mechoriet: probblly header tank bleedoff
[5:02:15] TLV_TV: would there be any point in making all the SN test version smaller to make them faster and save money?
[5:02:17] Valentin_PV: they're going to ditch the legs for the earth starship and use the tower to catch it from supports attached under the top wings
[5:02:18] MisterSirCode: a rocket launch is happening today
[5:02:18] HeatGoes: Have you heard of Astra Space? Excited about how their next launch hopefully this year.
[5:02:24] MisterSirCode: what???
[5:02:26] mechoriet: maybe cause off the new internal design
[5:02:26] Honeth: they insulated it better this time ROFL
[5:02:31] BeastboySAW: Wait...  stuff far away seems smaller. TIL.
[5:02:35] Flobu_: what e exactly do they vent out?
[5:02:35] ChickenIsAwesome: @giantwaffle why does it say NO LAUNCH right beside your cam?

[5:03:20] pengeg: spac*
[5:03:20] exWan: Why does it say No launch?
[5:03:22] ChickenIsAwesome: @mechoriet didn’t he just say they are filling it?
[5:03:22] cosmicblip: was playing with it today but have you played with metahuman creator yet
[5:03:33] mechoriet: @ChickenIsAwesome for a static fire yeah not a launch
[5:03:40] KABBL: chat this will be a 1 sec burn, not launching!
[5:03:41] UECNSNemesis: @exWan they are just testing engines for today
[5:03:45] ChickenIsAwesome: Ahhhh sorry I just got here, makes sense. Thank you
[5:03:57] exWan: @UECNSNemesis ahh ty
[5:03:57] Honeth: saying it is the easiest part though
[5:04:00] Orin_The_Sly: With Gusto!
[5:04:06] HeatGoes: True true. Big words from them yeah. The whole space sector is exciting stuff.
[5:04:08] TLV_TV: NKLA motors similarities
[5:04:09] Fivesix6: by lying out my ass... it's easy Kappa
[5:04:10] Gelil: With words, normally
[5:04:15] mechoriet: in musk we trust Kappa
[5:04:21] steeIeknight: Waffle Corp. will be a multi billion dollar space company, invest now Kappa
[5:04:22] ItsOnMax: isn't that just market manipulation tho?
[5:04:26] CorSPACE: you mean rocket labs?
[5:04:27] pengeg: its like IOTA or ADA vs new shitcoin
[5:04:39] Systox: like Elon and Hypertube KEKW
[5:04:50] Honeth: Waffle that's the thing though you need to get attention before you prove yourself so that once you've proven it people know to just believe next time
[5:04:54] mechoriet: comon ground bleed off soon PauseChamp
[5:05:08] ItsOnMax: Saying that you are going to make 'so much money' but have not shown anything looks like market manipulation to me.
[5:05:09] mechoriet: just framing it nice :)
[5:05:17] x_Crawley: There's definitely something to be said for the present worth of future value, but you would have to use a pretty significant discount rate for such a high risk unproven company
[5:05:29] CaptainBary: When is lifroff?
[5:05:36] mechoriet: just starship lower side tanks
[5:05:39] UECNSNemesis: rule of thirds is perfect in this shot
[5:05:42] pengeg: @captainbary no lauch
[5:05:44] mechoriet: looking tanks
[5:05:46] CaptainBary: :(
[5:05:50] DoctorLongBalls: liffroff
[5:05:56] MisterSirCode: is this launching today??? PLEASE someone tell us!!!!
[5:06:10] mechoriet: YEP now its cursed tnx wafflle
[5:06:13] KABBL: well they figured out how to buuuild tanks while contructiong starships, so why not use the knowledge KEKW
[5:06:14] UECNSNemesis: KEKW
[5:06:16] CaptainBary: What are they testing?
[5:06:17] mechoriet: god dammit
[5:06:23] masztufa: i mean, if it's so eager to get into space why should we stop it? Kappa
[5:06:24] CorSPACE: hydraulic
[5:06:24] emyuun: forgot to bolt it down lol
[5:06:24] RafaLorenzo: @MisterSirCode Static fire!!!
[5:06:29] pengeg: LUL
[5:06:33] TLV_TV: NKLA motors stock price has been stable even though it´s an obvious castle in the air ...for example
[5:06:35] UECNSNemesis: turned the bolts left instead of right, my bad boss
[5:06:39] BeastboySAW: Flex tape
[5:06:39] Warkless: They make a giant hand which is holding it in place NODDERS
[5:06:41] Ornaate: flextape
[5:06:47] Rocketdrone: space shuttle and delta used explosive bolts
[5:06:49] CorSPACE: iirc its 15 seconds after the tri vent goes off and on
[5:06:56] NeoPAro: 3 vent will pulse like 10 sec before static
[5:07:00] zippolino88: is the whole rocket filled? or is there a smaller tank inside?
[5:07:07] mechoriet: @CorSPACE we havent seen that last time tho
[5:07:10] pengeg: your mom sits on the bottom Kappa
[5:07:12] zapiiiiiiii: how much does is lose fuel per second
[5:07:17] mechoriet: @CorSPACE think that idea got scubbed

[5:08:37] Joshuapetch: YEP
[5:08:38] FingerGames: pepeSmoke
[5:08:50] streyder: Well you can hang a 2ton car from an m4 screw if you are careful enough so holding a rocket down should actually require insane bolting like on ships or something
[5:09:09] pengeg: not my channel points waffleHands
[5:09:09] KABBL: at this rate they will launch by venting KZKW

[5:11:41] Ranger02: Why is there smoke coming out of it what’s the meaning @giantwaffle
[5:11:59] Wetware: These are the new raptors, maybe they're taking it slower?
[5:12:00] masztufa: can't wrap my head around these things not breaking immediately after firing
[5:12:11] mechoriet: @Ranger02 cooling the engines with LOX
[5:12:17] SnoLys: says triple at the bottom
[5:12:18] strawwwwww: they say triple engine in the title

[5:15:18] mechoriet: maybe a second 3mm test?
[5:15:22] mechoriet: idfk
[5:15:25] kyle18211: They are testing MaxQ
[5:15:30] mechoriet: or new header tank design

[5:16:34] AceBlizzardz: my points haven't recovered since I got scammed
[5:16:41] CorSPACE: its for structural testing
[5:16:51] Feritexus: its not the normal nosecone.
[5:17:09] mechoriet: lab cam
[5:17:25] mechoriet: yeah everything is focused on static fire i guess
[5:17:25] The_SilentGuardian: I think that test nose is just a testing pathfinder for the structure around it
[5:17:39] mechoriet: there already up 3 levels orso

[5:54:54] MetalBBA: I still think physical media is relevant but that is because I grew up in an area where driving over an hour away to buy the physical disc, drive back and install it was faster than my internet
[5:54:56] Nincy1986: my cusin was in tears becuse he got fortnite in a "hard" copy from a store and it was an empty case... he didnt know that he was sopose to use the code inside in a online store to download it... when i told him he was so happy :)

[5:55:55] Amcro: he also did mining gadgets
[5:55:57] Gelil: Was his first
[5:56:01] benjamin_berry: building Gadgets was the original author
[5:56:02] Arkypoo909: I think he only had the artwork stuff done for him
[5:56:07] Azafure: Bunch of stuff that he wanted in a mod and he just decided to make it lol
[5:56:17] benjamin_berry: He had some help at the end.
[5:56:18] Nincy1986: i love how soaryn can piss him off heheheh
[5:56:19] schwebels428: i think if gamestop wants to survive, they'll pivot into pc gaming hardware and become a micro center but highly specific
[5:56:21] DecoyOcelot: they had like a dozen dup bugs when he made it, but super good mod
[5:56:24] Goodmangammering: Mining gadgets is also partly his

[5:57:27] Gelil: Laziness.
[5:57:28] ItsOnMax: The better deal is stock
[5:57:30] txwild: gamestop would also have to close like 90% of their retail locations with that pivot. Not that much demand
[5:57:41] Nexhunter: gamestop should just sell used mining gpus Kappa
[5:57:43] benjamin_berry: Because explaining Steam to your grandmother is hard.
[5:57:49] schwebels428: i got a 2070 super for a better price at bestbuy. was better than like 250$ KEKW
[5:57:53] Surge43: I went to Frys before they went out of business and tried to by a cable modem. They had none.
[5:57:55] Ace_Runn3r: But if they price match amazon then EZ get it in a hour
[5:57:56] aundros: maybe we will see a nostalgia for hard copies of games?
[5:57:57] Verb0sity: The only big market I could see them going is something like a cloud gaming service. Because the libaries of games are too large on current market leaders
[5:58:01] McFatbutt: because online i dont have it, when you buy at a shop you have it physically there
[5:58:11] Nexhunter: it outright criminal KEKW

[5:59:22] KoalaCorgi: they were pushed out, one main guy sold 3 days before it like tripled in price
[5:59:26] streyder: Local stores need to go back to customer service like in the old days. Otherwise their business model is obsolete

[5:59:53] BronzKneeeCap: @The_SilentGuardian for sure i get that. I myself prefer to have a disc just because growing up it was always nice to have a collection of games to show off and idk just showing a libary on my console or steam doesn't feel the same
[5:59:55] KoalaCorgi: Insiders selling stock has to be announced yes
[5:59:57] Robohornet: Yes, they have to announce it and have it approved a certain amount of time before the trade occurs so that it is transparent
[6:00:00] txwild: yes. If you have a fiduciary duty you have to adhere to a predetermined schedule for stock sales
[6:00:02] BeastboySAW: He took a cut in pay last year and they paid him is worthless stock. Then it jumped and he jumped.

[6:04:46] Honeth: i mean i wonder how they'll try to do currencies once we become a lifeform that knows they have more than 1 planet under it's control
[6:05:03] UltimaEternal: May i ask what modpack is this
[6:05:04] benjamin_berry: The only way governments will get involved in crypto is to outlaw it. It’s made to be uncontrollable
[6:05:13] Gelil: I mean FDIC exist because of unregulated currency exchanges by banks.
[6:05:25] streyder: I bet governments will stop this from happening just because too much money is involved in keeping the old system alive. They will find a way to keep their friends in power
[6:05:26] Nexhunter: also remember the CFTC is already regulating some of it but needs more power sadKEK

[6:06:49] Gelil: Space tech right now is super bleeding edge. It will take a few decades to be sustainable
[6:06:51] Nexhunter: we have reserves for that shit

[6:07:28] Cyberwire69: dig up the landfills

[6:07:32] Lands8142: it's probably not efficient...
[6:07:33] weasel9999: i'd say a lack of helium is probably a bigger problem.  still plenty of untapped oil laying around
[6:07:34] RhinoWrEcKs: probably start making bio-plastics if we have to
[6:07:36] bier_404: if humanity get over a break point in space industry i think space programs are gonna snowball
[6:07:37] mrhigher: @Giantwaffle EXACTLY, thats why we need to find resources outside Earth

[6:08:19] Fortunate87: you could produce the products coming from oil, it will be costly but you can
[6:08:21] streyder: Well there is alternatives. We just need to stop burning oil and we are super fine
[6:08:24] SeriousPotatoBot: peepoHmm At least 1 year
[6:08:30] Honeth: Waffle that also requires specific temperatures and atmospheric pressures which we can't modify just yet
[6:08:34] KABBL: just use baby oil, there are new ones everyday 4Head
[6:08:39] Baenjamin: we need to crack the code for time travelling, and push mars a million years ahead in time from us, yep. SeemsGood
[6:08:39] alotron_: Lack of oil, lack of helium, lack of sand. Rather sooner than later we will run out of a lot of stuff.

[6:08:58] N3rvrackD: sounds like a future Earth Problem! KEKW
[6:08:59] Robohornet: There are microbes that synthesize oil. All we have to do is scale them up and farm them for oil production
[6:09:05] benjamin_berry: Takes longer to get all the carbon in one spot than to make it into oil
[6:09:10] Honeth: sustain our planet you mean just abandon it right?
[6:09:16] Goodmangammering: Most oil is from bacteria type organism that were in oceans hundreds of millions of years ago
[6:09:19] hockeygoaliechris: wall-e here we come
[6:09:20] Nexhunter: or we will nuke ourselves to death over fighting for an oil well in the arctic KEKW

[6:09:30] iMikial: @Giantwaffle what do u think about safemoon ?
[6:09:36] Goldps1: we need a swing like that
[6:09:38] Nexhunter: you still need oil for products
[6:09:44] streyder: Well... boomers gonna boom and as long as they are in power fuck all will change
[6:09:50] Lands8142: yeah, i think the switch is happening now. It's just going slower than we can see at the moment
[6:09:52] zacpdx: apparently we have 714 million barrels of oil stocked in old salt mines
[6:09:56] Yatko: meanwhile germany wants to remove all their nuclear power stations
[6:09:56] TheSparMan: we are some days over 100% in Denmark
[6:09:57] benjamin_berry: It’s now cheaper to build a solar panel plant than a oil/natural gas plant
[6:10:00] Baenjamin: can't we just find new oil resorvoirs? we have probably not found all them yet
[6:10:02] Honeth: Nexhunter which is when the people that went into space with a select group of folks will come down after the war and have the planet for themselves
[6:10:04] fapohogu: most of Brazils energy is green if I'm not mistaken
[6:10:06] Troupster: according to jerryrigeverything solar panel creation is offset in 1 year

[6:11:10] Goodmangammering: If the world was more accepting nuclear we could transition to that very quickly
[6:11:11] Troupster: If the US was a company would it have to provide healthcare? 🤔
[6:11:13] burritothenoodledragon: @Giantwaffle we should chose to build reactor to save the evemeant and prevent co2

[6:11:16] nick43087: ya
[6:11:19] Nexhunter: cause of the oil crisis

[6:11:22] zelrock0: but how will solar work with Bill gates wanting to block out the sun?
[6:11:23] streyder: The problem is that times change faster now than ever and the generation now in politics is not prepared for that
[6:11:32] fat_larz: It would only happen when climate change directly effects peoples every day lives
[6:11:39] spo161: everything needs ressources u cant produce something out of nothing even "green" power

[6:12:42] fapohogu: hydroeletric isn't greener?
[6:12:42] benjamin_berry: The US has more untapped oils reserves than the Saudis. It’s just not worth pumping it.
[6:12:44] Nincy1986: the true reason Elon is pushing for space...
[6:12:45] WGG25: there are technologies to reduce nuclear waste significantly
[6:12:47] itzjuststewey: @driitzz Ty bro
[6:12:51] Bpapman: Nuclear isn't economically feasible compared to wind/solar. The time loss efficiency of constructing a new plant makes the greener options significantly outpace it now
[6:12:53] Nexhunter: @benjamin_berry damn straight it fucking expensive
[6:12:54] Lands8142: alright... so we gotta seed mars full of them dinos and make a ranch for oil. lol
[6:12:56] DukeOFlukes: theres people who are developing extremely long lasting batteriesd using nuclear waste and diamonds. iirc it s of special interest to spacetravel
[6:12:56] streyder: Well if the us out of anything they will just spread some democracy to countries which still have some
[6:13:08] Goodmangammering: Neither is any other tech, producing solar or wind also produces waste
[6:13:15] orillion: we have about 30,000 years worth of nuclear fuel with good reactors D:

[6:13:23] itzjuststewey: What’s the aim of this mod pack ?
[6:13:33] burritothenoodledragon: yep but @Giantwaffle we have hunders of years nuclear fuel for fisson and a tone of fusion fuel

[6:18:31] benjamin_berry: Right now they’re making reactors that they can mess with the magnets. Once you figure it out you can probably simplify the magnets

[6:19:48] Nexhunter: the follow up project if ITER works out will be DEMO which will be the first attempt at actual scaled electrical generation which would be like 2040 earliest for construction start
[6:19:49] streyder: @benjamin_berry the issue is not the magnets. The issue is getting energy out of the system and starting the fusion
[6:20:10] DecoyOcelot: there it is
[6:20:11] Nexhunter: 32buckets KEKW
[6:20:12] DimensionalShadow: KEKW
[6:20:19] ItsOnMax: lmso
[6:20:21] ItsOnMax: lmao
[6:20:22] Shantrix: better start pooping
[6:20:29] benjamin_berry: From what I read they were having issues keeping the fields stable
[6:20:36] ItsOnMax: pressure pooping inc
[6:20:40] Nincy1986: get the PPI stat

[6:20:50] Nexhunter: ITER not even done with construction so it other reactors having those issues @benjamin_berry
[6:21:02] chopchoi: you got poop
[6:21:18] Droth_: Bout time to upgrade all your random machines since you have hardened glass
[6:21:20] TheLynorus: @benjamin_berry Yes they do have trouble keeping it stable longterm but Iter should in theory solve that problem
[6:21:23] Nincy1986: saplings?
[6:21:24] sp3kz_23: waffleD
[6:21:30] DimensionalShadow: Need to up the poops per minute
[6:21:42] Nincy1986: tree room
[6:22:22] Nexhunter: and then DEMO will be the one to actually do real electricity generation from the reactor which the last timelines put it at 2048 for the first attempt if construction isn't slow when it starts in 2040 if ITER succeeds @TheLynorus
[6:22:24] streyder: The issue with the magnetic fields is that they need to change to get the process starting and energy out. Just keeping the plasma stable would be easy
[6:22:38] DimensionalShadow: LOL
[6:22:51] Nexhunter: good thing you built those 7x7s KEKW
[6:22:51] DecoyOcelot: peepoPooPoo
[6:22:55] Gelil: Shitty quest.
[6:22:55] pengeg: all this for poop KEKW
[6:22:56] Pati: quite the sophisticated poop machine
[6:23:00] Arkypoo909: Looks like a problem for Future Waflle
[6:23:06] Nincy1986: wow down the rabbit hole we go

[6:25:29] produkteriswf: Sadge
[6:25:30] Nexhunter: @TheLynorus yeap but there is one benefit to the design being attempted with ITER and that is production of helium PogChamp
[6:25:44] xfrozev2: waffleT3
[6:26:30] streyder: @nexhunter but doesn’t that require tritium to work?
[6:26:54] Nexhunter: @streyder lithium being hit by the neutrons butttt yea since that supposed to be the main fuel cycle sadKEK
[6:26:58] streyder: Which is insanely rare on earth (but actually abundant on the moon)
[6:27:10] TheLynorus: @Nexhunter Yes, that could help offset the costs a bit
[6:27:12] Nexhunter: is with the tritium and also that helium would be highly radioactive up the ass KEKW
[6:27:57] Nexhunter: we can hit lithium with neutrino to get tritium and helium but ya know neutrinos little bit dangerous pepeLaugh
[6:27:59] Nincy1986: degrating?
[6:28:01] blizzardmagic: do you mean decay?
[6:28:13] Myekos: Tritium is a naturally occurring radioactive form of hydrogen that is produced in the atmosphere when cosmic rays collide with air molecules. As a result, tritium is found in very small or trace amounts in groundwater throughout the world. It is also a byproduct of the production of electricity by nuclear power plants.
[6:28:13] streyder: @nexhunter ohh the want to use the neutrons to split lithium? I thought they fuse tritium to helium?
[6:28:31] Myekos: how's that
[6:28:33] Nexhunter: yea so the fusion chamber would be tritium and deuterium
[6:28:49] aman36000: Losing power
[6:28:53] streyder: @nexhunter you mean neutrons not neutrinos
[6:28:53] Shmeader62: Haven’t been in this chat in so long love it here
[6:28:59] Nexhunter: danDerp
[6:29:05] Arkypoo909: i think its the square higher on the cloches @Giantwaffle
[6:29:14] TheLynorus: You can get tritium by hitting deuterium with neutrons from nuclear fission and you can get deuterium form hitting water with neutrons
[6:29:16] Nexhunter: yes but neutrinos still suck ass monkaS
[6:29:24] Nincy1986: maybe auto output into a sawmill?
[6:29:26] Arkypoo909: Boom bom bam
[6:29:43] Nexhunter: but this is the ITER/DEMO designs so @TheLynorus
[6:29:54] ninopanda: Nex is still a poo poo head YEP KEKW
[6:29:56] streyder: Neutrinos basically do nothing. There is billions hitting you all day to no effect what so ever
[6:30:10] Nexhunter: @streyder they still suck ass
[6:30:12] DimensionalShadow: The massive poop injector LUL
[6:30:23] SpiderQueen7202: It's possible but unlikely for neutrinos to pass through electronics and change bits as they go
[6:30:27] aman36000: @Giantwaffle need more power for cloches
[6:30:34] Gelil: Why are we tucking neutrinos yum?
[6:30:39] MohamedYous5ef: le poop, yes
[6:30:43] philip0524: I usually inject poop in the toilet
[6:30:49] TheLynorus: @nexhunter yeah but you just get the deuterium and tritium as fuel first and then fuse those into helium
[6:30:55] MiraPacku: peepopoopoo
[6:30:59] Nepli: pretty shitty mod tbh Kapp
[6:30:59] streyder: @spiderqueen7202 yeah happens very very rarely

[6:31:24] DecoyOcelot: you wish
[6:31:26] Arkypoo909: This is a shitty idea Kappa LUL
[6:31:28] benjamin_berry: Isn’t there a poop -> poop recipe?
[6:31:40] streyder: @thelynorus you “just” do it? That’s super hard
[6:31:41] Nexhunter: @TheLynorus and then mass suicide cults can inhale that helium pepeLaugh
[6:31:52] MiraPacku: waffleBlind
