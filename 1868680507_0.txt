[0:23:21] georgehehheh: Crash patrol ggeeSalute
[0:23:24] Akhawais: More specifically, broken cinema
[0:23:54] georgehehheh: Ah yes yogTODDY
[0:24:01] Hodgelett: Doesn't look broken right now rooste78QUESTION
[0:24:17] georgehehheh: @hodgelett Yet hryPogO
[0:24:20] Akhawais: idk why it keeps happening, it's either the SSD is dying or there's a connection issue with YouTube specifically
[0:25:08] Akhawais: Looks stable for now
[0:25:09] Hodgelett: I'd be more inclined to blame the software
[0:25:10] georgehehheh: Must sometimes be quite tough to diagnose from your end
[0:25:50] georgehehheh: I've got a job in Derby hryBoggies
[0:25:56] georgehehheh: For September
[0:26:15] Akhawais: It can be but usually straightforward but this bug is quite weird this time
[0:26:18] psykhohedgehog: yogHey Cinema goers.

[0:27:02] psykhohedgehog: Congrats george!
[0:27:30] Akhawais: @georgehehheh yogGERS
[0:28:13] georgehehheh: I don't think I'm allowed to divulge detail, but involves exciting stuff vedalExcite
[0:28:37] georgehehheh: Thanks Akh yogLove
[0:28:53] Akhawais: Sounds pretty exciting!!
[0:28:54] georgehehheh: Thanks psykho yogR
[0:29:10] Akhawais: My advice is make the most of your time until September
[0:29:16] Akhawais: Work is fun but also tiring
[0:29:31] Akhawais: And you have to do adult stuff like "book annual leave in advance"
[0:29:46] georgehehheh: I will be, they permitted me to start after a family holiday
[0:30:04] psykhohedgehog: yogR I read marine. So now I'm imagining your position involves making fish frenbots.
[0:30:05] georgehehheh: to Costa Rica nagCool
[0:30:19] Akhawais: Niceee
[0:30:27] georgehehheh: @psykhohedgehog dafnotLul

[0:32:25] Hodgelett: I've scheduled time off in September...for other people's weddings yogR
[0:32:34] psykhohedgehog: yogR Cinema just had a burp. Not a hiccup.

[0:34:17] georgehehheh: @hodgelett I hope you at least enjoy yourself with them NotLikeThis LUL
[0:34:47] Hodgelett: I'm maid of honour for one, so currently enjoying planning the hen party
[0:35:20] georgehehheh: @akhawais Sadge can you add in the classic remix bug as a feature
[0:35:30] Hodgelett: Also an Aussie friend is over then too so figured taking the week off was sensible
[0:35:54] georgehehheh: One in fifty videos turns into a techno TTT
[0:36:08] Akhawais: @georgehehheh No need it will be back itself at some point ðŸ«¡
[0:36:18] georgehehheh: LUL
[0:36:47] Hodgelett: Techno colours too?
[0:36:58] JaffaMod: We're now going for an ad break that will last up to 5 minutes. Make sure you subscribe ( twitch.tv/yogscast/subscribe ) to not see them anymore!
[0:37:06] georgehehheh: I feel like the current bugs don't have the same charm though yogO
[0:37:39] psykhohedgehog: Like the infinite BAM video?
[0:38:35] georgehehheh: Like where it repeated every two seconds in a staggered pattern yogOkay
[0:38:50] JaffaMod: While we're offline, check out: shadowatnoon playing Planet Zoo: ðŸŒ¸no thoughts head empty monday mood !radio stream saturday bingo friday over at twitch.tv/shadowatnoon !
[0:39:11] psykhohedgehog: Oh, the feaver dream remix.
[0:39:28] georgehehheh: Or even better, when it played bits in slow mo, so they sounded drunk LUL
[0:39:43] georgehehheh: Yeah the fever dream remixes, I miss those LUL
[0:40:11] Akhawais: Yeah the old solution was to adjust the playback rates of the audio to catch up with the video when we had desync issues
[0:40:26] Akhawais: So you would at times have slow mo audio or chimpmunk audio (rarely)
[0:40:43] georgehehheh: I loved that LUL
[0:41:20] georgehehheh: Was annoying when I wanted to sleep to it tho LUL
[0:41:23] Akhawais: Thankfully I stumbled across a better way of doing it BUT
[0:41:24] psykhohedgehog: They were great, but they made my anxiety spike sometimes. yogHands
[0:41:29] Akhawais: Now we have more problems
[0:41:35] georgehehheh: yogC it's not a sex thing
[0:41:49] Akhawais: Sleep to the remix?

[0:41:51] georgehehheh: @akhawais boupheGrr classic
[0:41:52] Akhawais: or to BAM
[0:42:38] georgehehheh: Either, but when it happened to BAM it actually wasn't that funny yogHA
[0:43:06] georgehehheh: I'm so glad it's blacklisted
[0:43:47] psykhohedgehog: Same, I do love Tom, though.
[0:44:35] georgehehheh: I love Tom too, but I've realised I'm too ADHD for his videos, too slow for me LUL
[0:45:27] psykhohedgehog: They help my anxiety. Slow relaxed videos help.
[0:45:30] georgehehheh: I consumed his old TABS horse videos like crack on demand, but I kinda stopped watching much after that
[0:46:02] Hodgelett: That's essentially what Zoom does I learned when it drops frames
[0:46:23] georgehehheh: It's a bit like me and Sips, I love the guy, but only watch him when I like what he's playing
[0:47:28] georgehehheh: Because then his humour and my focus on his content is combined into a great experience
[0:47:42] georgehehheh: Similar thing for me with Tom
[0:48:26] georgehehheh: But Tom focuses on specific genres and indie games, so I'm not really drawn to his content as much

[0:49:27] Hodgelett: Any good vids to celebrate Fionn's birthday?
[0:49:35] georgehehheh: But it's very good that he has his own style. I really like when he collabs with other yogs

[0:51:32] Hodgelett: I feel this one plays a lot
[1:01:03] psykhohedgehog: Time to put my phone down and sleep. Take care all and have a good night.
