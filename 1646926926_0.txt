[0:20:25] DOOMinion: why does it say that next drawing is yesterday?
[0:20:26] Holycorn817: you only get the full value if you take it as an annuity, you get less if you take it all up front, which is the cash value - fees and taxes and all that stuff
[0:20:32] Meat_Skirts: If I won the powerball I would legit go live on twitch and helicopter my ween until banned. Like at that point YOLO
[0:20:38] ninopanda: est cash value is 932.2 Million.  that takes taxes out as well as everything else

[0:21:59] SassyPants: @JoshuaACasey To the vendor I assume
[0:22:02] jmm548: yeah 900 mil is after taxes but then u pay more when do your taxes they take more
[0:22:06] Frosteffect: smithing to 99 was rough
[0:22:06] Meat_Skirts: @ninopanda how could they have it taxed when every state is different tax number
[0:22:09] Imperial_Kappa: 1k KEKW
[0:22:09] UnholySkrub: You playing the new god of war?

[0:23:09] ninopanda: @Meat_Skirts you win the 1.9 billion.  then after taxes and everything is paid out you get 932.2 million.  that is how other states that dont tax as much will pay more of the cash value
[0:23:09] Harmar: you were talking about a bunch of different things yesterday, burgers, noodles, pizza LUL

[0:23:36] Calls1gn: $300 for groceries for the week Sadge
[0:23:40] Allmostdone: food is at all time high
[0:23:49] 0sem0: D:
[0:23:50] TheIrishGuy: Stew
[0:23:56] ThatOnneGuy: My butcher said if you can find steaks for sub $9.99, buy plenty
[0:23:58] TheIrishGuy: ravioli
[0:23:58] wonly: theres a big thing with meat processors controlling the meat market atm, only a couple processors doing all the meat basically
[0:24:02] brag1: brag1 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 48 months! how was Soulstone Survivors? Played the beta and it seemed fun
[0:24:02] Pbjtime54: the inflation that's "not happening "
[0:24:05] LtLeotard: evening
[0:24:09] bensmcc: What grocery chain?
[0:24:13] LtStang: i grind up my own boar
[0:24:15] ThatOnneGuy: Also if you plan on getting a turkey for thanksgiving, GET IT NOW. They're gonna get expensive
[0:24:16] Meat_Skirts: @ninopanda you’re not understanding. They wouldn’t put the cash value on the website for the whole country if it was after tax. State taxes change the total payout for every state. The total on the website is before taxes
[0:24:18] Nexhunter: @Pbjtime54 the inflation that is happening for the globe so don't be dumb dwjftSuffer
[0:24:25] ObsceneTwix: dioxide i think
[0:24:26] SeaOfMadness_: Nitrogen probably
[0:24:35] LtLeotard: Nitrogen
[0:24:36] jayerbuu: nitrogen maybe
[0:24:38] Aldizzert: They use CO on tuna.  Keeps it bright red
[0:24:39] LtStang: nitro
[0:24:41] Grumpage: steak is usually better when it goes brown
[0:24:42] prozacco: nitrogen maybe
[0:24:45] nellydocs: dihydrogen monoxide pepeLaugh
[0:24:50] JimmyHuren: They trying to poison us monkaX
[0:24:50] Apparentthreat: I don't think standalone butchers are doing that?
[0:24:53] SassyPants: you guys are thinking of tires
[0:24:56] Allmostdone: why not have it cryo frozen
[0:24:57] LtStang: i thought monoxide would brown the meat
[0:24:57] ilaj_vynneve: "Nitrogen at 99.0% concentration is usually recommended for food preservation."
[0:24:57] Apparentthreat: that'd be a silly expense
[0:24:59] 0ddR: sodium pentanal
[0:25:02] Milkman157: its nitrogen the same stuff they put in chip bags
[0:25:05] Aldizzert: CO binds with the hemoglobin, keeps it red
[0:25:07] Nexhunter: it will be primarily nitrogen
[0:25:14] dennixfailalot: fresh meat only good for one day susHmm
[0:25:21] Myekos: would be dangerous to work with CO in your typical store fronts
[0:25:24] Nexhunter: there will be some carbon monoxide but it is primary nitrogen
[0:25:25] prozacco: hehehehe gassy meat
[0:25:29] jayrickson87: nitrogen for race car tires
[0:25:30] prozacco: toot toot
[0:25:33] LtStang: vaccumm sealer
[0:25:35] AlfaAnanas: i use oxygen for breathing it helps me keep fresh
[0:25:37] Allmostdone: why not use some sort vacuum
[0:25:37] Apparentthreat: You just need to freeze stuff from a butcher
[0:25:43] SassyPants: i have some ground beef I need to cook
[0:25:44] Apparentthreat: in the paper
[0:25:44] LtLeotard: It's fun to think about that oxygen is a substance that is slowly eathing the planet.
[0:25:45] Harmar: if you dont freeze it same day have to use it within a few days
[0:25:46] ThatOnneGuy: I love my vacuum sealer
[0:25:53] LtStang: cook fresh
[0:25:55] ninopanda: @Meat_Skirts im not going to argue with you.  the website and people who work with the lotto have posted how it works
[0:25:57] Bergyi: KEKW
[0:25:58] Miskav: Why not use a better solution
[0:25:58] Calls1gn: Time to shop!
[0:26:06] Meat_Skirts: @ninopanda lmfao okay
[0:26:11] ThatOnneGuy: I use my vacuum sealer for all sorts of shit. Meat, fruit, veggies
[0:26:12] AlfaAnanas: why use a car when i have a horse?

[0:26:28] TigerLuv: sceen
[0:26:35] TigerLuv: scene
[0:26:35] suicidebolt: They use nitrogen for stuff like apples for long term storage
[0:26:57] Myekos: https://fortune.com/2022/11/07/tax-bill-if-you-win-the-billion-dollar-powerball-jackpot/  for the tax debate
[0:27:00] TheIrishGuy: did some one win
[0:27:07] Nexhunter: @suicidebolt all foods love nitrogen for preservation cause oxygen is what spoils shit
[0:27:07] Meat_Skirts: @ratscapula it’s not going to help lol. Some people already made their mind up XD
[0:27:08] Nexhunter: and no
[0:27:11] nativeW01f: Missed yesterdays stream, what’s the craic with Astro colony?
[0:27:12] Nexhunter: they only just announced the numbers
[0:27:22] Allmostdone: and it's all about keeping the bacteria from growing on the meat?
[0:27:31] suknuts: i only wanna play DnD
[0:27:32] Csstform: Csstform subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 50 months! five zero Pog
[0:27:37] suknuts: so addicted
[0:27:41] SassyPants: yeah they know all the tickets that were issued
[0:27:50] Thermaight: one of the states was having difficulties reporting, so they delayed the draw
[0:28:03] espi: Hey you look cute today
[0:28:07] Nexhunter: @SassyPants yes but given they were taking precautions last night I tbh wouldn't expect them to announce
[0:28:17] Nexhunter: immediately
[0:28:18] OMICRON: sammyw11Sus
[0:28:18] prozacco: they probably have to go by a bunch of legal before public disclosure of whether anyone won but tbh im just speculating
[0:28:28] thunderdawg11: how much would it cost to buy all combinations?
[0:28:30] Csstform: I just installed this, is it any good?
[0:28:33] LtStang: is this like raft?
[0:28:34] Nexhunter: @prozacco
[0:28:38] Milkman157: the numbers are reported to the agency when they are sold so they will know if has been sold
[0:28:38] omar_i_: no minecwaft? Sadge
[0:28:39] Nexhunter: @prozacco nah they could give less fucks
[0:28:39] Triwinner97: what is the TLDR of this game?
[0:28:41] W84M3: what you think about the game @Giantwaffle ?
[0:28:41] Myekos: 600m
[0:28:49] absynth123: @LtStang It's basically raft meets satisfactory in space
[0:28:50] FrostedSentry: and would take forever to print those tickets cohhCheer
[0:28:52] CantTouchDisNow: just wait for a news outlet they will find and doxx the guy pretty fast KEKW
[0:28:58] Allmostdone: security problem. like the guy who was on the lottery board that was arrested for fixing
[0:29:01] Apparentthreat: prozacco I don't think they hide anything. stores like to brag about being the winning store, etc. people have to disguise themselves
[0:29:16] Kardiiac: not only that but it takes time to physically get the tickets
[0:29:17] Nexhunter: @CantTouchDisNow unless the state allows a private hidden trust then they goochi
[0:29:21] bcdmonkey: Elon wafflePoint wafflePoint
[0:29:23] SeaStudios: elon musk cough
[0:29:24] NyarrX: @giantwaffle I got vorki yesterday at 64kc my first pet
[0:29:31] prozacco: @Apparentthreat not that, i mean imagine announcing something and once it turns out to be a goof, then having to backtrack on the announcement
[0:29:32] complexprotein: Anyone that has 600m to do it, is probably smart enough to not do it
[0:29:32] Aldizzert: Elon buys Powerball, This just in
[0:29:32] FrostedSentry: would love to see that kind of elon troll
[0:29:36] Quaigon_Twitch: you need more money than you would win

[0:29:46] thunderdawg11: big brain
[0:29:47] UnicornBrothels: seqThink
[0:29:47] AndrewUHD: KEKW

[0:29:57] GiantRobotNinja: CoolCat
[0:29:57] UnicornBrothels: @LtLeotard how dare you

[0:30:05] BearAntlers: @TK_Verge big brain luck from smallest brain man
[0:30:16] Allmostdone: LOL. that was a great theory
[0:30:16] TheIrishGuy: @giantwaffle and he still won't pay tax on the winnings
[0:30:19] Nexhunter: also chat you can't just buy the powerball the MUSL that runs it is a multi state operation
[0:30:21] hotdog_bun_water: so one who really doesn't need it wins
[0:30:22] elusivei: Then he buys twitch...
[0:30:27] AndrewUHD: popCat
[0:30:40] thunderdawg11: @BearAntlers Daddy Elon is 100 steps ahead
[0:30:52] MSUdude: hows it raft like?
[0:30:54] Chikin__: its just astroneer but updated
[0:31:01] Pict1on: raft in space got it

[0:32:23] iliketrains0605: iliketrains0605 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 9 months, currently on a 8 month streak! What happened to the PC build?
[0:32:46] absynth123: It always seems weird to me how space games just use assets from Earth. Why are there tropical palm trees on a floating asteroid
[0:32:46] TussMane: POGGG
[0:32:51] headbang3rboogie: we might see POST?
[0:33:12] dylan0806: New contact frame?

[0:33:28] ToxicAWOL_TV: @Giantwaffle new Kurzgesagt video
[0:33:33] lcePops: What is a contact frame?
[0:33:49] Ladon_Dragon: Sorry for the distraction Kappa
[0:33:51] SickFilthu: which contact frame you got?
[0:33:56] CantTouchDisNow: seen it all :)
[0:34:02] zetsuro: YEP
[0:34:03] forfiet: Did you see EVGAS prototype “4090”
[0:34:14] forfiet: Jayztwocents  got sent a copy
[0:34:15] ChromeSDK: I have my new ultrawide monitor on the way and it was delayed "due to mechanical failure" according to UPS...
[0:34:15] nick43087: Not the 4090.  KEKW
[0:34:21] Pict1on: existential crisis here I come !
[0:34:26] Thermaight: @lcePops it is a replacement for the CPU hold down hardware, it makes the contact between the CPU and cooler flatter/smoother and helps with thermals.
[0:34:29] フリクリ: rdy waffleSip
[0:34:32] Systox: I hate watching(stealing) you video   I am out
[0:34:39] lcePops: Thermaight thank you!

[0:34:45] SickFilthu: thank you
[0:34:49] forfiet: The not “4090”
[0:35:06] Aldizzert: Why don't we drop nuclear waste into a tectonic subduction zone?  That one actually makes sense.
[0:35:12] Grumpage: yeah GamersNexus got a not 4090 as well
[0:35:25] Calls1gn: No Powerball winners, estimated $2.3 billion for tomorrow's drawing

[0:36:20] insuftw: can you play powerball outside the us?
[0:36:23] Nexhunter: OMEGALUL
[0:36:30] Orin_The_Sly: Can't win this one

[0:36:43] Triwinner97: what was the tech issue?
[0:36:54] UnicornBrothels: pog
[0:36:55] JoshuaACasey: thanksgiving is thursday. powerball drawing is monday, wednesday, saturday
[0:36:58] MasterKraft: a great way to split a pot is to pick your own numbers, random for biggest win IMO
[0:37:03] gregcee: @Miskav LOL
[0:37:04] Aldizzert: 14 92 16 20 17 76
[0:37:04] iliketrains0605: I got the powerball right only PogBones
[0:37:29] bcdmonkey: Shoot it into the sun waffleNote
[0:37:44] baconburgerfries: dizzyBarf
[0:37:47] D_roi_D: wait thats a lot
[0:37:48] Nexhunter: i know where to use that spent fuel Kappa
[0:37:48] thunderdawg11: This is what i do at work
[0:37:53] Allmostdone: bad bad idea
[0:38:01] Aldizzert: Breeders
[0:38:03] Tabakhase: der8auer teased a 4090 OC video "where he doesnt even have to powrmod, its just entirely open" - i wonder if thats a "not 4090" video as well pepeLaugh
[0:38:10] farcryer2: or we could use the waste for small scale reactors
[0:38:16] Quaigon_Twitch: breeders are a myth
[0:38:19] Glacial_Indifference: Correct
[0:38:20] absynth123: Pebble-bed reactors are way better
[0:38:22] bcdmonkey: Nodders
[0:38:23] thunderdawg11: yes
[0:38:24] Aldizzert: Think so
[0:38:25] aritas: yes
[0:38:27] SeaOfMadness_: Breeder reactors are made to make Plutonium
[0:38:29] Nexhunter: yes but they suck for producing weapons
[0:38:29] mahoraz: i wanna see the rocket that can handle the radiation if its shot into space
[0:38:30] dylan0806: Or medical isotopes
[0:38:31] Triwinner97: KKona hell yea
[0:38:32] kenshin2666: what if we fire the nuclear waste into the sun to dispose of? Kappa
[0:38:40] ok_juju: that was chernobyl design
[0:38:41] Nexhunter: yep
[0:38:47] A_Wildland_Firefighter: Thorium Salt reactors are the way to go.
[0:38:48] bcdmonkey: Most call it greed
[0:38:49] Allmostdone: we don't need more weapons
[0:38:56] darthrithen: thorium
[0:38:58] Grumpage: plutonium on chips is lush
[0:38:59] wonly: japan has a nice reactor called HTTR going to use it to generate hydrogen for fuel cells and its high temp so it'll be used for steel creation and other high temp industries
[0:39:03] Aldizzert: Breederscan breed different species, depending on design
[0:39:04] Nexhunter: power is a by product the real product from our reactors is the resulting waste
[0:39:09] Jared948: I use thorium in WoW Kappa
[0:39:32] Nexhunter: and yes plutonium
[0:39:32] Moobot: You can sub to Waffle by clicking this neat link -> twitch.tv/giantwaffle/subscribe SUBprise
[0:39:36] Thermaight: thorium is poorly developed technology, pebble bed is a natural extension of existing work and research and is inherently much safer.
[0:39:39] Nexhunter: but we haven't made new RTGs in a while
[0:39:40] Harmar: its a waffle fix Kappa
[0:39:42] Aarimous: Noted
[0:39:57] Nexhunter: the stuff they call by product is what we actually want to produce the energy is the by product KEKW
[0:40:05] SeaOfMadness_: If the rocket blows up KEKW
[0:40:08] fraenklyn: most reactors were also build 30 years ago.
[0:40:15] JoshuaACasey: @SeaOfMadness_ that's what I thought of
[0:40:18] thunderdawg11: This is what the company i work for does. Store and maintain nuclear waste before we ship it to new mexico
[0:40:36] Myekos: 1 twitter per year
[0:40:37] fraenklyn: you don't replace them economicaly
[0:40:42] kenshin2666: 1 twitter a year KEKW
[0:40:43] Jared948: Sweet the cost of twitter
[0:40:45] ok_juju: imagine if that rocket went bakoom
[0:40:46] Apparentthreat: waffleDrip
[0:40:48] bcdmonkey: Wha that, 4% of twitter?
[0:40:48] Aldizzert: 44Billion again hmmmmm
[0:40:48] Jared948: ayy @kenshin2666
[0:40:48] kurtbarlow: 44bil for entire world isnt that much
[0:40:58] Allmostdone: so the cost is something the goverment looses
[0:40:59] ThatOnneGuy: monkaHmm how much do we spend on the us military again?
[0:41:18] thisisbrad: this is 2021
[0:41:18] Glacial_Indifference: Yep, and most of the orbital routes are getting full.
[0:41:21] thisisbrad: '22 was even higher
[0:41:25] Nexhunter: yes but they aren't unique rockets per launch
[0:41:26] kurtbarlow: @ThatOnneGuy exactly, 44bil is cheap
[0:41:28] thebodge: why are they launching so many?
[0:41:32] Nexhunter: so it wouldn't work for this concept KEKW
[0:41:36] mahoraz: and were supposed to be suffering from lack of fossil fuels LUL
[0:41:43] wonly: china is going to implode before they finish that station
[0:41:49] Bleu_Forge: KEKW
[0:41:49] Onoson: And all the launches increasing air pollution too
[0:41:52] darthrithen: it would if just leo
[0:42:02] farcryer2: I can see the future of NUCLEAR RAIN KEKW
[0:42:03] Allmostdone: well china might drop a few on some of their citizens
[0:42:04] Nexhunter: @CthuIhu96 all the SpaceX launches pepeLaugh
[0:42:05] ThatOnneGuy: monkaS HE SAID THE T WORD
[0:42:13] baconburgerfries: HypePat
[0:42:14] absynth123: It would be much cheaper to use mass drivers to launch nuclear waste into space.
[0:42:15] BlainL: temporary storages somethging waffle would do
[0:42:17] Gay1e: Nuclear industry uses Temperary solutions just like Waffle does.
[0:42:29] Shoebex: why send it to space just bury it in the ground where it came from
[0:42:32] Glacial_Indifference: We wouldn't put it in LEO
[0:42:37] Miyagui16: shoot it to the sun
[0:42:38] wonly: one of the lagrange points probably
[0:42:39] mephisto__ttv: just yeet into into the abyss
[0:42:41] Myekos: imagine the communications interference
[0:42:43] mahoraz: and then boost the depo into space if its full
[0:42:43] Awesomeaustin37: Then if the station is hit that is a disaster
[0:42:43] 0ddR: send it to the sun?
[0:42:44] Nexhunter: no we would shoot this shit to the sun
[0:42:52] Valohrak: so much energy
[0:42:55] TigerLuv: send it to the moon
[0:42:56] gregcee: Do you think SpaceX is going to make their own spacestation?
[0:42:56] thunderdawg11: whats wrong with storing it under ground like we do now?
[0:42:57] Aldizzert: And eventually plunge them into the sun.  dV be damned!
[0:42:58] Tabakhase: instant kessler onr soon to be kesslered KEKW about the same
[0:42:59] Nexhunter: do not keep this shit within our missile ranges KEKW
[0:43:05] MasterKraft: Jsut need to "yeet" it to wrd the sun, let time handle the rest
[0:43:05] SeaStudios: monkaW
[0:43:06] akaCube: shoot it into another planet
[0:43:06] Quaigon_Twitch: how would you keep that station up? with all the radiation good luck woth your electronics LUL
[0:43:07] thebodge: but some countries just don't care, they'd launch it right at US satellites
[0:43:07] ThatOnneGuy: PogChamp
[0:43:09] zetsuro: monkaS
[0:43:11] espi: sending something to the sun is absurdly hard, only have to look at the Parker Solar Probe mission
[0:43:17] DOOMinion: into the sun
[0:43:25] Myekos: just use nuclear rockets
[0:43:30] Nexhunter: @espi nope wasn't hard it made it there and kissed it KEKW
[0:43:38] zetsuro: rip YEP
[0:43:41] ThatOnneGuy: just aim it for a small village like china
[0:43:42] Nexhunter: minor issue

[0:58:56] Aldizzert: I'm honestly not sure, but if one ticket is 1:300million, would 10 unique tickets be 1:30 million?

[1:38:58] thebodge: the raft rotation gets really funny when you build super far out... it spins you around reallly fast
[1:39:03] kaztrogaming: what him be like ya ive been to space
[1:39:05] TheDadministrator: @Smithii follow your nose
[1:39:07] Gay1e: Wouldnt the concept be that hte compass would point to the greatest source of perceivable gravity at any giveing point of time?

[1:40:26] Crazyfox55: The compass gets pulled down
[1:40:26] Brakebein: nouth weast

[1:41:06] Daanaas: have u doct the to planets ?
[1:41:08] Ghulmeister: earth is in space, so we are technically in space aswell
