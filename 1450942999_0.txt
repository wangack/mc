[0:13:58] ryant2205: it was chaos in the crowd
[0:13:58] ImmaWizard_: @imTymp this you dont expect lattifi to just get back on it
[0:14:24] drifter_310: stroll paid actor confirmed
[0:14:33] imTymp: if lattifi was forced to let pass I wouldnt of expected him to floor it again and inside overtake
[0:14:35] Sav_gg: what did the stewards determine?
[0:14:43] DrWinston0Boogie: pepeD Go McLaren
[0:14:47] imTymp: it is strolls fault but it was shitty timing for lattifi to just get back on it

[0:26:12] 0omkins: "The Canadian also has two penalty points added to his FIA super licence, taking him up to seven for the 12-month period.  The stewards wrote in the bulletin that Stroll had a “lack of situational awareness of Latifi's passing manoeuvre” up the inside towards Turn 6, making him predominantly to blame for the collision."
[0:26:18] Vargh: they have to be able to take 1 liter of fuel out for sampling
[0:26:38] ryan_tokki: do you like the modified melb track?
[0:26:57] iivu1canii: Doesn't tsunoda have 8 penalty points ?
[0:27:37] ryant2205: @Lion_Touroseu_Tokki its annoying if anything because it takes more of our public road so more traffic then normal
[0:28:06] iivu1canii: and then Stroll proceeds to blame latifi LUL

[0:28:44] StOrMy1100: He's just a joke. He doesn't deserve his seat
[0:28:46] 0omkins: he's going to get himself or someone else killed.
