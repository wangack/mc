[0:40:16] Fenyx_Of_Chaos: unless they are in water or in shade
[0:40:17] VoxTheBanshee: some things will die but some won't
[0:40:18] Thalenias: which they will
[0:40:18] NotKaciel: not the spiders
[0:40:19] Azuremoon13: if they aren’t wearing a hat then ye

[0:46:57] SteeleX: You can see the point at which I saw his message
[0:47:01] TheeeToxicAvenger: lol
[0:47:20] SteeleX: I do that in group chats all the time and its always hilarious

[0:48:54] Bad_Dog_Games: She didn't say kiwi
[0:49:02] Bad_Dog_Games: No spoiling
[0:49:06] Fenyx_Of_Chaos: 5 streams later "Builds a mansion"
[0:49:09] SteeleX: Oh don't worry I'm not backseating I'm riding shotgun
[0:49:29] Zapafaz: spoiler no spoiling
[0:49:29] SteeleX: With GPS upside down
[0:49:46] VikeXIV: "the GPS says to go straight!"
[0:49:58] SteeleX: LUL
[0:50:08] Fenyx_Of_Chaos: I remember when I was a college lad I got into this game for a while and copied builds from YT videos and such. Good times
[0:50:15] 0ntan1o: @VikeXIV never done that in my life
[0:50:48] SteeleX: Cass builds gr8 in any crafting games so this too will be fire
[0:51:07] VoxTheBanshee: one of the biggest reason I stopped playing minecraft is I need a map from day one and ideally a minimap
[0:51:12] VikeXIV: i made a somewhat to-scale replica of my house in minecraft when i was in middle school
[0:51:18] NotKaciel: oh heck
[0:51:25] NotKaciel: brb rewatching tokyo ghoul
[0:51:26] Fenyx_Of_Chaos: Mods
[0:51:29] Azuremoon13: vanilla maps suck
[0:51:33] Azuremoon13: you need a mod
[0:51:35] NotKaciel: ^
[0:51:35] StreamElements: Curious about our alerts? Check our Panels OR do !bitalerts Sparkles  !subalerts Sparkles or !tipalerts in chat ⋅⋅♡⋅⋅
[0:51:38] TheeeToxicAvenger: i remember when i found out about working elevators in minecraft, made a home on top of a mountain with an elevator inside the mountain
[0:51:46] SteeleX: @vikexiv I made my entire school complex and then it didn't save and lost half of it SeemsGood
[0:51:50] VoxTheBanshee: there are maps in the vanilla game but they are not that helpful or early
[0:51:56] SteeleX: That was my last time really playing playing
[0:51:57] VoxTheBanshee: you have to craft them
[0:52:00] VikeXIV: vanilla map is like if you asked me to draw directions to a place i've been 3 times in my life
[0:52:16] Fenyx_Of_Chaos: if u plan on navigating without mod maps, u need coords
[0:52:17] VoxTheBanshee: yeah I make a trail of torches personally
[0:52:19] VikeXIV: can grab the coordinates of it with one of the buttons (i can't remember which)
[0:52:19] Azuremoon13: if it is something you really want.. we can help you get a mod installed for a map for another stream :p
[0:52:22] Fenyx_Of_Chaos: by pressing F3
[0:52:44] Azuremoon13: yeah don’t look at F3 you’ll get confused LUL
[0:53:05] Fenyx_Of_Chaos: actually yeah I take that back
[0:53:05] buttsbot: actually yeah I qter that back
[0:53:06] VikeXIV: the easiest way is to not die :)
[0:53:08] VoxTheBanshee: but also, think about dying and spawning similar to valheim
[0:53:30] chelsymm: That's why I always build near my spawn point in the beginning. Respawn ans reminding my base frustrates me.
[0:53:35] StreamElements: My new Video Diary is out now: Sparkleshttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa1STlyr-zo&t=65s
[0:53:48] b00kitt3n: I crocheted myself a little striped cat ear hat, inspired by you!
[0:54:23] NotKaciel: i usually take a bed with me if im going far
[0:54:31] b00kitt3n: I love it so much! I made it tan and gray like cat colors and with a pink border like the nose!
[0:54:42] Fenyx_Of_Chaos: So I was talking about builds earlier, and I've seen ones that are straight up like a person's face
[0:55:56] VikeXIV: have y'all seen the large-scale project that a group did to build out the entirety of Middle Earth in Minecraft?
[0:56:02] Fenyx_Of_Chaos: how much time effort does that take like I just wanna ask the person doing it and be like "Are you okay? Can I get u some water cuz that feels tiring"
[0:56:05] TerraTanzanite: froogySit
[0:57:04] Bonny299: cassidotRIP cassidotRIP cassidotRIP
[0:57:11] VikeXIV: ripperonis
[0:57:18] 0ntan1o: if you want to
[0:57:22] 0ntan1o: yuh
[0:57:31] Zapafaz: @Fenyx_Of_Chaos there's ways to easily convert pictures and 3d models stuff to minecraft build plans
[0:57:32] VikeXIV: can't believe they started you in the snowy mountains
[0:57:32] 0ntan1o: that's for after stream
[0:57:35] VikeXIV: kinda rude
[0:57:45] Fenyx_Of_Chaos: aaaah
[0:58:05] Thalenias: I'd start in a place you can easily build a starting base, just in case you die.  You can move later on to a nicer place
[0:58:05] Zapafaz: @Zapafaz but i'm sure some ppl are just artistic like that
[0:58:06] chelsymm: This is a particularly rough map.
[0:58:36] VikeXIV: Weenie 2.0
[0:58:42] Zapafaz: tehre's also creative mode where you can fly and have infinite resources so
[0:59:04] VikeXIV: this already seems much nicer
[0:59:33] Fenyx_Of_Chaos: Yup
[0:59:43] Fenyx_Of_Chaos: im sure you'll be fine here
[1:00:46] chelsymm: I don't like dessert maps. They're no fun to me, this map seem to be friendly, for minecraft anyway.
[1:01:36] Fenyx_Of_Chaos: Im more into Jungles
[1:02:05] 0ntan1o: I fuck with the mountain biomes
[1:02:15] VikeXIV: i love snowy mountains
[1:02:17] Fenyx_Of_Chaos: Jungles cuz Pandas. I love feeding the pandas
[1:02:18] Bad_Dog_Games: Lush meadows
[1:02:29] chelsymm: My fav is the cherry trees and bamboo areas.
[1:02:34] hushlavenderkitten: the cherry blossom
[1:02:36] VikeXIV: my soul yearns for the mountains
[1:02:37] 0ntan1o: the mountain biomes are hella pog my g
[1:02:39] NotKaciel: my favorite biome is wherever your house is so i can put my bed next to yours
[1:02:39] buttsbot: my favoqter qterome is wherever your house is so i can qter my bed next to yours
[1:02:41] hanlambo: I like the desert one where there's a lot of terracotta
[1:03:40] chelsymm: I like in mobile mine raft you can pick a seed template and cherry blossoms is an option.
[1:05:06] hanlambo: not constantly being on the run from monsters here
[1:05:48] hanlambo: not on this new save, you were on the other one
[1:07:30] chelsymm: Loosin my supplies is my least favorite part of death in minecraft.
