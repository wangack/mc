[2:26:08] KairoTheFoxtaur: KairoTheFoxtaur subscribed with Prime. 
[2:26:08] DonDanieIo: dig but unfinished
[2:26:08] Captain_Yerkanov: Guys smart is missing his forehead WutFace
[2:26:09] wodn1wnayc: bro u made such a mistake not taking splash!!!!
[2:26:09] flyyboyy: !firered
[2:26:09] RegisMark5: rigged. the game is afraid of the power of Lotus
[2:26:09] Nightbot: Della the Skarmory beat FireRed Kaizo Ironmon!!
[2:26:10] zeldacore: powasl1CONTENT
[2:26:10] antom609: just for splash
[2:26:11] Quittle7: Sadge
[2:26:15] Gintamasuke: Splishy splash
[2:26:15] paiigeamber: damn that‚Äôs rough, buddy
[2:26:17] logmania: pls no water ground Prayge
[2:26:20] GabryKiane99: Future Lucarios will have splash tho!
[2:26:20] tangtangotang: Flame blitz look OP - 120 power o.O What's the drawback?
[2:26:21] tinyraccoonhands: does this challenge include Kanto as well or just up to E4?
[2:26:22] DonDanieIo: placeholder dig
[2:26:24] lolpantser: why no recoil?
[2:26:25] Radund: 6 if you are lucky
[2:26:26] chineseguy79: smolSpin
[2:26:26] paiigeamber: prince zuko moment
[2:26:27] neonblaccpro: OHHH 12 bc kanto
[2:26:28] alvaricooke2346: You doing Kanto too?
[2:26:30] Voltrident: also, potential heart scale check for moves?
[2:26:30] bretkissinger94: Rumor is that's a 1 in 1000000 chance ohko with splash
[2:26:30] XChronosGaming: @smallant If you think about it, since every move is derived from dig, you technically know every move already
[2:26:31] zeldacore: @tinyraccoonhands ends with red
[2:26:32] matitras: why 6 and not 12?
[2:26:32] w3dls: is it too late to pivot?
[2:26:34] Lylaurion: maybe heart scale lvl 1 moves too?
[2:26:37] Novamender: Don't worry gym 5 TM is volt tackle
[2:26:39] bhutch12345: on average it'll be 6, in this run itll be 1 cause you arent getting past the next leader
[2:26:41] LotusAivy: There are randomizers that have Arceus of every type as a separate mon. Saw it in a game with overworld encounters. There was God everywhere!
[2:26:42] Fi_ller: at least he's having fun splashing around
[2:26:43] thsgrn: @tangtangotang normally it does recoil damage
[2:26:45] tiyanigean: Q: What determines which TMs you can use? standard rules or also randomized?
[2:26:46] Lylaurion: blackthorn
[2:26:47] dukeofburgerz: blackthron
[2:26:47] Chakracat: blackthorne
[2:26:48] bryguy4747: on this island, isn't it?
[2:26:48] goopygav: If you picked splash the challenge would of been to easy
[2:26:48] Voltrident: blackthorn, at 8th gym
[2:26:49] aghon52: oh man, lotus is still alive? that‚Äôs sick
[2:26:49] alvaricooke2346: In the 8th gym
[2:26:49] Novamender: Blackthorn
[2:26:50] Overvaluation: @dukeofburgerz ya the gpu shouldnt affect load times, just hdd vs ssd and number of saves it's holding
[2:26:50] Circassa: @tangtangotang it has recoil damage, but his ability negates recoil damage so now drawback for him
[2:26:50] awsmrs: blackthorn
[2:26:51] triforce00111: blackthorb
[2:26:52] ErgoMageSteph: blackthorn
[2:26:53] Misserette: Splash is the first part of dig but without dodging the damage
[2:26:53] Redlod: 8th gym town
[2:26:54] livipup: luceZoom
[2:26:55] Disclosinq: this looks like a really good run for attempt 10
[2:26:58] zeldacore: blackthorn

[2:27:00] guash87: beating Kanto too sounds crazy hard
[2:27:00] Tibobene: isnt move relearnier not allowed?
[2:27:02] akobjay21: bless you
[2:27:02] pwrsk8r: !ironmon
[2:27:03] tangtangotang: Aaah, flame blitz is fire volt tackle

[2:27:05] dododomka: hi everyone<3
[2:27:07] y0ggurtt7: lotus nazi solute confirmed??
[2:27:07] brafricaon: is surf physical/better than aqua jet?
[2:27:11] alvaricooke2346: You should relearn Sand Tomb
[2:27:12] Circassa: @tangtangotang yep
[2:27:17] Radund: Heartscale into Swords dance or D Dance would be huge POG
[2:27:19] KianiraStar: HG/SS are my favorite games kianirLOVE
[2:27:20] shadowfire953: that game has too many gyms
[2:27:22] thsgrn: @tiyanigean TMs given by gym leaders (which teach a random move), which also only have a 50% chance of being learnable by any given pokemon
[2:27:23] dukeofburgerz: @Overvaluation cause i was trouble shooting with him and his CPU was like 97% or something
[2:27:24] goopygav: If you picked splash the challenge would of been to easy
[2:27:25] logmania: also our spatck is awful so no
[2:27:25] whorainzone10: @brafricaon surf is special
[2:27:29] bryguy4747: waterfall is physical, but same deal -- can't use it
[2:27:29] awsmrs: @KianiraStar same
[2:27:32] excited_raichu: also aqua jet is better on this stats
[2:27:40] RegisMark5: steelix must be getting rusty
[2:27:42] CapDeathWish: kanto might be easy cuz all of those gym leaders aare lv50 normally. so they'll all prob be 75
[2:27:43] dukeofburgerz: KEKW
[2:27:44] niamhistired: LUL
[2:27:46] SouthArcticBirds: That is an impressive SpA stat
[2:27:50] zyer_: ah
[2:27:50] 0_D_cee: They should make splash damaging when in water
[2:27:51] shadowlama97: is there gonna be a video on the super Mario odyssey only up
[2:27:53] dukeofburgerz: the sp atk Dump is HUGE
[2:27:54] lavender_sunsets: OOF
[2:27:57] ermnsi: the spa is really really nice, its basically as low as it can get
[2:27:59] neonblaccpro: SURF=surfboard SLAP
[2:28:02] extraneat: its carrying this mon ngsl
[2:28:03] Azeron7: Is this generally considered harder or easier than FireRed Ironmon?
[2:28:04] StevensDs: Don't kill the Mawile!  pingde1Sad pingde1Sad pingde1Sad
[2:28:06] bhutch12345: just wait until the counterpart to foul play comes in
[2:28:08] dukeofburgerz: Shuckle attack almost
[2:28:10] niroxium: did you just get mold broken?
[2:28:10] Thelexh: i thought lucario was a mixed attacker?
[2:28:14] doorkmaster: Ye I think minimum is like 10 LUL
[2:28:15] zxchrys: good thing it‚Äôs not defense or speed
[2:28:15] akobjay21: area zero battle music is so good due
[2:28:17] Radund: This is a great SPA considering he is a ATK mon
[2:28:18] Circassa: aqua jet is useful for finishing off enemies, especially if you're slower than them later on
[2:28:18] GabryKiane99: Surf is the second part of dig, but water
[2:28:19] psemtube: @Thelexh randomized stats
[2:28:20] logmania: catJAM
[2:28:20] chineseguy79: i like reading the chat from the tip of his hat
[2:28:21] tiyanigean: @thsgrn oh I phrased my question wrong, I meant what determines which of those TMs the mon can actually learn
[2:28:22] scout_aoe: you defeated the dialga shouldnt you catch it insted ?
[2:28:23] neonblaccpro: we want recoil attacks bc rock head
[2:28:25] mattnoahg: sorry dumb question why doesn‚Äôt the flare blitz deal recoil to you?
[2:28:26] eisen59: how is it even that low?
[2:28:27] LarioxLOL: too much spread in HP and ATK need more in DEF and SPD Kappa
[2:28:31] austiinos: @thelexh its a randomizer
[2:28:36] dukeofburgerz: @mattnoahg rock head ability
[2:28:37] gray_zoldyck: @Thelexh Randomized stats
[2:28:37] FrohAndKoh: !firered
[2:28:38] Nightbot: Della the Skarmory beat FireRed Kaizo Ironmon!!
[2:28:38] xTrufiane: @mattnoahg his ability
[2:28:41] Misserette: Have you seen or heard of Cassette Beasts before?
[2:28:41] Circassa: @Radund what? its randomized...
[2:28:44] Thelexh: @psemtube sorry i didnt realise cuz im an idiot
[2:28:44] BennoDrago: Good attack though, which is what you want
[2:28:44] Overvaluation: @dukeofburgerz bg3 is a very cpu heavy game, moreso than most these days. 97% sounds normal for some parts of the game!
[2:28:46] CapDeathWish: @Thelexh the stats were shuffled
[2:28:50] legoless100: geese i left for 2 hours and your level 56 i left while you were still in the 30s

[2:28:52] Pavipoke: @mattnoahg lucarios ability prevents recoil
[2:28:54] scout_aoe: but you are not allowed to defeat wild pokemon either^^
[2:28:56] bhutch12345: nyanwoord
[2:28:57] ghostcly: schoolgirl bob?????
[2:28:57] Radund: @Radund Yes all stats are randomized as well as the Pokemon
[2:29:03] Fidayyyyyyyy: smolSpin
[2:29:07] Orphic____: @tiyanigean it's 50/50 for gym tm's to be learnable
[2:29:13] dododomka: Skyblock later?
[2:29:15] dukeofburgerz: @Overvaluation oh man monkaS i'll pass that on too
[2:29:19] neonblaccpro: WHY can ROCK SNAKE SURF
[2:29:21] Circassa: @Radund so why did you say it has great SPA?
[2:29:23] ArodGem: Good luck man! This ironmon can be particularly rough
[2:29:30] logmania: so just grind on wild shinies Kappa
[2:29:30] Sando_MTG: its not gyarados tho
[2:29:30] TristeTempss: that means that outside from the spA, your Lucario has probably insane base stats then ?
[2:29:31] neonblaccpro: NO ITS DIALGA
[2:29:38] dysenteryy: nothing compared to platinum hitless
[2:29:39] quitostuff: what does the thing next to the PC do in the pokecenter?
[2:29:39] Thelexh: love how 7 people immediate hit my finger with a ruler (like my teacher back in the day) to say im stoopid lol
[2:29:40] mattnoahg: dang pretty lucky to get flare blitz with Lucario then
[2:29:40] bulkylion: could this be the run, or is lucario's speed stat too low?
[2:29:43] cryofire11: i thought you were able to catch or beat 1 pokemon per route?
[2:29:44] Sando_MTG: the shiny at rage lake is random
[2:29:46] motomus64: hey Smallant have you played Mario 2 the lost levels?
[2:29:50] ErgoMageSteph: can't wait to see what the shiny gyarados randomizes into
[2:29:52] Sloosh_e: You should not have said that
[2:29:52] Pikapeww: @neonblaccpro it‚Äôs a metal snake‚Ä¶ like a boat. of. it floats >.>
[2:29:52] Circassa: speed could be higher
[2:29:52] LimeGround: lucario is cool

[2:30:02] awsmrs: @ErgoMageSteph we already beat it Clueless
[2:30:03] blitzknight401: is nightbot programmed to tell me ur randomizer settings??
[2:30:05] PeterBP616: Don‚Äôt jinx it!
[2:30:06] ermnsi: hgss ramps from gym to gym, it gets constently harder.. you will now slowly feel it
[2:30:06] Radund: @Radund Because in Kaizo Ironmon you want 1 low attacking stat and 1 high attacking stat.  So his SPA is low and hit ATK is high.  Which is great
[2:30:13] zelirion: GURT
[2:30:24] logmania: almost Sadge
[2:30:26] Cherby7: imagain if he beats this on his 10th attempt LUL
[2:30:28] Circassa: @Radund oh "great" as in its great that its low. that wasn't clear lmao

[2:31:10] livipup: Lycel smolBLANKIES
[2:31:11] Radund: @Radund Correct,  Only thing that would help this mon would be less heath and more speed and a little more ATK for more one shotting late game

[4:08:15] Nightbot: In a beta test build, the player would respawn with a stack of bookshelves, enchanting tables, end portal frames and end portal blocks so the devs could easily test their functions. That's why everything is built out of bookshelves and enchanting tables. smolWow

[4:09:38] thestarlightmaster: Bro this is very risky
[4:09:40] 4twevix: You should have put them while placing the blocks
[4:09:42] joebobcosmos: Hey Smant do you follow American football
[4:09:44] ugivmegoodfeel: they can only pick up blocks in an area that's not flat, so as long as the surface they're on is horizontal and doesnt have any blocks at their height, you're fine. @SmallAnt

[4:10:20] ItzJammz2: could you quickly make a texture pack to make string more visible
[4:10:25] poggers_73: woop woop woop

[4:10:47] PureSeason: Will you be the first to have an endermite farm video. I couldn't find one on YouTube. @smallant
[4:10:48] dtmund: use a texture pack
[4:10:49] Doike326: Cant you put on a texture pack that makes it easier to see?
[4:10:50] thsgrn: do you know how much string you started with? you should be able to count what's left
[4:10:51] thestarlightmaster: What was the most hardest farm for you to build?
[4:10:52] suwucideee: @suwucideee yeah he said its a block, so i said hitblockses
[4:10:54] digino24: What would you say is the coolest farm design you've seen from a creativity perspective?
[4:10:56] Brumbleberg: String is so the snow cant land on the cobble KEKW
[4:10:57] bwampgobrrrrr: So that they cant place blocks or smthn
[4:10:58] RemiTh3Rat: i knowabsolutely nothing
[4:11:01] ProfManique: Ant is just trying to string us along Kappa
[4:11:03] PuffieDane: they can't place blocks there
[4:11:06] LemonAndCrime: Your square is only 31 blocks wide, is that correct?
[4:11:07] WilllBomb: @dtmund not a bad idea
[4:11:09] lavender_sunsets: very confused lmao
[4:11:09] logmania: @Brumbleberg ah yes the snow in the end
[4:11:10] akobjay21: this is giving me the same energy as watching somebody build an entire house brick by brick
[4:11:11] livipup: @Brumbleberg Snow Golem?
[4:11:12] droopydrojon: I saw him skip one block it‚Äôs where one of the endermans were standing when passed it by

[4:11:42] GoldenGage19: Just got here how are we doing
[4:11:47] mugiwaralux: did the ironmon run die?
[4:11:48] aroseinbloom: you can use a texture pack that makes string easier to see
[4:11:49] Zoboo_the_Mafoo: Imagine this is just a prank and the strings do nothing
[4:11:51] livipup: @joe_ott He just said string doesn't spawnproof the platform because it has no collision
[4:11:53] dindul: the string stops snow golems from spreading snow maybe
[4:11:54] SuperTheUnderDog: @mugiwaralux yes
[4:11:55] NewtoRah: do it in a spiral inwards so that each ring will be smaller and it will feel like it's going faster
[4:11:57] dtmund: if you use string then you could see them better
[4:11:57] Joking_Ace: Are they going to pick up the string and make a giant blanket? monkaHmm
[4:11:57] ShardKore: !ironmon

[4:12:08] 4twevix: use a texture pack
[4:12:09] vKhaleed: @goldengage19 throwing string all over the floor
[4:12:14] chuliRMG: u gotta make a tex pack so u can see the string better LOLL
[4:12:22] catcatmegan: Smant has a talent for decorating
[4:12:33] Lycel: turn string to milk
[4:12:46] vKhaleed: string is milk
[4:12:46] dragonlo: Maybe look for a texture pack where string is better visible?
[4:12:47] livipup: Would using redstone instead of string work?
[4:12:48] exilesmumanddad: @lycel exilebdHug
[4:12:48] akobjay21: crouch toggle is still on
[4:12:49] Brumbleberg: you need roughly just over 9 stacks of string for this btw @SmallAnt
[4:12:54] willrsq: maybe go peacefull during build lol
[4:12:54] thestarlightmaster: What happens if you accidentally hit an endermen
[4:13:00] dukeofburgerz: OH
[4:13:01] ordinaryjoe9834: How much string do you need?

[4:13:18] DeadNight_4: is this some kind of update supressor ?
[4:13:18] SuperTheUnderDog: silent alarm
[4:13:18] lukesweeting: maybe put a carpet down to reminder where the last string will be put so you dont forget
[4:13:20] EzraManning: waterlogged sculk sensor: am i a joke to you

[4:14:21] stormapple: Pretty scary smolFlushed
[4:14:24] LemonAndCrime: Mr Ant - Your square is 31 blocks wide. Would it be worth counting the other side to make sure that it is a square or is it not important?
[4:14:24] Sonic495: hey smant i believe you missed a block Kappa
[4:14:25] dracnplays: alot of villagers can spawn cats wich can give string
[4:14:26] terakin21: the machine
[4:14:26] GabryKiane99: U can sell string
[4:14:28] bhutch12345: if you missed one then you missed two and missing two is unlikely
[4:14:32] Dampseeker: yeah you can dupe string
[4:14:32] akobjay21: piglins can give string
[4:14:37] battlingthecats: there is no villagers that trade string
[4:14:38] feedusmaximus911: string duping is a thing
[4:14:44] Brumbleberg: ah ok my bad soz
[4:14:46] jethin7: can you use the hitbox view to see string
[4:14:46] Thegalagladi: Why are the vods of the second ironmin stream missing @chat ?
[4:14:49] agentblzzrd: i'm here what r we doing?
[4:14:49] superchad27: villagers can trade it
[4:14:49] 1nacnud: just use the string texture pack when ur done maybe
[4:14:51] FaeAura: yeaaa there's a really funny string dupe. it just... spits out string endlessly
[4:14:52] 4twevix: Ye it's pretty easy
[4:14:53] Dampseeker: and the string duping machine is pretty easy to set up iirc
[4:14:55] DeterminedDaaf: String over the gap? Okay now this makes me think it might not have to do with enderman placing blocks
[4:14:56] bl00py: i feel like a texturepack would be fine, this would just be a nightmare to check through
[4:15:03] yuhcooper: no spider spawners right?
[4:15:05] battlingthecats: fishermen buy 20 string for 1 emerald
[4:15:09] newluigi_09: Why the strings tho ??
[4:15:12] raparent06: just got back how did the ironmon go
[4:15:14] cricketzs: are you setting up a tripwire to trigger and push them towards the middle?
[4:15:15] thestarlightmaster: You can see strings ten times better in pocket edition
[4:15:16] sergeshimada: love this song
[4:15:16] afmetz: why the strings?

[4:15:25] akobjay21: piglins can give you string smant
[4:15:26] Dusk5_: does this design use the trapdoor trick in the middle?
[4:15:28] aroseinbloom: there's already texture packs that exist for visible string
[4:15:29] rangacherry: vanilla tweaks has a texture pack u can download
[4:15:29] jenkmanss: what is he currently doing?
[4:15:32] logmania: PauseChamp
[4:15:32] willrsq: you started with X strings and have to fill Y blocks. If someone goes to the vod and checks the number, it will be easy to know if you missed some at the end !!
[4:15:33] raparent06: @bhutch12345 ok thanks
[4:15:38] Varigatou: I like when that happens tho..
[4:15:39] DeterminedDaaf: Surely it exists already, a string texture pack
[4:15:45] Radund: just blank screen then fix your texture
[4:15:47] catcatmegan: Amoungus in minecraft? Clueless
[4:15:48] PyjamaMole: lycelS

[4:17:19] chazmarkanov: what does the string do though
[4:17:20] thatwalmartman: what‚Äôs the end goal
[4:17:21] dindul: put it in peacefull while building this
[4:17:24] PyjamaMole: NODDERS
[4:17:32] livipup: @PureSeason Probably because it prevents other stuff from being placed on the cobble without preventing spawns
[4:17:34] akobjay21: you can get more string from piglins
[4:17:35] lost_soul0007: Does string doesn't count entities on it or smth
[4:17:35] Zoboo_the_Mafoo: I searched for string texture packs but none of them look great honestly

[4:17:51] cryofire11: the string is to catch ender fish
[4:17:51] djfvh22: Is it so endermites won't spawn?
[4:17:55] destroyah9009: Ye
[4:18:01] PureSeason: Oh yeah. Enderman can't pickup string?

[5:27:01] Z3ddicusZ: one you threw didn't go over the edge. I wonder if that was the problem
[5:27:01] DamienPup: Is it something with the old enderman?
[5:27:02] Coltanzebot: the pearls float and kill them
[5:27:02] dracnplays: ITS NOT ENTITY craming
[5:27:05] Radazzle: embrace the chaos
[5:27:07] dukeofburgerz: it feels like a sewer pipe
[5:27:07] Crunchee: Do the blocks count as separate entities?
[5:27:08] ServantChild: Why don't we start the world in spectator?
[5:27:09] Mirashade: Darn
[5:27:09] MrWafWaf: if it spawns all blocks could it spawn a block that causes damage?
[5:27:10] peltrux: maybe the chest is giving problems
[5:27:12] Yuwkaa: the same u way u die to the entiry blocks so do the endermen
[5:27:12] mrmcflufflekins: are they trying to place a block on the chest?

[5:27:38] granimated: when you move away they're able to teleport and it might be on the chest
[5:27:40] TaubenPilz: buttfart would have lived
[5:27:41] extraneat: Is there a broken string that's letting them place a block that kills some and they explode?

[5:27:52] maxthechillbot: @bdogo6 I think if he goes to peaceful it will delete meep
[5:27:52] Varigatou: Do they die when holding waterlogged blocks?
[5:27:53] Dusk5_: i think the explosion will only stop with meeps death sadly
[5:27:58] bdogo6: nvm i forgor abt meeeep
[5:27:58] maximumpower18: Enderman had their reach changed
[5:27:58] manatee_uprising: NOOO

[5:28:02] Radi_culus: Does the lava block burn while its being held?

[5:28:07] peltrux: try removing the chest, anything that's diffenrent to the test u did can be @SmallAnt
[5:28:09] yuhcooper: Why is there a chest there anyways?
[5:28:11] maxthechillbot: @mischievouslittlegoober I don't think missing a string would matter
[5:28:12] knoodler: Does anything weird happen if you save and reload a world when a mob is in midair? Like taking extra fall damage?
[5:28:15] TanglingOcean45: how much health does hte fall leave them on?
[5:28:19] terakin21: catJAM
[5:28:19] mrmcflufflekins: @SmallAnt hello Mr strimmer I might be a big dumb dummy but maybe they might be trying to teleport/ place a block on the chest?
[5:28:20] KellanTK: are they teleporting into the pool of water?
[5:28:21] Dutch_7: maybe the "items" are considered falling blocks, then dealing damages to the endermens
[5:28:25] axolot0401: can you pick up fire?Small ant?
[5:28:28] PyjamaMole: yeah weird that it only happens now, idk
[5:28:29] maxoulehibou: can someone in the chat tell me what is the Gamemode or Game version that allows him to do that ? I dont want to make smant repeat
[5:28:41] TrevDragon: It didn't look like you missed a piece of string, would missing one do this??
[5:28:42] jackowackismonkeyman: Love your stream smant
[5:28:46] Dusk5_: @maxoulehibou its a april fools update, one block at a time

[5:28:54] awesorn: smolSpin
[5:28:58] itcamwdcbook: @TanglingOcean45 maybe, if a dead enderman drops a pearl and it does damage to all the other endermen
[5:29:00] h7yt0p: hello, can anybody simply explain whats going on?
[5:29:01] yuhcooper: If one of them holds a fire block or a block that could dp damage could that damage the rest of them
[5:29:02] MrWafWaf: suffocating in the chest that they MIGHT be dropping INTO?
[5:29:02] CowntessMoo: Ok chat, who is Meep? I've missed SO MUCH.

[5:29:17] bhutch12345: @CowntessMoo meep is an endermite used to aggro the endermen
[5:29:17] RiskOfTea2: If a single one dies it drops an enderpearl, though
[5:29:19] iansonofthor_: @CowntessMoo The endermite we named
[5:29:20] 6double: @knoodler it takes too long before the explosion. plus we see some holding blocks before it explodes
[5:29:24] smallant_fan69: @SmallAnt go in spectator mode to see why their dying maybe?
[5:29:31] CowntessMoo: Endermite! That makes sense. Thank you :D

[5:37:26] TheCodaMinecraft: @zxinglam one block at a time it was the 2022 april fools update

[5:37:46] CashCab1221: you can get that technically
[5:37:51] yuhcooper: Can they place blocks on teh way donw on the walls?
[5:37:53] 0_stamina: are the endermen spawning with random blocks?
[5:37:54] Wauby: you are gonna have to swap a few times to get all the items anyway, unless you want like 100 endermen just sitting there
[5:37:55] smudgemci: who is meep??
[5:37:55] knoodler: Try killing most of the existing Endermen before saving and upgrading?
[5:37:58] lavender_sunsets: and get new armor

[5:38:21] smudgemci: can someone tell me who meep is?
[5:38:24] Lukaelle: Maybe its the chest
[5:38:25] PureSeason: @smudgemci Meep is the endermite or should I say enderAnt

[5:39:03] ndv330: Use /give with a command block
[5:39:07] someguywithaeye: Give meep a base
[5:39:08] thatguy2232641: command blocks are cheating right?
[5:39:08] DeterminedDaaf: Maybe meep needed to be a block higher or something? Idk
[5:39:09] DamienPup: @thestarlightmaster enderman in this update can only any block

[5:39:46] TanglingOcean45: make wall
[5:39:52] z_amaranth: its very satisfying watching you yeet everything into a void
[5:39:53] RiskOfTea2: Could they still TP to stairs?
[5:39:54] PureSeason: @alfredhitscotch entity cramming needs a lot more enderman
[5:39:55] dom124124: @thatguy2232641 yes it's cheating
[5:39:57] thestarlightmaster: Smant are you looking for a specific block or item?
[5:40:00] granimated: have a backup plan if that isn't the case
[5:40:01] TheCodaMinecraft: @solidifiedgod read the bottom of the screen or look at the google sheets
[5:40:06] Lukaelle: Are you gonna restart to save meep?

You have one option: Buy a physical copy of the version you want and install it on a Switch that has no prior update data of that game without internet and with auto-updates off. If you already had the game installed, you have to factory reset to down patch, just deleting the game isn't enough. This means you will only be able to play on the 1.0 version.

[5:58:55] RemiTh3Rat: grAAAA
[5:58:57] RiskOfTea2: Are you throwing one through the corner long enough for it to take a tick of suffocation?
[5:58:57] DamienPup: WHYYYYY NOOO
[5:58:58] logmania: tnt monkaW
[5:58:58] awsmrs: NOOO
[5:58:59] egulio64: I think they teleport back up into the spawning platforma and take fall damage twice

[5:59:11] jvo24: entity cramming?
[5:59:11] EOValyrym: entity cramming but real this time?
[5:59:13] maxthechillbot: o7 MEEP
[5:59:14] chaospants: LUL
[5:59:14] Flamesnivy: entity cramming?
[5:59:14] bhutch12345: isnt it 30 blocks tall?
[5:59:15] DeterminedDaaf: It seems to start small, and then it just falls like domino stones
[5:59:16] willrsq: i feel sorry for you
[5:59:18] 0_stamina: they all took damage at once
[5:59:21] PyjamaMole: how far is the frop?
[5:59:22] soapywater345: THEYRE CAUSING A RIOT
[5:59:24] bhutch12345: that'd make it exactly 32 blocks from bottom to top
[5:59:25] granimated: i think you had missed with one enderman and then it was able to teleport
[5:59:27] PeterBP616: What the heck just happened
[5:59:28] TanglingOcean45: i think its fall damage
[5:59:31] RemiTh3Rat: @the_lucky_artificer I thought so too ! Maybe he forgor theyre also renewable ?
[5:59:32] PyjamaMole: they can tp 32 blocks
[5:59:33] DamienPup: double fall damage? that could be it!
[5:59:37] Flamesnivy: if they spawn holding a falling block?
[5:59:39] stinkytobybean43: add water

[6:00:05] Dusk5_: a fall so fun you gotta jump twice
[6:00:05] Gintamasuke: They're determined to make it the end
[6:00:05] michaelman3117: back to the drawing board

[6:00:10] Aubade1_: Madge
[6:00:12] dukeofburgerz: oh lower the floor works
[6:00:16] Sparks353: or raise the platform
[6:00:22] bald2nd: What we trying to get?
[6:00:23] ichikawahyuga: smolWop
[6:00:24] bhutch12345: raising the platform is so much more effort
[6:00:24] dune1992: you sure you dont want to rebuild the entire top bit instead?
[6:00:26] soapywater345: LAG CAM?
[6:00:27] Lukaelle: its all worth it in the end!
[6:00:28] PyjamaMole: KEKW
[6:00:30] egulio64: you technically don't need them to take any damage just make the platform higher until they take no damage
[6:00:32] bhutch12345: move 20 blocks or move 900
[6:00:33] stormapple: KEKW
[6:00:34] cryofire11: the fun of building farms
[6:00:34] lavender_sunsets: KEKW
[6:00:34] SkyNintendo204: THE LAT
[6:00:36] maxthechillbot: vip whoever it was that figured that out
[6:00:36] michaelman3117: i also thought he was gonna raise it but lowering it is just easier
[6:00:37] SuperTheUnderDog: it does seem water was part of it though, since it took a lot longer to break
[6:00:39] GTU_vovan: hi
[6:00:41] logmania: lol the camera started doing the thing at the perfect time
[6:00:42] RiskOfTea2: @SmallAnt if they break out and get on the back wall, they get extra height too, right? Does the whole thing need dropped?
[6:00:42] chaospants: You all glitchy
[6:00:42] dukeofburgerz: understandable
[6:00:43] guash87: AND replace all the string lol
[6:00:44] soapywater345: 27 sounds nicer
[6:00:44] GabryKiane99: Make it 54
[6:00:45] deadlydrumer0: the laggg
[6:00:45] Joking_Ace: @dukeofburgerz nah increase the height do more work YEP
[6:00:46] Gintamasuke: Probably lowering the floor is easier. I get it
[6:00:47] rodri99pt: find it funny how it's universal for minecraft lagging the pc when booting up
[6:00:49] DamienPup: KEKW the camera glitches
[6:00:50] pizza194862: why can enderman spawn holing anyblocK???
[6:00:50] magictrait: Woah your camrea crazy bro
[6:00:50] JaceOfThePhoenix: JaceOfThePhoenix subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 41 months! I heard annoying and I was summoned
[6:00:51] garymcharry: Lag cam everytime you fire up the backup
[6:00:52] wishingrats: not to mention the string that‚Äôs on top XD
[6:00:53] violethtml: have you ever played pokemon conquest?
[6:01:00] stinkytobybean43: water?
[6:01:02] TheCodaMinecraft: did you start on twitch or youtube first?
[6:01:02] bhutch12345: @pizza194862 one block at a time
[6:01:02] penguingladiator: how long hav you been at this
[6:01:02] dukeofburgerz: v fair
[6:01:05] dracnplays: if you raise the platform then you need to place the string again
[6:01:06] RemiTh3Rat: Which of the renewable plants are you trying for smat ? I think youve thrown out the rose bushes twice now and i dont know if it was a mistake or intentional smolEyes
[6:01:06] dom124124: 8 stacks
[6:01:07] GigaBeavers: ahh yes water
[6:01:14] ichikawahyuga: The fit is üî•
[6:01:15] SkyNintendo204: What games have you played today?
[6:01:21] thsgrn: you could instead build a higher layer for this version
[6:01:23] redgi_o_matic: water would be a great idea
[6:01:24] mrburstcraft: this is still vanilla right?
[6:01:32] th3_red_baran: they can take up to a 43 block fall
[6:01:32] Zyonji: Do you have powdered snow to cancel fall damage?
[6:01:35] bhutch12345: I saw them teleport back up
[6:01:39] thsgrn: just build a platform high enough that they don't take any fall damage and it'd be fine, right?
[6:01:39] DamienPup: @mrburstcraft yep
[6:01:40] RiskOfTea2: Would TP up on the chain then falling that extra distance also kill them?
[6:01:44] stinkytobybean43: im going to get that bowl of cereal
[6:01:44] awsmrs: @SkyNintendo204 he's played pokemon heartgold and minecraft
[6:01:44] wernic111: what about powder snow the landing platform so they dont take damage?
[6:01:56] TheCodaMinecraft: Did you start twitch before youtube or vice versa?
[6:02:05] SuperTheUnderDog: @mrburstcraft vanilla*. Only mods are for framerate and to keep this a skyblock world (prevent blocks on generation)
[6:02:06] Zyonji: Slime would cancel fall damage too.
[6:02:07] pizza194862: no
[6:02:08] RiskOfTea2: Powder snow under carpet prevents fall damage @SmallAnt
[6:02:08] SkyNintendo204: it doesnt work that way
[6:02:09] garymcharry: Carpet on top of powdered snow
[6:02:09] michaelman3117: they could freeze to death
[6:02:11] wernic111: powder snow + carpet
[6:02:11] shjiji: carpet on top
[6:02:12] the_lucky_artificer: yes
[6:02:12] redgi_o_matic: eventually
[6:02:13] jelato12: you can put carpet on top
[6:02:14] ValociraptorBlue: if you have the powder snow 4 blocks up they will pass through it
[6:02:14] pizza194862: Yes
[6:02:15] Zyonji: Carpet on snow cancels fall damage.
[6:02:16] Sling_07: Not if you put carpet on top
[6:02:16] namesarewordsonyt: put carpet on the powder snow
[6:02:17] TheCodaMinecraft: powder snow and carpet
[6:02:20] QotSA0718: I THINK THEY WOULD
[6:02:20] jugardecisiveable: carpet on snow cancels fall damage
[6:02:20] redgi_o_matic: after a while they die
[6:02:21] jaceisveryes: I think they have to be fully covered to die
[6:02:22] y0ggurtt7: we‚Äôre definitely gonna need an update vid üòÖ
[6:02:26] 0_stamina: what about slime blocks?
[6:02:26] strahduk5594: cmcSkull cmcSkull cmcSkull
[6:02:28] etanesnd: do you have hay or beds?
[6:02:32] garymcharry: Powder snow with carpet
[6:02:33] gabe_42_: slime?
[6:02:33] michaelman3117: under the carpet though only negates the damage
[6:02:35] Dusk5_: slime/powdered snow with carpet ontop would keep the bois safe
[6:02:42] redgi_o_matic: smol2O
[6:02:42] spaceboy834: could you put hay blocks at the bottom?
[6:02:42] maxthechillbot: cobwebs might be safer
[6:02:47] p0int_crow: honey blocks
[6:02:51] maxthechillbot: cobwebs instead
[6:02:51] michaelman3117: 1 off
[6:02:53] jelato12: you need 9
[6:02:57] DeterminedDaaf: probably need 9
[6:02:59] michaelman3117: honey and powdered
[6:03:00] blobblesss: Hi Smallant! Your my favorite streamer, first time catching a stream!
[6:03:00] WilllBomb: 9
[6:03:03] p0int_crow: they do
[6:03:03] the_lucky_artificer: they do
[6:03:04] tangelobreeze: hay and beds don't block all fall damage
[6:03:04] blue_instinct77: haybales?
[6:03:06] jugardecisiveable: @maxthechillbot arent cobwebs impossible
[6:03:08] SkyNintendo204: they do prevent damage
[6:03:09] Lukaelle: what about cobwebs?
[6:03:14] Wauby: can they fall in the middle block?
[6:03:17] jdogskizzle: you can just block off one block of the drop
[6:03:17] pizza194862: honey blocks
[6:03:18] maxthechillbot: @jugardecisiveable can't you craft them with string?
[6:03:27] dukeofburgerz: YEP
[6:03:27] jugardecisiveable: @maxthechillbot nope
[6:03:28] bhutch12345: simply like this
[6:03:28] TheCodaMinecraft: @maxthechillbot no...
[6:03:33] RiskOfTea2: @SmallAnt would there happen to be any snow at leftover cauldrons up top?
[6:03:33] joey____the_wall: 8 and 1 slime
[6:03:39] jelato12: you chucked a cobweb enderman into the void
[6:03:39] soapywater345: get cobwebs from enderman holding them
[6:03:43] dw33z1l: beds?
[6:03:43] usingername_: slime
[6:03:44] Aubade1_: let spiders sit in ur house for long enougn then u get a cobweb
[6:03:45] the_lucky_artificer: hay bales and honey block reduce fall damage
[6:03:45] SuperTheUnderDog: do you still get launched if the slime block has a carpet on top?
[6:03:46] Zyonji: Put a slime in the middle.
[6:03:46] PilkyPi: hay bales
[6:03:46] p0int_crow: HONEY
[6:03:47] GamesJam82: you can craft cobwebs with string
[6:03:49] etanesnd: bouncy castle!
[6:03:49] nach0ou: water Kappa
[6:03:51] jaceisveryes: Water does
[6:03:51] dforder4: lava
[6:03:52] derpdeerz: hay
[6:03:52] DeterminedDaaf: vines- but that's not helpful
[6:03:53] jugardecisiveable: iirc honey blocks cancel fall damage
[6:03:58] 0_stamina: wtf you said that idea was too silly
[6:04:00] cryofire11: haybales prevent a lot of fall damage
[6:04:03] sapphceleste: some of them will just be a little bouncy
[6:04:04] Tegridi: water Kappa
[6:04:05] terakin21: powder snow
[6:04:05] DeterminedDaaf: give them all a slow falling potion
[6:04:05] jaceisveryes: Water prevents fall damage
[6:04:06] Dusk5_: beds prevent damage i think
[6:04:13] bhutch12345: beds do not
[6:04:14] SkyNintendo204: Honey and slime prevent damage but slime bounces and honey doesn‚Äôt.
[6:04:16] WilllBomb: why cant you get more powdered snow?
[6:04:20] jaceisveryes: Water stops fall damage
[6:04:20] dforder4: lave most certainly prevents
[6:04:22] jugardecisiveable: beds only cancel like 30% damage
[6:04:24] etanesnd: Bouncy!
[6:04:26] macksamumz: im pretty sure its just an X in the crafting table with string
[6:04:26] soapywater345: bouncing endermen?
[6:04:27] Gioxsc: you have 2 powder snow i und the chest above
[6:04:28] PilkyPi: just use haybales
[6:04:28] bhutch12345: beds mitigate, they do not cancel
[6:04:33] jasianyx: honey doesnt
[6:04:34] michaelman3117: @jaceisveryes endermen cant touch water
[6:04:35] pizza194862: honey
[6:04:35] p0int_crow: yes it does
[6:04:36] blobblesss: This is an insane skyblock world
[6:04:37] redgi_o_matic: what happen to the pog guy
[6:04:37] blue_instinct77: honey blocks do
[6:04:37] jugardecisiveable: i swear honey prevents damage
[6:04:37] usingername_: it mitigates damage
[6:04:39] granimated: honey only does from the side chat
[6:04:39] bhutch12345: hay has the same issue as beds
[6:04:40] SuperTheUnderDog: can they get launched up to Meep? miiliPanic
[6:04:40] michaelman3117: honey slows ya down
[6:04:42] dukeofburgerz: i feel like it does
[6:04:42] tangelobreeze: vines
[6:04:43] Catpotatt: it can if you do it right
[6:04:43] RiskOfTea2: Honey is non-bouncy slime
[6:04:43] p0int_crow: it does
[6:04:44] Zyonji: Honey only does on the walls.
[6:04:48] caniac2006: yes it does...
[6:04:50] dukeofburgerz: dang
[6:04:51] michaelman3117: side only
[6:04:51] the_lucky_artificer: it reduces it not fully prevents it
[6:04:52] blobblesss: land on the side of the honey
[6:04:53] RiskOfTea2: It does from the side, like vines
[6:04:54] xolossus00: it blocks some dmg right?
[6:04:55] xsantosrafax: Cheer5
[6:04:58] cryofire11: i think you have to shift on the side of honey
[6:04:59] tytyharbs: it‚Äôs back!
[6:05:05] p0int_crow: take the carpet off
[6:05:06] maxthechillbot: I really thought you could craft cobwebs with 5 string, must be a modded thing
[6:05:07] jugardecisiveable: oh right they have to slide down it
[6:05:09] Outersquid: hay?
[6:05:11] DeterminedDaaf: You need to slide down the side, yeah that's not going to work, at least not with this setup
[6:05:11] caniac2006: It works like vines or a ladder, it's useless here, but it does prevent damage
[6:05:13] Aquila_Regalis: just train the endermen 4Head
[6:05:13] logmania: ah yes the enderman will simply bucket clutch Kappa
[6:05:16] knoodler: Endermen are gamers
[6:05:16] Potatachip: @SmallAnt  As with hay bales, falling onto a honey block reduces the fall damage by 80%, i.e. the player or mob takes 20% of the normal fall damage. They have the same sticky properties of slime blocks; when pushed by a piston, it will pull any moveable blocks along with it.
[6:05:16] dw33z1l: Wiki says honey block negates 80% of fall damage
[6:05:17] Gintamasuke: Endermen are just gonna hurt themselves
[6:05:18] p0int_crow: u have to take the carpet off
[6:05:19] jugardecisiveable: if they get pushed into the side it cancels it
[6:05:20] PyjamaMole: atirelComfy
[6:05:22] dforder4: no
[6:05:22] soapywater345: nah endermen are dumb
[6:05:23] SkyNintendo204: if it was version 1.23
[6:05:27] LapizSapphire: it reduces it if you land on top of it, but doesn't negate it
[6:05:28] p0int_crow: u gotta take the carpet off
[6:05:29] PyjamaMole: lycelS
[6:05:29] SuperTheUnderDog: The slime can't launch them high enough to reach Meep, right?
[6:05:30] michaelman3117: you just have to touch the side of the honey
[6:05:30] jaceisveryes: Give undermanned buckets too water clutch
[6:05:32] RiskOfTea2: Would there happen to be cauldrons left in the snow region that might've collected powdered snow?
[6:05:35] PyjamaMole: hey hey meep atirelComfy
[6:05:38] tangelobreeze: honey block prevent 80% damage
[6:05:40] maxthechillbot: they HATE meep
[6:05:40] xsantosrafax: Cheer85
[6:05:40] jdogskizzle: enderman will take freeze damage in the snow after a bit
[6:05:41] endercraft1020: MEEEPPPPP
[6:05:42] logmania: hi meep widepeepoHappy
[6:05:45] HectorR_98: Wouldnt powder snow kill the Enderman with frostbite tho??? dviperLurk
[6:05:46] usingername_: hello meep smolLove
[6:05:54] PyjamaMole: no
[6:05:56] SkyNintendo204: no
[6:05:58] Sling_07: No
[6:05:59] RiskOfTea2: can you put another chain above him, then carpet the top of that?
[6:06:00] namesarewordsonyt: no
[6:06:00] escapedcryptid: what are we doing rn?
[6:06:02] jugardecisiveable: im pretty sure theres a collision check
[6:06:02] pizza194862: no
[6:06:03] jelato12: no
[6:06:04] SkyNintendo204: Definitely not.
[6:06:04] DamienPup: no
[6:06:05] 3th4n_48: No
[6:06:08] bhutch12345: i can suffocate an enderman
[6:06:13] redgi_o_matic: only of they are into it
[6:06:19] stinkytobybean43: there non suicidal
[6:06:19] 3th4n_48: They tp
[6:06:29] maxthechillbot: water prevents fall damage, just use that Kappa
[6:06:38] redgi_o_matic: yeah use water

[6:08:42] blobblesss: other than thousands of teleporting enderman going insane, sounds great
[6:08:43] DeterminedDaaf: Why don't you use lava? If the endermen hold space at the right time they could take no fall damage
[6:08:45] Aflac37: the point is to kill it instantly, not to force a teleport
[6:08:46] etanesnd: give them slow falling?
[6:08:48] DeterminedDaaf: OI
[6:08:53] bhutch12345: @RaccoonMarioFogo no it doesnt because in enough time an enderman will still die
[6:08:55] der_James: you smant can you show what playlist this is?
[6:08:56] DEWTEAM2008: use nethrite blocks
[6:08:57] the_lucky_artificer: @bhutch12345 my point is that chat wasn‚Äôt lying

[6:09:02] knoodler: Because Endermen don't like the light, duh
[6:09:02] soapywater345: what if we use pointed drip stone?
[6:09:03] endercraft1020: theres so many of them
[6:09:04] Catpotatt: you should use dripstone bc if you relog then you dont take fall dmg
[6:09:05] stinkytobybean43: man im stupid
[6:09:07] logmania: 07 space program

[6:10:09] blobblesss: powdered snow gets rid of fall damage!
[6:10:19] biggiedag4mer: uhhh
[6:10:20] DeterminedDaaf: What if they land on the edge of the slime block? Could they still take fall damage?
[6:10:20] ItzRobinTTV: HEY ANT
[6:10:24] PyjamaMole: smolFine
[6:10:27] blobblesss: you can use that in the nether as well

[6:11:53] DeterminedDaaf: @usingername_ He's not in the update where that bug was patched, and maybe it'd be fine and they'd land on the snow. But better safe than sorry I think.
[6:11:53] OtherVinny: yeah I've pissed in carpets but it's really hard to clean
[6:11:54] stinkytobybean43: build a platform above in the chut

[6:14:23] PyjamaMole: PauseChamp
[6:14:24] pizza194862: what version are you going to?
[6:14:24] jugardecisiveable: if it landed on the edge it would still land on the powder snow so its fine
[6:14:34] DeterminedDaaf: Probably fine, but if something breaks it might be worth looking into.

[6:42:37] Captain_Devy: could you just kill the enderman and have them drop all the blocks you want instead of picking them up?
[6:42:38] blobblesss: mogswamp, its better than "cool garbage"
[6:42:38] celestis_almonds: You‚Äôre a very talented 7 year old
