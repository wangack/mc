[0:38:34] TelRehiad: @magenof that already kind of happens.
[0:38:34] Nexhunter: cause their own engine failed hard KEKW
[0:38:36] LordDusk: @magenof all games already use one of 2 major engines, barely any have their own...
[0:38:39] ShendoxJoey: when is minecraft coming to unreal KappaRoss

[0:39:38] Hunterwar: not even a complete game KEKW
[0:39:40] HostileLogOut: it had alot of polygons so yea.
[0:39:40] fafuja: lol
[0:39:47] aledantee: tahts raw assets..
[0:39:50] D3athKai: in future all games are 1tb in size LUL
[0:39:55] Nexhunter: and it isn't even using directstorage which will be using uncompressed assets for a while KEKW
[0:39:55] DrHax_: @b_booey true but I really doubt that new consoles are gonna ship with multiple TB of storage
[0:39:58] jmm548: when i got my series x i bought a 1 tb ssd right away
[0:39:59] Nexhunter: also internet caps
[0:39:59] BuLLeT_LV: Play only one :D
[0:40:00] CorSPACE: it was the project file tho not an exported project
[0:40:00] PaulFlies: UE5 have direct storage support?
[0:40:03] Askjong: Gamestreaming
[0:40:07] Nexhunter: storage is not the only thing at play
[0:40:09] Hunterwar: storage is not cheap at all... I was trying to buy a SSD and it was expensive than least year LuL
[0:40:13] ReconPeon: cloud gamming the future purely because of storage limitations
[0:40:13] IamWambo_: yeah also download speed, I only get like 15mbs
[0:40:13] n8level: I'm already at delete a game to install a game
[0:40:13] Monty0x: imagine using $15 per month cloud gaming and not having to download anything
[0:40:16] Nexhunter: ISPs are implementing data caps up the fucking ass
[0:40:18] Switcharoo: Games are going to be over a TB
[0:40:24] ReconPeon: gaming*
[0:40:26] strxcc: This is a tech demo not a normal demo which means it was pushed to limits the 100GB file size is high for that main reason, sure games will be big but not like this yet
[0:40:27] ayonme: internet cap in 2020 KEKW
[0:40:30] Joshuapetch: @nexhunter just don‚Äôt be capped 4Head
[0:40:31] SodiumDoggo: maybe we should go back to physical games where they can just store the game in the physical copy
[0:40:32] handofdoom_101: Uncompressing/compressing is gonna take a lot of CPU
[0:40:45] PaulFlies: Yeah, limited B-Roll catalogue it seems
[0:40:51] HostileLogOut: @handofdoom_101 nope. Directstorage removes the need for it
[0:40:53] Nexhunter: @Joshuapetch yep let me just avoid a monopoly that implements a 1.5tb cap sodaMad
[0:40:56] GenericFutureMan: just tuned in, what is this?
[0:40:59] ShendoxJoey: Forget storage amount though, some people still don't have access to decent download speed. YOu may have 1tb SSD's for $80, if a game is 500gb and you have 4-10/mbps that's just a feels bad
[0:41:08] jmm548: to save time u can buy a cheap external HD with like 2 to 4 tb to move the series x games over to then back when u want to pay, faster then reinstalling
[0:41:08] D3athKai: prometheus
[0:41:10] Nexhunter: and data caps @ShendoXJoey

[0:42:31] Saisino: @ShendoXJoey Maybe the next step could be for devs to sell SSDs/harddrives preloaded with the game. so you get a SSD + the game :)

[0:44:16] SmartDoll: why not just use something you're used to? there's no point in fighting over an engine for a game
[0:44:17] Jack_Snack_: you can mix C++ and Blueprints
[0:44:18] aeadon: use it when you need it

[0:44:27] SmartDoll: language and engines are just tools

[0:44:29] Jack_Snack_: if you compile the engine you can extend Blueprint with your own stuff
[0:44:30] HostileLogOut: Blueprint sucks. its so slow to work in.
[0:44:31] kiegh_: you can turn blueprints into c++... it's a great way to learn c++ if you know what the blueprints are doing
[0:44:34] irregular_urek_mazino: just learn c++ 4Head
[0:44:39] vapo213: well you can build blueprint templates in C++ and use them in the Blueprint editor

[1:01:47] Belfiglio3: there is a way but we need x y z c b to all join in... lmfao

[1:13:25] Draiv_: Why save mats before hitting 1400 on main? You are just missing out on gold by not doing all the content

[1:13:34] aurulentus: The books
[1:13:44] Cannonboot: 1385 is perfect parking place for now before we getting valtan
[1:13:47] dumplingator: I think its about 1000 extra gold
[1:13:52] edible_jesus: p3 is an extra 1000g
[1:13:53] Warkless: It is very hard to get ahold of dropinfos and % in english Susge
[1:13:56] Khealim: i locked myself out with 1384 doing p1 for gold, i thought phases are separate entry...
[1:13:56] Geeving: i'm not going 1400 right now either
[1:13:57] ldvemonl: 2.7k gold and 3mats for p3 so 11total
[1:13:59] nathrizen: it's definitely deminishing returns for argos3
[1:14:11] Vosy1984: 1385 is required for p3, not 1400
[1:14:13] Toorrimo: p3 has extra little for crafting items
[1:14:17] Flauschosaurius: oh. i am free again
[1:14:19] Flauschosaurius: guzuHappy
[1:14:21] Fronku: They will probably fuck up valtan like they did with Argos, don't trust AGS
[1:14:24] Draiv_: I understand saving mats for alts etc. but I don't understand gimbing your main out of content
[1:14:26] AustinNF: @Vosy1984 wrong lol
[1:14:32] Tamerlain: grinding more more
[1:14:34] Kenji_QQ: 1340 abyss is 900 i think
[1:14:41] resku89: the mats required to get to 1340 is worth so much more than the 1600 gold you get from Orehas Veil
[1:14:41] Warkless: it's 1385 for supports widePepeLaugh
[1:14:44] Khealim: people invite 1385 sups for p3

[1:16:00] SlyPoooper: still wrong LUL
[1:16:12] Tamerlain: if they hit 100k online they puish some charasters
[1:16:30] Asphoron: P2 is harder than P3. It is just the extra damage if you aren't 1400 that can be a problem
[1:16:40] SkinnaKid: huge for me cause lance was my intended main
[1:16:47] Zeikoa: i'm just coping they add some support tools to existing classes like arcana COPIUM
[1:16:52] Astrophysics288: i would like to be support, but am not doing the 1340 - 1370 grind again in awhile

[1:17:24] Draiv_: @astrophysics288 1340-1370 gets a lot easier once you get main to 1385 and get the stronghold honing upgrades
[1:17:27] RamseyRinehaus: Zeals destroyer today in Igrexion KEKW
[1:17:29] hotdove911: isn't support useless if you know how to dodge?

[1:34:48] Dagmoo: yeah we may not get it for a long time
[1:34:53] itzSimondr98: I mean.. would they really nerf classes that hard rather than buff the underperforming once? monkaHmm
[1:34:56] Dagmoo: hwo knows
[1:35:02] Kenji_QQ: might be a while yes, but if/when they get nerfed in kr people will already start looking to swap
[1:35:05] nathrizen: for NA/EU players it's just best if they dont nerf anything.  we need the xtra power
[1:35:06] celadriel23: so i saw a tip on reddit if youre gonna play lancemaster you can create a female martial artist and just sit them in trixion and you will apparently have 5 days of rested chaos dungeon rewards
[1:35:12] Face_32: do you think they want the JP balance patch done before they introduce more classes to NA/EU? @Giantwaffle
[1:36:01] Zeikoa: incredibly rested
[1:36:01] Moobot: You can sub to Waffle by clicking this neat link -> twitch.tv/giantwaffle/subscribe
[1:36:16] celadriel23: my lancemaster will be called Mancelaster
[1:36:25] sagle: With as slow as they're progressing us its prolly gonna be a few years before we could be on the same patch as kr
[1:36:36] celadriel23: yes its 5 extra dungeons worth of loot so 2.5 days
[1:36:48] nathrizen: does that take into account more chaos dungeon mats at each successive difficulty
[1:37:27] Zeikoa: time for training dummies
[1:37:39] Zeikoa: scarecrows*
[1:37:53] rezv: how many days for 1100 w/ 960 power pass?

[1:41:49] celadriel23: im terrible at hte game and its super useful as a zerker
[1:41:57] nathrizen: ^
[1:42:03] TelRehiad: even bards pick up heavy armor. its good
[1:42:05] Mandorake: @Giantwaffle i learned yesterday that my gunlancer alt gives immunity to foxy lady transform
[1:42:08] Vosy1984: why run heavy armour when I can just heal myself cohhEZ
[1:42:10] d1zzr: Nah I was just wondering I have surge and ambush master rn
[1:42:11] nathrizen: heavy armor3 + mayhem zerker == 96% damage reduction
[1:42:25] d1zzr: Trying to see what engravings I need lol
[1:42:37] celadriel23: im still using the damage reduction under 50% as well
[1:42:39] celadriel23: card sets
[1:42:44] SlyPoooper: Aceblizzardz tru
[1:43:07] d1zzr: For some reason my attack power is higher then willing

[1:48:20] iMelon: Moake is so easy if no one griefs
[1:48:24] nathrizen: 1302 -> 1340 takes quite a bit of mats for an alt.  havent worked the math but i feel like it takes 2 weeks to get positive returns
[1:48:27] Warkless: People say alts would make the burn out, but doing t3 without alts will make you burn out even faster
[1:48:32] dadish: Im so glad i quit the game :)

[2:36:23] tommyfod: wtf man
[2:36:24] Gotizie: That is what is happening in Calgary Alberta currently as well as the market is still nuts.. cash offers and no conditions
[2:36:26] k8thegrea8: all because there is no inventory
[2:36:31] Cryso12: can you show us your gear!
[2:36:31] officialhunterx: scam market
[2:36:33] Mandorake: @Nexhunter why do it if you have to though?
[2:36:35] tommyfod: get into the most debt in your life without making sure of it? insane
[2:36:35] MushuTushu: cause its good enough to be a rental property
[2:36:35] Chronoes: "the house is fine" source: trust me bro
[2:36:35] MemweatherDangle: This about the 30-year?
[2:36:36] OhWhale: some mortgage companies wont allow you to even go thru them if you dont get an inspection @Giantwaffle
[2:36:43] Dagmoo: i would NEVER buy a house without inspection you could cost yourself hundreds of thousands of dollars
[2:36:54] Scottyrockson: market is shit rn for a buyer
[2:36:56] MushuTushu: interest is not good anymore
[2:37:15] OhWhale: right now you just get a 30 year and pay it off early with extra payments
[2:37:16] Kardiiac: @Giantwaffle did you hear that theyre considering 40y loans now too
[2:37:17] Strider1515: Interest went back up and it roughly 5% which is bad
[2:37:17] Nexhunter: that is why there is high inflation
[2:37:24] MushuTushu: its 4+ now. my first time home was 3.0 in 2020
[2:37:29] Nexhunter: we kept the interest rate at nothing and pumped a fuck ton of credit into the economy KEKW
[2:37:30] Strider1515: I got a 30 year at 2.6%
[2:37:33] Gotizie: 3.44% In Calgary on 25 years or so
[2:37:34] MemweatherDangle: Ours is 2.75 with a 30 yr
[2:37:35] Dagmoo: its still low historically but not as low as covid
[2:37:41] celadriel23: isnt 1 extra payment a year save you like 3 years?
[2:37:43] basedgubbs: my interest rate is 2.4 on 30 yrs
[2:37:46] TelRehiad: paying extra principal is the way to go
[2:37:46] OhWhale: i sold many 2.5% in the beginning of covid
[2:37:50] OhWhale: @meilers yes
[2:37:51] Nexhunter: you either get interest rates at 0 with inflation or interest rates not at 0 and minor inflation KEKW
[2:37:53] ImScottLol: Moved into a condo that we payed less than asking for in march of 2020, current value has gone up 200K
[2:37:58] tommyfod: it's worth doing it as long as you wouldn't make more money by investing the extra basically
[2:38:04] Cannonboot: PROFIT?
[2:38:07] tommyfod: but investment has risks so
[2:38:25] OhWhale: i refi'd a 14 houses for a guy and he got all the mortgages under 3%
[2:38:27] Nexhunter: builder just wants to sell
[2:38:30] wonly: honestly the move is selling your place if you can profit and invest that and rent a place until the crash then buy again
[2:38:32] ImScottLol: Now you can't even talk unless you have 50k OVER asking price.
[2:38:36] mechoriet: they probbly always try to upsell

[2:39:32] Nexhunter: @OhWhale who the fuck has 14 houses rooBlank
[2:39:34] Kuhlnoggin: so as a note as opposed to inspections you can buy 1 year warranty that if anything breaks or  is found in the first year you can get it replaced
[2:39:44] wonly: @Nexhunter landlords
[2:39:49] Nexhunter: @wonly fuck them KEKW
