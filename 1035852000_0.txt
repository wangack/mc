[0:11:33] JDoobs: That's not true. Epic is literally paying for exclusivity in a lot of cases.

[0:12:50] Kaley4D: i know its unpopular but im on apples side of the apple vs epic thing
[0:12:53] RubberMullet: 12%
[0:12:58] RoninStorm: competition is good for the consumer

[0:36:21] MrPooter: you learn all this programming on the side? @Giantwaffle
[0:36:25] TastiHam: you don't need c++, you can do everything in blueprint
[0:36:31] Venom254: @Giantwaffle you gonna learn today.
[0:36:32] 13hunteo: if you learn c++ then you can use it for unity as well I think
[0:36:35] Ratscapula: just do Blueprints

[0:37:21] Tenkaichi500: ohh so unity is c#
[0:37:21] FrostedSentry: I'd consider myself an expert and I 100% lean into blueprints. There's a time and place for the complexity of C++.
[0:37:22] tackattack: man, fuck us

[0:37:54] strxcc: blueprint is literally adopted by big studios. Riot dev admitted all abilities in Valorant are blueprint and only movement is c++ :P
[0:38:01] PIZZA_OMC: working on a project for uni in C++ was a pain getting things fixed coz i literally couldn't find solutions
[0:38:05] Vovosunt: unity needs build in fucking networking solution cause their stuff is absolute garbage
[0:38:09] Tenkaichi500: programming always makes people feel a certain way

[0:40:41] 13hunteo: @Myekos yeah I would have been using some external editor, but he doesn't like to use them for whatever reason - I dont think he likes to have to copy paste
[0:41:03] Tenkaichi500: holy moly
[0:41:26] mittensthekillerbunny: Words of wisdom. If you can't look at your code and see how awful it is you're not growing. wafflePoint Though derp moments are so relieving afterwards though.

[1:03:24] Frozen_Shadow1: drawer upgrades aren't sequential and are stackable @Giantwaffle
[1:03:31] kypudo: waffle u can put the upgrades all off the same tier, it does not need to be sequencial
[1:03:35] MrDocth: on top maybe ?
[1:03:38] MrPooter: Its a twitch issue sometimes
[1:03:44] StOrMy1100: SchubertWalk
[1:03:57] Kaley4D: dude it sounds SO OFF
[1:03:58] daemonaedryn: !latency ?
[1:03:58] Moobot: If you find that Waffle's stream is glitching, lagging, or rubber-banding, try turning off "low latency" in the stream settings and/or switch the stream resolution off of Auto. This issue is on Twitch's end.
[1:03:58] CorSPACE: lock res

[1:04:19] 13hunteo: it does it to reduce the delay
[1:04:24] Dorwen: yes
[1:04:24] psyco_oe: Usually a refresh fixes it but it will slowly get out of sync again in my experience

[1:04:45] CoolReal: Has to be from the top
[1:04:59] podwe: low latency
[1:05:11] daemonaedryn: The cobblegen might work from directly ontop?
[1:05:11] 13hunteo: @xNew Player > General > Allow the player to speed up to reduce delay.

[1:19:48] Archelonde: ah yes THAT anime yeah it was quite the twist
[1:19:49] Chronoes: I mean it's not that hard to figure out, human story is 15 years ahead of spider story
[1:19:55] GenerlKat: pulp fiction
[1:19:58] absynth123: It's all about the "epiphany", they're trying to give the "ohhh" moment of instant understanding
[1:19:59] Hikyy: same with timeloops

[1:21:11] maimvice13: yes
[1:21:17] EvergreenMoth8: EvergreenMoth8 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 29 months, currently on a 27 month streak! doesnt feel like 2 years. but the facts are here for all to see
[1:21:26] Soul_Synergy: I think there are multiple manga derived from the light novel for it
[1:21:26] maimvice13: human timline is a side story in the novel
[1:21:28] Venxuri: chat has bullied waffle into may things some of them were good some bad
[1:21:34] Venxuri: many*
[1:21:36] strawwwwww: @leewickert Yeah, I will probably try to do that.

[1:22:01] aCookienot: it's not hard to figure out if you read the novel first xD
[1:22:03] Asphoron: The humans are far less exciting
[1:22:06] DharionDrahl: So what im a spider anime
[1:22:09] Soul_Synergy: Supposedly the studio butchered the human timeline compared to the light novel
[1:22:11] maimvice13: i am wondering how the will conect it properly
[1:22:18] RamseyRinehaus: we havent bullied him into predictions yet tho, FeelsBadMan
[1:22:31] Archelonde: human timeline is literally like a bonus chapter at the end in the light novel for the first 5 or 6 novels

[1:23:22] 13hunteo: wait why is there quartz in the over world?
[1:23:30] Asphoron: I love when they show when other people see her and she's just intimidating
[1:23:39] Chronoes: I mean, I would've dropped the animu if it weren't for the human storyline at the beginning. I hated the constant monologue and the "game" narrator. now, the spider story is also really interesting though
[1:23:44] skokpo: @Giantwaffle What do you think of Unreal 5 Early Access
[1:24:08] listikuss: Dungeon? ^^

[1:25:47] HolyLlamalord: depends where you go and what you get, but yea

[1:26:21] Chronoes: it sure sounds a lot to me
[1:26:22] boatnutsAL: i avg 70 a week or so
[1:26:24] Kohta_Sama: I think 100 is a lot, but I live like a poor student so
[1:26:29] SymbolicLegend: a@mandorake 100 a week isn't alot ? lol
[1:26:29] littlebumperoo: Depends if you live alone or not
[1:26:29] Mandorake: if you're eating out its like 10-15 a meal.  Easily hit 200+ a week
[1:26:36] 13hunteo: our household of 4 spends 120 a week
[1:26:39] RamseyRinehaus: that's ~$15/day for food, not too bad
[1:26:41] FrostedSentry: I'm around 150-200 for 2, not including alcohol (17 days drink free!!)
[1:27:00] FloodRacer: That's a lot of Taco Bell
[1:27:05] The_Bantjes: sorry im not from the us so how many liters are in a case ofe beer?
[1:27:12] Ender410: Me, wife and kid, if we shop every two weeks it can be like 150-200, if we do a big month worth of shopping, much more
[1:27:21] Kohta_Sama: I only eat once per day yeah
[1:27:21] Moobot: Support Waffle by using his Epic creator code: Giantwaffle

[1:27:54] Linkitch: That sounds unhealthy rooThink
[1:27:56] Mandorake: a lot of streamers seem to do OMAD
[1:27:57] complexprotein: I feel like if you just eat shit it can be super cheap. If you buy high quality healthy food it is pricey.
[1:27:58] Stevadeli: just don't eat 5Head
[1:28:14] fafuja: 5Head
[1:28:16] Kohta_Sama: 5Head no eating = become rich
[1:28:19] Deepcast: meal prep
[1:28:20] Allmostdone: 10 for lunch? What are you eating, crap?
[1:28:24] Mandorake: @complexprotein especially if you're trying to cut out things like sugar and carbs.  Protein and veggies are expensive compared to just junk.
[1:28:30] daemonaedryn: So youre essentially permnanently doing intermittent fasting?
[1:28:41] Rydoes: You aren't all that physically active during the day either @Giantwaffle
[1:28:48] Mandorake: its called OMAD: One Meal a Day
[1:28:53] RamseyRinehaus: which is why you need to do kind bars at the 4-5 hour mark of your stream, btw
[1:28:54] Kohta_Sama: it's not fasting if you're not hungry Kappa
[1:29:01] Linkitch: Why aren't you using the magnet, to pull items in?

[1:29:26] BONBONNIE13: No wonder I never need to eat. I never use my brain. 5Head
[1:29:29] n8level: and you get a snack most days anyway
[1:29:31] K3ll06s: its the "most" but you burn only 1.4k ish if you dont move as a male

[1:30:12] Kohta_Sama: invalid peepoBlonket
[1:30:28] IOIBURGERIOI: 150
[1:30:31] Mandorake: what if you walk a mile while doing mathematical calculations
[1:30:37] Bleu_Forge: I thought the brain only used something like 20 or 25% of your calories per day
[1:30:41] IOIBURGERIOI: a donut is like 350

[1:31:01] Brucey_Bit: That makes sense bc as an engineering student I’m always hungry but when I was in high school playing 2-3 sports I didn’t eat as much and performed well
[1:31:06] Mandorake: @Giantwaffle I've actually seen a study that showed walking with a partner to converse with has extra benefits over just a regular walk
[1:31:07] MrAppl3: jup google says brain uses 20%
[1:31:07] shengdeluo: literally feeding the brain lol

[1:32:13] Slymph: susHmm
[1:32:27] Myekos: you only use about 1/3 of your actual strength in doing any activity because your tendons and attach points have lower damage limits and don't repair as fast as muscle
[1:32:29] Ghulmeister: my brain uses only around 1%

[1:33:08] pickle_padthai: Hank is right, waffle not right
[1:33:21] Myekos: so, when going all out on physical activity you go from 8% resting to 30% full

[1:36:31] Myekos: are you saying you burned more calories in that endeavor? :)
[1:36:34] Tabakhase: your liver uses 25% - so more than the brain LUL @Giantwaffle
[1:36:39] Biskit427: My little bro gave me his old gaming pc and I’m looking for a headset to get.

[1:43:47] Mongo_Smash: I've been playing the single player EFT.  Umm...  I've been enjoying it. lirikSIP
[1:43:54] Jep5dk: nest big pach is around scaves and no one play scaves late wipe (carma system)
[1:43:54] TarMonA: why season/leagues  are so loved
[1:43:59] Hunter1701: I heard Ets and Ats are getting offical multiplayer
[1:44:00] ThatOnneGuy: My theory is because they don't feel like dealin with the servers getting fucked just like every wipe
[1:44:03] Setinal44: if i have to kill scavs on shorline with untar gear for the like 9th time im gonna do something bad
[1:44:13] Ghost0447: we are getting lighthouse first streets next year i think
[1:44:20] ThatOnneGuy: It's a good cash grab for them to do a wipe but it's probably a headache too
[1:44:33] N4RCO5: More games could benefit from a regular economy wipe, like in PoE
[1:44:38] Venxuri: I love starting over in EFT, but I rush Kappa and quit
[1:44:39] daemonaedryn: There was a video I watched about this lately, want the link?
[1:44:40] Ghost0447: then think like end of summer wipe i think
[1:44:57] x_Crawley: They should work toward making a game state where they don't have to do a wipe and the economy doesn't get fucked up.
[1:45:11] MadBadHare: Anyone look into single player Tarkov? - I know it is not official nor sanctioned but it does solve the wipe issue
[1:45:16] botmaniac: just grab a KS23 and engage ratJAM
[1:45:20] daemonaedryn: It is still a lot of fun btw, Ive met a few chads but definately not the majority
[1:45:21] Venxuri: oh, even with that much money people still have gearfear and run crap kits
[1:45:27] kefyrasFTW: Just do pistol runs
[1:45:34] pickle_padthai: there is no better feeling in tarkov than being a low level player and taking down a heavy Chad with an akm
[1:45:38] Setinal44: MadBadHare it works, but it gets stale. The pmc ai are even worse than the scav ai
[1:45:48] miracore: that jetpack sample sounds like it came from that motherload mine miniclip game
[1:45:51] TarMonA: or a mining laser

[1:46:45] MadBadHare: @Setinal44 I had seen several MODS that address that as well - Just curious it is stable - Seem like a good option for hardcore style runs I am thinking
[1:46:50] Setinal44: MrMoneybagMan yea but harder doesnt mean more fun. You just get shot through bushes and aimbotted
[1:47:13] Setinal44: MadBadHare its certainly stable, just make sure to install it on like a different hard drive and dont run it at all with tarkoc running
[1:47:32] Setinal44: like you said its not approved so we dont know what the ramifications of BSG finding it on your pc lol

[1:49:00] Venxuri: so maybe
[1:49:02] listikuss: @Giantwaffle What do you think about IQ tests?
[1:49:34] mrtraxx: Sorry i meant, Is Omnifactory a good pack coming off of Project Ozone.
[1:49:37] Allmostdone: IQ are a hoax

[1:51:02] JustGlennBE: I mean.. The same with school degrees.. Some stupid people are just good in learning things but not knowing what its about and smart people know what it is but just cant learn every single word.
[1:51:06] MadBadHare: @Setinal44 Yeah I saw - Copy folder, extract over - start server, start client and away you go ;)
[1:51:08] Monkey121212: measuring like EQ, IQ, Logic and communication skills

[1:52:56] Andee2: My Uni still used E
[1:53:02] Kohta_Sama: tl;dr somebody accidentally wrote an F instead of an E
[1:53:05] Yirith: we use 1-5 where 5 is the best
[1:53:07] Kohta_Sama: because handwriting bad I guess
[1:53:08] maimvice13: we use numbers to 100
[1:53:09] The1_TS: F for fail?

[1:54:00] Allmostdone: There’s a fallacy. The education board has nothing to do with education
[1:54:00] richie385: i cant spell today but ignore the first one
[1:54:01] Helo_KiX: growing up we had letter grades but it wasn't  a 10 point scale, it was a 7 ish scale 93-100 was an A
[1:54:03] RussianRainbowTV: I'd trust onion posts before I ever trust reddit KEKW
[1:54:04] ParAd0xA: Waffle use assembly Machine for your condouit
[1:54:07] spiwn: you could turn an F into an E. Very easy to modify your marks.
[1:54:18] Therealdeacon: In Denmark we have a 7-point grading system: -3, 00, 02, 4, 7, 10 and 12, with 12 being the best
[1:54:23] Helo_KiX: but it wasn't 7 points for every letter,  was so confusing

[1:55:29] mgaSA: lol
[1:55:30] Widdie: pepeJAM
[1:55:30] CowFall: That's a very ethnocentric view, and I support that : - )
[1:55:30] bee_mow: America has crazy influence on other nations.

[1:55:34] mgaSA: syria, china
[1:55:34] Morionware: Not entirely isolated, policies affect other places
[1:55:38] Chronoes: America's problems are extremely visible thanks to the load of information available
[1:55:39] Mr_Perril: Nah, we got rid of the US, the rest of the world would be ol KappaRoss
[1:55:41] crispybacon2009: its easier to point out the log in someone elses eye as opposed to the stick in your
[1:55:50] Frozenjaws: Reddit isnt American lol

[1:56:00] tinspin: The US is very close to another civil war, all the stars are aligned for shit to really fall apart!
[1:56:05] aundros: You are missing one thing waffle. America has been the cultural center of most of the western world for years. So many of americas problems are very visible to others
[1:56:13] sogerr: reddit is just an advertisment site for onlyfan girls, why bother looking at other subs?
[1:56:14] Yemtron: @tinspin lol no

[1:57:13] usernameNull: "depends on what I'm looking at" we all know porn is better on old.reddit
[1:57:13] bee_mow: @tinspin Check your sources.
[1:57:16] MrDocth: ME conduit are cheaper i think
[1:57:19] panic_inducing_citrus: what is the advantage of using this void world vs regular?

[1:57:49] Allmostdone: Well rinse off
[1:57:52] SpookyClips: In Northern Norway our biggest problem is USA because they abuse their NATO partnership by having more and more presence here. There has been peace between us and Russia until USA started caring so much about being here.
[1:57:54] mahoraz: america is your the oldest cousin who bullies people that arent his friends and boasts about it to everyone he hangs around with LUL
[1:57:59] tinspin: I lived in NY for 6 months in 2001, the shit I saw was really really bad allready back then.

[1:58:21] Ebonmourn: can't the yeta wrench or w/e allow you to open up the interface without seeing a side?
[1:58:35] bee_mow: @Yemtron Don't feed the troll. This guy doesn't know what he's talking about.
[1:58:46] Yemtron: lol
[1:58:48] Yemtron: obviously
[1:59:08] Yemtron: I would love for him to actually go to a war torn country. He would gladly change his mind
[1:59:10] SmokyMtnRed: Slippery only because people get hurt feelings when another person has a totally different opinion. That the main issue in society, IMHO... why worry about another person's opinion.
[1:59:22] bee_mow: @Yemtron Seriously.
[1:59:23] madseed15: why dont u just swap the drawers

[2:00:04] Ender410: No, we have too many people not able to understand that an opinion doesn't mean anything
[2:00:05] AmoArman: yeah, people get offended on others behalf lmao
[2:00:11] Yemtron: It's good to know your opinion, not necessarily to share it lol
[2:00:15] TarMonA: everyone want to be heard and no one wants to listen
[2:00:24] panic_inducing_citrus: @TarMonA ^^
[2:00:34] Grumbagz: its too easy to share opinions now, having an opinion is fine LUL
[2:00:42] Allmostdone: We have streets made of gold. but people starving

[2:01:07] chilli_dog_69: whatever happened to bavon donut is he okay?
[2:01:07] UltraScientism: well, all the people on Twitter are not as conscious about keeping their damaging opinions to themselves KEKW
[2:01:15] Chronoes: a lot of people tend to pose their opinions as facts on a sample size of 1 too, it's just so much information noise
[2:01:17] zero3juan: your opinion helps you find others with the same ones, to form your own echo chamber
[2:01:19] Andee2: Also depends on one's influence and audience
[2:01:27] SmokyMtnRed: I believe what I believe and do not force my beliefs/opinions on anyone else, and if I dislike another person's opinion, I do not make it an issue.
[2:01:30] Ebonmourn: on the conduit
[2:01:33] K3ll06s: If you have an opionon because you feel like it and cant explain why, its invalid to me
[2:01:43] Jimbobs8: conduit prob?
[2:01:44] Brucey_Bit: Yeah, what happened to Bacon Donut?? 🥓

[2:01:51] pengeg: gm waffle n chat waffleHey
[2:01:56] Bolt_Vanderhuge_: @brucebit12 he retired
[2:01:58] JadedOnyx19: ya its hard to take some peoples opinion because you have no idea what level of understanding they have of the subject. Life = hard
[2:02:02] Vovosunt: Alt + f4 on the conduit Kappa
[2:02:05] Brucey_Bit: Haa okay

[2:03:19] Allmostdone: but all my opinions are unfounded
[2:03:32] Yemtron: Here is my opinion. Waffle is a nice guy with a beard who likes playing with blocks. :)
[2:03:39] spiwn: you could have used the yeta wrench to configure the conduits
[2:03:58] panic_inducing_citrus: @Allmostdone that is probably a good thing, that means you don't have a lot of "strong" opinions
[2:04:10] madseed15: @Giantwaffle there is a mode i think
[2:04:11] Linkitch: Did you try Shift Left Clicking a conduit?
[2:04:15] Allmostdone: @Yemtron that's a lie! He's a really nice guy!

[2:22:27] boceknecmi: GOOOOOOOOD BAYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
[2:22:43] Infinin: He said it was basically easier to stop streaming and retire than to try and explain what happened between him and tpup and the  accusations she brought up
[2:22:47] Bman4228: @boceknecmi Good Bay?
[2:22:48] Winner5001: LUL a floating tree

[2:25:48] Allmostdone: @DapHammer Yo
[2:25:51] SmokyMtnRed: This go-around, I will make different ME Interface setups to categorize the crafting patterns better. One lump-sum made it hard to find one when needed
[2:25:54] BaTu016: this base is gettin juicy
[2:26:04] Soultiger777: what about doing gymnastics ?
[2:26:05] JadedOnyx19: people that ask about Bacon and stuff have to be trying to get a reaction. Bacon says hes retired right on his Twitter

[2:27:54] Yemtron: @Allmostdone It plays "Down with the sickeness" when it's ready
[2:27:57] grtcdnstoner: whistle or shut off at a certain temp
[2:27:59] Yemtron: sicknesS*

[2:29:11] madseed15: KEKW
[2:29:35] madseed15: wasnt ur kettle hella expensive
[2:29:41] Bolt_Vanderhuge_: could always put the kettle on your desk
[2:29:49] SmokyMtnRed: That is like saying you do not need a Bluetooth smoker
[2:30:11] Soultiger777: 40 secs? thats kinda bit long
[2:30:11] madseed15: takes 1 hour for u to remember u have it on
[2:30:21] SmokyMtnRed: LUL
[2:30:27] SmokyMtnRed: Agree
[2:30:34] WhomstAmYous: how long does it take to get to ore automation

[2:32:40] Moobot: Support Waffle by using his Epic creator code: Giantwaffle
[2:32:47] DigitallyAdmiringHumanity: does minecraft music put anyone else to sleep or is It just me?

[2:35:49] PepzzOG: ItzJord i did few times already
[2:35:53] Yemtron: how about when a portion of molten cheese and sauce pulls off and hits your lip
[2:35:54] SmokyMtnRed: Yeah, I typ tell myself I will wait till it cools, but never do
[2:36:03] ItzJord: weird
[2:36:12] the_one_wasabi: And then when you burn your tongue and you can't taste anything on the burned spot for a few days FeelsBadMan
[2:36:18] daemonaedryn: If it has sauce in the crust its actually fucking boiling
[2:36:19] ItzJord: might be your Internet @pepzzog
[2:36:28] listikuss: because you are greedy! ^^
[2:36:28] RussianRainbowTV: you ever swallow something so hot you feel it run down your spine? that shit sucks KEKW

[2:38:04] listikuss: imagin how the death star was build this way! ^^ haha
[2:38:17] TarMonA: time to upgrade it KEKW
[2:38:20] madseed15: this is why make a cable layer

[2:40:16] Allmostdone: look up the orgins of swear words
[2:40:46] Yemtron: When crpto drops, go to town :)

[2:41:32] SpookyClips: KomodoHype
[2:41:32] Wozatron256: Waffle have you seen biomuntant?
[2:41:34] MrMoneybagMan: Powerwash sim?
[2:41:44] Chronoes: Starbase
[2:41:46] Allmostdone: God. I hate markdown. I don't understand the reason for it to exist
[2:41:48] daemonaedryn: Hell yeah Pog of Thieves PogChamp
[2:41:52] djsplat: thieves
[2:41:57] tonigmaa: Farming Simulator ?
[2:42:03] Tahj____: I'm ready
[2:42:06] daemonaedryn: Dark souls? I remember you started dark souls 3
[2:42:06] Bleu_Forge: PauseChamp
[2:42:19] QuesoBad0nga: Minecraft 1.17 Vanilla
[2:42:21] DaGMC: @Allmostdone if you tried the other stuff markdown is much better/easier
[2:42:22] madseed15: June 11 for mario golf
[2:42:22] Webvidaddict: AoE?
[2:42:26] Tahj____: Starbase won't have as many features on EA launch but it's definitely worth checking out for me
[2:42:27] ParttimeOnion: June 25th for Mario Golf iirc
[2:42:29] SmokyMtnRed: I hope Starbase delivers
[2:42:30] SpookyClips: jackbox games?
[2:42:32] MrMoneybagMan: Power wash sim?? @Giantwaffle
[2:42:32] daemonaedryn: Valheim if it has a big update?
[2:42:37] madseed15: sorry that was the 1999 version @Giantwaffle
[2:42:56] Wozatron256: golf is the 25th
[2:42:59] ParttimeOnion: 1999 version came out 06/11, the switch version comes out 06/25
[2:42:59] Tahj____: They have a roadmap you can look at for Starbase @Giantwaffle
[2:43:00] daemonaedryn: Rains playing PowerWash sim rn
[2:43:00] madseed15: @Giantwaffle June 25 for mario golf
[2:43:04] MrToastedBanana: Whats the name of that program chat?
[2:43:05] Alittlewhale: 25th
[2:43:18] ericnivek: Hit up flight sim for a bit again?
[2:43:19] Barney__: @MrToastedBanana sublimetext
[2:43:20] daemonaedryn: @MrToastedBanana Sublime
[2:43:21] Allmostdone: what other stuff? Other than oh.. maybe text?
[2:43:26] nichaim: @MrToastedBanana The text editor? Sublime Text
[2:43:26] MrToastedBanana: Thanks
[2:43:38] strxcc: Starbase still online only mode? Singleplayer would be so nice to have just for no network worries
[2:44:03] DaGMC: @Allmostdone Textile, XXXWiki or RST
[2:44:16] KABBL: Starlink launch in 1h!
[2:44:20] dazray: will you play the new f1 game when it comes out
[2:44:25] The_Holas: i mean its in Playable Alpha
[2:44:28] fanta_x_thomas: I smell pay to win
[2:44:41] Chronoes: I'm quite pessimistic but still somewhat hyped
[2:44:44] strxcc: I just hate online only games because you're buying something knowing it won't last, especially if it turns out shit. Singleplayer lasts forever
[2:44:45] Soultiger777: Yet
[2:45:14] DaGMC: @Allmostdone but you have point text based formats like markdown or something else is much better than .doc or .pdfs
[2:45:27] madseed15: @Giantwaffle go look for the last incriber press
[2:45:31] Tahj____: SPog Engineers
[2:45:33] alotron_: @Apollia It is still heavily under development and the release in June will be just an alpha. There is still hope for some kind of singleplayer / creative mode.
[2:45:53] lange__: What game?
[2:45:55] Tahj____: I once mined for 10 hours straight in space engineers
[2:45:55] Wild_Pachi: just watched the trailer, looks kinda cool
[2:45:56] Yemtron: incoming 10 fps :)
[2:46:00] Rob_Kebab: Like space rust
[2:46:07] daemonaedryn: I'll probably see how it is on the first day then decide if Im going to buy it
[2:46:12] strxcc: @alotron_ Hope so, love the advanced build mechanics for it but could die if network issues persist. Would be a fantasy single player game
[2:46:14] count3rnova: coding a full station to build a ship will be amazing
[2:46:16] JDoobs: I wonder how feature complete it will be.
[2:46:17] SmokyMtnRed: What about Dual Universe. It failed IMO, well as of now  and Starbase reminds me of it
[2:46:39] Rob_Kebab: WAS awesome
[2:47:06] Tahj____: Yeah Starbase is VERY ambitious with their building system
[2:47:16] Ghostnine: on the micro level
[2:47:21] Wishtap: We talking about Roblox's metaverse?
[2:47:37] Tabakhase: gonna be a flightsim-like download when joining a server KEKW
[2:47:39] Chronoes: I just hope it won't suffer the Atlas effect
[2:47:39] daemonaedryn: Optimistic but cautious
[2:47:42] London_Monarch: have you played Occupy Mars
[2:47:43] count3rnova: take atlas as an idea cluster servers garbage at launch but run smootheish now
[2:47:44] fisering1: Insane scale in that game, both big and small
[2:47:50] Crazyfox55: You probably cant work on the design of your ship when your flying around. That way they can optimize your ship
[2:47:57] Naappletree: yo that base is clean!
[2:48:15] Tahj____: I expect nothing, Starbase is probbaly gonna run like shit and not be as cool as it seems, but I'm ok with it
[2:48:17] count3rnova: pre desined ships yea but the bases are random
[2:48:23] Rob_Kebab: Especially with the massive size of the intricate star bases too
[2:48:27] Crazyfox55: The hull was predefined but not the walls/doors on the ship
[2:48:33] Ghostnine: 100% people will make veiny cocks to fly around space
[2:48:37] GenerlKat: are you going to be printing?
[2:48:43] Wishtap: not sure if you've played the AC games, but do you think an online Assassins Creed game could work? Seeing how Ubisoft is going for the freemium model instead of releasing AAA every year
[2:48:48] GenerlKat: where is starship print at?
[2:48:48] Moobot: You can find Waffle's Youtube channel here - https://youtube.com/giantwaffle
[2:49:03] alotron_: @Apollia Definitely. The building mechanics are also the main selling point for me. And yolol a bit as well. It could be an interesting project to build your own satellites to get some sort of navigation system running.
[2:49:09] Allmostdone: @DaGMC So text just isn't good enough. I looked those up and still it seems that simple text is better
[2:49:17] dystav: Will the base be open with railings or closed with walls and a roof?
[2:49:18] zynithtv: idk why my stream is so laggy. just did a speed test and im getting like 700mb/s down and 300mb/s up
[2:49:18] daemonaedryn: Same, I have so much shit to do for college and cant get any of it done
[2:49:27] GenerlKat: yea I get that
[2:49:41] Myekos: do it while you can, you can chill out and rest when you're 75
[2:49:43] Ghostnine: gogogo
[2:49:45] Timer_lol: hello waffle did you ever hold onto your bbw stonk it's now worth 12$
[2:49:48] SmokyMtnRed: Sometimes adulting sucks LUL
[2:49:53] Wishtap: Where's the garyvee hustle waffle
[2:50:05] DapHammer: nothing wrong with taking a step back
[2:50:12] CheesusTheCrust: you have to have a daily basis of chill
[2:50:16] Rob_Kebab: Phase
[2:50:36] Rob_Kebab: It’s not a phase mom
[2:50:37] Ghostnine: over functioning. you should make sure to take time for your brain health
[2:50:41] HailTheDemocracy: why the fuck is bbw at 12$
[2:50:49] Yemtron: go build a bear go!
[2:50:57] Wishtap: Do you stream full time, or is this a part-time hobby?
[2:51:11] SmokyMtnRed: I feel a person needs mental breaks like that
[2:51:24] Wishtap: Do you prefer streaming or making videos more?
[2:51:35] Linkitch: People always feel the need to do something. I don't like listen to music while walking my dog or biking. Much prefer the natural noise and just let my mind wander
[2:51:39] panic_inducing_citrus: Do streamers have something like a 401k?
[2:51:40] Mapleton: monkaGun
[2:51:57] So_Stormy: ive been watching waffle for 6 years POG
[2:52:05] DaGMC: @Allmostdone  text only lacks formatting & structuring, and the alternatives like markdown are a small tradeoff to achieve that w/o using a binary format.
[2:52:05] HostileLogOut: !followage
[2:52:05] Moobot: To get how long you have followed, just click your name in chat on PC.
[2:52:09] n8level: Even Richard Feynman took it easy - drank OJ and played bongos. Claude Shannon rode a unicycle and juggled -- gotta have balance, burn out is no bueno.
[2:52:09] HostileLogOut: dangit :D
[2:52:12] HailTheDemocracy: your ETH will match it 5head
[2:52:17] BaTu016: how can i see how long iv been followin waffle KEKW
[2:52:21] Biskit427: My employer matches up to 5%
[2:52:22] Tabakhase: "matching" is still your money - just not taxed extra i think
[2:52:27] Phyyl: @Giantwaffle what's your ideal factory style game (actual game or just idea)
[2:52:30] Yemtron: drinking orange juice as a hobby KEKW
[2:52:31] Dagmoo: i mean the matching is only a small portion of it
[2:52:37] Beautyfades: @Tabakhase no its the company adding to it
[2:52:37] Chronoes: @BaTu016 click your name

[2:53:07] count3rnova: world simulator
[2:53:10] Yemtron: jk
[2:53:11] Yemtron: lol
[2:53:12] panic_inducing_citrus: The matching becomes significant in the long run
[2:53:13] Phyyl: @Yemtron  hahaha
[2:53:13] Myekos: auto factory sim
[2:53:13] MrMoneybagMan: just go outside
[2:53:15] Tabakhase: @Beautyfades thats what im sayn - its money the company could just give you - but by them doing it directly you dont have to pay tax on it
[2:53:18] Th3Harbinger: that would be legit
[2:53:21] HailTheDemocracy: aren't like 90% of those sims made in germany
[2:53:23] HailTheDemocracy: feels like it
[2:53:23] Allmostdone: @DaGMC That why we send it to the editing/documentation group. They can pretty it up all they want.
[2:53:26] onkelkonkel: waffleSip
[2:53:29] TripleCakes: So kinda like GTA
[2:53:30] DatoPotatoDato: that sounds really ambitious to make tbh
[2:53:31] The_Holas: too slow progression ...
[2:53:35] Yemtron: I would play the goat sim part
[2:53:35] lazycdog: that'd be huge.
[2:53:51] listikuss: "life simulator"
[2:53:52] Blazedude99: @Tabakhase aren't 401k's taxed as you take out of them not put in?
[2:53:52] Soultiger777: farming sim + truck sim
[2:53:55] Phyyl: yep that's a great idea
[2:54:11] LinearLayer: How about we just have human controlled robots that do that in the real world? Like a pick up plastic rc boat sim? waffleHmm
[2:54:15] count3rnova: ye and watch as the world sim devolves into war farmers fighting eachother stealing crops lmao
[2:54:23] noxiiiouse: we need more pc power look at flight simulator @Giantwaffle
[2:54:34] Tabakhase: @Blazedude99 as an EU i dont know those depths PepoThink - talking of income tax tho
[2:54:37] Soultiger777: Train sim Pog
[2:54:39] The_Holas: so you are saying if you want to farm just farm is easiesr then this game KEKW
[2:54:44] Phyyl: and sims style people actually buying and using resources haha
[2:54:51] ericnivek: @Giantwaffle do you think there might be a site like FSEconomy that could bring it all together?
[2:54:52] Biskit427: UPS The Game 😆
[2:54:57] Beautyfades: @Tabakhase Yup neither do
[2:54:59] count3rnova: like eve but on world not in space
[2:55:02] Yemtron: Honestly, they should just be combined with some big API on a website
[2:55:02] Soultiger777: it would
[2:55:03] TripleCakes: But who buys it in the end ?
[2:55:08] paulpkpk: logistic sim Pog
[2:55:11] lange__: I'll just say glhf making it
[2:55:13] London_Monarch: have to build your own house
[2:55:20] DaGMC: @Allmostdone if you have such a big teams thats nice. In the small company I work we're responsible for everything, welcome to dev(sec)ops ...
[2:55:34] Wishtap: Thoughts on Hytale? It seems ambitious
[2:55:46] daemonaedryn: Or bad servers
[2:55:53] So_Stormy: make mods for all of those games and link the mods together :\
[2:55:58] BaTu016: pepeLaugh
[2:56:17] Soultiger777: thats every game now in days KEKW
[2:56:18] Biskit427: So you would pick what job you wanted to do? Like be a trucker and people in boats bring the cargo to you?
[2:56:18] K3ll06s: AOC is at least 2 years or more away, just got into alpha and its cool but yeah, its a real alpha
[2:56:22] count3rnova: its hard to moneytize mmos atm without microtransactions
[2:56:23] Allmostdone: @DaGMC it was only a 250 IT team just siloed
[2:56:46] ZyianDev: The Alpha was okay, lots of promise, still HEAVY dev time still needed
[2:56:59] DapHammer: true
[2:56:59] Moobot: Come join the Waffle House discord https://discord.gg/G5FeeveP3c and chat with the community! Remember to link your Twitch account in the Settings (gear) > Connections for subscriber channels.
[2:57:02] jay7tx: nah i prefer one off to subscription KEKW
[2:57:06] HostileLogOut: Looking at New World. its going downhil real fast.
[2:57:12] Allmostdone: people want everything FREE!!!
[2:57:13] DaGMC: @Allmostdone the company I work for doesn't have 30 employees total ;-)
[2:57:14] Linkitch: Problem is getting enough people interested, with a subscription
[2:57:18] JDoobs: Subscription model is pretty outdated.
[2:57:27] lange__: Why not both? :))
[2:57:31] ericnivek: or do both like blizzard
[2:57:34] Chronoes: both 5Head
[2:57:37] jay7tx: yeah exactly, i think sub $10 then microtransactions
[2:57:42] count3rnova: one good thing about ashes of creation atm is that it has no shareholders pushing agendas
[2:57:43] paulpkpk: why not both? 5Head
[2:57:50] imeasytokill: i think poe has a good model
[2:57:51] Allmostdone: @DaGMC oh. ok and I thought 200 was small
[2:57:51] QwyIl: #poe
[2:57:55] BaTu016: just like bdo
[2:57:56] DaChibi: For real world simulator... it wouldn't be that difficult. The primary thing is to figure out what get sync'd between all the clients.
[2:57:57] tommyfod: or do both like wow
[2:58:11] Soultiger777: Waffle secretly has a job with EA KEKW
[2:58:14] Chronoes: buy the game at full price, subscription to continue paying and microtransactions for cosmetics and QoL
[2:58:20] The_Holas: i love how you always start kicking PoE when we talk about microtransactions KEKW
[2:58:25] jay7tx: Agree with literally everything except subscriptions, shitty games aren't worth subscribing too
[2:58:27] K3ll06s: AoC will also double dip with subs and cosmetics
[2:58:36] tinspin: microtransactions create bureaucratic garbage! subscriptions is easily the best model... I'm aiming for $10/year for my action MMO!
[2:58:53] HostileLogOut: Poe is the best example of a really well Done cash shop. No p2w, no way to sell items, no way to earn exp faster etc
[2:58:55] Soultiger777: same
[2:59:03] DaChibi: Ideally it would be something simple like "cargo type, cargo cost, cargo amount, and cargo weight."
[2:59:08] Bolt_Vanderhuge_: FFXIV does sub and cosmetics too. works for them
[2:59:11] Allmostdone: but how can you get the mob into that whole system?
[2:59:25] K3ll06s: I spent 500 bucks + tax on aoc, because its the last hope for a western mmo for me in the next 10years :/
[2:59:29] quazaka: I like to support the developers of games i enjoy. I know the amount of work that goes into it.
[2:59:40] ZyianDev: Labor Potions LUL
[2:59:40] Linkitch: Cosmetics are stupid expensive in some games though. They always target the whales
[2:59:42] jay7tx: miss the old model with one off payment then DLC payments, subscriptions are annoying as hell
[2:59:55] ZyianDev: Good game, terrible model
[3:00:03] count3rnova: well community ruined the game LUL
[3:00:08] Larklen: Awaken Online when widepeepoSad
[3:00:10] ZyianDev: I loved the navel gameplay in ArcheAge
[3:00:16] IronErro: I think the problem with paid cosmetics is a lot of them are a good bit more than 5 bucks. most times youre paying 10+ for a single cosmetic if you're buying it directly
[3:00:37] jay7tx: ahh thanks for explaining
[3:00:39] HostileLogOut: the best model has always been paid sub lol. look at world of warcraft. still the most played mmo to exist.
[3:00:42] slyjedi: oh wait what happened to zombnies? did they add stupide micro tranactions?
[3:00:47] Soultiger777: Skyrim
[3:00:57] QwyIl: There needs to be some continous form of payment for continued developement and server costs
[3:01:00] Larklen: Too much YEP
[3:01:02] Naboorunab: a lot
[3:01:05] Dagmoo: but you cant support a game forever with buy to play and players expect a large number of years of support
[3:01:05] dennixfailalot: zero
[3:01:06] Webvidaddict: 0
[3:01:07] MeZorZ: $25000

[3:01:16] undecizive: over 6k euro easy
[3:01:17] Allmostdone: 0
[3:01:17] K4shira: 0$
[3:01:19] zynithtv: enough to go to college for a year KEKW
[3:01:20] SmokyMtnRed: Maybe start a website/community that tracks crops (when sold), deliveries (when delivered), etc... To create that type of economy/world, but easier said and done I guess. LUL
[3:01:21] APieceOfFruit24: Probably like 100
[3:01:25] Deadfox74: Maybe $50-$100
[3:01:27] jay7tx: probably 500 - 1000 over like 10 years KEKW
[3:01:27] dystav: Maybe 1k for me, maybe up to 2k even
[3:01:27] listikuss: 500€
[3:01:29] Ender410: less than $10 for sure. I am very stingy with microtransactions.
[3:01:32] panic_inducing_citrus: Not micros, but games on sale on steam I'll never play
[3:01:36] Wozatron256: I have 1.5k just in leauge of legends so
[3:01:40] Ricz1337: maybe 5k over 20 yeahrs
[3:01:41] listikuss: but even more for hardware.
[3:01:42] Yemtron: calebGLOD calebGLOD calebGLOD
[3:01:44] HostileLogOut: Black desert online

[3:01:50] natsu130: i have only 711 games on steam BibleThump
[3:01:50] yoVespart: Ooooo way too many
[3:01:56] Chronoes: I have not spent money on games barely play
[3:01:59] Soultiger777: i spent over $1k on a freegame FeelsBadMan
[3:02:01] Ghostnine: took me 2 weeks on black desert an I spent 60$ on storage
[3:02:07] zynithtv: i really wish i had all the money i spent on weed and LoL now cause im broke KEKW
[3:02:08] funnyc4t: Playing wow for 15 years, it's insane how much money I've spend on that total
[3:02:09] jay7tx: call of duty maps, overwatch skins, poe mtx, i can't even remember some other shit
[3:02:13] Ricz1337: Ricz1337 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 3 months! yooo
[3:02:14] DDelve: If you like it, you pay for it. Best model ever.
[3:02:17] imeasytokill: got some star citizen players in here? Kappa
[3:02:25] Jedidude77: Only pokemon go
[3:02:26] Daanaas: yea
[3:02:28] dystav: I have mostly spent it on a game which I've played ~10 years, so I'm fine with that
[3:02:30] paulpkpk: the whales
[3:02:35] Tahj____: See I spent hundreds on PoE and it was worth it for the time spent. Not sure I'd have spent that much as an upfront cost though.
[3:02:39] Syzygy50: I like buying mtx to support devs. Sucks when whales are spending literally x1000’s what you are. Normal player is no longer the target audience.
[3:02:44] PERsepollis: حشقفخ قعمث
[3:02:46] Yemtron: yeah chat, you stink ;)
[3:02:51] PERsepollis: parto  rule
[3:02:57] Linkitch: Cosmetics prices seem to be priced after Whales
[3:03:00] Yemtron: @PERsepollis monkaS
[3:03:04] lightandfire88: free online games are usually the ones in which you spent a ton for microtransactions
[3:03:20] Yemtron: @Jorjica Yeah, they have to run free games somehow :)
[3:03:31] PERsepollis: @Yemtron  na its  real parto
[3:03:48] Wozatron256: @Jorjica yep
[3:03:49] Phyyl: alloys?
[3:03:51] ajwelcheck: Nope, not magnetic.
[3:04:07] Ebonmourn: not unless its an aluminum alloy
[3:04:16] madseed15: KEKW
[3:04:20] zynithtv: thats the fluid extractor
[3:04:20] Yemtron: Imagine the cost of running the backend of a free game with +100,000 players
[3:04:22] Yemtron: oof
[3:04:40] HostileLogOut: prob like 50k + monthly or so
[3:04:42] Soultiger777: warfrane does that
[3:04:59] ZyianDev: back in the day, it was probably really expensive
[3:04:59] Moobot: Support Waffle by using his Epic creator code: Giantwaffle
[3:04:59] Phyyl: really expensive, but really profitable also... everything is relative
[3:05:02] Lucrosus: $5 members subs
[3:05:03] ZyianDev: lots of upfront costs
[3:05:04] Tabakhase: classic RS runs on 2 old pentiums in some dudes basement KEKW
[3:05:07] Yemtron: My previous company was a small texting app and our backend on AWS was like 20k a month
[3:05:08] Yemtron: lol
[3:05:09] Allmostdone: then you sell the players info
[3:05:26] HostileLogOut: @Yemtron first mistake was using AWS lol. they are super overpriced.
[3:05:36] Tabakhase: AWS is like 300% premium yea KEKW
[3:05:52] Chronoes: pleeple
[3:05:58] Tabakhase: soon like an hour..
[3:06:07] davethulhu: you're running multiple servers at that point, and have to deal with stuff like load balancing as well
[3:06:15] phoenixxua: AWS as well as Azure have Reserved instances that gives like 60-70% discount
[3:06:16] ZyianDev: 300% premium so you're not locked into a data center contract
[3:06:25] Allmostdone: pleaple are the same a sheeple
[3:06:36] Tabakhase: @phoenixxua still doesnt help on how they rip one on traffic...
[3:06:49] Yemtron: AWS has really nice support and solutions though. Sooooo many things you can do
[3:06:58] HostileLogOut: @Giantwaffle interested in checking out Vintage story?
[3:06:59] Yemtron: and it integrates with basically everything seamlessly
[3:07:02] phoenixxua: @Tabakhase everyone bills for traffic. and everyone has some free amount of it
[3:07:31] slyjedi: @Giantwaffle did you ever get your grill up and running?
[3:07:33] HostileLogOut: eh. heard quite the oppesite @Yemtron AWS has bad support and is super bad with delay etc. there are so many issues
[3:07:34] Tenkaichi500: ask him CarlSmile
[3:07:36] Wozatron256: Biomutant looks great
[3:07:43] DatoPotatoDato: biomutant is a very painful game to play, its just so boring
[3:07:48] MofuLord: ive heard biomutant is scuffed
[3:07:55] MofuLord: but thats second hand info
[3:07:56] Tabakhase: @phoenixxua not everywhere =) i pay for bandwidth, not traffic
[3:07:58] Venxuri: can you actually do sponsored content without saying "sponsored blabla"?
[3:08:04] ajwelcheck: I've heard it sucks.
[3:08:15] Yemtron: I wish I were sponsored to be here :(
[3:08:16] Shiftoman101: i like it and im not sponsored
[3:08:20] Hwabyung: The gameplay also looks jank, like theres a visual pause with every move you make
[3:08:22] SmokyMtnRed: Doesn't look like fun to me honestly
[3:08:32] TarMonA: chat sponsor by McD's KEKW
[3:08:33] funnyc4t: I had to stop playing it after a hour, didn't like the combat at all
[3:08:38] DapHammer: we lpve the game! (sponsored comment)
[3:08:40] Yemtron: Waffle doesn't pay you to be here chat? Big YIKES
[3:08:44] Infinin: We are sponsored by your dad and mom
[3:08:44] Allmostdone: im sponsored. I will say it
[3:08:45] slyjedi: i tuned into shorty earlier, he was complaining about the dialog being repetitive
[3:08:52] Hwabyung: (sponsored comment): PogChamp
[3:08:53] phoenixxua: @Tabakhase Azure has a fiber connection service for some providers and charge for bandwidth as well
[3:08:59] Wozatron256: Image how much better this pack will be with some automation of basic parts
[3:08:59] DatoPotatoDato: from what ive heard the combat in biomutant is very stale, and the story is very cliche and boring. on top of that u have a narrator just telling u the whole story throughout the whole game
[3:09:07] Venxuri: KomodoHype
[3:09:16] undeniablyrexer: Why don't you use a lathe for rods?
[3:09:30] kyoo_mibu: -+
[3:09:34] Yemtron: Yeah, the narrator in biomutant is a little much. Kinda needs to shut up lol
[3:09:36] undeniablyrexer: doesn't use a tool
[3:09:42] The_Holas: but its 2 rods
[3:09:54] Venxuri: oh, he is sponsored
[3:09:56] DatoPotatoDato: @Yemtron exactly it keeps killing the immersion
[3:09:57] Venxuri: the title lol
[3:10:01] DapHammer: lol
[3:10:03] Chronoes: KEKW
[3:10:03] funnyc4t: You can turn them off
[3:10:04] Tabakhase: @phoenixxua and even traffic, compare egress on aws vs smth like hetzner or ovh-cloud - its nuts...
[3:10:06] Yemtron: He just keeps talking
[3:10:07] Yemtron: lol
[3:10:07] TarMonA: 2 and dust??

[3:10:41] Hwabyung: MONKERS
[3:10:44] phoenixxua: @Tabakhase yeah, it's true. but a lot of others like Digital ocean and Linode also charges for consumed traffic as well
[3:10:44] FalleNM3rC: @Giantwaffle just watched wrath of man
[3:10:44] DatoPotatoDato: monkaS
[3:10:46] slyjedi: hes so annoyed

[3:15:36] Chronoes: NFT has no legal backing, it's pretty useless right now besides flexing your ego
[3:15:37] madseed15: @Giantwaffle press
[3:15:37] DaGMC: its like throwing a bunch of dollars out of the window for a starship in startcitizens

[3:16:12] Yemtron: People pay stupid amounts of money for digital assets with no verification currently. I could see how it can work lol
[3:16:16] PureSpider: DaGMC yea but in star citizen thats just it, they can do whatever they want to with your ship - while NFTs actually exist on a blockchain and can't be fudged igaShrug
[3:16:34] Linkitch: I get ticks everytime I see those curved blocks rooScream

[3:17:11] Larklen: The in-game mining profession could be used to validate the blockchain Kappa
[3:17:20] DaGMC: @PureSpider onces the blockchain is down your goods are gone
[3:17:27] Askjong: T-40 to launch
[3:17:40] Yemtron: Uh oh, saying chat doesn't know something? Ballsy my friend Kappa
[3:17:42] PureSpider: DaGMC yea but a distributed system of thousanda of nodes is less likely to go down than star shitizen servers 4Head
[3:17:49] Chronoes: sounds insane to me to have every single item in a game with an associated NFT
[3:17:49] Jeylists: Of course there is if the chain is run on a centralized server it can be compromised so it wouldn't be actually 100% valid :)
[3:18:00] FalleNM3rC: @Apparentthreat its behind BN3 being stacked, so unlikely its leaving anytime soon
[3:18:01] mitsuki_11: verification of ownership of digital documentation seems like a pretty realistic uses case, but that's not sexy so most people wont care lol

[3:18:49] PureSpider: DaGMC will anything? like, you're reaching preeeeetty far here :D
[3:18:56] Venxuri: those are much much cheaper and less of a hassle
[3:19:49] Yemtron: In 1000 years we will all exist only as memories in a hardware medium as bits. Sadge
[3:20:10] DaGMC: @PureSpider take a look at the pyramids or the gifts from a tomb, they still exist
[3:20:15] Klorell: later

[4:28:11] aicoa: its essentially a downward spiral IMHO just see how YT increased ad amount and people are annoyed instead of buying youtube red @Giantwaffle
[4:28:12] DecoyOcelot: 6 ads per hour? what is this daytime television?
[4:28:20] Malkariss1: personally getting 6 ads in a row is enough to make me switch to watching something else so i definitly think it hurts the channel
[4:28:25] DuctTapeNinja_: just sign biggest contract, always play ads and never acknowledge it with chat Kappa
[4:28:26] itsfilipoficial: Is this so that twitch can make some money out of ad revenue and the new ads index metric?
[4:28:29] JingleYT: If you don't sign the Ad contract, wouldn't you be missing out on a ton of money? @Giantwaffle
[4:28:30] mechoriet: @Chyrion but is it worth the pain of losing viewers
[4:28:32] INoname_x: How many years I wasted just by watching ads. I could be a milionaire already KEKW
[4:28:35] Atzgee: ads on live contest is really bad how they do them currently
[4:28:36] BadLa: what percentage of your regular viewers are subs and dont even see ads?
[4:28:43] Atzgee: content*
[4:28:45] Tabakhase: @CuresEighty mobile and consoles are huge - and even on pc adblocking on twitch is "a struggle" they actively fight :P
[4:28:48] Vax_Man: Vax_Man subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months! vaxmanLOVE
[4:28:49] Archelonde: I dont mind watching 1-2 ads if a streamer goes on break to stretch legs or something, but if 3+ pops up im outta that stream.
[4:28:56] Chyrion: @mechoriet probably not tbf
[4:29:00] Surge43: LIke I dont need to see the southwest ad for the 90th time.
[4:29:01] aCookienot: won't there be ads anyway?
[4:29:03] produkteriswf: 3 second? wut i get minimumk 15
[4:29:04] fanta_x_thomas: They dont allow them because they get paid less for showing them
[4:29:07] DapHammer: it sucks to watch
[4:29:10] Hengo: The worst part its that they only have like 2 different apps Sometime si get the same twice...
[4:29:11] aicoa: i am annoyed as they are ALWAYS too loud.. especially because its so dependant on the streamers input volume..
[4:29:12] Morelia__: im told content creators on youtube dont get paid for ads that are skipped
[4:29:12] EdgeOFChaos17: if ads pop up during a stream, i usually just leave and find someone else to watch lol
[4:29:17] AshtenD: I usually leave those streams
[4:29:19] AshtenD: Yeah
[4:29:23] n8level: just about to watch the end of the round and 6 ads run = the worst experience ever
[4:29:25] strxcc: Bro, just ran the UE5 Ancient demo, people may be hating the whole 'it just works' bs but even at 30FPS for such a scene its runs smooth and on my kinda shitty old system :P
[4:29:31] PumaDFloh: it would be fine if the ad was in my language sorry Twitch i dont speak french
[4:29:35] Dagmoo: same KEKW
[4:29:36] RamseyRinehaus: the 7 consecutive ads is almost always an immediate leave stream for me
[4:29:39] mechoriet: widepeepoHappy piHole what ads KEKW
[4:29:40] The_Sauce_Bros: pre roll is not 6 tho
[4:29:43] Pine_Noir: I like Twitch's "no sexually suggestive content" term, but there's a condom ad in every other ad segment
[4:29:49] JadedOnyx19: that aint made a dime off me then lol
[4:29:49] n8level: @Crunxzu exactly
[4:29:51] kypudo: ublock baby
[4:29:58] shinigami312: Getting adds when looking at a new stream often makes me give up before the add is finished
[4:30:04] Wetware: I can handle the 10-15 second youtube ads, but the 3 minute ones - skipped
[4:30:04] fanta_x_thomas: Pretty sure thats how youtube works, techniqu.lly and ad
[4:30:06] aicoa: @Pine_Noir and a Hot Tube category.. where the money flows... typically LUL
[4:30:07] ZyianDev: I mostly hate when the ads just interupt the conversation that was going on
[4:30:09] Atzgee: ublock EZ
[4:30:09] ThatOnneGuy: I started getting ads in spanish... no idea why
[4:30:22] Rob_Kebab: pepeJAM
[4:30:29] Morelia__: ive been offered 15 minute ads on youtube before
[4:30:34] realbobmaster: I absolutely hate ads. I’d rather pay to watch at this point
[4:30:34] MrMoneybagMan: pepeJAM
[4:30:42] JadedOnyx19: anymore then 3 ads and i wont even make it past 10 seconds of the first, our attention span can be broken very easily lol
[4:30:43] Kuroiorb: waffleSpy
[4:30:45] Pine_Noir: my ublock doesn't seem to block Twitch ads. dunno why.
[4:31:10] fanta_x_thomas: Technically an ad that is skipped doesnt show as an ad watched by someone thats why now lots of ads are 5 seconds long
[4:31:22] kitofmaadnes: @morelia__ bro i once seen 4h add on yt like who does that
[4:31:24] Tabakhase: you had that - and they removed it again KEKW
[4:31:26] Rob_Kebab: If you block ads on twitch it just gives you more ads
[4:31:33] ZyianDev: I'll deal with preroll, but mid-rolls are fucking annoying
[4:31:33] daemonaedryn: The worst thing is trying to find new streamers to watch
[4:31:39] abhidingox: YT ads are getting out of hand i watched a 9 min video there was a 34 min ad
[4:31:41] botmaniac: i mute the stream and go to another window in chrome as soon as i hear an ad
[4:31:47] ThatOnneGuy: no there's just so many partners
[4:31:48] daemonaedryn: Because I dont want to watch a new streamer if I have to watch 2 ads to do it
[4:31:51] Morelia__: @kitofmaadnes monkaGun
[4:31:52] Bkmoto28: the pre roles do my head in
[4:31:53] MiraPacku: monkaHmm what?
[4:31:53] ThatOnneGuy: all they care about is money
[4:31:55] CMDR_WeeJet: i just pay for twitch turbo. so i never get ads what so ever
[4:31:57] DX_Plates: Crream runs his ads well. He takes regular breaks and uses those to run ads. If you run regular ads on your stream you aren't supposed to have the pre-roll stuff.
[4:31:59] Chronoes: I can deal with pre-roll ads 1 or max 2. Anything that becomes disruptive, is an out
[4:32:05] PumaDFloh: i miss the time with twitch turbo and no ads
[4:32:09] Sefa202: that's why I have yt premium
[4:32:10] fanta_x_thomas: I thought the point in twitch prime was originally the so that people who had it didnt see ads
[4:32:10] Wetware: I suppose they have to pay the bills somehow, but I now irrationally hate Novanilla for that Indeed ad LUL
[4:32:20] Tabakhase: imGlitch devCheck
[4:32:26] DX_Plates: Nothing is free.
[4:32:29] richie385: fuck sky sports for runing ads during the race you pay for it and get hit with ads i use freestreams but im still pissed that thay run them
[4:32:38] EdgeOFChaos17: they just need to add turbo back to prime.
[4:32:47] Bulva: I am just using VPN, no ads since
[4:32:58] JadedOnyx19: i will watch an ad or two but its not like we have an option, i just dont like that Twitch will just shove ads on channels and do it at the worst times too, can kill the whole vibe at 0 fault of the streamer
[4:32:59] PumaDFloh: wait there is no twitch turbo? they removed it
[4:33:01] Little_Lady_Lauren: yea sometime i will want to see what a streamer is up to, get an add, and im like no i dont care enough
[4:33:03] Chyromyr: I don't mind twitch ads, but that's because I live in a region that don't get many. I might see one or two per day watched.
[4:33:12] DX_Plates: PumaDFloh They decoupled it from Prime
[4:33:31] Wetware: Pre rolls really make me not look for new streams though
[4:33:35] M1k3D3l7a: Latvia is a country ,yes
[4:33:36] phoenixxua: yeah, i don't have any ads as well since there are no local ads in twitch
[4:33:48] JadedOnyx19: @Little_Lady_Lauren also how many people do u watch that you are subbed too, i forget theres ads sometimes cause i only watch a few lol
[4:33:50] DX_Plates: Wetware Turbo = no pre-rolls
[4:33:50] Jeraku: heya waffle, you doing snowrunner today?
[4:33:51] Bulva: I am using Hungary , no ads for me
[4:33:52] PERsepollis: iam fron iraaan and no adssss\
[4:33:53] Tabakhase: @PumaDFloh they removed it - bundled it in prime - then discoverd that not al countries have prime, turbo came back - and then they removed adFree from prime another few months later bamDerp
[4:33:55] kaos4666: Albania is perffect Kappa
[4:34:04] PumaDFloh: @dx_plates okay i may have to search for it then
[4:34:04] Moobot: Come join the Waffle House discord https://discord.gg/G5FeeveP3c and chat with the community! Remember to link your Twitch account in the Settings (gear) > Connections for subscriber channels.
[4:34:13] merscever: recently they have began showing ads even in those countires, local subs pricing also shows that twitch wants to be in every country
[4:34:20] MrArrig: I started to get german ads for some reason. I'm not german
[4:34:37] DX_Plates: PumaDFloh Yea, its in the drop-down menu next to Music.
[4:34:38] Little_Lady_Lauren: @JadedOnyx19 yea same. i only watch a few channels regularly and i am sibed to them
[4:34:40] MiraPacku: pepeLaugh @MrArrig
[4:35:01] Wetware: @DX_Plates Yes, I'm thinking I might get Turbo, but I don't watch that much, I expect I'll break down at some point though :D
[4:35:17] PumaDFloh: @dx_plates okay thx
[4:35:47] DX_Plates: I got turbo cause I surf a lot. Especially since I got into NoPixel and looking for other POVs.
[4:35:57] daemonaedryn: Could probably automate it right?
[4:35:58] Th3Harbinger: those things are a pain
[4:36:00] sogerr: @MrArrig ad companies know more about you than yourself, you probably are german
[4:36:05] sleepymisaki: I started to get french ads, I am german KEKW
[4:36:06] Venxuri: grains took like 10 mins to automate
[4:36:09] CorSPACE: first 1.17 pre release tomorrow! https://twitter.com/slicedlime/status/1397596175683969024
[4:36:25] MrArrig: @sogerr My mother has some explaining to do, thats for sure
[4:36:27] Cafn8247: Auto clicker and vacuum hopper
[4:36:34] Cafn8247: Ftw
[4:36:47] CorSPACE: pre-release they do several before release
[4:37:00] CorSPACE: the data pack adds that
[4:37:12] CorSPACE: but its an experimental feature
[4:37:13] daemonaedryn: So will 1.17 be the caves and cliffs or copper or something?
[4:37:18] CorSPACE: no
[4:37:35] DatoPotatoDato: yeah the datapack is essentially 1.18
[4:37:35] CorSPACE: yes
[4:37:37] symaski62: @CorSPACE ty ty ty !
[4:37:52] daemonaedryn: I feel like using 1.17 just to add copper is a bit of a waste, or a Jebaited
[4:37:55] Echonnaissance: afaik they're doing the fauna and then environment but its been forever last ive checked
[4:38:12] ChickenInASweater: can they even burn?
[4:38:20] Doughnut911: they can't burn
[4:38:23] Venxuri: I remember blazing pyroeth-something-something wasn't hard to get and from there jsut vaccum into ender chest and its automated and forget
[4:38:31] Adayics: They dont burn Waffle! c'x
[4:38:37] Pine_Noir: Is the Igniter in this pack to automate this?
[4:38:41] CorSPACE: in 1.15 or 16 i forget mojang added the experimental feature for datapacks to change world generation thats what makes the data pack possible to do the world gen
[4:38:41] msfWEBdude: Automating this was a pain
[4:38:54] Wetware: Must be pretty hot flint and steel to burn bedrock LUL
[4:39:00] Exerion09: Fire water with a vaccum chest
[4:39:01] msfWEBdude: but you have to replace broken flint and steels
[4:39:02] pt0ughneigh: another pog day for gme
[4:39:26] daemonaedryn: ratJAM
[4:39:43] pixfix2k2: On my way to Minmus for the first time, hopefully I have enouigh Delta-V to get back
[4:39:57] Sanduckchan: is a starship this fast in oribt as well?
[4:40:05] pixfix2k2: Oh sweet im fine then'
[4:40:26] Chronoes: altitude and mass of the body you're orbiting
[4:40:27] Sanduckchan: oh fuck im dumb.. of course FailFish
[4:40:32] aicoa: are you saying i would be as fast as well? Kappa
[4:40:33] Yemtron: how fast do we have to go to orbit around chat's mom susHmm
[4:40:37] peon47: half way round the world in 42 minutes blows my mind/.
[4:40:37] Wetware: @Giantwaffle Did you hear another satellite internet provider asked for an injunction to stop Spacex doing more Starlink launches. Their reason - we can't compete LUL
[4:40:42] Naappletree: NODDERS
[4:40:47] Exerion09: Well unless your mass is like  a trillion pounds :D
[4:40:58] Cyberwire69: ooh lando is live
[4:41:04] elonblazeit42069: Mental health check for chat and streamer how are you all doing today?
[4:41:07] aicoa: is a next starship test date already on the horizon?

[4:42:18] Wetware: Maybe they're going to paint a Doge face on the side of SN-15?
[4:42:28] elonblazeit42069: somebody suggested on twitter melting sn15 down and making some medals or something that pwople can buy
[4:42:37] Sanduckchan: snow in space? DansGame
[4:42:42] lofffff: its crazy the rate they deploy these starlink satellites at
[4:42:55] yarrnn: what are the small particles flying around? I thought space didn't have dust and stuff?
[4:43:00] Cyberwire69: she said 45:30..  etf
[4:43:12] elonblazeit42069: @yarrnn its mono propellant
[4:43:22] yarrnn: @elonblazeit42069 oh ok thanks!
[4:43:22] Sanduckchan: lofffff well they want like what.. 3500 of them in space? so better hurry up :D
[4:43:31] Wetware: Could do the correction with a good fart
[4:43:34] Yemtron: bugs around the cameras in space KomodoHype

[4:44:03] mechoriet: @Chronoes KEKW

[4:44:44] doppelapfel65: Lookin sharp today waffle
[4:44:54] Yemtron: My name looked weird without a waffle next to it
[4:44:59] ParkourVienna: would need real time data/projections
[4:45:10] lofffff: i think there is another website that shows starlink
[4:45:15] Chyrion: you can just search for starlink without a group
[4:45:22] M1k3D3l7a: my link, waffle
[4:45:36] SchroTN: Heavens Above has something like that as well
[4:45:39] Exerion09: Where's the waffle satellite?
[4:45:39] Yemtron: no internet at the north pole :(
[4:45:44] Wetware: Man still crazy how many they already have up
[4:45:57] Wetware: No internet for Santa!
[4:46:01] M1k3D3l7a: Yemtron only world wide coverage not global
[4:46:09] ParkourVienna: wow coverage looks awesome already
[4:46:25] Sander20011: why no polar orbits?
[4:46:25] The_Holas: is this Dyson sphere? Kappa
[4:46:34] DX_Plates: Alaska Sadge
[4:46:37] DrBeardGuy: @Giantwaffle Snowrunner today?
[4:46:39] celadriel23: are these currently deployed satellites or what will be covered
[4:46:39] boatymc_boatface_: don't you need like 500 euro for initial equipment?
[4:46:43] InTheLittlePro: Linus tried it and got like 5Mbps
[4:46:46] InTheLittlePro: I think
[4:46:46] kommendorfindus: There was a single frame of the inside of the LOX tank again
[4:46:50] mechoriet: yeah the RSS icons are ground stations
[4:46:57] usernameNull: starlink would be great for living in an RV
[4:46:59] Surge43: My area is too crowded. I would get this over cox. no data caps.
[4:47:17] sogerr: DSP PepeHands
[4:47:24] QwyIl: I've heard of 2 more shells. One lower and one higher with interlinks
[4:47:28] Yemtron: so are these tidally locked?
[4:47:28] aur1so: PogChamp
[4:47:28] MarQuiZ_: Free wifi for everyone <3
[4:47:29] Berrog: i saw a train a few weeks ago it was crazy looking
[4:47:32] DX_Plates: Base Stations are fixed not mobile, yet...
[4:47:34] mostlylaughing: Wait they already did 1200 sattelites? That's nuts
[4:47:45] aicoa: just connect to the ocean fiber glass Kappa
[4:47:45] 0omkins: just 200mb DL
[4:47:51] Sander20011: What if I want to connect from scandinavia?
[4:47:55] Tes2K: are those for starlink ?
[4:47:58] Wetware: I think the military was funding development of more mobile ground stations
[4:48:02] Bulva: anyone know, if I bought one of the starlink device from U.S. and take it back to Europe, can I use it without issue?
[4:48:05] mechoriet: @DX_Plates hmm idk i have seen video's where people took it with them
[4:48:06] Flamingass: Watching you talk about this made my internet connection act up
[4:48:07] cluckliddel: imagine a zombie apocalypse scenario where you can still access the internet
[4:48:09] CorSPACE: @Tes2K yes, all starlink
[4:48:11] ParkourVienna: endgame is sat to sat connectivity, then mobile stations matter less
[4:48:12] Yemtron: are these tidally locked or do they move? D:
[4:48:16] Biddy2004: are the speeds good?
[4:48:24] Cyberwire69: LUL @ oneweb
[4:48:27] Tabakhase: the fixed thing is supposedly purely FCC mucking around LUL
[4:48:33] aicoa: i am only sceptical for more and more and more companies putting sats up there .. pollutes the night sky way too much once this is affordable for other companies
[4:48:35] mechoriet: 100/10 at 20ms orso
[4:48:39] peon47: gonna be huge for people in countries where the government controls the internet. people in myanmar or hong kong or north korea.
[4:48:40] sogerr: @biddytv Linus have a video on it, good speed but kind of high ping
[4:48:40] Doughnut911: its 3G
[4:48:42] pev1e: @Bulva No it won't work, the dish is assigned to a particular cell. Check their FAQs on their website
[4:48:43] CorSPACE: 150
[4:48:48] Th3Harbinger: that's really good for satallite though
[4:48:49] Biddy2004: gotcha thanks
[4:48:52] CorSPACE: i think elon wants to do gigabit
[4:48:53] boatymc_boatface_: twitch rivals from central african republic incoming
[4:48:56] Codidley: @Yemtron nah these orbit at like 90 minutes periods
[4:48:58] RamseyRinehaus: they are also good if you dont want to support fucking comcast
[4:48:58] peetur_: poeple get >100
[4:49:00] Chronoes: @Yemtron you mean geostationary orbits and no, geostationary is like 35000 km
[4:49:01] Th3Harbinger: like current satalite is like 35/2
[4:49:03] bedbuggies: doesnt the dish need to be pointed at a specific angle? (assuming your putting the device on a moving vechicle)
[4:49:05] aicoa: @peon47 until companies comply with them... just like they are all doing in china... nothing will change really tbh
[4:49:07] Bulva: @pev1e oh thats sucks
[4:49:09] DX_Plates: I've seen a couple farmers that have done Starlink videos, cause there relied on 3G mobile networks before starlink was available.
[4:49:17] Yemtron: linus had a video too
[4:49:18] Deadfox74: 50/20 is better than my current internet LUL
[4:49:40] Tabakhase: @venoxx11 those visualisations dont take scale - "in real" you could put ALL the things on stuffin.space in a single pixel on the screen or so LUL
[4:49:42] RoninStorm: i live in a town with a shitty local company monopoly on internet... i pay 85$ a month for 50/5 internet... I can't wait to get starlink
[4:49:46] Doritobob269: "really recent" 2 months ago LUL
[4:49:51] mechoriet: push that sat firmware KEKW
[4:50:01] Yemtron: oh wow
[4:50:06] Naappletree: that's pretty fuckin good
[4:50:07] QwyIl: I have like 30 on cable

[4:50:10] TelRehiad: most people have 32 ms even with DSL
[4:50:13] boatymc_boatface_: that's my cable ping
[4:50:14] ZyianDev: that ping is really good, but it's not stable :(
[4:50:16] ebrain3: that's insane
[4:50:16] Tabakhase: no multi-sat hopping yet
[4:50:17] ExcelsiorVFX: 27 is good ping period
[4:50:17] JadedOnyx19: i have more then that to my local city ffs
[4:50:18] DX_Plates: Currently Starlink is more for rural internet rather than city folk.
[4:50:21] philipkatis: And it will only get better with more sats
[4:50:22] barbsfury: thats mine
[4:50:22] Naappletree: yo that's better than my up/down lol
[4:50:23] aliceoface: 56k
[4:50:23] AmoArman: its 27 ms for every object you load, its good for video but awful for facebook
[4:50:23] pev1e: @pev1e Outside of beta you'll be able to move it around such as attaching it to an RV.
[4:50:24] Sander20011: That is almost the same as my wired connection in ping
[4:50:25] Dasperhue: i had 56k modem LUL
[4:50:25] produkteriswf: 27 is amazing, here is me with 80
[4:50:26] Tabakhase: jut ping-pong to ground
[4:50:29] johnshepherd104: Its better then nothing
[4:50:30] CorSPACE: scott said on twitter that this was the final launch of the first shell of starlink
[4:50:34] aicoa: @Tabakhase still, polluting the night sky is already an realised issue, which is also why starlink is now painted black .. first sats weren't
[4:50:38] Cyberwire69: <100ms was awesome when switching from dial up to cable
[4:50:38] InTheLittlePro: for remote people its great!
[4:50:38] DatoPotatoDato: ...my down was 2mb/s a year ago
[4:50:39] mechoriet: i think its down/up/down don't think they can do up/sat/sat/down yet
[4:50:39] ParkourVienna: I think sat to sat connectivity isn't in production yet, it's just sat to ground station, or not?
[4:50:40] kommendorfindus: 27 is not really noticable
[4:50:42] MakerOfThingys: I'd pay it just to get rid of Xfinity
[4:50:42] Wetware: It's faster than the existing sat internet since the satellites are so much lower orbits
[4:50:43] Tes2K: thats better than my corrent ADSL
[4:50:45] itsRynosuki: damn, that 10x what i pay for equal speeds
[4:50:49] QwyIl: I'm paying 80$ for 130/10 so it's really close
[4:50:51] Watertoad: i was getting .9 megabits down last night LUL
[4:50:58] Watertoad: my internet was fucked last night
[4:50:59] sogerr: @Giantwaffle isnt this video from a dude in a city? should use from someone in a more rural setting
[4:51:04] mechoriet: don't think they have the lasers up yet
[4:51:15] CorSPACE: also not all the satellites have optical sat to sat communications right now
[4:51:16] aicoa: its totally fine for everyday internet
[4:51:18] kommendorfindus: in germany that would be astronomical for private internet
[4:51:21] Sxe_Ben: better than my upload that i spend 80$ / mo for lol
[4:51:21] JadedOnyx19: its more then i get lol and i have 400 down

[4:51:46] CorSPACE: #vanlife
[4:51:47] Naappletree: oh heck yeah
[4:51:47] Wetware: I wonder how many actual users they can service before they hit a limit?
[4:52:00] boatymc_boatface_: yeah because in a trailer park you spend 100 per month on internet
[4:52:01] dennixfailalot: i'm happy with my fiber internet
[4:52:02] Crazyfox55: Clamping?

[4:52:29] mechoriet: pepeJAM
[4:52:29] Mapleton: @Crazyfox55 Glamorous camping, like with 100k$ camping trailers
[4:52:29] celadriel23: it will be a great improvement for rural areas - the infrastructure cost is way too high to get high speed internet to the vast majority of land in hte country
[4:52:33] Exerion09: Meme access for all!
[4:52:34] Tes2K: whats that website again ?

[4:52:38] CorSPACE: over 500k people have ordered starlink
[4:52:43] Cyberwire69: its currently geo locked tho
[4:52:46] cluckliddel: Funny that the people who would benefit the most might be the ones against it the most.
[4:52:53] MrArrig: What happened to internet by weather ballons or whatever that facebook talked about?
[4:52:55] aicoa: right now starlink is region locked right
[4:52:56] Naappletree: *slaps car* this baby can hold so many starlink dishes
[4:52:58] MetalBBA: It really comes down to always having a decent alternative to your local monopoly with its shit rates
[4:52:59] paulpkpk: will vibration be a problem tho PepoThink
[4:53:02] Aarimous: Parks and Rec Glamping scene: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=842-nopgVYs
[4:53:04] Tradios: kind of ironic how a system like this is geo locked @Cyberwire69
[4:53:09] Wetware: Hard to get away from it all when you bring it all with you though!
[4:53:11] Triquarter: Oh seeing the moon its a blood moon and lunar eclipse tonight ;)

[4:55:36] iciRellik: Wranglestar also has a review
[4:55:38] ebrain3: that's better than my 4G KEKW
[4:55:42] Tithonius: the 500 dollar hardware cost is a bit hard to swallow tho with starlink
[4:55:43] Yemtron: starlink and starlink accesories KKona
[4:55:56] Sander20011: FSD?
[4:55:59] Invalidm_: 2020 felt like it actually was 5 years ago tbh YEP
[4:56:01] iciRellik: His review is that its average
[4:56:05] Mapleton: Barley get radio out at the cabin, Internet would be godly
[4:56:06] Naappletree: All I hear is Frame Shift Drive lol
[4:56:08] Sander20011: Ah, okey
[4:56:10] Jerryspringernl: It will perform good with only 5 users, but with 5 million?
[4:56:13] Zoinx: @iciRellik thats a name I haven't heard for a couple years, used to watch him all the time
[4:56:13] Ruan_A: M peepoPat
[4:56:14] QwyIl: When was the last time SpaceX lost a payload?
[4:56:22] ItsOnMax: @Naappletree same
[4:56:27] Doughnut911: "The way it should be, Ah tell you What"
[4:56:35] Tabakhase: @Jerryspringernl if there are 5 million peope somewhere, someone will put fiber in the ground
[4:56:36] ItsOnMax: facebook KEKW
[4:56:38] Naappletree: @Naappletree ayyyy
[4:56:40] Chronoes: they lost the Tesla on the Falcon Heavy Kappa
[4:56:41] DuctTapeNinja_: that wasnt a loss
[4:56:42] PrototypeGREW: good xD
[4:56:47] Yemtron: Facebook lost a satellite? good :)
[4:56:49] Mike190Twitch: facebook "Nothing of value was lost" KEKW
[4:56:52] aicoa: fb KEKW
[4:56:52] Wetware: Facebook satellite ? And nothing of value waslost
[4:56:59] DaGMC: wtf facebook satellite?! to spy on us?!
[4:57:00] ebrain3: facebook has a satellite?
[4:57:00] aicoa: thats almost sad LUL LUL
[4:57:09] timbit123: do they have satellite insurance?
[4:57:12] Yemtron: tesla's linked to starlink incoming D:
[4:57:12] ItsOnMax: @DaGMC yes Kappa
[4:57:32] Redronn: Facebook was trying to sell peoples data to aliens? NotLikeThis
[4:57:35] sniper370: They lost a payload going to the space station a few years ago i thought
[4:57:38] SodiumDoggo: ufo??
[4:57:39] mostlylaughing: sattelites are 100% insured
[4:57:51] mechoriet: company i think
[4:57:53] dasmako: companies i thought are always insured
[4:57:55] GamerShawTV: yes insurance helps with that i work in transport -
[4:57:55] dasmako: they have to be
[4:57:56] Tithonius: depends on if you drive for a company or contract based
[4:57:57] Jerryspringernl: @Tabakhase But, what is the max user count that it can handle? or total bandwith
[4:58:02] Tes2K: they said it was an "accident"  *wink* *wink*
[4:58:03] ilya__yas: on geo sats they usually buy insurance...
[4:58:03] fanta_x_thomas: The company is insured
[4:58:09] johnshepherd104: Most loads are worth more then truckers are worth, sadly
[4:58:09] Moobot: You can find Waffle's Youtube channel here - https://youtube.com/giantwaffle
[4:58:10] dasmako: nah thats the point if you are at fault the company is at fault i thought
[4:58:15] dasmako: tbh i dunno though
[4:58:16] dennixfailalot: company if done properly
[4:58:20] BadLa: instead of cargo its a spacego KEKW
[4:58:20] 0omkins: receivables insurance
[4:58:21] mechoriet: then still company cause they hired you
[4:58:22] GamerShawTV: most delivery companies are self insured and they deal with claims
[4:58:26] aicoa: probably depending if reckless or not
[4:58:28] 0omkins: export insurance.
[4:58:31] Joltygon: the rocket ensures the payload
[4:58:33] Exerion09: All I heard was party catJAM
[4:58:35] davethulhu: insurance pays if you're at fault, see car insurance.
[4:58:38] iciRellik: @Zoinx I agree, I'm not super in to the current format of his videos
[4:58:41] 0omkins: Contract Insurance.
[4:58:48] Yemtron: Now you can have your contracts with a clause of risk in it :)
[4:58:48] peon47: cant wait for KSP2
[4:58:53] EntropicEGO: Drive hardcore mode... no insurance anywhere
[4:59:02] Vaebae_1: If spaceX did nothing wrong then Facebooks insurance would pay imo
[4:59:04] Tabakhase: @Jerryspringernl that aint rly public information :| - its obvs a shared medium sure, but so is everything
[4:59:40] Yemtron: Yemtron satellite coming in 2022. Right over chat's house
[4:59:56] ItsOnMax: @Yemtron NotLikeThis
[5:00:13] produkteriswf: we upload zero two douhjin
[5:00:14] Cyberwire69: 70k to launch, still gotta build it too
[5:00:20] RamseyRinehaus: dedicated minecraft server? Kappa
[5:00:20] Exerion09: more Minecraft peepoHappy
[5:00:23] jcblair: just beam down memes
[5:00:28] ParkourVienna: space is much more exciting then minecraft right now imo, can't wait to see a spaceship (with booster) start - imagine that sonic boom shot
[5:00:30] Deadfox74: Put your crypto key on it
[5:00:42] Doomwyte: "Just read the instructions" LUL
[5:00:43] Allmostdone: One cube sat? Take over the world

[5:01:13] SooSheeRice: Flares Pog
[5:01:16] DaGMC: cant wait for JWST to be deployed
[5:01:25] Tithonius: what do the cameras look like? just a lense poking out or?
[5:01:31] ItsOnMax: whas that the moon?
[5:01:36] Exerion09: Aliens
[5:01:43] BadLa: dont see any stars in the background monkaHmm
[5:01:49] aicoa: to be honest.. i think i never watched a launch until this stage.. the landing is the best part LUL
[5:01:55] Yemtron: Dude, when the james web get's launched I'm gonna be monkaX the whole time... so scary
[5:01:57] M1k3D3l7a: that's basically Hubble on crack, right?
[5:02:06] mostlylaughing: @BadLa Sun though
[5:02:11] DaGMC: yeah definitely, we will be able to look so much further
[5:02:14] M1k3D3l7a: PogChamp
[5:02:15] aicoa: is it a telescope in space?
[5:02:16] ajwelcheck: Super Crack Pog
[5:02:17] brewerdc: James Webb?
[5:02:20] ItsOnMax: crackcocaine
[5:02:26] Tabakhase: scott to the rescue
[5:02:29] Tabakhase: YEP
[5:02:32] Cyberwire69: scott is usually to the point
[5:02:32] fisering1: fisering1 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 9 months! <3
[5:02:33] DaGMC: @venoxx11 yes
[5:02:33] Chronoes: short? we don't watch short videos here
[5:02:35] mechoriet: there is a video of it unfolding
[5:02:35] GTLugo: It isn't visual light, sadly
[5:02:45] aicoa: @DaGMC reason is we can look further then?
[5:02:45] BobPatience: just one more short video pepeLaugh
[5:02:46] ajwelcheck: MINE POGGERS
[5:02:46] CakeYay: my telescope?
[5:02:50] Wetware: Webb is tuned more for infra red than visible light
[5:02:51] Pine_Noir: It's infrared though, not visible like Hubble is
[5:02:51] DaGMC: its infrared
[5:02:55] prairydog: ^^
[5:03:10] Codidley: unfortunately, it definitely won't be as long lasting
[5:03:11] aicoa: what if they find out there was never a big bang Kappa
[5:03:11] Chronoes: visible light in space is kind of boring, chat
[5:03:13] NatureBoyPat: waffleHeart_HF waffleHeart_HF
[5:03:18] Exerion09: I'll take two
[5:03:21] CorSPACE: infared is a wider spectrum than visible
[5:03:22] ItsOnMax: @DaGMC can still be turned in to cool images
[5:03:26] sogerr: the fighting stream now has 1.3M viewers, wtf
[5:03:31] dasmako: YUP
[5:03:39] ajwelcheck: IM OFFENDED Madge
[5:03:39] DaGMC: @venoxx11 better optics
[5:03:42] Aarimous: Hexagon is the bestagon
[5:03:43] ParkourVienna: redshift baby
[5:03:44] paulpkpk: Yep
[5:03:47] aicoa: @DaGMC thx
[5:03:47] M1k3D3l7a: 6 times? dang
[5:03:49] Tabakhase: like "all" pretty much
[5:03:53] DaGMC: yeah green is red
[5:03:55] dasmako: they are multiple images combined yea
[5:04:01] Tabakhase: exceptions make the rule^^
[5:04:05] CorSPACE: ya its a lot of interpretation
[5:04:05] lofffff: susHmm
[5:04:08] GTLugo: @Chronoes We're just talking about comparing to Hubble. Hubble gave us really nice looking images, whether or not it was useful.
[5:04:13] SooSheeRice: Did Waffle see the Motherboard video about this NASA engineer defend satellites in space from hackers?
[5:04:14] aicoa: are you saying its all fake? Sadge
[5:04:18] The_kid_as_a_teen: she sounded like burnout revenge lady
[5:04:20] Aarimous: I don't care they are colored, they are pretty
[5:04:32] Tabakhase: dasH
[5:04:36] Yemtron: they can find signatures of life through the atmosphere from planets I thought. Traces of things than we can only see with organic matter. I forget
[5:04:43] Tasar_: What could go wrong
[5:04:44] Overkrow: Is this the new satellite to control all the 5G chips?
[5:04:45] aicoa: i want to live on pluto kapp
[5:04:49] PERsepollis: more cooler  more deep it can see
[5:04:52] DaGMC: I hope everything goes well
[5:04:58] Chronoes: @GTLugo I'm sure JWST can get better images, even if they are post-processed
[5:05:00] cheppard: isn't that a giant solar sail?
[5:05:03] ParkourVienna: i know that voice, that's a porn actress
[5:05:06] philipkatis: The deployment events of JWST are monkaS
[5:05:07] Doritobob269: or so LUL
[5:05:08] Wetware: If we need some diamonds, we can just put some coal up the butts of the guys responsible for deploying this during the launch
[5:05:10] MorningJs: how can it be cold in space if there is no air?
[5:05:12] Yemtron: What if they only find dickbutt ?
[5:05:13] DrHax_: that kinda heatsink is needed because he telescope is powered by AMD CPUs Kappa
[5:05:23] GTLugo: @Chronoes Yeah, but it just isn't the same as a true visual light image imo.
[5:05:26] ilya__yas: when is webb due?
[5:05:31] QwyIl: @DrHax_ More like Intel nowadays
[5:05:33] ItsOnMax: the launch is going to be so nerve wrecking
[5:05:35] JoeCrow: This is so freakin exciting
[5:05:46] Tabakhase: @MorningJs works the other way around, where nothing is you cant have warmth
[5:05:46] lofffff: 5Head just fold it
[5:05:46] DaGMC: october 31 2021 according to google
[5:05:53] Yemtron: imagine if they lost that payload :(
[5:05:55] GTLugo: I am still very excited to see JWST launch
[5:05:55] botmaniac: imagine if that rocket kabooms :(
[5:05:56] itsIffy: Just send a few rolls of tinfoil
[5:05:57] M1k3D3l7a: Oh nice,they use a Ariane V?
[5:06:04] Doritobob269: simulated using ksp LUL
[5:06:06] Tabakhase: rly simplified LUL
[5:06:08] ilya__yas: @BBQgril :D
[5:06:08] johnshepherd104: 3 weeks x.x
[5:06:10] Noblez_: Imagine the rocket exploding during launch with the telescope in it...

[5:06:43] PrototypeGREW: Mine? thank you
[5:06:44] Racerboy108: @venoxx11 i believe they are putting it far enough out that we couldnt go out to repair it

[5:06:57] ajwelcheck: It's mine?
[5:06:57] billy112134: I made this :)
[5:06:59] CorSPACE: theres now delays with the Ariane V. they noticed fairing deployment errors that they will need to demonstrate are fixed on 2 missions prior to JWST so that it can fly @Giantwaffle
[5:07:00] TimmyVRC: those mirrors have to be immaculate dont they
[5:07:00] dasmako: origami status?
[5:07:00] Comets__: Is that what we just saw?
[5:07:03] BadLa: can i sell it?
[5:07:05] AlfredTheSalmon: my taxes paid that, ofc it's mine Kappa

[5:07:18] Aarimous: KSP?
[5:07:19] DaChibi: It's ours? Quick make an NFT of it and destroy it.
[5:07:21] aicoa: @Racerboy108 probably ya.. so much risk as obviously they can't just sent another one two weeks later
[5:07:23] BeastboySAW: Glad they aren’t letting Electron launch it.
[5:07:38] Wetware: It's way out there too, no servicing missions are possible like with Hubble
[5:07:59] mechoriet: YEP boiloff
[5:08:02] peon47: what protects the delicate mirrors from micrometeorites?

[5:56:41] mechoriet: yeah they changed some major components
[5:56:45] Wozatron256: It is crazy to see the mods that were created for 1.12 were really advanced due to the long cycle
[5:56:51] madseed15: peepoPat @szczureq90
[5:57:02] poggiewooggie: Fabric FTW

[6:00:31] Face_32: i have only recently started using fabric and i LOVE it
[6:00:33] TelRehiad: have you seen some of the new features from Forge as well? Where it does automatic mod installation for servers and things. its super cool
[6:00:40] Face_32: PLUS the forge guys are ass holes

[6:00:51] Yemtron: whoa whoa @Face_32
[6:00:53] Wozatron256: but forge has a crazy back end compared to fabric
[6:00:53] HoytZephyr: Skyoplis 4 uses forge and it boots pretty damn fast
[6:01:09] Yemtron: I don't play minecraft :)
[6:01:13] Face_32: @Yemtron do a quick google search about the forge owners, you will find it EZ
[6:01:15] DuctTapeNinja_: whats the goto Minecraft launcher nowadays?
[6:01:34] Yemtron: @Face_32 D:
[6:01:36] Face_32: forge is also more difficult to get mods published
[6:01:57] DuctTapeNinja_: thank you my dude @Giantwaffle

[6:10:32] Venxuri: alloy smelter with a mold
[6:10:33] WGG25: fluid solidifier
[6:10:36] madseed15: @Giantwaffle thermal expansion has a gear maker
[6:10:49] Maynid: solidifier only needs 4 ingots
[6:10:53] WGG25: the solidifier is the same material cost as the extruder (4 ingots)

[6:11:57] QwyIl: How many people got the J&J?
[6:12:01] Wetware: Vaccine uptake seems to have slowed down a bit in the US?
[6:12:09] Schimmeldude: you should start exporting then
[6:12:23] BlehblehFreak: they had vaccine shots available at the renaissance faire if you wanted it
[6:12:39] Yemtron: imagine taking the first dose, then being naw I'm good
[6:12:40] Yemtron: lol
[6:12:54] Wetware: @bla68ck68100 Yeah, but that was the vaccine for the Plague LUL
[6:13:10] celadriel23: some places have gone to bars and such
[6:13:13] TheRaidiation: hey waffle
[6:13:16] dasmako: god damnit people
[6:13:20] celadriel23: i think they had a vaccine drive at a strip club in vegas
[6:13:23] KrunkleDunk: we will hit it after a few years of culling
[6:13:28] daemonaedryn: In other words, idiots being idiots making life worse for others
[6:13:29] Allmostdone: and last time I read a bunch of humans together is called a group not a herd
[6:13:37] Exerion09: Yeah but I thought there was going to be a covid season like the flu season?
[6:13:41] ajwelcheck: Pog
[6:14:00] ashin47: I got my first shot go for my second on the 8th I felt fine
[6:14:03] daemonaedryn: LUL

[6:14:40] dokterbruinbeer21: you playing snowrunner later?
[6:14:42] polygonalperson: I actually love wearing a mask-- I don't have to smile at anyone
[6:14:46] Chronoes: my second shot is still a month away
[6:14:50] wizzkidnl: In the netherlands it is a tragedy
[6:14:54] madseed15: @Giantwaffle why u keep on ignoring the crafting terminal near the multi block LULW
[6:14:55] ItsOnMax: I will get my second dose on june 8 YEP
[6:14:56] celadriel23: im ugly af so i never minded wearing a mask
[6:14:59] roguetrooper2: eu and russia and iran wont let any vaccines in to their country unless they make it so exporting it may be harder but the other side like india or something might take it
[6:15:06] SavosDarkran: @polygonalperson likewise :D
[6:15:50] Syzygy50: Spend your nickels!
[6:16:06] Yemtron: buy airline stocks now D:
[6:16:16] strickyR: i've been to chicago and dallas during May and airports are back to normal
[6:16:17] ItsOnMax: @roguetrooper2 what?
[6:16:18] Yemtron: This is not financial advice. Kappa
[6:16:24] Exerion09: Going on a trip on Friday :D
[6:16:25] Schimmeldude: It's going to be a mess
[6:16:25] Wetware: I heard the cost of getting a flight has gone up dramatically recently
[6:16:37] strickyR: yes masks at all times except eating/drinking
[6:16:38] thebodge: I have flown recently. Masks are mandatory
[6:16:43] thebodge: on planes
[6:16:49] Jeksi: You can still get and spread Covid after vaccinated. You just don't die from it. So yes masks
[6:16:50] MervyTube: it's fine. recovering from, or dying from the virus basically has the same effect on herd immunity as getting the vaccine.
[6:16:51] lazermage24: CDC guidelines state that if vaccinated you dont need to wear a mask unless using mass transit i.e. trains planes
[6:16:51] mimicl: you ready to go on a cruise yet?
[6:16:51] diverse114: sweden is horrable with mask. Specially the higher you go
[6:16:52] ThatOnneGuy: Minneapolis and st paul still require masks but literally every other surrounding city is like "nah fuck it"
[6:16:54] strickyR: they serve the peanuts and a very limited drink menu on the plane. only 4 options
[6:17:20] Allmostdone: It almost like the airplane people were just waiting then put the price back up
[6:17:20] polygonalperson: I'm still gonna 100% wear a mask after being vaccinated-- masks are just way too convient.
[6:17:21] Yemtron: where are you going
[6:17:27] Schowzy: I literally booked a flight from Chicago to Sand Diego and it was only 300 bucks. Pretty average I think so.
[6:17:39] celadriel23: seasonal flu numbers were down something like 99%
[6:17:39] Schowzy: San Diego
[6:17:48] Yemtron: KomodoHype have fun
[6:17:59] dasmako: love masks
[6:18:06] Yemtron: eff you flu
[6:18:15] dasmako: just like other countries do HMMMM
[6:18:16] BadLa: monkaHmm
[6:18:18] Goldps1: haha ya right
[6:18:20] daemonaedryn: I really hope that becomes common
[6:18:21] madseed15: thats the point right LULW
[6:18:23] celadriel23: except people dont give a shit about anyone else
[6:18:24] CodyOrSomething: and because people didnt get tested for it lol
[6:18:33] paulpkpk: Work at home helps too
[6:18:35] DaGMC: maybe we will wear masks forever
[6:18:39] Schimmeldude: which shows: social distancing and wearing a mask can stop a pandemic and even the flu
[6:18:42] lDmanl: i work at an urgent care
[6:18:49] lDmanl: we haven't test for flu since before covid
[6:18:50] Yemtron: I was planning on licking doorknobs, but noooo.... the country ruined my plans
[6:18:57] BadLa: i had flu symptoms and only got covidd tested at er, that came up negative and they didnt test for lu
[6:18:58] Stretford_Sean: Not going to work when ill? what? LUL
[6:19:00] Allmostdone: Oh no. If you didn't go to work sick what would the American bushiness do
[6:19:11] FatOPanda: flu number were down because flu  is being miss identified as covid
[6:19:12] Moobot: Support Waffle by using his Epic creator code: Giantwaffle
[6:19:12] roguetrooper2: @ItsOnMax its crazy we tried to export the vaccines over to eu an iran and they sent it back saying they wont use it unless they make it how mad
[6:19:15] ItsOnMax: Yeah they suck
[6:19:24] Yemtron: Stubbed your toe? Must be covid Kappa
[6:19:26] dexdiman: Most republicans don't care about the evidence. You're taking away their decision to wear a mask by mandating it. So dumb.
[6:19:27] Nicolaimunkholm: I guess people all over the world should just use masks as they do in asia where if you feel ill put on a mask as respect for the people around you
[6:19:38] lazermage24: @roguetrooper2 We do the same thing when people try to import to the US
[6:19:41] dasmako: @Nicolaimunkholm same
[6:19:41] Schowzy: People are saying that covid is spreading because people aren't masking and SDing, but Flu is down 99% because people are masking and SDing. ???
[6:19:43] v_Vanil: that was first year i wasn't sick even one day
[6:19:50] Schimmeldude: friend of mine works in a pharmacy and he says they have lost customers last and this year because people stay healthier
[6:19:52] oxidexd: i've never felt so weak in my life when I had covid
[6:19:55] inorganic: I had COVID, and I can confirm it was worse than the vaccine
[6:20:00] DDonoven: my wife had covid for 6 hours. it was crazy
[6:20:01] B3rs: no
[6:20:08] roguetrooper2: iv had my jabs months ago
[6:20:08] celadriel23: covid is much more transmittable
[6:20:10] StOrMy1100: @Nicolaimunkholm I think in Asia they wear masks mostly because of the polluted air
[6:20:23] Fellwing94: Yeah having your lungs fill up with jello sounds pretty unpleasant
[6:20:24] bob_n47: I had covid couple moths ago, and now different smells are mutated for me. Any meat or eggs smells the same as a junk
[6:20:28] ItsOnMax: @roguetrooper2 I am not sure. Europe is jumping for vaccines, Unless you are talking about the russian vaccine. I can see why they turned that one down.
[6:20:30] celadriel23: or virologist
[6:20:30] Mandorake: Also kids not being in school for a long time would help keep the flu down
[6:20:39] daemonaedryn: And no chat, the facebook doctor claiming to be an expert isnt an immunologist
[6:20:48] ajwelcheck: You mean epidemiologist?
[6:20:48] mechoriet: @DaemonSzyman oh KEKW
[6:20:52] Allmostdone: Yea saw a lady who was one of the first 500 in her state way before the vaccine. Took over 6 months before she could move
[6:21:05] Nicolaimunkholm: @StOrMy1100 Also that but its also pretty normal if you have the sniffles or something to wear a mask so it isnt transferred to the people around you
[6:21:08] macdrai: You havent met my boss, this old boomer fuck
[6:21:08] complexprotein: Have a daughter in daycare, they are the #1 spreader of everything.
[6:21:23] Solitude411: ohio state is opening for the most part
[6:21:23] celadriel23: yes, kids are just small disease vectors
[6:21:24] dasmako: lolol
[6:21:37] ItsOnMax: NotLikeThis
[6:21:43] johnshepherd104: How do kids always find the dirt?
[6:21:43] celadriel23: when school goes back to 100% normal more people will get sick again
[6:21:47] DB4DKevin: @Giantwaffle you act like when school opened this year there wasn't an outbreak and there was
[6:21:57] Schimmeldude: that's how you grow a good immune system
[6:22:10] plattnotpratt: Student's in elementary to high school are back in AZ.
[6:22:11] roguetrooper2: kids and guys with beards
[6:22:16] Mythakos: Mythakos subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 33 months! 
[6:22:22] sogerr: i wonder how weak we got to normal diseases after so long being stuck at home without exposure to the outside world
[6:22:23] Goldps1: technical analysis hmm yes
[6:22:25] Adayics: @Giantwaffle Would you ever have your own kids Waffle or are you not wanting to raise kids?
[6:22:29] xxDeepThoughtxx: It is illegal in Iowa for schools to require proof of vaccine.
[6:22:30] i_W4tCH_i: Mans thinking he's looking at crypto
[6:22:30] mechoriet: atleast that whats everyone hopes to happen when re opening
[6:22:41] Allmostdone: oh yea. Remember anti vacer send their kids to your school too
[6:22:51] Yemtron: @xxDeepThoughtxx I mean it's medical history
[6:22:55] rissifrutti: @Giantwaffle do u know about CLUCOIN?
[6:22:56] Fellwing94: Yeah doubtless there will be a Christmas time spike
[6:22:58] i_W4tCH_i: Its now in a downtrend
[6:23:02] johnshepherd104: When you dont look at Crypto for three days, you are ready for Crypto
[6:23:08] i_W4tCH_i: will be in a bull
[6:23:11] Ycrems: then whos kids do you want?
[6:23:16] Ycrems: you gonna steal babies?
[6:23:23] daemonaedryn: Same
[6:23:28] dasmako: YEP
[6:23:30] dasmako: same
[6:23:32] celadriel23: i had to get vaccinated before i went to public school, and most colleges/universities require it
[6:23:32] BadLa: dog = kids KEKW
[6:23:42] Yemtron: Doesn't every generation feel that way lol
[6:23:45] celadriel23: so its asinine that these idiot legislatures are saying that places cannot rquire it
[6:23:47] Allmostdone: stealing a baby sound like WAY to much work
[6:23:48] roguetrooper2: there is to many people out there that wont take the vaccine so it could go up lol
[6:23:49] BetrayedZom: same 100%
[6:23:58] lazermage24: Every generation says the same shit all through time. That's not a logical argument for not having children.
[6:24:02] johnshepherd104: Yeah be an uncle
[6:24:03] complexprotein: Have a dog and cats, problem with the kid is we can't board her
[6:24:06] johnshepherd104: Let your brother deal with it
[6:24:07] Guydudeman3: spoil tf outta yo nephews
[6:24:09] madseed15: @Giantwaffle Learn to draw and have a vtuber daughter 5Head
[6:24:10] rissifrutti: Waffle, do u know about the CLUCOIN ? i just noticed it today
[6:24:11] JDoobs: A large majority of measurable statistics of the human condition are improving. Our kids will have it better than we do.
[6:24:13] xxDeepThoughtxx: @Yemtron   I know.  But our gov. signed it into law.
[6:24:21] Stegmurmulis: my gf was talking about kids so I got cat and she stoped! KEKW
[6:24:22] Adayics: I figured that. Dogs and cats are pretty rad tho @Giantwaffle  :P
[6:24:22] strickyR: hahaha "more interesting to hang around"
[6:24:26] daemonaedryn: Inscribe him into the crypto cult Kappa
[6:24:34] dogma802: @meilers It's because it's not FDA required and you can't sue anyone if you have any negative side effects as a result since you're technically opting into a testing phase
[6:24:41] Yemtron: @xxDeepThoughtxx Ah ok
[6:24:53] strickyR: oh no i totally understand what you mean. just thought it was funny commentary
[6:24:57] Allmostdone: @JDoobs That's not true in all places. The US is an example
[6:25:08] rabiat: All parents fuck up in some way or other, If you are worried about being a good parent going into it thats a pretty good start.
[6:25:09] madseed15: Hey remember ur uncle waffle

[6:25:35] Sxe_Ben: uncle touchy feely?
[6:25:36] JDoobs: @Allmostdone You'd have to cite a specific statistic, but yes, it is true.
[6:25:43] daemonaedryn: My uncle was also crazy, but not in the good way. Had like 6 kids with 3 different women in the span of like 7 years waffleD
