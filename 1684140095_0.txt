[1:00:12] Etwas77: i always put the speaker up when putting it down
[1:00:14] CoolReal: It includes the speackers
[1:00:42] JonathanLivingstonSeagull: is it complicated to replace?
[1:00:48] CoolReal: Still the best VR headset probably
[1:00:54] Venxuri: Pati is waiting in discord PauseChamp
[1:00:54] AllSham: should have bought 2
[1:01:03] TigerLuv: hope the Java thing fixes Pati's problem
[1:01:05] regslax17: speaking of speakers my headset is finally going out. idk what to get there are some really good options now
[1:01:09] Sinewave: Had the same issues with my old Logitech headsets, expensive headsets that all hinge on millimetres of plastic that ends up cracking despite the whole unit being useable. Switched to Sennheiser that don't have that issue.
[1:01:09] JonathanLivingstonSeagull: oh thats pretty cool, makes it really easy
[1:01:21] Slymph: I can handle it COPIUM
[1:01:22] Sinewave: Headphones have lasted me for so many years now.
[1:01:23] plzt: Did you buy 2 for when you break the first one?
[1:01:27] Gh3ttoboy: electrical engineer right
[1:01:27] Slymph: *orders a new one*
[1:01:42] whyando: I was gonna buy a headset in January, should I get an index?

[1:02:19] lunar_ish: just get a quest 2 for right now and a link cable
[1:02:24] lunar_ish: works great for a budget
[1:02:34] data_PC: quest 2 already has good wireless tbh
[1:02:36] jmm548: spend 4 ot 5 hundred for the quest 2
[1:02:48] data_PC: the battery just dies super fast
[1:02:54] Salerodis: htc vive gang
[1:03:00] MrMoneybagMan: making a basement

[1:03:03] LidlFrog: PauseChamp
[1:03:03] N3rvrackD: I won't get into VR until Wireless with reasonable performance
[1:03:04] Apparentthreat: peepoMine
[1:03:04] babyaddalyn: basement
[1:03:05] daemonaedryn: Patis being pati
[1:03:10] jmm548: unless your playing a game on the quest 2 its self then it runs fine
[1:03:14] N3rvrackD: Basement for power
[1:03:14] Slymph: Pat'im peepoPat
[1:03:24] lunar_ish: the wireless is alright on the quest 2 but you need to have a wifi 6 router and have it near by
[1:03:28] Dagmoo: peepoMine
[1:03:28] lunar_ish: nearby*
[1:03:40] lunar_ish: LInk cable is still far better for quality though
[1:03:45] satyasann: how long do you think you need to finish this modpack solo? with no afk overnights?
[1:04:08] jmm548: with link cable u can play stream vr games smoothly
[1:04:13] maccabeus: a few hundred hours probably satyasann
[1:04:13] Dagmoo: @satyasann i think ppl said 300 hrs
[1:04:15] Apparentthreat: trovertic wouldn't your PC need to support wifi 6 along w/ the quest ?
[1:04:16] hypnoshroom333: im looking into waffle calculating how much he will need processors pepeLaugh
[1:04:17] Venxuri: Wouldn't a crate be more 'universal' than a drawer? (above the alloy smelter) lol
[1:04:19] lunar_ish: you can go into the debug of the link cable and set all the bitrates to be forced max
[1:04:24] Reginoth: Pati in disc

[1:04:41] JonathanLivingstonSeagull: whats your most played vr game?
[1:04:43] traemonsta666: do you think the new valve headset will be heavy if its wireless?
[1:04:53] ninopanda: @Apparentthreat huh?
[1:04:59] Gh3ttoboy: @ras2709 with @piratepati
[1:05:02] stormblaz: will it be on pre order sale?
[1:05:08] ninopanda: @traemonsta666 its not that heavy

[1:06:29] fafuja: oh you still doing DJing?
[1:06:31] fafuja: cool
[1:06:48] Apparentthreat: trovertic lmao duh. 🤦󠀂♂️ my b. it still seems the quest 2 doesn't support 6e. perhaps a wifi 6 AP may still have more channels for more devices which would help
[1:06:50] PureSpider: i mean the quest 2 is not heavy, so i can't see why the new valve one would be heavier
[1:06:51] JonathanLivingstonSeagull: where do you perform?
[1:07:07] Gh3ttoboy: @jonathanlivingstonseagull in VRChat
[1:07:08] Hurtwolf: @JonathanLivingstonSeagull VRChat
[1:07:11] ninopanda: @traemonsta666 for the oculus it lasts about 6 to 8 hours of gaming.  but forever if i am wired in.
[1:07:16] JonathanLivingstonSeagull: ah ok
[1:07:37] babyaddalyn: its enuf you have 37
[1:07:38] PureSpider: nino, six to eight? do you have the battery strap?
[1:07:39] Apparentthreat: trovertic oh. it supports just "6" though? This is confusing NotLikeThis
[1:07:39] Moobot: You can find Waffle's Youtube channel here - https://youtube.com/giantwaffle
[1:07:41] lunar_ish: @Apparentthreat Yeah that should do the trick just fine, I use mine wirelessly every now and then with no issue with a setup like that
[1:07:43] Kyogerfan: waffle Pati is crying they miss you
[1:07:45] Pict1on: 37 < 36 ??
[1:07:47] akaCube: make macerator to double ore?
[1:07:49] imTymp: yea i just leave myself plugged in KEKW
[1:07:49] lunar_ish: @Apparentthreat no it does support 5
[1:07:55] Venxuri: Extruder is MV, you have a Lathe
[1:07:57] lunar_ish: @Apparentthreat 5 just looks and feels like shit
[1:07:57] kolbias_13: extruder is MV
[1:08:00] DeadMrEd: Could look better? Sure, but im of the mindset not to expect amazing quality from wireless->virtual desktop viewer, so i guess i dont look at picture quality that much @trovertic
[1:08:20] MrMoneybagMan: pati alone in discord Sadge
[1:08:22] GFQPR1882: Slight problem KEKW
[1:08:25] babyaddalyn: pati is in discord waffle

[1:08:44] Gh3ttoboy: @deadmred boy just wait untill we get deep dive helmets for VR stuff
[1:08:44] satyasann: you always tired Sadge
[1:08:49] lunar_ish: @DeadMrEd then your golden :)
[1:08:51] traemonsta666: @ninopanda but the new headset hes talking about. if its wireless have they said anything about battery life?
[1:09:07] NeonDactyl: ADF is azure data factory Kappa
[1:09:07] stormblaz: why no morning coffee? how did you made it through engenieering school
[1:09:09] DeadMrEd: @gh3ttoboy yee cant wait for that xd
[1:09:14] stormblaz: All Day Fuckery
[1:09:15] maccabeus: air defense fighter
[1:09:18] Stormflare: ADF is a new airframer
[1:09:20] Stormflare: ADF is a new airframe
[1:09:23] Tro95: Could you use AE2 to do all the crafting?
[1:09:26] Stormflare: whoops double post
[1:10:00] Gh3ttoboy: @deadmred maybe we could get that within 30 years
[1:10:14] officialhunterx: might wanna look at the drive recipe
[1:10:22] ninopanda: @traemonsta666 they have not right now
[1:10:52] kenpetto: @giantwaffle why not use the crafting calculator?
[1:11:00] Venxuri: Getting AE2 might be realistic, but for Autocrafting you will need to make Polyethelene, than mike be a day... 4-5 kind of thing
[1:11:01] lunar_ish: @Apparentthreat also just in case.. it does need to be a physical router. trying to use a wifi 6 dongle and hotspot off you pc does not work and will cause more issues than doing wifi 5
[1:11:15] Arthur_Jan: theres a balancing button inside of the creating table
[1:11:24] MrMoneybagMan: are u still using 2 ingots per plate?
[1:11:37] Tweeton: they've got a bender to be 1 per plate
[1:11:51] Gh3ttoboy: @mrmoneybagman he uses the plate bender
[1:12:05] traemonsta666: @ninopanda gotcha gotcha if they can match 8 hours with that video quality and same weight im sold lol, hoping for the best. thought i missed something
[1:12:09] Apparentthreat: trovertic oh really? just cuz of latency? I was wondering if someone tethers their quest 2 to their PC w/ the link thing, does the headset still lose charge? I wouldn't think USB ports could supply enough power to maintain charge
[1:12:11] Soul12eaver: dont you guys have the mold thing for 1:1 plates?

[1:12:40] stormblaz: so much upkeep
[1:12:47] ninopanda: @traemonsta666 yeah i cant wait to see the specs
[1:13:06] Gh3ttoboy: so chat is the patreon server in space yet
[1:13:11] Zapper_777: second cluster
[1:13:21] zero3juan: @flixtwix they forgot to chunk load overnight...
[1:13:23] Tro95: Whenever I need copper I just take it from the telephone poles
[1:13:24] LaredoLarry: rip space bar
[1:13:28] stormblaz: urinate
[1:13:28] Zapper_777: not the close one, the one over
[1:13:28] imTymp: those stairs KEKW
[1:13:31] Trip6FlipYoBic: @FlixTwix Just Waffle realizing he didn't chunk load the base before logging last night.
[1:13:33] lunar_ish: @Apparentthreat exactly that, it's almost unusable that way. I thought the same thing out first.  so... here is the thing about the link cable. it's quite fucky with that

[1:14:43] ninopanda: KKona Crew is almost on MV power
[1:14:57] lunar_ish: @Apparentthreat if you do usb-c to usb-c it will lose charge quite quickly. BUT if like in my case and you have a usb extension and use a usb 3.0 to usb-c converter it will hold the charge almost forever
[1:15:07] nothenewmemeguy: Did you lose the scanner?
[1:15:20] Venxuri: If only you created a waypoint Kappa
[1:15:27] stormblaz: Did making an F-16 considered an engenieering challenge, or eng marble
[1:15:30] Apparentthreat: trovertic like a powered extension?
[1:15:31] ninopanda: @traemonsta666 yeah I am on the oculus and am looking at upgrading once I move into a bigger house
[1:15:39] stormblaz: seemd like a lot of brain power went into making a f-16
[1:15:47] lunar_ish: @Apparentthreat so... oddly enough optimal use is a usb extnesion into a converter into a link cable into your headset.
[1:15:48] Moobot: You can sub to Waffle by clicking this neat link -> twitch.tv/giantwaffle/subscribe SUBprise
[1:16:39] Venxuri: its probably above you
[1:16:42] TheBonBon_: Check waypoints
[1:16:44] Ras2709: its above
[1:16:57] Apparentthreat: trovertic i mean that would make sense if the extender is powered and happens to provide the minimum v and amps. I bet there are some other extenders out there that aren't providing the minimum
[1:17:02] lunar_ish: @Apparentthreat yeah pretty much. usb 3.0/2.0 provides more power than a usb-c so it acts like a middle man to supply extra power or some shit like that
[1:17:05] xxRodeo: its at the top
[1:17:11] Apparentthreat: oh
[1:17:23] lunar_ish: @Apparentthreat and no I mean straight from the computer, not a powered extention
[1:17:25] Major_Panek: by the lava at the redstone vein
[1:17:29] VyleStyle: imagine playing this mod with colorblindness and all those ore colors
[1:17:31] Apparentthreat: trovertic gotcha.
[1:17:33] traemonsta666: @ninopanda you dont have a full room dedicated to vr yet? smh (neither do i, still gotta tuck my chair under my desk securly)
[1:17:35] stormblaz: Why is there soooo much reddtone????
[1:17:40] ninopanda: usually higher up
[1:17:46] lunar_ish: @Apparentthreat extension, absolutely no clue why it works that way but it does.
[1:17:46] kenshin2666: according to google its "kal-co-pyrite"
[1:17:51] TheBonBon_: I think you have a waypoint for the copper
[1:18:00] stormblaz: you got a red stone heavy seed
[1:18:03] KavokCollective: you were looking at the y-levels for the moon not the overworld weren't you?
[1:18:07] Filikeu: You found it yesterday it had a huge lava lake
[1:18:17] Gh3ttoboy: so how hard is a quarry to make
[1:18:37] lunar_ish: @Apparentthreat for the converter Im just using one I got off amazon from cable mod, usb 3.0 male to usb-c female
[1:18:40] JonathanLivingstonSeagull: will you eventually have a quarry?
[1:18:44] ninopanda: @traemonsta666 yeah my room is a shared computer room, its a bit tight for some VR.  in the new house we are looking to make a VR room separate from the computer room.
[1:18:56] stormblaz: Is Runescape true wherr you find tin there is copper?
[1:19:13] lunar_ish: @Apparentthreat and then the official link cable to the headset
[1:19:19] PureSpider: it only goes away once you mined the entire vein
[1:19:22] snorix: isn't the numbers right next to the name mean the level it is at?
[1:19:29] lazyhot: lazyhot subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 7 months, currently on a 7 month streak! A new minecraft series NICE!
[1:19:36] Bunjimus: wasnt it down by the lava and diamonds?
[1:19:46] minecraftsand__: if you had to select between noita and potion craft, what would you take?
[1:19:46] pufflefump: Is it not the dark red ore?
[1:19:46] zero3juan: time to dig a shaft
[1:19:54] Ras2709: @Giantwaffle maybe go to the top number and dig downwards?
[1:20:03] KavokCollective: thats the y-level for the moon isn't it?
[1:20:07] Wolframpage: it might be better to just run around on the surface and find another vein. Then just dig straight down till you find it
[1:20:12] TOCO__: cool cool, pity it doesnt work
[1:20:13] Wingy_: You're looking at the wrong vein in JEI
[1:20:27] Knightishift: you looked the worng ore in jei
[1:20:28] lilgangstagoth1: its higher up
[1:20:35] traemonsta666: @ninopanda youre talking about things i dream of, hope you and me both get it lol
[1:20:36] snorix: and are you sure you are checking the overworld spawns?
[1:20:44] i_am_davis: i thought you had a copper waypoint

[1:35:23] InternetPlumber: when I lived downtown my rent was 1200/mo and the parking space was 400/mo more
[1:35:37] ThatOnneGuy: Parking ramps in downtown st paul charge $2/hr, and a lot of people rent a spot and you have to pay for the entire month, so they'd be paying about $15/day. That's $450/month... for a parking space close to work
[1:35:38] macdrai: imagine, a parking space has more economic value than a human
[1:35:39] Zoinx: wtf, we pay 60$ for a parking space where I live pretty centrally in Stockholm

[3:46:20] Nilau: Oh I need 2000 motors, lets go AE!
[3:46:29] ReedS77: @thebubbajones1 Correct but that doesn't mean its not taxxed. If the driver was audited and found to not pay taxes on their cash tips they could be responsible for repaying them or going to prison

[5:26:32] Peeeeeeeeeep: @dagmoo probably the best option. I enjoy just going with the flow as well. I like having a rough idea of what I'd like to do, but not scheduling anything. that's why I could never do a tour group vacation or anything like that

[5:54:54] CyberParzival: yee
[5:54:55] TheWonderLlama: Chupacabra
[5:54:57] Tompop23: Really wanted to make your mum joke lol

[5:55:32] Venxuri: oh the most expensive alloy joke LULW that was a good one
[5:56:11] Dagmoo: @lvyeartman is it for doping like gallium? am i remembering correctly
[5:56:49] kenshin2666: six teen dust?
[5:56:50] 0omkins: Chlorophyl...more like BOROPHYL
[5:57:03] Dagmoo: i could be wrong i was a bad student LUL
[5:57:30] Movinggun1: Is the word solder spelt different in american, whenever I hear an american say it I get confused.
[5:57:51] coolcake2: sau-ter
[5:57:53] Apparentthreat: Movinggun1 no
[5:57:56] RationalLies: @Movinggun1 nope. that's how we spell it too. idk why we say sodder
[5:57:59] Dagmoo: apparently "PV manufacturers began to replace boron doping with gallium around 2019"
[5:58:00] lvyEartman: i am not sure i was just quoting wiki, but searched for it before when we found traces of it where i worked
[5:58:01] LiveType: yep boron and phosphorous for p and n type doping
[5:58:06] Stragmol: see kids, pay attention in school you never know when you're playing a game and might need the info.  LUL
[5:58:21] Raffataff: Pronounce "Soldier"
[5:58:28] IlsaGold: Sodder? I just met her.
[5:58:29] N3rvrackD: Your talking to mah boy all wrong!! do it again i'll stab you in the face with a soldering iron!
[5:58:31] xDeadBringerx: @Giantwaffle Gallium doping is getting more common for solar panel production. Boron undergoes boron-oxygen complexes under sunlight causing light induced degradation.
[5:58:33] okuumu: gallium apparently can be used in doping pvs for better cell lifetimes
[5:58:46] Dagmoo: i feel smart :)

[5:59:34] ToaVee: What was the waste like from that fusion experiment?
[5:59:38] Raffataff: @Movinggun1 It makes sense because that's how it's spelled/ pronounced LUL
[5:59:43] xDeadBringerx: Gallium doping solar panels was under patent until two years ago, hence it wasn't used a lot
[5:59:45] LiveType: We're not. It's manufacturing that's getting cheaper not the fundamental technology.

[6:00:00] WoofWoofDude: pretty sure we aren't running out of fossil fuel any time soon. But we should keep it for where it's not possible to use something else
[6:00:02] WoofWoofDude: liek planes
[6:00:02] AmoArman: isn't fusion the future
[6:00:08] jo_beorn: @Giantwaffle why does pati keep leaving and joining the server again
[6:00:26] Derek_LastName: yes fusion should be future but it is not a super close future

[6:00:33] sprockettes: fusion has been 20 years away every year for the last 20 years
[6:00:33] theszechuanslinger: @lvyEartman they have a theoretical limit on effeciency anyway

[6:01:10] lvyEartman: the cost of photovoltaic cells that's needed to generate solar power drops by 20% with each doubling of global manufacturing capacity. It's moore's law equivalent, but it's from 1977 to 2014...

[6:01:29] Smithii: Some promising results with fusion lately: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-5bNFg50KU
[6:01:32] Kasify: it’s just unfortunate that we’ve still be using fossil fuels for the pat decade knowing they’re finite / dwindling and there hasn’t been more genuine focus on completely switching energy sources as humans
[6:01:33] coolcake2: @Giantwaffle quantum tunneling already happens for current sizes
[6:01:36] RationalLies: Just make quantum tunneling a part of the calculations Keepo
[6:01:36] coolcake2: they work around that
[6:01:38] LiveType: Fusion will have the same issues as fission nuclear. It's too expensive.
[6:01:39] ToaVee: electron smear smh
[6:01:41] Blitzonite: you can, you just need to make some changes to how they function
[6:01:44] jo_beorn: @Smithii  yeah thats what i was talking ab
[6:01:56] 1killersquirrel: electromagnetism works weird at those levels of nanotransistors
[6:02:03] kenshin2666: index out of bounds error?
[6:02:17] allking4: Fusion wont be any different from fission. Oil companies will prevent them from being constructed until the earth dies from CO2
[6:02:30] LiveType: Gaafets are endgame transistors and will be perfected around the start of the next decade. Only scaling option is then to go 3d

[6:03:58] AlfaAnanas: is this game like God of War?
[6:04:03] kenshin2666: try possibly getting pati to lower his render distance to start with to see if that helps if he has it at a high distance
[6:04:05] Apparentthreat: AlfaAnanas ya
[6:04:06] 1axt1: did you already watch doshes space exploration video?
[6:04:10] LiveType: @lvyEartman Hard to say, but have you seen how cheap you can get solar these days? Nuclear isn't popular because it takes so long to build that governments change by the time it finishes and cancel it. It's happened multiple times.
[6:04:15] theszechuanslinger: @AlfaAnanas it's actually exactly the same
[6:04:16] superTrippie: factorio when?
[6:04:18] Kasify: i don’t wanna spend my 60’s in an apocalyptic era lol
[6:04:26] Orodude: @AlfaAnanas this is actual the sequel to GoW: Ragnarok
[6:04:30] Apparentthreat: 1axt1 I don't think he has, at least not on stream
[6:04:35] Dagmoo: @kasify yeah i mean if you generously say they live 30 more years, things might be uncomfortable but probably not apocalyptic yet
[6:04:36] TytuxTv: im hyped for the factorio DLC
[6:04:39] jo_beorn: Yeah they said 10 years ago that we will run out of fossil fuels this century.. then we found about double or triple the amount we thought was available.
[6:04:40] allking4: I got bad news on that front, 2050s onward are going to be misery for most
[6:04:46] jo_beorn: so next century? until we find more.
[6:05:08] Dagmoo: @kasify i fully agree with you btw :)
[6:05:23] Kasify: @dagmoo hopefully not, you’ve got more optimism surrounding the choices of our peers than i do for sure haha — thanks for the chat too
[6:05:28] LegacyOfPain: i've never played factorio. is it GOAT?
[6:05:40] InTheLittlePro: Isnt factorio an old ass game? what could they add with dlc that not already modded
[6:05:53] AlfaAnanas: is God of War your first?
[6:05:57] Kerold: FeelsWeirdMan
[6:05:58] Novaltv: it is
[6:06:00] Dodara87: pirated a long time ago LUL
[6:06:01] aeadon: and it never goes on sale, so no reason to wait
[6:06:02] Apparentthreat: AlfaAnanas how'd you know?
[6:06:03] LiveType: @jo_beorn Eh, it's not so much the raw amount. It's the amount that's economically viable to extract. This is where new technologies come into play. Fracking was the new game changer of the past decade. Then you need to find a new technology
[6:06:04] PliusInfo: true NODDERS
[6:06:10] Chris_Cross_Crash: I've been playing Satisfactory like crazy after watching you stream it @Giantwaffle
[6:06:10] TytuxTv: yep 1k h here
[6:06:11] AlfaAnanas: @Apparentthreat i like God of War
[6:06:12] MoellerPoeller: Literally one of the games of all time
[6:06:13] xindianx: what about satisfactory?
[6:06:13] Jhreks: and then you find out you can mod factorio KEKW
[6:06:25] LegacyOfPain: high praise. I will pick it up after Christmas. What are you other top 4 games?
[6:06:29] PliusInfo: Jhreks KEKW
[6:06:32] lvyEartman: @livetype Its true what you say but it is because meeting the requirements which are new, when you ahve a blueprint, it will get cheaper. Even in comparisson with solar
[6:06:44] langhoff1: cant you mod terraria xD
[6:06:48] Novaltv: what about firewatch?
[6:06:51] lvyEartman: @livetype if you build more of em
[6:06:52] 0omkins: Great question what are your other 3 top games huh?
[6:06:54] Apparentthreat: LegacyOfPain MC, KSP, .... Lost Ark Kappa
[6:06:54] Synnoc: factorio, terraria, minecraft are my top three "insane value for the price" games ever
[6:06:58] swappan: yea pyanodons mod for factorio is as crazy as this minecraft mod
[6:07:15] Lord_Royalty: "basic"
[6:07:18] Tapeman83: KEKW
[6:07:24] Nexhunter: HUH why we doing MC
[6:07:26] Kerold: It's easy, just craft it NODDERS
[6:07:31] SeaOfMadness_: oil power tho
[6:07:32] Nexhunter: there are falcons to fly
[6:07:33] InTheLittlePro: holy shit bro this is just like immagine its IRL now make it
[6:07:34] Apparentthreat: Nexhunter HUH
[6:07:34] LiveType: @lvyEartman Very true. Solar and wind can never replace oil. Ever. Not without massive extremely unlikely changes to the grid.
[6:07:39] xDeadBringerx: Waffle is there for Quest Progression, Pati for Tech Progression LUL
[6:07:40] Dagmoo: chat i love you all that we can have intelligent conversations widepeepoHappy
[6:07:45] jo_beorn: @LiveType economics dont really matter to the industry that quite literally runs the entire planet.  They decide the market.  Global currency is quite literally oil.
[6:07:47] dennis3833: maybe semi-auto crafting first?
[6:08:03] DB4DKevin: are my cable bein weird or is there a special way to put down gregtech cables bc they aren't attaching to machines?

[6:08:23] CommanderUrsus: @DB4DKevin, you need to wrench it
[6:08:23] Trip6FlipYoBic: We should just fusion power everything already.
[6:08:27] coolcake2: can we have more bio plastics that would get viable? Like we have PLA...
[6:08:29] Nexhunter: @Trip6FlipYoBic soon tm
[6:08:29] drsnaki96: @DB4DKevin use a wire cutter on them
[6:08:30] Apparentthreat: Big Oil has entered chat
[6:08:34] Jhreks: when we have good batteries it will change everything

[6:08:48] warmwalrus: COPIUM
[6:08:50] Best_of_Strategie: you can make polymer out of sugar cane
[6:08:52] Nexhunter: oh human timescale oil is fucked KEKW
[6:08:54] dylan0806: And oil is still the densest energy
[6:08:59] Trip6FlipYoBic: @Nexhunter Prayge
[6:09:01] Dodara87: you can make plastic from plant surely??
[6:09:04] JimmyWelsh: JimmyWelsh subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 15 months! 
[6:09:10] CMDR_WeeJet: people against wind seem to not know we can store the wind power exess to use when its not windy so they think renewables cant work
[6:09:11] Shank_nasty: Oil doesn’t make up much of electricity generation. Natural gas is about 60%.
[6:09:13] coolcake2: E=MC^2
[6:09:13] Captain_Rax: cant wait for 40k time line where everything is made out of metal
[6:09:14] Orodude: fission is definitely more dense than oil
[6:09:14] dylan0806: Safest
[6:09:15] xDeadBringerx: Fision right now is way more dense
[6:09:16] Pilgrim_age: @Best_of_Strategie so replace more food space for industry?
[6:09:17] Nexhunter: oil energy density is not dense when we can split the atom KEKW
[6:09:17] Smithii: We are gonna' be the plastic boomers KEKW
[6:09:19] allking4: We dont have to run out is the problem, we just have to run out of CHEAP oil. Imagine gas consistently at 10$+ a gallon
[6:09:32] Nexhunter: nuclear is much more safe when not given to lowest bidder KEKW
[6:09:37] fafuja: ^
[6:09:37] CommanderUrsus: how is plutonium any more 'sustainable' though
[6:09:42] SpiderQueen7202: Coal plants do put out radiation tho
[6:09:44] LiveType: @Nexhunter Facts
[6:09:44] Kisheen: Petrochem/coal does actually emit a lot of radiation from their byproducts
[6:09:45] CommanderUrsus: still gotta dig it out of the ground
[6:09:46] Stormflare: the problem with wind and solar as well is they cannot react quickly to changing demand on the grid. you can easily burn more fossil fuel and generate more power in a couple minutes if load is high. can't with solar/wind with current storage tech
[6:09:47] Best_of_Strategie: @Pilgrim_age  i dont say what is right but its an option
[6:09:48] Nexhunter: oh no radiation is a byproduct of oil burning KEKW
[6:09:49] Smithii: Coal plants apparently emit tons of radiation
[6:09:52] ninopanda: @nexhunter what to see a funny video?
[6:09:53] drsnaki96: surelly not as dense as my head

[6:10:12] Chilled_Voodoo: he's just butthurt that he won't get to smell oil at the station

[6:10:15] ninopanda: #pokemon in kkona server
[6:10:15] ToaVee: space mining, I'll get right on it
[6:10:15] xDeadBringerx: I'd rather see massive steps being taken in Thorium based nuclear energy. A lot safer than the Uranium and Plutonium decay chains.
[6:10:19] moot411: yes but this is why us chemical engineers get the big bucks
[6:10:21] Nexhunter: @ninopanda Susge
[6:10:25] xDeadBringerx: It's also way more abundant than Uranium
[6:10:27] bismarcksd: Don't tell that to the asteroid miners
[6:10:30] Tompop23: That’s why we need to mine the asteroids
