[2:52:38] Minelmonia: Isnt it the same for VR nowadays?
[2:52:39] stormblaz: 250mil pays the marketing maybe
[2:52:40] Dizz1227: i belive it was 1.2 billion
[2:52:41] oxidexd: @Giantwaffle was that FOR ALL the sequals?
[2:52:41] aepervius: the rest is marketing.

[2:53:27] ohbi78: time for a drawer key?
[2:53:28] Bwangoh: Yeah but according to google, the movie will have to break 2 billion to break even. @Giantwaffle Just found that
[2:53:28] i3arry1993: @Giantwaffle no it was 250m
[2:53:37] Kenji_QQ: the 2 billion number is what it needs to gross to break even, not the cost
[2:53:40] natsu130: @GFQPR1882 yeah the don't make 3D TV anymore :D
[2:53:41] Fluffymagicman: @satyasann I think it's because the original was just boring tbh
[2:53:41] i3arry1993: just looked it up
[2:53:44] Cleversided: Yes it is
[2:53:47] VikashPindoria: but they filmed 3 too
[2:53:53] Sacratoy: There's some wacky accounting going on
[2:53:57] Battle_Crow: maybe 250m for the actor budget

[2:54:08] cansley123: googleis lying
[2:54:08] Zenimer: Variety reports that Disney put in 350 million.
[2:54:09] Otige: The budget was 350 million and they said they need to make 2 billion to make a profit
[2:54:10] mrtraxx: it's not 250mil
[2:54:10] Bwangoh: No It is 2 billion to break even. That was what they wanted it to be
[2:54:12] FrostedSentry: We spent almost 200 million on marketing one of the movies I worked on... and it was nothing close to the scale of avatar
[2:54:15] LordDusk: @slyjedi HBO is putting movies on HBO Max 45 days after cinema release. They've done the same with Fantastic Beasts 3, and with Batman.
[2:54:19] Cleversided: nah time magazine
[2:54:21] verysleepyexe: @roxidas LUL dude
[2:54:21] Venxuri: you just voided it all KEKW

[2:54:25] DonMerkuzio: @Giantwaffle 'Avatar: The Way of Water' needs $2 billion at box office to break even, says director James Cameron.
[2:54:26] Chilled_Voodoo: are you just watching interviews and believing that?
[2:54:26] LokiRulez: holllyword reporter said 350-400 million, the actual number isnt public yet @Giantwaffle
[2:54:27] count3rnova: LUL
[2:54:27] Tweeton: welp... there went all the cobble into the void
[2:54:30] TooFlyBry: Definitely not 2 bn

[2:54:36] DX_Plates: All 4 sequals are 1 billion total
[2:54:37] pattttx: Time said 350 mil.
[2:54:39] Manacaym: 350m based on what times says

[2:54:45] versoto: ‘Avatar: The Way of Water’ needs $2 billion at box office to break even, says director James Cameron
[2:54:45] Manacaym: and thats from disney
[2:54:46] cazabel: There is no publicly available, definitive answer as to the exact dollar amount, but overall, the film is reported to have cost Disney $350 million, according to Variety
[2:54:47] Drakos_aka_Mar: read an article that says probably 400 mil
[2:54:47] Bwangoh: It is 2 billion.
[2:54:48] Dizz1227: "Early reports have claimed the production budget alone was in the $250 million range, but director James Cameron isn’t willing to give a hard number just yet. The only answer Cameron would give about the sequel’s budget when asked by GQ magazine was the following: “Very fucking [expensive].”
[2:54:49] Venxuri: yea I know, still funny tho
[2:54:51] slyjedi: Ahh ok.  Didn’t know black Adam was part of it.
[2:54:54] LegacyOfPain: Budget is between 350 million and 400 million
[2:54:57] DonMerkuzio: 'Avatar: The Way of Water' needs $2 billion at box office to break even, says director James Cameron.
[2:55:03] Tweeton: how many 9x compressed cobble we gonna need for this?
[2:55:03] Bwangoh: I just found the other article stating that they need to make 2 billion to be profitable
[2:55:03] Beufff: it seems like disney bought the rights for avatar for 2 billion so they need avatar to pass that in order to break even on the aquisition? cost to film $350M
[2:55:05] wr1th3: Chat, 100k VCPUS on AWS running for about 48 hours is 200k, and movies use alot more than that sometimes, the costs get very high
[2:55:08] 0ddR: the  real question is..... is it any good?
[2:55:08] markusla2: markusla2 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 67 months! 
[2:55:08] GFQPR1882: Budget/cost are to different things KEKW
[2:55:09] stormblaz: There is no publicly available, definitive answer as to the exact dollar amount, but overall, the film is reported to have cost Disney $350 million, according to Variety.
[2:55:09] kenshin2666: "you just voided the most easily accessible resource in the game" LUL
[2:55:10] dylan0806: Make a compressed drawer?
[2:55:14] KoniQ111: 400M
[2:55:15] jmurrayto: Difference between production costs and the costs to get movie played in theatres...
[2:55:17] i3arry1993: first one made 2.5b world wide
[2:55:19] IronGajeel: 356m
[2:55:19] Vasatsar: how do these companies get this kind of money, do they go to the bank for a loan?
[2:55:20] cazabel: that title belongs to Disney’s Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides, which cost $379 million. Second place goes to Avengers: Age of Ultron, which rang in at $365 million, and third belongs to Avengers: Endgame, costing Marvel (well, Disney) $356 million.
[2:55:21] n00rman_: pirates and endgame was more expensive apparently
[2:55:22] n3pykstonks: who cares
[2:55:24] stormblaz: Pirates of carribean still costed more lol
[2:55:30] Aeliel_: 356 million for endgame
[2:55:31] Larklen: Endgame: $356–400 million
[2:55:32] LokiRulez: 356 million i think give or take
[2:55:33] LegacyOfPain: There is no way Avatar 2 is going to hit 1 billion.
[2:55:34] Zenimer: Disney didn’t spend 2billion dollars.   There’s no way any movie studio would shell out that much.
[2:55:42] Asdcrawl: Asdcrawl subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 49 months! 
[2:55:43] LordDusk: @slyjedi It also made ~390 million dollars, which for a side DC movie, is pretty damn good...
[2:55:46] Manacaym: @Giantwaffle the reported combined budget for the next three movies is a whopping $1 billion
[2:55:51] Frodosc1: who else are on the server?
[2:55:51] jmurrayto: If $2bn needed to break even, that's covering theatre overhead, marketing, distribution, etc.
[2:55:53] Dizz1227: I assume that there is a difference in production budget and the budget they spent researching and creating the technology to make the CGI
[2:55:54] Manacaym: from times
[2:55:57] shimon128: With an estimated budget of $350–460 million
[2:56:04] 19rhys: pati earring rn LUL
[2:56:10] stormblaz: movie budget doesnt account for a lot of otjer costs
[2:56:10] DX_Plates: The large numbers reported in interviews include IP costs not actual filming costs.

[3:02:47] ForgottenTime: Unfollowed universal and the whole franchise
[3:02:49] Warkless: 0ticked pistons

[3:03:13] gingerrsss: phantom power
[3:03:14] i3arry1993: @ForgottenTime hes not doing it because they let go of the one guy that played superman
[3:03:18] CoolReal: You could place the observers on top of the sugarcane
[3:03:25] 0x4273: use ender io redstone conduit

[3:03:35] Battle_Crow: use a redtone torch
[3:03:36] yunireverse: repeater to delay it?
[3:03:36] Yakobro: @Giantwaffle 2 observers facing each other is what I did
[3:03:56] thejokercards: I’m pretty sure you don’t need the piston to push a block, you just need a piston to break the sugar cane
[3:04:11] maimvice13: just use the existing clock
[3:04:16] Larklen: KEKW
[3:04:29] i3arry1993: @ForgottenTime black Adam was going to be like batman vr suprman but black adam vr super man

[3:04:52] ohbi78: janky
[3:04:55] kenshin2666: why break it with blocks on pistons, instead of just the pistons?

[3:06:22] 0x4273: hoppers work okay until you get to autoclaves
[3:06:35] kenshin2666: put the snad redstone behind the sugar cane, then use water to just flow the broken sugar cane to 1 block location?
[3:06:37] ShionSinX: minecart with hopped going back and forth Kappa

[3:13:26] CoolReal: It's java 8
[3:13:27] Apparentthreat: @giantwaffle curseforge uses openjdk
[3:13:27] Dodara87: kekw
[3:13:28] snurre: 1.8 is 8
[3:13:31] AshhanX: need java 16
[3:13:32] LokiRulez: that is 8
[3:13:34] dontb4nmeplz: I’m running 18
[3:13:36] BurnedAether: java 17 or 18
[3:13:37] KoniQ111: 17
[3:13:44] 0x4273: yes
[3:13:44] Jibbur: minecraft used a super old JAVA until around 1.15 IIRC
[3:13:45] CoolReal: 1.12.2 runs on 1.8
[3:13:46] ninopanda: ok he shouldn't be having that error then
[3:13:50] Apparentthreat: If you open task manager you’ll see what it’s using
[3:13:54] RigiTv: 19 is latest I believe, but probably need 16-17ish

[3:14:17] CoolReal: This pack doesnt use much RAM, 6 is way enough
[3:14:20] etherz10: @Giantwaffle Kudos, your DnB set is sick -- any chance of a set list?
[3:14:26] Watertoad: if you allocate to many it can be bad too
[3:14:26] GFQPR1882: KEKW
[3:14:30] weightmaker: top-right in F3 shows java version
[3:14:38] Allmostdone: it should say "why the hell would you have java installed"
[3:14:40] Zapper_777: I run 8 with mod packs
[3:14:44] Apparentthreat: @piratepati open task manager and look at that java is running towards the top.
[3:14:45] GFQPR1882: all the GIGS
[3:14:46] mahoraz: really? because alot of the modpacks dont even run with less than 6gb
[3:14:48] fionera: @Giantwaffle That depends on the gc thats enabled. With ZGC on Java 17 its fine. I run Confluence with like 32GB of heap xD
[3:14:50] officialhunterx: keep in mind you have ddr5
[3:14:51] Jibbur: pretty sure minecraft 1.12 used Java 1.8

[3:51:22] DaddyDiddy: @Venxuri yeah same, i'm playing on a server with teams racing against each other to finish the pack and one of the rules was no void, so we had to build actual bases, so i built into a ravine lol

[3:51:30] Tapeman83: Yeah, I legit only used EnderIO and that one Logistics mod during my playthrough

[3:52:58] Aeliel_: you could make it with chest loot
[3:53:01] Placidemu: It can be found easily in chests in Lost Cities

[3:53:50] Vovosunt: where will you get XP from?
[3:53:54] Tapeman83: yeah, and once you get DML up, experience isn't a problem ever again

[3:56:51] TheWonderLlama: Right here o/
[3:56:52] kenshin2666: minecraft uses your alexa to listen to audio and when it hears you talk about specific things it removes them from the game for you

[4:05:10] noxiiiouse: do it no reason not to i think
[4:05:24] Tapeman83: yeah you need graphite

[4:06:51] DaddyDiddy: oh don't get me started, before tank i just looked at my ME system and just saw all my resources just dwindling down and it was very sad lol @Tapeman83
[4:06:53] Venxuri: @DaddyDiddy I dont really care for the debate if they complete it in 2 weeks or not, as long as they even get around to endgame and actually enjoy it instead of feeling burnout
[4:07:06] Tapeman83: true
[4:07:12] DaddyDiddy: yeah true my favorite part of the pack is the progression
[4:07:12] TigerLuv: no cows at the village?

[4:07:48] Tapeman83: you can also just go to the overworld with a cake
[4:07:49] DaddyDiddy: yeah nomicoins are infinite
[4:07:54] DaddyDiddy: which is why you just spend all of them
[4:08:01] Venxuri: you can just go back to lost cities and grab them in a soul vial or smth like that, you're not locked to the void
[4:08:01] ohbi78: hes in the overworld already @Tapeman83
[4:08:14] Tapeman83: i know, i'm saying if you were playing in a void world @ohbi78
[4:08:18] DaddyDiddy: @ohbi78 nah the regular overworld, he's in the lost cities technically
[4:08:39] ohbi78: its generated cities in the overworld
[4:08:53] ohbi78: you dont spawn in that dimension
[4:09:34] DaddyDiddy: hmm maybe that was a different version of this pack, because i remember being able to go between the two, but yeah they probably changed that in ceu
[4:09:39] Venxuri: make a stack of them lol

They've broken or outright ignored just about every international deal they've ever made, so why try and hold anyone to those promises, especially if Russia no longer considers itself the USSR
[5:45:34] SubbDogg: @piiixxx as a citizen from the border I would love to have more guarantees against the country who has invaded us multiple times in history peepoPooPoo

[6:07:11] SirNickGaming: One generates steam for the other two
[6:07:13] Venxuri: Augment
[6:07:13] lvyEartman: its empty
[6:07:14] ohbi78: they have an upgrade in it
[6:07:16] Arr0wKey: No RF
[6:07:18] TheWonderLlama: Broke it PepeHands
[6:07:20] mrtraxx: also can't you use sugarcane for your Furnaces?  dont need coal anymore
[6:07:23] Pwsed: that one generates steam
[6:07:30] ShuxDC: when it eventually overflows its stuff that you've dropped that's clogging it. Should filter the vacuum when you can
[6:07:35] Glennox2009: boiler
[6:07:38] undeniablyrexer: that's wrong
[6:07:44] undeniablyrexer: pati's setup was right
[6:07:49] ygaum: I miss Ender IO
[6:07:51] Larklen: NOTED
[6:08:05] iLu_786: LUL
[6:08:06] Glennox2009: @Giantwaffle that is the boiler and provides steam the other two
[6:08:06] bobolpwnz: the middle one makes steam that other two consume
[6:08:10] akaCube: Destroyed working Setup LUL
[6:08:12] b0ltz12: only needs steam
[6:08:13] ohbi78: you have to put the middle ones steam into the other two
[6:08:18] SirNickGaming: THe middle one burns and makes steam for the other two
[6:08:19] drsnaki96: pepeLaugh
[6:08:21] b0ltz12: you pipe the steam into the other dynamos
[6:08:31] 19rhys: no water in the other two?
[6:08:35] ohbi78: theres a quest chain for it
[6:08:48] Glennox2009: look at the augments
[6:09:03] LambdaRail: "quirky"
[6:09:05] b0ltz12: I think 1 boiler, makes enough steam to power 3 dynamos if its default
[6:09:09] Dantesaur: I'm not like other dynamos
[6:09:11] ohbi78: its a 1 steam generator to 2 steam consumers ratio
[6:09:22] drsnaki96: also water generator can auto output water
[6:09:22] lvyEartman: the pressurised conduit was for the steam i guess
[6:09:45] lvyEartman: so it was a nice efficent set-up that you destroyed
[6:10:06] ohbi78: sorted
[6:10:37] ohbi78: they have different augments in
[6:10:42] bobolpwnz: they have different augments installed
[6:10:44] Pwsed: The augment is what changes it to make/use steam
[6:10:45] Venxuri: they are the same thing, but have auguments inside them
[6:10:50] Sentinel1_9: @Giantwaffle is that an upgrade for the steam dynamo on bar last slot?
[6:11:10] akaCube: This setup is up to 320 on demand. Without demand nothing is generated
[6:11:10] Moobot: You can find Waffle's Youtube channel here - https://youtube.com/giantwaffle
[6:11:27] mrtraxx: upgrades
[6:11:42] b0ltz12: i think the power generation throttles when power is full
[6:11:47] Zapper_777: the cable is latent to take power
[6:11:52] ohbi78: broke it then fixed it*
[6:12:07] MishkaYumYum: drum
[6:12:21] Venxuri: for GT there are lossy cables and lossless cables, right now you are using one that loses power, idk if that was your question tho
[6:12:21] Tapeman83: right, sure, power will never run out YEP
[6:12:27] 0x4273: COPIUM forever
[6:12:42] ohbi78: theres a throttle augment

[7:00:42] TxMaverick88: yup, took up like 15 drawers with seeds and plants one time...

[7:07:16] Aeliel_: It's fine, I've been having a blast with expert mode
[7:07:18] Gh3ttoboy: why would people even play PO3 Mythic mode because they hate themselfs
[7:07:19] DX_Plates: Myekos LuL Thats expensive these days.
[7:07:26] coolcake2: no DML really sound like self torture
[7:07:51] officialhunterx: you should watch the gtnh stargate base tour its insane 5k hours play time
[7:07:57] Psyclone____: it doesn't take sugar cane
[7:08:01] Psyclone____: it has to be coal
[7:08:11] DX_Plates: ooo Did Waffle get a recap, can he see how many points we spent on KEKW s?
[7:08:11] Moobot: You can sub to Waffle by clicking this neat link -> twitch.tv/giantwaffle/subscribe SUBprise
[7:08:14] lvyEartman: it needs carbon for the carbon content
[7:08:30] officialhunterx: now
[7:08:34] officialhunterx: you have conduits
[7:08:35] Myekos: DX_Plates it's always been expensive, just varying degrees.  can't remember if it was 100k or 250k when I did it
[7:08:38] DrHax_: are bonsais in this and already usable for infinite wood?
[7:08:44] nellydocs: @Giantwaffle u only need 1 conduit and 1 chest to automate it
[7:08:59] Gh3ttoboy: 8s the
[7:09:09] quadcor33: how hard is this pack?
[7:09:18] Gh3ttoboy: is the patreon server in space yet Chat
[7:09:53] officialhunterx: doesnt it sound like a vacuum
[7:10:08] maimvice13: 1 proble; whit grechtech and enderio is that the conduits fille the 2 slots even it is to different items so you need to filter it properly
[7:10:27] Dagmoo: or you could keep playing more Kappa
[7:10:37] TheDeviate: I hope the EnderIO rewrite isn't pushed back further once 1.20 comes out. If it does, then so be it, but I'm just so ready to have it back.
[7:10:41] Dagmoo: get on chats degen level

[7:11:02] Gh3ttoboy: @maimvice13 does this pack have thermal expansion cause then you could use the keep amount items in machine

[7:11:11] MrHashbrowns: MrHashbrowns subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 31 months, currently on a 31 month streak! We're back baby!
[7:11:14] TheDeviate: They're working on it for 1.19.2 right now. It's just early alpha, so there's no proper release.
[7:11:16] knudsen1505: knudsen1505 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 64 months, currently on a 64 month streak! 
[7:11:33] DemonicHell3: LaserIO kinda works like EnderIO conduit did
[7:11:34] officialhunterx: maybe because its getting more and more difficult to code it
[7:11:54] TheDeviate: It was originally slated for 1.18, but 1.19 came out so quickly that they just decided to skip 1.18 entirely.
[7:12:01] Venxuri: for newer modpack XNet is goated
[7:12:05] maimvice13: @Gh3ttoboy no duct of thermal but you have a filter for keeping exact items in the maxhine but it is costly
[7:12:21] Zenimer: So to keep up u could just stay playing all night too.  I don’t think chat would complain. waffleYes
[7:12:29] Gh3ttoboy: @maimvice13 the advanced filters from EnderIO right
[7:12:38] splix661: to automate the PBF i use a tiny pile of carbon dust in the bottom input side to block it from putting more then 1 stack of coal in SeemsGood
[7:12:50] Wetware: What's the autocrafting like in this pack?
[7:13:04] maimvice13: @Gh3ttoboy i think i don't have the game open at the moment
[7:13:17] Venxuri: @Wetware ae2 no channels
[7:13:21] TheDeviate: I can barely play 1.12 modpacks nowadays because I've just been so used to the villager changes of 1.14.
[7:13:25] Gh3ttoboy: @maimvice13 ah
[7:13:34] wr1th3: just make a lip around the building so the vines cant grow past it
[7:13:42] 0x4273: channels ruined ae so disabling them is a good move
