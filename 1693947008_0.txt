[1:56:36] mechoriet: €389 in netherlands
[1:56:37] Experiment_B: yeah like 500
[1:56:38] Zyie: He can afford a new AMD or Intel CPU, with dd5 ram, and ofc a mobo that supports it. If he's going to use it for the next 10 years, might as well just go for top-of-the-line stuff
[1:56:39] BryanSWAGBEAST: 5800 is the last am4 socket! @Giantwaffle
[1:56:40] kane1941: even 3k series are good enough

[1:57:12] silv: girlboss and gatekeep
[1:57:12] AIex_0: costco prebuilt?
[1:57:14] Jolle450: In this economy, prebuilt might even make more sense
[1:57:14] Experiment_B: NZXT
[1:57:14] Driitzz: like alienware
[1:57:15] Zyie: He's looking at pre-builds from costco
[1:57:15] Techniker32: After i watched LTT, i ain't trusting no firm anyone KEKW

[1:57:21] AIex_0: he's looking at a costco one LUL
[1:57:21] wonly: they sell them
[1:57:22] Dibbsu: Prebuild from wish is the best NODDERS
[1:57:24] The_Holas: he just showed one on stream LUL
[1:57:25] Joshuapetch: that's what he's looking at getting
[1:57:27] Techniker32: *anymore
[1:57:30] Lupic: components*
[1:57:36] Trollsamaa: prebuilt is fine its just not the best bang for buck... just dont buy from garbage builders.
[1:57:42] BuLLeT_LV: Min possible PSU? :D
[1:57:42] bramblepatches: my best buy prebuilt is over 12 years old and still going strong
[1:57:43] WhoAmIErik: if youre watching LTT you probably arent buying a prebuilt anyways KEKW
[1:57:47] Sn00zr: LTT does an annual prebuilt compeitiion it is interesting to watch.
[1:57:52] itamarb77: he should get a starforge one
[1:57:57] thepolaroidbear: Prebuilt on sale can be a good deal. Also a good way to get grfx cards.
[1:58:00] vapo213: at this point a prebuild vom Domions or Wendys would be a massiv upgrade KEK
[1:58:04] mostlylaughing: prebuild is a lot of overhead costs over parts which is not worth for assembly and some questionable cable management
[1:58:14] Techniker32: OMEGALUL
[1:58:20] Dibbsu: Wendy's would hook you up
[1:58:29] CommanderUrsus: fresh never frozen
[1:58:31] PragmaticThoth: they use frosty juice for the heatsink KEKW
[1:58:38] meccha08: frosty liquid cooling

[1:58:55] MrDarkstorm: still have gpu shortage
[1:58:57] All_Tech: 20 year low yeah
[1:59:01] Stillglade: he already has the GPU which is the only hard thing to get still
[1:59:02] MrDarkstorm: no one wants to buy a brick
[1:59:04] stefan150: doesnt the 4090 need like 1000 watts to run
[1:59:13] Techniker32: And yet, the prices ain't free marketing....
[1:59:14] InternetPlumber: no, they are too fucking overpriced
[1:59:14] Kascade418: KFC already beat Wendys to the punch
[1:59:16] Lupic: it's so expensive, plus world economy is mostly fucked
[1:59:18] cheppard: they are all in stock
[1:59:18] ThomK114: I wouldn't be surprised if nvidia didn't perceive any losses still
[1:59:21] dollar_cave: Given how many GPUs ChatGPT need, I'm not too worried about their sales
[1:59:23] BuLLeT_LV: Regarding PCs, i want to upgrade 1660s to something, like 3060? Any suggestions? :D
[1:59:28] wonly: i think the problem with a prebuilt for pati is he already has a very expensive card and can save 1/2 his cost building
[1:59:28] Skorpio1: we have greedy corporations at the moment
[1:59:37] tankmarti: i got a 4080 way to expensive :)
[1:59:39] lateknighthero: I'll ride my 1080Ti to the grave, then give it a viking burial, has served me well
[1:59:45] stefan150: i meant in general with cpu and everything
[1:59:45] rickthe_punk: mining took a hit so less miner means more gpu on the market
[1:59:50] Skafo222: no one wants to pay 2k for a brick card KEKW
[1:59:51] BryanSWAGBEAST: im waiting on the 4070ti @Giantwaffle
[1:59:52] sp4wn999: 4 Hours until its Just Sunday

[2:00:02] Rongoel: @lateknighthero Mine now lives in my Roommates PC LUL
[2:00:05] Az1iiiz: @BuLLeT_LV rx 6600 is much better for the price unless you want nvidia stuff
[2:00:06] itamarb77: on a 2070 not replacing it soon

[2:28:29] Kascade418: Do what that one guy did, mount google drive as swap space
[2:28:36] FinnYellowbelly: protip: install another cpu under the motherboard, the case acts as a heatsink 2x the power!
[2:28:38] dylan0806: And then pati realize he doesn’t have Xmp enabled
[2:28:38] theRealWesty84: To realistically complete the pack how many 24hr streams would you have needed to do?

[2:30:20] stormblaz: mini hdmi

[2:30:28] Face_32: is USB-C future proof? @Giantwaffle
[2:30:29] stormblaz: can usb c transfer sound and video?
[2:30:30] Dizz1227: @stormblaz Bold of you to assume Apple wont just go full wireless charging
[2:30:30] axeraider15: C as a connector is fine.. but as a 'speed' the version can still vary
[2:30:31] InternetPlumber: always trust the printer people to fuck up a standard
[2:30:34] Spiderti: The weird type for printers damn you
[2:30:44] cheppard: type b?

[2:41:20] ThirstQuencher: @LordDusk acutally
[2:41:26] TheBobby1: We have those automated on patreon server
[2:41:30] ThirstQuencher: they build for free?
[2:41:36] Trollsamaa: I have a HDD in my ~2 year old $1500 computer that i only added a few months ago... they are still nice to have, But they shouldnt be a workhorse drive
[2:41:38] stormblaz: Dont forget the disc drive
[2:41:39] FraKo23: DARK mode

[2:41:47] ThirstQuencher: as long as vrm is competitive
[2:41:52] cmmeth: 13600k or bust
[2:41:55] Tim_wrx: Man RAM got really cheap!
[2:41:57] TimmyVRC: its probably fine
[2:41:57] Caldarr: microcenter is overpriced
[2:41:59] Dagmoo: @RoninStorm he already has a 3080
[2:42:02] daedmissica0: he got OCing
[2:42:02] ayaya_prime: It's fine
[2:42:03] FraKo23: SeemsGood
[2:42:06] daedmissica0: is not
[2:42:07] wonly: i only have 8tb free of 36tb... 0 porn. how am i supposed to store that on ssd/nvme cheaply?
[2:42:15] Archelonde: we need 7tv Flashbang emote
[2:42:16] dylan0806: Ddr4?
[2:42:18] CoolReal: 32 for 80? holyshit
[2:42:25] stormblaz: what mobo?
[2:42:30] calebhub514: man I remember when 32 gigs of DDR4 would be like 400 dollars, bad times those were
[2:42:31] BuLLeT_LV: 32 for 80 is decent :D
[2:42:32] ShadowBlade72: It's a decent build honestly. It'll serve him well for the price.
[2:42:41] mechoriet: can the mobo hold 2 nvme's tho?
[2:42:45] SheepsAholy: does he have 2 nvme slots?
[2:42:46] axeraider15: why not gen4 nvme?
[2:42:48] Shantrix: ^
[2:42:48] Moobot: You can sub to Waffle by clicking this neat link -> twitch.tv/giantwaffle/subscribe SUBprise
[2:42:49] stormblaz: thats solid E is Extreme to overclock
[2:42:55] Fufcia: it has 3 nvm slots
[2:42:56] CoolReal: Don't forget a cooler YEP
[2:42:56] ayaya_prime: no
[2:43:00] RefiixGaming: no
[2:43:02] dylan0806: Does the mobo has 2 m.2?
[2:43:05] flagnarok: last longer
[2:43:05] stormblaz: dont use box cooler?
[2:43:05] cmmeth: 13600
[2:43:11] Shadowmail: Heat Sink no included. Hmmmmm
[2:43:12] RefiixGaming: 13600k is super good
[2:43:14] SeriousPotatoBot: widePepeLaugh I remember paying £80 for a single 8GB 2400mhz ddr4 dim back in 2017
[2:43:16] ryanstringer1: 170 for the case should look at 1st player sp9 its a clean case
[2:43:19] UZMeNow: @Giantwaffle Check the cooler
[2:43:19] Skorpio1: depends on the use case, 13600k is slightly better
[2:43:23] Zyie: I think going for an AMD 5800X3D with AMD mobo is better, especially if he's going to keep it for 10+ years like current one. It's also better for gaming than that CPU.
[2:43:24] Shank_nasty: Problem is with 13 gen you want to change motherboard
[2:43:24] daedmissica0: this does
[2:43:25] stormblaz: is he using his old cooler
[2:43:25] Sentinel1_9: @giantwaffle rhe e is rhe overclocking one since has a k cpu might as well
[2:43:32] sneakyHoovy: Box YEP cooler
[2:43:33] daedmissica0: you can with this
[2:43:37] stormblaz: you dont need K
[2:43:38] RefiixGaming: yes
[2:43:39] flagnarok: 13600k is nicer but you aren't getting the reliability or affordability
[2:43:40] Skorpio1: same price I think
[2:43:40] sheepiez: Lian Li case is better than an NZXT
[2:43:41] stormblaz: if u dont ovrrclock
[2:43:44] cheppard: does he have a cooler?
[2:43:45] dylan0806: Or if you need additional hardware KEKW
[2:43:48] stormblaz: ohhh ks yea
[2:43:49] RefiixGaming: If its retail price
[2:43:50] RoninStorm: passmark benchmark it
[2:43:50] Stillglade: it would be same basic cost to go to 13600 but then you can get the ddr5 version of the mobo
[2:43:52] RefiixGaming: than fs
[2:43:52] ayaya_prime: does he have cooler?
[2:43:53] Trollsamaa: PCPP isnt perfect but it does help a lot....
[2:43:57] Zyie: K = overclockable, don't need it
[2:43:57] stormblaz: yea if u dont overclock u dont need it
[2:43:59] MrWarsai: 13600k is like $30-50 more
[2:44:04] Winstonrocks: why not get the ddr5 version motherboard
[2:44:05] Shank_nasty: K is unlocked, ks is binned
[2:44:07] wonly: does the 3080 fit in a mid tower case?
[2:44:09] CoolReal: K also have higher clocks
[2:44:10] iliketrains0605: K is overclock F is no graphics
[2:44:11] theflyingamerican74: KEKW
[2:44:12] mechoriet: k = unlocked ks = factory overclocked or something
[2:44:17] flagnarok: 12k is much more reliable and will last way longer than 13k because you'll end up abusing the overclock
[2:44:22] CoolReal: Need a cooler
[2:44:23] Stillglade: K allows overclock, F has no Graphics
[2:44:24] kaggez: K is over clok enablet. KS is binned
[2:44:25] Winstonrocks: its the same price
[2:44:25] DeadLiner: K is unlocked, F is without graphics
[2:44:28] Sentinel1_9: @giantwaffle what gpu does he have
[2:44:30] SheepsAholy: no cooler?
[2:44:33] theflyingamerican74: Affordable in this market KEKW
[2:44:33] Zyie: @wonly I've got a 3080TI, I've got the meshify 2 like he's got in his list, it's fine
[2:44:36] Konhacas: K is overclock, ks is intel factory overclock, kf is without graphics engine
[2:44:37] UZMeNow: @Giantwaffle Check the CPU COOLER
[2:44:39] Winstonrocks: cpu cooler?
[2:44:39] Yemtron: Just donate to me to get a PC Kappa
[2:44:39] Koristbuh: wtf OMEGALUL
[2:44:42] TimmyVRC: oh this PC is gonna blow his current one out of the water
[2:44:44] stormblaz: yea its stupid
[2:44:46] cmmeth: 13600k with ddr4
[2:44:49] flagnarok: wait for the crash and buy the dip LUL
[2:44:49] ayaya_prime: $200 for 32gb
[2:44:51] Koristbuh: does he get 15fps?
[2:44:53] stormblaz: thats solid
[2:44:55] strxcc: yo wtf I am on a 4790k, shit still works perfectly fine :P
[2:45:01] dylan0806: @giantwaffle can’t he enable xmp on his memory?
[2:45:04] RoninStorm: liquid cooling?
[2:45:06] xavier2119: that looks like my pc
[2:45:07] piiixxx: got my ddr5 for 260
[2:45:07] ShadowBlade72: Should just get the NH-D15. AIO is over hyped.
[2:45:08] Zapper_777: what PSU?
[2:45:08] Thr0h: H115i
[2:45:11] Zyie: I would go for a Noctua DH-15, just as effective in cooling, but cheaper
[2:45:14] mechoriet: @Zapper_777 850
[2:45:18] itamarb77: ssds?
[2:45:24] stormblaz: cooler master is ok I like Krakens more
[2:45:28] JasonDM_: I'm looking at $600 to bring my system from a 2700x, ddr4, bust mobo to a 7600x, 32GB ddr5 5200 and hopefully not bust mobo
[2:45:28] Shank_nasty: Cooler master is solid
[2:45:29] SmartDoll: not using noctua NOPERS smh
[2:45:30] Archelonde: Noctua
[2:45:30] AIex_0: @ShadowBlade72 but that thing is ugly
[2:45:31] xDeadBringerx: I have a MasterLiquid 360 TR4
[2:45:32] mechoriet: I mean the watercoolers are all the same just the shroud is different
[2:45:33] ryanstringer1: i built my pc for £1200 and if he goes for a cheaper case he could bump up something else
[2:45:34] Dynamic1237: I don't really like the CM liquid cooler, it doesn't have RGB controller, it is a physical button (At least some of them do)
[2:45:35] ayaya_prime: Be quiet, Arctic and corsair are probably best
[2:45:35] xDeadBringerx: Works just fine
[2:45:37] Sentinel1_9: @what gou does he have rn and yeahe should go E mobo
[2:45:37] Konhacas: They are all the same, since they all use the same pumps and rads
[2:45:37] mechoriet: cause the pattent shit
[2:45:41] tiberiom: Noctua or Rito
[2:45:43] CoolReal: Air > Water
[2:45:43] stormblaz: corsair is top tier hut cooler master is great for price
[2:45:44] xavier2119: I am a huge nzxt fan. I have the Kraken and their H440 case
[2:45:52] ShadowBlade72: @ShadowBlade72 They have the Chromax Black version that's literally just black. It looks great in a case.
[2:45:53] wonly: had to modify my antec 1200 tower to fit the corsair cooler in it FeelsBadMan
[2:45:55] Zyie: @ShadowBlade72 There's an all-black version for $10 more.
[2:46:00] stormblaz: Like isnt most psus from 2 giant companies
[2:46:01] indi1984: i got the kracken with the LCD...downside of nzxt is the damn garbage software you have to run
[2:46:06] Zapper_777: How much overhead do he have on the PSU?
[2:46:06] Sentinel1_9: @giantwaffle what gpu does he have rn and yea he should getthe E mobo
[2:46:07] mechoriet: no watercooler tech is pattented from that one company forgot name
[2:46:07] Butterwhales: Lol my personal preference is just a nh d15
[2:46:15] mechoriet: @Sentinel1_9 3080
[2:46:16] xavier2119: @indi1984 its really not that bad lmfao
[2:46:16] Winstonrocks: Gigabyte Z690 Aorus Elite AX look at this board has wifi onboard as well for 70 more
[2:46:17] itamarb77: what ssd is he getting? an nvme?
[2:46:23] stormblaz: 850 is more than enouf
[2:46:34] wonly: 750 was recommended for the 3080, we looked it up on pati stream
[2:46:38] mechoriet: 750 min for 3080
[2:46:39] kaggez: all the iao's with a pump in the cpu block is designed by asetek
[2:46:40] SheepsAholy: is he going to have any case fans?
[2:46:50] ShadowBlade72: Surprisingly I dropped ~5 degrees switching from an AIO to the NH-D15.  Nothing major, but also no risk of the pump running dry or leaking.
[2:46:53] Winstonrocks: that board has no wifi?
[2:46:55] Mr_Jarv1s: For fans, always get the beige and browns, Noctua all the way baby
[2:47:08] indi1984: @xavier2119 not that bad except the horrible memory leak its had for years now that they refuse to fix
[2:47:10] stormblaz: dont forget Thermal Paste for cpu
[2:47:16] TPells67: Does he have anything’s in his current pc that he tends to use
[2:47:21] ryanstringer1: waffle look at the 1st player sp9 case its cheaper and better to look at better parts
[2:47:25] BuLLeT_LV: monkaHmm
[2:47:25] stormblaz: people always forget the thermal paste
[2:47:49] xavier2119: @indi1984 I don't think I have had a single memory leak from it. unlucky
[2:47:52] leeroy_47: no its shit
[2:47:55] mechoriet: @stormblaz the cooler has paste
[2:47:56] daedmissica0: wireless  one for ci

[2:48:25] sktls_: me w/ my OC 4790k at 5.0 w/ liquid metal and d15 cooler
[2:48:29] MrWarsai: I hate putting thermal paste on
[2:48:29] stormblaz: is it tested that high end pastd beats factory?
[2:48:30] OpticVoid94: Dont forget Windows Vista KEKW

[3:14:45] GeekJenn: Yeah it was playing a FPS
[3:14:45] ChromaCym: VR legs yeah
[3:14:47] Stillglade: Rogue Squadron killed me in VR
[3:14:49] 619srt: actually flying a drone is fuckins hard.. not in a sim
[3:14:57] GeekJenn: My friend told me that it can take time to get used to

[3:15:07] el_amigo_gx: if you use binoculars inside a moving car you will get hella sick

[3:16:05] Arimil: I like head bobbing KEKW
[3:16:20] Arimil: It feels weird to me with it off, feels like I'm ice skating everywhere.
[3:16:25] ShadowBlade72: Yeah, it blurs your peripheral vision when you move in VRC to help you focus and try to prevent motion sickness.
[3:16:30] 619srt: LUL
[3:16:42] DrHax_: I couldnt watch i.e. God of War streams because of the mild bobbing, its already too much for me DansGame
[3:16:48] ChromaCym: oh damn
[3:16:49] TimmyVRC: Waffle try continuous walking where you walk straight in VR but you're walking circles in your play space. That was the most sick I've ever gotten in VR
[3:16:55] theflyingamerican74: D:
[3:17:04] ChromaCym: god I hope not
[3:17:04] GeekJenn: My friend is trying to get me check out VR chat tonight

[3:17:14] A_Wildland_Firefighter: The drone shows seems more environmentally friendly until you think about the amount of lithium and cobalt in all their batteries.
[3:17:15] ChromaCym: Yeah VRC was popping off last night
[3:17:18] kenshin2666: i meeeean, you can just take the headset off and walk away

[3:19:18] AsHackDM: @CJS7070  HUH  what do you mean
[3:19:23] Popowing: waffle, what was the site you used to buy your keyboard cable from?

[5:31:18] kane1941: what you needed it for?
[5:31:19] Dagmoo: i think you made assembler 2
[5:31:20] CoolReal: @619srt You will need to use the java version but login with the microsoft account
[5:31:22] Niceyyy: you have not made it mate
[5:31:39] 619srt: this probably not the modpack to start your first time in minecraft correct?
[5:31:47] CoolReal: 100% not
[5:31:56] Niceyyy: dang xD
[5:31:57] DaddyDiddy: do not play gregtech for your introduction into modded, not a great idea @619srt
[5:32:03] BobTaco21: @619srt Yeah no
[5:32:06] FowD8: i think in community edition it won't blow up, the cable will just burn up (unless you don't use a cable and put it right next to it) @Giantwaffle
[5:32:07] 619srt: ok
[5:32:09] CoolReal: It's his first introduction to the game LULW
[5:32:10] 619srt: Sadge
[5:32:12] Niceyyy: xD
[5:32:30] DaddyDiddy: play like stoneblock or sky factory
[5:32:30] SheepsAholy: thats a great idea actually
[5:32:31] JBrown: yeah start with Nascar KKona
[5:32:31] maccabeus: FTB University, Skyblock, and Enigmatica are all more appropriate starter packs imo
[5:32:34] Dagmoo: @619srt yeah everyone has been suggesting FTB Academy for first time modded
[5:32:34] 619srt: looks like soo much fun
[5:32:44] CommanderUrsus: I mean you should at least beat vanilla first
[5:32:48] DaddyDiddy: i mean you can give it a go but you're not going to have a fun time @619srt
[5:32:50] 619srt: NOTED will look into that.
[5:32:51] CoolReal: I'd say playing vanilla for a bit would be better LULW
[5:33:00] kane1941: are SMDs automated?
[5:33:10] 619srt: Vanilla looks boring af to me
[5:33:10] Moobot: You can sub to Waffle by clicking this neat link -> twitch.tv/giantwaffle/subscribe SUBprise
[5:33:43] CoolReal: Minecraft 1.0 FeelsStrongMan
[5:33:54] Bulltank: I dont play vanilla minecraft at all
[5:33:58] SheepsAholy: I never played vanilla Mc, Gregtech was my first
[5:34:03] DiStegro: That's me, one day I'll touch vanilla
[5:34:05] DaddyDiddy: vanilla minecraft has made a lot of improvements over the years but its no where as fun as modded
[5:34:16] BobTaco21: Vanilla is fun every now and again when I want to make mega builds but now modded is my go to
[5:34:23] iDiezALot: I did like 2 hours of vanilla, graduated to skyblock and from then on pretty much only Modded
[5:34:23] Bulltank: The problem with not knowing vanilla is all the tricks from vanilla
[5:34:39] Zyie: I've never played fully vanilla MC, always played either modpacks, or "vanilla" with a number of mods I added myself
[5:34:40] gikei: figuring out automation in vanilla is fun imo
[5:34:45] suicidebolt: I just bought and went head long into this mod as the first Minecraft I have ever done and it has been fun so far
[5:34:47] Ratlanta: with one tank you can make infinite tanks
[5:34:49] DaddyDiddy: nah you get infinite creative quantum tanks
[5:34:56] Ratlanta: you'll have a tank for every fluid
[5:35:18] DaddyDiddy: the creative tank data is made from the heart of the universe
[5:35:29] kane1941: its a mold that doesnt get consumed
[5:35:32] Tapeman83: KEKW
[5:35:36] Dagmoo: KEKW
[5:35:37] AleXanDreMau: KEKW
[5:35:40] SheepsAholy: KEKW
[5:35:42] DaddyDiddy: and then you just keep feeding it buckets and you get infinite creative tanks
[5:35:42] 619srt: KEKW
[5:35:45] SheepsAholy: thats a one time use btw
[5:35:53] CoolReal: The data doesnt get consumed
[5:35:59] LethalBro: NC = not consumed in the recipe
[5:36:07] DaddyDiddy: its like how the mold for any extruder works

[5:40:07] DaddyDiddy: you only need PBI for like all the asslines recipes and advanced SMD capacitors and what not so you're gonna need a super tank full at least
[5:40:17] officialhunterx: what was the name of the game that was bricking 3090
