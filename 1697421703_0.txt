[0:14:58] daemonaedryn: KEKW

[1:24:59] Igneous3: elephant foot
[1:25:06] aundros: You sure you wanna place it so central in the base?
[1:25:09] Pati: @N3rvrackD please no
[1:25:11] orangecreamsicle3: The reactor he's making is for burning fuel to make better fuel
[1:25:11] bandani: It turns into molten corium LUL

[1:28:37] IAmJester: fingers crossed you don't miss one.
[1:28:43] Kuma_Taru: That's so not what I'm used to. I'm used to reactor rods going the whole length
[1:28:49] orangecreamsicle3: do you want me to call you? peepoShy
[1:28:49] Apparentthreat: orangecreamsicle3 I'll probably have to rebuild my jetpack and stuff after losing my inventory. Not looking fwd to that. unless marques has time to dig around
[1:28:52] Bulltank: @IAmJester or fingers crossed he DOES miss one? Kappa
[1:29:01] Stormflare: chat what are the odds he melts it down and blows up the entire base
[1:29:15] orangecreamsicle3: @Apparentthreat I tried to figure out why your player ID got corrupted

[1:29:27] Thalmize: Prayge Blowup
[1:29:35] Stormflare: when it doesnt blow up
[1:29:35] TallicDragon: it would error if it was invalid
[1:29:40] Saishu_: its valid
[1:29:43] chipsdrengen: lever
[1:30:05] aundros: Fission power, lets go
[1:30:08] Bulltank: Do the redstone conduit right away @Giantwaffle
[1:30:09] orangecreamsicle3: vanilla redstone
[1:30:09] Sui_Ume: @Giantwaffle it tells in the quest book
[1:30:10] Tro95: Stripey radioactive blocks would look cooler
[1:30:10] jayrickson87: depends what fuel
[1:30:13] Apparentthreat: orangecreamsicle3 What I experienced was: Long lag spike -> logged out -> couldn't ping -> ping said "???" for player count -> logged in -> no inventory and in overworld.
[1:30:14] PureSpider: @chipsdrengen such useful information, thank you bamBam
[1:30:15] IAmJester: time to get your fish on.
[1:30:17] Saishu_: please only use low enriched fuel
[1:30:17] Amenophiz: would gregtech do it ? Kappa
[1:30:22] PureSpider: seqChat word
[1:30:26] orangecreamsicle3: @Apparentthreat D: oh no
[1:30:32] 0sem0: Do that
[1:30:33] thomasausen: no this can not overheat
[1:30:47] chekke: cells 63?
[1:31:04] officialhunterx: depends what fuel you use
[1:31:08] orangecreamsicle3: @Giantwaffle you need a port to input fuel and output power
[1:31:42] kane1941: dimensional transceivers anytime soon?
[1:31:43] Stormflare: think you need the port first
[1:31:44] Rooster2400: does it go boom?
[1:31:50] orangecreamsicle3: pepeLaugh
[1:31:53] TheShaddo13: maybe a wrench?
[1:31:53] Apparentthreat: orangecreamsicle3 Player file could have gotten corrupted or something during that process. Why I was hoping a backed up version could recover it. but at least with our automation getting the stuff back won't be unbearable.
[1:31:55] TigerLuv: on the controller?
[1:31:57] Yionix: PauseChamp
[1:31:57] Sui_Ume: @Giantwaffle you put it on the I/O ports
[1:31:57] angelicsprite: instead of lever?
[1:32:01] aundros: You need input and output blocks first
[1:32:02] jmm548: it goes on the in port
[1:32:03] Bored______________: just send it YEP
[1:32:09] Warkless: yeta wrench it
[1:32:11] Saishu_: @Rooster2400 it melts and ruins your base
[1:32:22] orangecreamsicle3: @Apparentthreat we could go back but all the work I put into PepeHands
[1:32:36] Apparentthreat: orangecreamsicle3 since today?
[1:32:40] Stormflare: Wokege
[1:32:40] StOrMy1100: Wokege
[1:32:47] Tro95: Isn't Pati autocrafting gears?
[1:32:50] Apparentthreat: orangecreamsicle3 I also think my personal file/folder can be replaced only
[1:32:51] Nexhunter: sainMad
[1:33:02] Apparentthreat: orangecreamsicle3 and not the entire folder
[1:33:08] Stormflare: pati gonna get fired
[1:33:09] orangecreamsicle3: monkaHmm
[1:33:16] Pati: just needs to request gears PepeHands
[1:33:17] jmm548: it hooks up to the port
[1:33:19] TigerLuv: instead of level
[1:33:23] SmokyMtnRed: He is auto-crafting a new PC
[1:33:27] Rooster2400: ahhhh
[1:33:28] aundros: Just read the quest book carefully waffle
[1:33:35] aundros: it tells you what needs to go where
[1:33:46] P00nDozer69: I think you also need to remove the lever
[1:33:47] officialhunterx: replace the casing with the ports
[1:33:55] TheShaddo13: no need to configure anything on the input/output channels?
[1:34:11] orangecreamsicle3: energy conduit like end steel
[1:34:24] mrleonehart: Remove the lever and then energy conduit for transporting the power
[1:34:27] orangecreamsicle3: yes
[1:34:29] mrleonehart: Yes
[1:34:30] jayrickson87: you can pump the coolant into a buffer connected to a active cooler for high temp fuels
[1:34:31] jmm548: should that cable be hooked up tot he import port box ?
[1:34:56] orangecreamsicle3: @jayrickson87 thats for a different design
[1:35:00] kane1941: setup of dimensional transceivers maybe
[1:35:08] aundros: Think maybe something like this is what he was thinking about waffle https://i.ytimg.com/vi/LfJbz-tTZ9k/maxresdefault.jpg
[1:35:09] Moobot: You can find Waffle's Youtube channel here - https://youtube.com/giantwaffle

[1:37:03] Tro95: You can put them in the ender chest
[1:37:31] N3rvrackD: is there something after end steel?
[1:38:02] Az1iiiz: all the time your making conduits
[1:38:07] Dizz1227: How far are we from dimensional tranceivers?
[1:38:13] Az1iiiz: plz automate those\
[1:38:38] aundros: is there a quick way to replace conduits in use?
[1:38:49] 0x4273: dont need that many COPIUM

[1:39:51] orangecreamsicle3: TBU fuel is best
[1:39:51] TheShaddo13: need to remove lever for the safety loop to wwork
[1:39:51] sorefingers: dont you need coolant?
[1:39:52] Kuma_Taru: Are you sure that's where the redstone things go?
[1:40:00] orangecreamsicle3: @sorefingers he has active coolers
[1:40:04] Harmar: *waits for random out of nowhere boom*

[2:03:14] banshay3: why are you using toothpaste on your uranium?
[2:03:17] Tro95: PTFE production is using most of the fluorine, you need to change the priorities

[2:32:38] Moobot: Come join the Waffle House Discord! <# https://discord.gg/fhGFtMuzdS

[2:33:00] Suikerfeestje: Trust me the 49XX series are not selling good
[2:33:06] Soul12eaver: are they still trying to market a 4060 as a lower tier 4070?
[2:33:09] NoisyPlays: i wonder why MonkaHmm
[2:33:21] itsIffy: lets buy nvidea YEP
[2:33:26] SmokyMtnRed: Plus they are not preforming to make it worth it either IMO
[2:33:28] Orin_The_Sly: They can keep it too. IDC if they drop it to 500$ im not using a 1200w PSU
[2:33:32] tommyfod: how are they defining what it should be priced at?
[2:33:33] kane1941: if only someone had a stock of electrum wires
[2:33:34] Suikerfeestje: Nvidia was 60% upp
[2:33:36] Trollsamaa: customers? learn? and not reinforce anti consumer behavior? KEKW thats allmost as likely as companies not worrying about making a profit.
[2:33:41] R1Rider01: @Giantwaffle look up metaphysic on YT.   reminds me of the nvidia eye contact thing
[2:33:48] arcticae: why would they sell consumer gpus cheap when companies will pay any price for ML gpgpus
[2:33:57] L4zER183: they saw scalpers pricing and thought they could just do that too.
[2:34:00] Suikerfeestje: Waffle have u seen the problems with the 7900XTX. cooler is leaking with some
[2:34:02] NoisyPlays: i got a 1660 super and aren't upgrading cuz of that stupid price augmentation
[2:34:03] tommyfod: right, gotcha. But aadjusted for component prices etc
[2:34:19] Asphoron: A midrange card should be no more than 500 in this decade
[2:34:19] silv: NODDERS

[2:34:39] 0x4273: @tommyford the current generation is actually pretty cheap to produce because die yields have gotten so good
[2:34:41] N3rvrackD: Newest GPU's are just not a good idea on either side right now
[2:34:44] yellowspy: You guys talk about 4000’s I still have a 1660S waffleDead
[2:34:48] sogerr: 7900x3d will be godly Kreygasm
[2:34:49] Suikerfeestje: AMD stepping up their game. hope the power consumption isnt as high as the intels 13 serie
[2:35:03] Dagmoo: @bugsplatter23 thats not true shipping has restored to precovid pricing
[2:35:04] GuardMoony: rather see a 7600x3d

[2:35:14] BakaPixel: I picked up a 5800x3d for xmas, happy with my purchase.
[2:35:19] LiveType: The vcache is incredible for simulation type games.
[2:35:20] kotwin: How do they fare in games when you have stuff like Twitch and Discord opened on your other monitors? Doesn't low thread count hinder them?
[2:35:29] mobfarmer: @yellowspy show pff, you kids with your fancy GPU's  I still have a 1060 GTX 6GB
[2:35:38] TheResinger: did pati get his pc yesterday? @Giantwaffle
[2:35:39] Suikerfeestje: Intel is will release a 13900 KS with 6Ghz clock

[2:36:12] yellowspy: @mobfarmer I still have that card on an older pc
[2:36:20] Vasatsar: god i know nothing about computers but i want to learn so bad
[2:36:22] Tro95: Did you change the EBF back from oxygen to nitrogen?
[2:36:25] N3rvrackD: I kind of want a 5800X3D but i don't know how available they still are that i might be better with a 5800x, 2700 is aging horribly
[2:36:27] BakaPixel: @Webmaster2001 Yeah, same, cpu, mobo, and aio all on black friday for like half price all told.
[2:36:29] txus_gamer: *3080
[2:36:32] orillion: PauseChamp eventually we'll end up like apple and have everything on the cpu
[2:36:35] GuardMoony: gta v gets a big boost with more cpu cache
[2:36:36] Webmaster2001: @BakaPixel good cops
[2:36:41] trabadam: big L3 cache means less RAM access , so everything runs faster not only games
[2:36:49] Saishu_: eventually L4 cache and goodbye ram
[2:36:50] yellowspy: @vasatsar you don’t learn you get born with that Kappa
[2:36:56] LiveType: You can best a 5800x3d with a 13900k and hynix a-die. It just costs way way more.
[2:37:01] 0x4273: KEKW
[2:37:04] mobfarmer: well the market is going up finally.. this morning it was still going down.

[2:37:07] sorefingers: its funny to me when people find gregtech complicated. imagine how complicated the manufaction of gpus and cpus are. cpus are at the point where you can count how many atoms the walls between cells are. there are so many smart people out there its magnificent @giantwaffle

[2:37:43] Asphoron: A fish is fine too
[2:37:43] n00rman_: 700K fish lmao
[2:37:45] MaestroG17: So if I were to get a new graphics card, should I wait a few months for the prices to drop or look at the 30 series?
[2:37:55] BakaPixel: @Webmaster2001 Upgraded from a 2600x KEKW

[2:38:32] iwill_endyou: need moar fish
[2:38:32] RefiixGaming: Im not old enough problably, but since im keeping up with gpu news basically nvidia 10 series, everyone seems mad
[2:38:32] mrleonehart: @Giantwaffle Check storage drawers....my spider senses are tingling
[2:38:32] ashla11: I think it will take more then a few monthes for 4000 price to drop
[2:38:34] MaestroG17: I've got a 1080ti lol
[2:38:37] wonly: 960ti here
[2:38:39] zzzDai: The issue is the new cards coming out are not competing with midrange cards at all
[2:38:43] Konhacas: Don't lok for 3k series. They are even more expensive than 4k series, the market is fucked up right now, don't buy
[2:38:46] GuardMoony: Are you still generating enderpearls ? because you did switch that over
[2:38:47] chipsdrengen: 1080 ti gang
[2:38:48] P00nDozer69: my buddy just gave me his 1070 to upgrade my 650 TI
[2:38:49] Rookje: 1080 gang :P
[2:38:49] zzzDai: so they might not even drop prices that much
[2:38:51] SkywardDev: Insane price hikes during a recession no less
[2:38:52] gikei: buy 3k series used
[2:38:53] ShionSinX: you guys got GPUs?
[2:38:56] Tro95: Did you change the EBF back from oxygen to nitrogen?
[2:38:57] Suikerfeestje: Waffle consider an RX over an RTX now?
[2:39:03] Blitzonite: even then, if you're from 970, just go for a 2060 or 1660 if you don't need more
[2:39:06] Blitzonite: crazy good cards
[2:39:11] Vasatsar: I bought my pc with a 3070ti in it and im happy with that for awhile LUL
[2:39:17] dennixfailalot: i waited so long i can wait some time longer
[2:39:20] bugsplatter23: I have a 3070ti in my miner i havent even bothered to move to my pc yet
[2:39:20] kane1941: just compress to foil?
[2:39:24] aundros: Didn't you switch another one of those deep learning machines to those cards, and said you were gonna switch back later?
[2:39:26] ashla11: if its true that nvidia switched fabs and lost its volume contract, I dont think they will lower the prices
[2:39:31] Dagmoo: with Eth switch to proof of stake it should help a lot though right?
[2:39:35] Igneous3: fine wire?
[2:39:36] deandosss: is it back filling the machine ?
[2:39:37] lgamer7: did the "chip shortage" have anything to do with companies increasing prices?
[2:39:37] Askjong: My PC is dying. Errors on my ssd and hdd... Going to buy a new PC without a GPU and reuse my old GPU 2080
[2:39:37] Trollsamaa: @Blitzonite just buy a cheap used card till the market stabilizes in that case
[2:39:38] rickthe_punk: i pass from 870 to 3070ti and its worth the 700$ but now im bottle neck by cpu KEKW never ending problem
[2:39:38] wonly: Blitzonite people are asking as much for those cards as they are for 3k series new
[2:39:39] Tro95: Check the interface configurator?
[2:39:47] mobfarmer: and now intel and amd are adding  ML and AI modules into CPU...  eventually it will only be gamers using GPU's
[2:39:50] LiveType: @suikerfeestje I would never. had a 6900xt. I wouldn't consider another amd gpu until overwhelming evidence can be presented that software support is on par with nvidia.
[2:39:59] RefiixGaming: @rickthe_punk up the resolution Kapp
[2:40:00] sorefingers: i just pay 8 dollars a month for nvidia Gecorce now cloudgaming ✌️
[2:40:09] Narcotical: Are things going in to there though
[2:40:18] Tro95: Interface configurator will tell you where it's going
[2:40:18] tommyfod: Stadia was killed, not Geforce
[2:40:18] SkywardDev: Stadia is gone
[2:40:19] TelRehiad: its probably being used by one of the keep in stock systems. you won't see it on the crafting screen because the system doesn't know its crafting.
[2:40:20] 0x4273: gloud gaming KEKW
[2:40:20] chaoskub: Stadia shut down
[2:40:21] sorefingers: stadia got shut down
[2:40:23] SmartDoll: why would they get rid of it
[2:40:26] lvyEartman: no google stadia stopped
[2:40:27] mangy9: GFN is amazing
[2:40:27] Suikerfeestje: @livetype Thats what i thaught too. AMD is behind in the software part while on hardware they are on par
[2:40:29] orillion: killed shield PepeHands
[2:40:50] SkywardDev: I really dislike the simulation chambers in this pack
[2:40:50] Moobot: You can sub to Waffle by clicking this neat link -> twitch.tv/giantwaffle/subscribe SUBprise
[2:40:55] SkywardDev: Kinda killed it for me
[2:41:06] Morowinn: everyone complaining about GPUs being so expensive and marked up for profit, Apples products are even worse, the margin they make from it is ridiculous but no one is throwing a hissy fit over that....
[2:41:22] raironzera: I'm upgrading from a 740 for laptops, what card should i aim for?
[2:41:40] Suikerfeestje: @morowinn Would expect the most people here to be on Android
[2:41:53] CoolReal: LuL
[2:41:55] RefiixGaming: @Morowinn Theres plenty of competition for apple you can buy other products while gpu there is only two of them
[2:41:55] Larklen: @Morowinn people have literally been complaining about Apple pricing for over a decade KEKW
[2:41:59] yellowspy: @raironzera desktop pc
[2:42:01] Bulltank: @raironzera an onboard card from today is probably better then that lol
[2:42:03] Saytos1: redo it all
[2:42:09] Orin_The_Sly: Im sorry!
[2:42:16] Foobaah: redo whole base
[2:42:22] LiveType: @suikerfeestje Nah, they're still a little behind on hardware, just nowhere near as far as software. Nvidia has ~90% marketshare for good reason.
[2:42:35] SvenQoala: Move to new base. You've outgrown this starter base
[2:42:38] orangecreamsicle3: Well you ignore chat too often so no its not my fault OMEGALUL
[2:42:39] wonly: manually crafting stuff? wth
[2:42:39] Saytos1: @Foobaah lowcoSmart yea
[2:42:45] mobfarmer: the APPLE silicon is insanely awesome... love my  probook m2 .. just wish I got  16GB of ram.. but still the 8GB ram is livable..  and i'm the guy that crams 64GB of ram into my laptop.
[2:43:01] Suikerfeestje: @livetype Yea true but Nvidia will decrease in the upcoming years
[2:43:09] Larklen: sure, but it's a pretty high chance that market share will be buying another NVIDIA gpu cause its what they know
[2:43:14] lvyEartman: nvidia stopped the gamestream functionality for the shield
[2:43:16] Suikerfeestje: BTW everyone talked about Intel gpu's this spring and now its gone KEKW
[2:43:21] Derek_LastName: Sadge I thought this was the year of the gamer
[2:43:30] LiveType: The semiconductor bust is coming for sure with how things are shaping up.
[2:43:37] Thegrinch6: gpu
[2:43:40] N3rvrackD: GPU
[2:43:42] Suikerfeestje: Never hear anyone about them
[2:43:44] Cyberwire69: why did that stop processing?
[2:43:59] ForgottenTime: Bruh I’m cold, wet, tired, working outside sucks in the winter
[2:44:05] N3rvrackD: Intel knew the struggle though
[2:44:06] zzzDai: Arc's hardware is fine, software is not there yet.
[2:44:46] N3rvrackD: They 100% acknowledged Arc would be a painful adopt
[2:44:53] wonly: those rows dont look evenly spaced
[2:45:09] Larklen: KEKW
[2:45:10] 0x4273: KEKW
[2:45:13] Larklen: texture still bwoken too
[2:45:33] LiveType: I think the texture is the fast/fancy  graphics settings
[2:45:34] jayrickson87: logs into charcoal into carbon
[2:45:46] Bulltank: Isnt the first rule of automation to automate all the things you need to automate? lol

[2:47:23] Bordemin: dayHey @Giantwaffle do you still play TrackMania?
[2:47:31] deandosss: why not make it so all your wire/gears etc always have a stock of 100+?
[2:47:38] Narcotical: blame Pati Kappa
[2:47:42] deandosss: waiting for pati new pc ?
[2:48:12] orangecreamsicle3: I think pati is stalling so he doesnt get punished
[2:48:13] mobfarmer: base slowest was because of pati's anchient potato PC.
[2:48:13] AleXanDreMau: @Giantwaffle make more machines to make wires and tell to make 5k!
[2:48:24] wonly: if you can spread the wires to all the slots in the interface, then it'll hold like 584. thats how pati fixed the other stuff you were saying that about yesterday
[2:48:52] LiveType: connect the interface
[2:48:52] Moobot: You can find Waffle's Youtube channel here - https://youtube.com/giantwaffle
[2:48:58] angelicsprite: @TheWonderLlama i think its more country resource abduction through political and cultural instability to make pillaging look like innovation for the future

[2:49:04] kane1941: rotate?

[3:41:16] BakaPixel: @Giantwaffle In all fairness you couldn't do drawers until you could reliably spam controllers and storage upgrades.
[3:41:27] Stormflare: pati moment
[3:41:32] TigerLuv: f?

[3:42:44] Polystyx: how do draws work?
[3:43:03] shifty_keyz: waffleHands
[3:43:14] DragonApoc: Is drawers with storage bus attached to a controller the best option .
[3:43:16] Variandra: drawers
[3:43:17] Stormflare: @Polystyx iirc they basically hold a large amount of a single item
[3:43:31] TigerLuv: so you can run around saying ' Under Where?!
[3:43:52] CommanderUrsus: back stuff all the things
[3:44:01] Tapeman83: Compacting drawers are great for ingots too, cause you get nuggets and blocks without having to use autocrafting space for them
[3:44:26] CanadianHealthCare: I’ve watched a lot of mod packs, first time I’ve seen the crafting system change more than once lol
[3:44:30] The_Flembo: Not to mention drawer walls are hot cirGasm
[3:44:44] bugsplatter23: As long as you arent counting on any co-products.  Then whole thing crashes
[3:44:53] Orkrist13: drawers and AP2 is one of my fav collabs of mods
[3:45:06] InoUno: You'll need a machine to produce each kind of item then, right?
[3:45:28] Amenophiz: Question, if you have a full drawer and some on the drive and you use part of the drawer inventory will it relocate the drive inventory to the drawer ?
[3:45:30] Askjong: Doesn't draws lag?
[3:45:34] Alamose: can even used the 2x2 drawers to store less if you dont want 2k
[3:45:40] s_DeXTeR_s: SPACESHIPS POG
[3:45:54] BakaPixel: @Amenophiz Relocate, no, but it uses drive inventory first iirc.
[3:46:34] Wolframpage: there are downgrade upgrades also can allow you to store less than 2048 items
[3:46:42] primo_qwe: or you can use storage downgrade + iron storage upgrade too easier to adjust
[3:47:02] TheRiehlDeal: Cobble upgrade
[3:47:04] primo_qwe: storage downgrade
[3:47:09] Ras2709: flint or cobble
[3:47:19] jayrickson87: downgrade it's made of flint
[3:47:21] Orkrist13: could be a later version
[3:47:22] Stormflare: youre searching for upgrade
[3:47:23] Variandra: bc u have u[grade ytped
[3:47:23] Amenophiz: search for downgrade instead of upgrade ?
[3:47:24] The_Flembo: Cause you're searching upgrade
[3:47:25] lazyhot: There is also storage downgrade so on a 4by4 downgraded you can storage rly low amount
[3:47:26] mrleonehart: You are searching wrong for downgrade
[3:47:26] Qbertman: thats cause you typed upgrade
[3:47:27] Markus11982: well look for downgrade and not upgrade :D
[3:47:49] Igneous3: put in 2?
[3:47:50] primo_qwe: thne you can use iron storage upgrades to incerase stacks
[3:47:55] Amenophiz: science it
[3:47:55] Moobot: Come join the Waffle House Discord! <# https://discord.gg/fhGFtMuzdS
[3:47:57] lazyhot: your looking for upgrade not down
[3:47:57] Alamose: 1 of those and a 2x upgrade
[3:47:59] CoolReal: Add the ones that increase stacks
[3:48:01] Linkitch: Maybe try a downgrade and an upgrade?
[3:48:02] sorefingers: you can combine a single stack and a multiplier jograde @giantwaffle
[3:48:05] primo_qwe: you put 1 of those and 2x iron
[3:48:07] ThomK114: Reduce then 2x?
[3:48:07] Ras2709: just make a 2x2 drawer and fill it with that
[3:48:20] Orkrist13: can you config one
[3:48:22] Alamose: it changes the base value, so 2x the base now
[3:48:51] sorefingers: like that you can easily crank up buffers as needed
[3:48:57] Stormflare: big brain
[3:49:34] lazyhot: Genius!!
[3:49:42] Ras2709: so emerald upgrade is = 512?

[3:50:41] sorefingers: i had problems before when the priority of stuff was only 1 higher, with 1000 higher didnt have that @giantwaffle
[3:50:48] mrleonehart: Cant you shift and hold left click to send multiple items into the storage?
[3:50:57] mrleonehart: Left hold drag
[3:50:59] Amenophiz: @Giantwaffle maybe keep a list on what systems have what nr priority on a text file to easily debug priorities ?
[3:51:00] n3wtpond: its the advanced blast furnace, it worked until i dismantles it. thanks tho @boltzmanC

[4:52:17] dennis3833: lesser prio fill fill the higher prio
[4:52:18] stickman_02: it stores in the 5000 but takes from the 3000

[4:54:01] weightmaker: items will take from highest prio first. Fluids will take from lowest.
[4:54:07] dennis3833: start making wires pls
[4:54:13] Minelmonia: doest it not have to be dust? as opposed to ingot?
[4:54:17] bcdmonkey: ratJAM

[6:44:07] ninjafire01: @Giantwaffle Do you like eggnog?
[6:44:08] lukasalbert: just less electricit
[6:44:09] LethalBro: 12 at lower voltage for lathe
[6:44:14] AleXanDreMau: KEKW
[6:44:14] Netfreq: Pati is over there extruding steel fishing pole to catch all the fishies
[6:44:15] KrunkleDunk: lathe doesn't need a mold
[6:44:19] end3avor_: 2.6s @ LV vs MV in the extruder so lathe is still better
[6:44:24] Saishu_: lathe tahe half the time at same power tier
[6:44:25] kane1941: can you even ask for 1024 interfaces for example?
[6:44:27] Deamp: it matters its another tier and the lathe is overclocked and therefore faster
[6:44:33] LethalBro: heck not 12, stupid fat fingers
[6:44:40] LethalBro: peepoFat
[6:44:47] lukasalbert: why not use one interface for 8 machines ?
[6:44:54] lukasalbert: would you need to many filters ?
[6:44:59] DrHax_: Waffle wants to use those machines because he's Lathe-y widePepeLaugh
[6:45:14] Deamp: extruder 2.6 MV vs lathe 2.6 LV -> lathe 1.3? MV overclocked
[6:45:24] ilya__yas: is this gonna make teslas in the end?
[6:45:36] Sui_Ume: @lukasalbert no, he uses filters anyway, he just likes to do it like this
[6:45:42] ToTheMato: @DrHax_ NOPERS
[6:45:47] lukasalbert: ah makes sense
[6:46:25] TheNamlit: @giantwaffle maybe double the amount of ingots stored in the drawer, so that when you take stuff like rods, sheets, gears etc. out of the system, it has a safer/larger buffer…else you might run out of ingots again (like right now)
[6:46:33] AleXanDreMau: @Giantwaffle does the server Restart daylie? maybe has a memory dump!

[6:48:18] KrunkleDunk: electrum bolts?
[6:48:24] R1Rider01: is there a reason to not use 1 MEI for like 10 machines, and then use the filter on each machine?
[6:48:39] Saishu_: vibrant alloy?
[6:48:40] DoubleOughtNot: Yes.
[6:48:46] Saishu_: oh you got them
[6:49:01] splix661: kind of surprised no call of ocd of the different items in lines like copper pipes , plates , ect LUL

[6:52:19] bcdmonkey: @fapohogu wasn’t preventing him, just curious
[6:52:57] fapohogu: @bcdmonkey i know, I've been wondering the same since he begun building this
[6:53:03] IlsaGold: We need power converters
[6:53:10] TigerLuv: Sui_Ume except he is working from the far end for the conduit/cables << purple stuff. I am really new to MC
[6:53:23] lilgangstagoth1: 2
[6:53:27] Deamp: the question is, is it more lag friendly to do this with level emitter instead of drawer/controller/storagebus-combination
[6:54:04] KnightofObv: We don't have a row for foil yet, right?
[6:54:13] Littleme02: presumably
[6:54:19] Deamp: just read something that you should not use a lot of storagebus-drawer combinations with a lot of drawer
[6:54:21] Smileynator: I don't get why AE2 didn't just build in that "level test output" into it's interface
[6:54:22] Sentinel1_9: do you?
[6:54:24] Smileynator: it's so dumv
[6:54:42] Koeckie: yes you said ever single thing gets a row

[6:58:56] kane1941: you can put just like 5-6 machines with input chest and request them in round-robin
[6:59:06] splix661: assembler can do that with lots of recipes too
[6:59:24] splix661: so 2 by 2 drawer
[6:59:33] burrrst: You could use pati’s old jank system for coated cables. Just request them
[6:59:46] KrunkleDunk: I would just make a few machines to do the coating, and use auto crafting for it.
[6:59:57] MrWardy_: drafting cards are way more lggy than lvl emmiters

[7:00:22] kane1941: more space for EBFs
[7:00:56] lilgangstagoth1: could arc furnace the old machines
