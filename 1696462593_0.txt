[0:15:22] P00nDozer69: that's the concussion one right?
[0:15:25] Harmar: they use to hide the issues (the players themselves)
[0:15:25] banshay3: @Mandorake he tackeld a guy, got up and then just collapsed

[0:47:13] Nickonil: LUL wtf
[0:47:18] banshay3: @PiratePati RIP

[0:48:33] Nickonil: they still havent released valve controller in Norway.. neither the index or steamdeck.. RIP
[0:48:36] banshay3: VR is a niche enthusiast thing LUL
[0:48:49] P3NGU1NSMACKER: Its a very niche thing, not everyone likes it
[0:48:50] ninopanda: @Giantwaffle nvm i got the patreon server
[0:48:56] darkblue_twitch: 1500 even without lighthouses?
[0:49:01] xtherapie: peepoH
[0:49:07] AIex_0: yeah the oculus is so affordabl
[0:49:15] SwinnyG: we also need better VR games lol they are all so bad
[0:49:25] SwinnyG: I only use VR for VR Chat and racing sims
[0:49:27] Apparentthreat: My problem rn is that some of the simplest games are $15 minimum. VR would need to be like mobile game in cost first for wider adoption
[0:49:31] TigerLuv: like they need a ford focus version, instead of the tesla version :D
[0:49:31] P3NGU1NSMACKER: shit makes me sick i have no interest in a VR headset
[0:49:44] FinnYellowbelly: fuck facebook
[0:49:45] P3NGU1NSMACKER: maybe im in the minority though
[0:49:51] FrostedSentry: can't wait to see Apple enter the chat at $3k
[0:49:51] Lenny1130: theyre losing money on the quest 2 pretty sure and making it up in ways the other companiesd arent
[0:49:52] RationalLies: put the other $1000 back into the computer
[0:49:52] PTK9: they would need to have same graphics as pc to sell it for 1400$...
[0:49:56] Twin5un: yeah but bad VR looks like poop
[0:49:58] count3rnova: big buisnesses
[0:49:59] hammertiden: quest 2 is more then enough for me

[0:50:02] BuLLeT_LV: Rich programmers Sadge
[0:50:07] cosmicblip: look at the steam hardware survey and click VR Headsets it shows what is used most on pc
[0:50:08] ps5gameplayer: Engineers are using them now
[0:50:09] MrHashbrowns: corprate profits
[0:50:10] priam__: did you see the recent sales reports about the new GPUs?
[0:50:10] ninopanda: @Giantwaffle should i reboot your server while i am at it. to fix any ping issues
[0:50:18] BuLLeT_LV: Everything is for business Kappa
[0:50:20] Bullistik_A: @P3NGU1NSMACKER Yeah same VR makes me sick as well
[0:50:23] Foooks: People keep buying...  price will remain high.
[0:50:25] SubHype: @P3NGU1NSMACKER a lot of people do get motion sickness from what i've heard. I wonder if it can be trained over time but idk
[0:50:26] JasonDM_: I use my index mostly for beat saber FeelsWeirdMan
[0:50:35] unnoticedx: unnoticedx subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 27 months! poggie
[0:50:37] Sup4545: Sup4545 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 52 months! I keep getting better and better jobs, just for the tech to get more and more expensive.
[0:50:42] GummiKu: Hopefully its released in the Nordics. The Index was not so it was around $2K to get it here..
[0:50:43] Razorigga: exchange "expensive" with overprized scam" :D
[0:50:44] Gotizie: what is a good mid to high range headset that you would recommend?
[0:50:47] CrystalSmack: popCat
[0:50:49] MiczuPL: Why buy expensive VR when everything is made for lowest common denominator... so it is made for cheap VR
[0:50:59] Tabakhase: the steamVR stat is rather screwed as you need it connected and even then its like 50/50 if detected and listed @cosmicblip
[0:51:06] Shmoopy0: A cool use of VR in my past job was Mercedes teaches their tech how to fix cars with a Hololens. So they train everyone in the nation at the same time via a conference call with the hololens sharing the FPV of the tech doing the repair. @Giantwaffle
[0:51:07] banshay3: @MiczuPL to see more anime tiddies
[0:51:11] TheHPGarage: its like ferraris
[0:51:17] MiczuPL: @MiczuPL slrSweat
[0:51:22] aundros: Sounds like something they would do
[0:51:29] mechoriet: 4070 tI thingy?
[0:51:35] cosmicblip: if you go and look at the steam hardware survey on steam and click VR Headsets it shows what is used most on pc form December 2022
[0:51:39] unnoticedx: sounds like capitalism
[0:51:45] mechoriet: WELL and different die
[0:51:56] mechoriet: very skummy
[0:52:04] TPells67: How surreal was it when you tried VR for the first time? @giantwaffle
[0:52:25] AlfredTheSalmon: see kids, bullying big companies work. First Sonic, now this
[0:52:28] Lenny1130: @Giantwaffle check steam hardware survey to see the ost used vr headsets

[0:52:32] FrostedSentry: yep
[0:52:37] nxusr: own, no. use, yes

[0:52:49] Littleme02: DK1 rift kickstarter here
[0:52:51] Nickonil: the oculus rift dev kit sucked balls and i hated it, never used vr ever again
[0:52:53] BuLLeT_LV: There was DK2?
[0:52:54] Littleme02: it was amazing
[0:52:55] SailorWS: i member the 1080 paperweights

[0:53:27] Twin5un: 800 USD so 15000$ Cad LUL
[0:53:29] davados_: @aundros it's dependent on the user i suffer from bad motion sickness even in a car
[0:53:33] Twin5un: 1500*
[0:53:39] dinodaman: dinodaman subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 18 months! 
[0:53:44] cosmicblip: 41.35% of people use Oculus Quest 2 on steam 17.24% is Valve Index
[0:53:44] Lenny1130: its very interesting to me how nvidia had sucha huge price drop with the 30 eries then brought it right back up with the 40 series
[0:53:44] SwinnyG: yeah the **70 series shouldn't ever be above $500
[0:53:56] ixwt: Isn't that the reverse of conventional logic? Price the cheap thing higher, closer to the price of the more expensive thing?
[0:53:59] AIex_0: yeah the quest 2 is solid
[0:54:02] iwill_endyou: got a quest 2 and the wireless PC link is *chefs kiss*
[0:54:08] TheIrishGuy: my 10y/o bro got it and it's so good
[0:54:09] aundros: Yeah, its amazing
[0:54:09] Asphoron: They need a pedestrian card around $500 to get their real sales
[0:54:16] MrArrig: But can we use it without a facebook account though?
[0:54:21] iwill_endyou: wireless link works flawlessly
[0:54:25] P3NGU1NSMACKER: Yeah no meta account required afaik
[0:54:31] Lenny1130: @MrArrig i think you can now
[0:54:50] kinglouisxvii: airlink is rly gud
[0:54:50] Dagmoo: @yeah but with a Meta account someone said
[0:55:06] Casual_Steve_: does the quest 2 even have Foveated rendering or eye tracking?
[0:55:06] P3NGU1NSMACKER: oh maybe meta account, non facebook
[0:55:23] mechoriet: COPIUM its seperate
[0:55:24] bugsplatter23: No its BT router not involved
[0:55:24] Littleme02: riiight
[0:55:25] Twin5un: i doesn't LUL
[0:55:27] Braumeister: is a notebook in a backpack with hdmi too clunky for VR?
[0:55:30] TPells67: How many times have you ran in to walls waffleDead
[0:55:35] EvilMealw0rm: I have the quest 2 and a wifi 6 router. Sometimes you ma get lags, but it's not very often and worth everything.
[0:55:41] nxusr: @casual_steve_ only quest pro has eye tracking
[0:55:45] aundros: i wonder if you can play mudrunner in vr
[0:56:00] Kodish: Deckard would be cool, valves Steam link tech is really good now, so there's potential for a wifi VR from Valve
[0:56:03] banshay3: need VR for star citizen, just to look around
[0:56:10] Derdrom_TJM: I was just going to ask if you ever streamed VR
[0:56:19] its_lil_deer_: You watch the bengals game?
[0:56:25] SwinnyG: streaming VR is tough and janky though tbh
[0:56:25] Winter_Squirrel: It's probably good to keep it as a non-work thing
[0:56:37] Dagmoo: thats probably healthy you have one thing you dont stream
[0:56:39] slimjimforevigt: your vr sessions er probably not family friendly
[0:56:42] Zett121: vrchat mute stream when? LUL
[0:56:50] P3NGU1NSMACKER: Steam deck i think will be very competitive in the pc market
[0:56:56] iwill_endyou: staggered launch was the best option
[0:56:57] darkblue_twitch: The Steam Deck is the best thing I have bought in... forever
[0:56:58] jmm548: steam does so few things they have to be good
[0:56:58] Lenny1130: @Giantwaffle i feel like valve is the same with games too. most games are really buggy and not finished but valve doestn do that
[0:57:05] aWildDaveThatStreams: I love my steamdeck
[0:57:05] Tabakhase: there was this Fan problem i think? but even that was minimal..
[0:57:10] Tabakhase: (with steamdecks)
[0:57:11] aWildDaveThatStreams: Sosoddo much
[0:57:29] P3NGU1NSMACKER: i can see steam decks replacing PCs eventually
[0:57:29] its_lil_deer_: waffleGun

[0:58:04] ChromaCym: oh yeah easily
[0:58:06] Tabakhase: BaseStations is what keeps me from Index - InsideOut or bust.
[0:58:21] jmm548: it would be liek the quest 2 with no pc but better
[0:58:28] sp4wn999: i had to buy my quest2 from france because it was banned in germany LUL

[0:59:23] Twin5un: does anyone has tried War Thunder in VR ??
[0:59:25] zleddge: Ive never owned a VR yet
[0:59:27] zleddge: I'm 33

[0:59:31] TPells67: Check on your power
[0:59:31] LVL97Magikarp: i hate that when i dont play vr for a while i get such bad motion sickness

[1:02:29] 1StClassAlcoholic: all military technologies are stupidly expensive

[1:06:45] mrblates: me @ 3am on google chrome light mode
[1:06:46] SailorWS: but we were on a carrier

[1:44:31] Pati: time to autocraft conduits despair
[1:44:32] Rayisbeast: i paid 369.99 for a 970
[1:44:44] Yizzles: I also got my 2070 before the GPU scalpers. Best decision of my life KEKW
[1:44:50] ToyBits88: ill just buy a 3070 from ebay......
[1:44:54] mechoriet: @PiratePati see you T-5 hour of pain
[1:44:57] Fligon_: Idk what to even upgrade to anymore from 20 series
[1:44:58] Koeckie: @Yizzles 206S same :D
[1:45:01] Peeeeeeeeeep: when I started gaming I couldn't afford the latest and greatest. I rebuilt a couple years ago and didn't feel like spending 1299 on the latest...
[1:45:21] Beufff: aren't you going to be bandwidth limited soon?
[1:45:22] YOUCEP: upgrade the existing ones
[1:45:23] SmokyMtnRed: I went from a 750Ti to a 1080ti to a 3070
[1:45:24] BloeR: i spend 1,1k
[1:45:28] Pati: I automated plates and youre not using it Sadge
[1:45:32] CyberParzival: @Fligon_ same. I don't want to make the wrong move lol
[1:45:39] Yizzles: @Yizzles Nice!
[1:45:51] Nexhunter: when the MSRP is $800 that before accounting in taxes and tariffs pepeLaugh
[1:45:53] Apparentthreat: PiratePati so Sadge be Madge
[1:45:56] HostileLogOut: @Fligon_ the 407o ti or 4080
[1:46:04] Pati: Request the system to make it
[1:46:05] mechoriet: YEP VAT
[1:46:06] M1k3D3l7a: I got my 1080 at MSRP for 789

[1:46:17] Fligon_: @HostileLogOut ya ill probably continue the 80 and go 4080
[1:46:17] YoshAkaSynergi: What I really would love to know publicly, how much like Sony substitutes the cost of their console with games. And then get a respectable price for their mass produced gpu. And then compare this price to let's say the Nvidia 4070
[1:46:22] mechoriet: request the craft?
[1:46:26] daemonaedryn: ^
[1:46:28] luisSir23: was 1400 for a 4080 a good price?
[1:46:29] ToyBits88: where can i donwload a gpu :))
[1:46:29] Infinity127: 1060 6bg > everything
[1:46:32] M1k3D3l7a: USD -> EUR is usually 1:1, except when you import the GPU
[1:46:46] Nexhunter: oh wait we good
[1:46:46] kinglouisxvii: 2k for 3080ti a year ago
[1:46:48] HostileLogOut: @M1k3D3l7a its the other way lol.
[1:46:57] Nexhunter: USTR has delayed the GPU tariff for another 9 months YEP
[1:47:03] jmm548: i payed 800 for a 3080 ti
[1:47:05] Nexhunter: $700
[1:47:09] mechoriet: 899 or something
[1:47:10] Nexhunter: then went to $800
[1:47:13] Fligon_: wait what
[1:47:15] kingjord: I think you need better power
[1:47:27] poop_nukem: Feels good to buy a 3080 FE at msrp for 715$ after tax.
[1:47:27] Moobot: Come join the Waffle House Discord! <# https://discord.gg/fhGFtMuzdS
[1:47:30] xNotorietyx: iphone logic - put it at $1200 and ppl will buy it
[1:47:31] Nexhunter: tell Nvidia to not use TSMC pepeLaugh
[1:47:36] Konhacas: 4080s here in europe is 1400euros. 4090 is 2k
[1:47:44] Konhacas: Portugal, I mean
[1:47:45] Fligon_: Is the price increase also a performace increase or is it a linear increase in performacnce
[1:47:47] M1k3D3l7a: HostileLogOut USD w/o taxes = EUR w/ taxes, even though EUR is stronger than USD
[1:47:48] Kruvik: the 4090 is 3000 to 3500 usd in argentina with taxes
[1:47:48] MakerOfThingys: All GPU's feel like 2x when looking at MSRP
[1:47:51] Nitro3k: in the end off corona i payed 2.412,77USD for my 3080 ti im from Denmark :D
[1:47:52] HostileLogOut: welcome to inflation. every release had a higher price.
[1:48:00] Infinity127: cheapest 4090 in my country is like 2.3k $ KEKW
[1:48:09] jmm548: that should work
[1:48:13] xevos221: Maxing out the conduit?
[1:48:17] Nexhunter: @HostileLogOut doesn't help that TSMC has a straight up monopoly KEKW
[1:48:26] jordan2185: You can fit one more on the floor
[1:48:36] HostileLogOut: @Nexhunter cause no one can compete with a giant like that lol.
[1:48:37] stormzwest: connection?
[1:48:39] luisSir23: hmmm, went to my local micro center to make a build and go tone. I have the rest of the month to return it or exchange it. I just figured its waht they went for since they just came out last year
[1:48:46] stormzwest: ender io conduits are buffer no?
[1:48:51] Nexhunter: @HostileLogOut well it also about buying the machines before others pepeLaugh
[1:48:55] Apparentthreat: LTT talked about people/GPU makers are including the potential $$ they can earn mining, etc. into the cost of the GPU just like including potential $$ from renting out single-family homes when buying homes/real estate
[1:48:58] daemonaedryn: need 19 of those
[1:49:00] xevos221: EnderIO conduits are not per connection
[1:49:27] Commander_Cooler: I just got a 3070 ti for 959 Canadian after taxes and that was with a $ 200 off sale  :(
[1:49:34] stormzwest: @Giantwaffle energy per connection is thermal exclusive
[1:49:45] Nexhunter: @Apparentthreat well nvidia is also accounting in for tarrif hits but the USTR to everyone surprise delayed gpu tarrifs coming back for another 9 months
[1:49:53] Rongoel: I bought mz 3080ti at the for like 900 last zear
[1:49:58] daemonaedryn: if it was max bandwidth, increasing # of dynamos would not increase power
[1:50:04] le_Pure: Commander_Cooler bruh im still waiting for 1 under 900 PepeHands
[1:50:09] daemonaedryn: exactly
[1:50:10] HostileLogOut: imagine buying a 7900 XTX and then it overheats lols.
[1:50:12] fisering1: But is it max 32k through the p2p channel then?
[1:50:13] Winstonrocks: enderio is max connection but there is only one connection into the me p2p so each p2p is maxed at 32k power
[1:50:19] Apparentthreat: It's not like the "conduit" fills up like in other power mods.
[1:50:27] stormzwest: place a acapacitor bank between the dynamos andd power line and check IO
[1:50:27] daemonaedryn: Thats what im saying, its proof its not bandwidth
[1:50:37] Yogithebaer: ive missed the last few days and it looks like the done by new year goal didnt happen
[1:50:44] rododendro: there is a probe to see stats for the conduits, so you can check input and output and storage
[1:51:00] novaworkmannn: I think it counts the whole block area where the connection is so I don’t think this will work
[1:51:06] lilgangstagoth1: the conduit dose have a total capacity
[1:51:30] MrArrig: Coding wise its probably so much more efficient to not have each line have a bandwidth
[1:51:41] Fligon_: enderio is such a good pack god damn
[1:52:23] Dr_Alori: isn't µI micro I ?
[1:52:29] xevos221: I'm saying if you don't have enough p2p tunnels connected to the power supply, you won't fill all that power into your ME system, but I haven't seen how many tunnels you have there
[1:52:35] daemonaedryn: thats fast af
[1:52:49] Smithii: Micro Infinity

[2:30:12] Daryl_Kay: @Giantwaffle You mentioned yesterday crazy property taxes, are you planning on staying in austin?
[2:30:15] GuardMoony: It's worth noting that the VR/AR headset is totally different from the rumored Apple Glasses. Those are said to be purely AR-focused and aren't likely to arrive anytime soon. Meanwhile, the VR/AR headset could be here as soon as 2023, and it's likely to compete with the Meta Quest 2, PSVR 2 and all the other best VR headsets.

[2:35:21] Sui_Ume: @MakerOfThingys it's not entry level, it's high end, ~50 are entry level
[2:35:22] Larklen: GeForce NOW is low end Kappa
[2:35:22] boogerbomb01: Intel is low end
[2:35:22] Ranctifier: nvidia being greedy af
[2:35:27] Noxaris: low-end was delegated to Intel
[2:35:28] jmm548: yeah 3060 ti is like 400 now so is 4070ti twice the performance ?
[2:35:31] Rolymole09: Imagine low end GPU in 2023…..
[2:35:33] Jandakast: Do you need to increase the P2P Power Input nodes?
[2:35:34] lukasalbert: nvidia milking what they can get
[2:35:34] MakerOfThingys: @Sui_Ume So far
[2:35:35] niitrolol: Aren't the intel arc cards cheaper and almost better?
[2:35:42] Quinnerdude1: no
[2:35:42] Daryl_Kay: I have a 2080 and its not bad
[2:35:47] Grav1s: ARC is low end. LUL

[2:35:56] raironzera: Monopoly almost
[2:35:59] Rolymole09: No intel are not better… but they are cheaper
[2:36:00] boogerbomb01: But there are enough people with unlimited money that they will always sell out
[2:36:00] Moobot: Come join the Waffle House Discord! <# https://discord.gg/fhGFtMuzdS
[2:36:04] LiveType: @jmm548 Not quite abut about right yes.
[2:36:06] Sui_Ume: @Sui_Ume well, sales are at an all time low, they waiting for the market to recover
[2:36:08] CommanderUrsus: APU's are probably the low-end now
[2:36:10] MakerOfThingys: I'll just be on a second gen market
[2:36:13] CrasH_CTB: Buying new GPU for low end was never smart - it was always better to buy better used card.
[2:36:15] MakerOfThingys: or third
[2:36:24] lgamer7: wasn't the "chip shortage" actually faked or something?
[2:36:24] Unwanted_Endlessness: 3080ti here
[2:36:26] Sayiber: i'm already doing that KEKW
[2:36:26] Yogithebaer: im still on a 1070ti and have no issues
[2:36:29] mobfarmer: ARC cards are limited by the drivers,  if the game uses the latest driver version.. its okay, but older games don't have good support
[2:36:29] jmm548: i was using 1060 til last year
[2:36:30] JasonDM_: I went from a 1060 to a 3070
[2:36:30] CubicJazz: I want to upgrade from a 1660, and I might pick up an amd 6000 series
[2:36:32] AshhanX: something substantial will happen
[2:36:32] DragonApoc: VR will get you to buy a new one
[2:36:32] Tapeman83: YEP, I’m using my 3090 for like 10 years
[2:36:35] GalacticDrew: there won't be dedicated GPUs after the 50 series
[2:36:35] boogerbomb01: I only play MC so my 1070 is still good enough
[2:36:37] larrymancer: GPUs are not selling in volume anymore. Prices need to drop especially with crypto being dead.
[2:36:38] Grimstar_: what cpu are you packing?
[2:36:39] sournotspicy: im still on my 1080ti and its amazing
[2:36:39] Cooper_XX: buying are gpu every year is pretty stupid anyways
[2:36:44] splnterwow: as long as cards can keep up like you are saying it is better than the upgrade every year modle
[2:36:46] MakerOfThingys: The games I mostly play don't need top tier
[2:36:49] 1StClassAlcoholic: 2070 working like a dream, mostly using it to train AI though
[2:36:49] Smithii: Waiting for quantum gaming computers Kappa
[2:36:49] Turnpoint: im still in 1080 area
[2:36:52] Rolymole09: Man even 1080ti still pump fps in todays games
[2:36:55] MakerOfThingys: I just like new stuff
[2:36:58] CaveManBk: IM ON A 1050 TI LOL
[2:37:00] LiveType: 4090 is great. Well worth it over the 3090 if you can use the performance
[2:37:06] Koeckie: and you are working with it
[2:37:07] noxiiiouse: i want the new stuff but its to much money @Giantwaffle
[2:37:10] Littleme02: i'm rocking a 2070 and before that i had a 780. And before that i ad 2x275
[2:37:11] HostileLogOut: @Giantwaffle you dont need it either you already got a 3090 no?
[2:37:12] JimmyHuren: and you get tax wrtie-off
[2:37:12] TPells67: If your gonna upgrade make it t drastic but not unreasonable expensive
[2:37:15] Uzi_Shamgar: I went to a 6950xt and don't see much reason to upgrade anytime soon either. Nvidia's new stuff isn't worth it
[2:37:16] Grimstar_: What about your cpu?
[2:37:24] Dexy2811: yeah i went from 2080s to 4090 :P
[2:37:26] fbritoferreira: I think the new thing is going to be power efficiency to the 4000 series is the last one with this crazy power
[2:37:28] MakerOfThingys: It's great when you wait three generations to upgrade.
[2:37:29] Koeckie: TRUE!
[2:37:31] TheEmperor30k: as far as games go, i think tech has reached a point where we'll see a wave of engine-level optimizations over raw GPU power
[2:37:32] poop_nukem: @LiveType moon2CL
[2:37:38] Sentinel1_9: iirc even jayz2cents has said he would skip this gen at these prices @giantwaffle
[2:37:41] baconburgerfries: ugsToxic
[2:37:43] Rolymole09: Yea, everything dang expensive rn
[2:37:45] fishypooos: cost of living PepeHands
[2:37:49] BroCreed1: I think the market goes in cycles. Currently we are in a market situation where there was a high demand for high performance, but now we will enter a market where consumers want economical options and the suppliers will be forced to comply or meet lower revenue.
[2:37:53] michaelmichaelTV: gonna see alot more AMD cards i can tell you that
[2:37:54] Ranctifier: nvidia is greedy and made too many 3080s, so they priced the 4k series above them in an effort to get rid of their 3ks
[2:37:57] flacc1dfrenchfry: moon2GIGA
[2:38:16] baconburgerfries: relTato
[2:38:26] ZwuenieBoyy: trying to salvage as much as they can now
[2:38:26] StefanGab95: StefanGab95 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 20 months, currently on a 20 month streak! 4070ti is "lower" tho' COPIUM
[2:38:30] maccabeus: COPIUM crypto is gonna be huge bro
[2:38:35] LiveType: Not true. Folks are only buying the 4090. Everything else is still in stock
[2:38:38] splnterwow: didnt nvidea come out with that big press report like a year ago about making their cards worse for miners though
[2:38:39] Rolymole09: Cheaper to limit production than to sell at a loss
[2:38:45] Tamerlain: they priced it with 3080 be 4060 performance in mind
[2:38:52] poop_nukem: They priced to to cut out the middle man scalping cards from the COVID and GPU shortage. But the demand is lower now and they are hurting bad on their greedy move.
[2:38:55] jmm548: if amd can keep up the compitition maybe it will help on next generation
[2:38:56] Littleme02: din't we all agree the stupid prices was to encourage selling of the large stocks of 3000series cards?
[2:39:00] fbritoferreira: nvidia is just not going to release lower end card this gen to salvage their stuff, they tried to have two 3080 for a reason
[2:39:05] GuardMoony: The problem is more for the vendors of GPU's.
[2:39:10] LVL97Magikarp: youre saying it wrong, its TIE not TI lmao
[2:39:11] Koeckie: I mean 3080 is still 1k
[2:39:11] boogerbomb01: I woke up too late for breakfast so whats for lunch?
[2:39:16] Skurt2k: if you gonna spend 1500 on a 4080 might as well pay more for a 4090
[2:39:18] Tamerlain: like cmon guyz they still pumping 3080 production and launching new models here and there for 2 old product
[2:39:19] obylix: I just built a high end PC as a non enthusiast that I wanted to keep it usable for 8 years. and I put a 4080 in it (bought at cost, so $300, below MSRP) and I'm okay with it
[2:39:21] StarThiefAtomsk: That's why I just buy last gen cards.
[2:39:23] Sentinel1_9: @giantwaffle only 4090 if they want 3080 theyre going amd or 3090
[2:39:31] lgamer7: @boogerbomb01  never too late for breakfast
[2:39:31] lukasalbert: ayaya ?
[2:39:40] Dagmoo: theres probably going to be a lot of people like me who switched intel/nvidia to amd/radeon for the first time

[2:39:42] TPells67: I have a 1080 gtx is that good?? I have no idea about electronics
[2:40:06] LethalBro: So close to half way through mid-game Pog
[2:40:25] GalacticDrew: 50 series will attempt to max out at 1500W wall outlet.  After that we will see a 60 series with more performance/W with similar performance to 50 series.  Then much reduced SOC to lower power more like ARM or Apple are doing
[2:40:28] Sui_Ume: @TPells67 if it runs your games fine, it's the best in the world POG

[2:40:52] wonly: this feels like runescape in the sense that the amount of work to progress doubles every 7 quests completed
[2:40:53] Dagmoo: @tpells67 considering how old it is 1080 is still solid

[2:41:24] obylix: @tamerlain the 1070 it's replacing is over 8 years old and still works fine

[4:06:15] Lemures322: I got my Masters in EE because I wanted to harness the power of the universe, creating order out of the chaos, bending the universe to my will.  Instead I just answer non-engineer's emails all day, while non-engineer's look at all of my hard work and make money-based decisions instead of good sense ones.  Bah.
[4:06:25] Sentinel1_9: that makes 2 also
[4:06:51] zzzDai: How much Signalium did you end up with this morning?

[4:10:17] Larklen: warm-up week :)
[4:10:39] Firstnecron: Took me a few hours to get back up to speed
[4:10:42] Movinggun1: I had 135 tickets waiting for me at work today was not fun. is what happens when you don't work for 2 weeks
[4:10:45] Apparentthreat: week after is full of "remember what we talked about 2 weeks ago"
[4:10:47] MakerOfThingys: I worked half the day yesterday to catch up
[4:10:50] Apparentthreat: then going over that again
[4:10:57] Smileynator: Do you think new minecraft versions will ever see as active a modding scene as 1.12?
[4:10:57] TigerLuv: well I am glad I am stuck with you LUL
[4:11:05] M1k3D3l7a: can't wait to come back on the 5th to hopefully see all my diplo clearances Prayge

[4:12:06] Gamernxc: tetris is a hard game
[4:12:15] SyriiAdvent: just have openGPT make it. ezpz
[4:12:16] Smileynator: tetris is not that complex though..?
[4:12:23] OrangeW2: man i just loaded my project up to do some work Madge
[4:12:31] kuraff1: Since I'm stuck here, I guess it's perfect time for a first time chat FeelsOkayMan
[4:12:44] silv: pull up
[4:12:48] Larklen: Pull up but not that high KEKW
[4:12:51] Shantrix: only for long videos
[4:12:52] Sentinel1_9: it literally tells you LUL
[4:13:13] Smileynator: structure
[4:13:16] scssquatch: SOLID principles
[4:13:16] jinkleft: You don't need that many classes. It's just a part of object oriented programming.
[4:13:16] Gamernxc: to be self contained
[4:13:24] raironzera: i fucking love OOp
[4:13:25] OrangeW2: tetris is a deep as shit game when you get down to the nitty-gritty with technical piece movement
[4:13:25] SyriiAdvent: you build a object inside another object
[4:13:27] SmartDoll: didn't you just say 20 mins ago that you know programming OMEGALUL
[4:13:29] mahoriiii77: OOP
[4:13:30] FusRohDakkaDakka: Inheritance
[4:13:31] iamforever27: Controller for the controller waffleSTARE
[4:13:31] Daryl_Kay: Really you only need block and tetromino
[4:13:32] MagnesiumOxide: So you could play multiple games of tetris inside the same app
[4:13:33] 0x000000: that's a relationship
[4:13:33] vilgot: inheritance
[4:13:34] SailorWS: OOP
[4:13:35] JasonDM_: too used to using CSS
[4:13:36] brom321: Polymorphism?
[4:13:39] LethalBro: Inheritance, not having to give certain attributed to things multiple times
[4:13:41] Qbertman: OOP is super important lol
[4:13:43] RationalLies: App -> plays Tetris -> Has Tetromino -> Is specific Block
[4:13:44] SailorWS: its so you can build stuff in modules
[4:13:45] TheGreatLemon: inheritance (classes in classes) are used to generalize functions that multiple subclasses need so that you don't duplicate code.
[4:13:45] Smithii: @Giantwaffle Class shape with common code for class square and circle
[4:13:48] Rongoel: @raironzera OOP is whz i stopped my degree LUL
[4:13:51] Smileynator: tetris is the game, tetromino is the name for a tetris piece, and then 1 "type" per block type it seems? Otherwise i don't get it.
[4:13:52] DarkbuilderX: App handles the window creation and stuff, Tetris for the actual game
[4:14:00] Algias: "built in" is not really the best phrasing. Its better to think of it as "uses an instance of" for composition, or "is a" for inheritance
[4:14:00] Moobot: Come join the Waffle House Discord! <# https://discord.gg/fhGFtMuzdS
[4:14:06] Sentinel1_9: waffleSTARE MathTime
[4:14:10] mobfarmer: APP is the framework,   tetris is the things that make the game special  tetris...
[4:14:29] mobfarmer: yep..
[4:14:35] Gamernxc: KEKW
[4:14:43] bobolpwnz: You want to separate the game logic from drawing/window
[4:14:44] jinkleft: Start with tictactoe lol
[4:14:46] TheGreatLemon: @Giantwaffle look up some youtube stuff on gridworld. It's a java inheritance example that does a good job of explaining OOP and inheritance/encapsulation
[4:14:47] Mr_Jarv1s: All classes are passed child objects so they can call them
[4:14:56] Derdrom_TJM: Ya that is the only down side with those coding projects you have been doing
[4:15:00] Larklen: need 47 of those, ye?
[4:15:01] Smileynator: The idea is just "segmenting the responsibility" the draw class draws, you pass it things to draw, and that is all it will do. So if something isn't draw related, you don't need to look at draw class. etc. etc. for all other classes.
[4:15:34] Variosit: mongus
[4:15:36] Smileynator: Headfirst C# does a good explanation of it somewhere in that PDF
[4:15:37] DarkbuilderX: Vent Susge
[4:15:44] Sentinel1_9: why is there a SUSSY monitor
[4:15:59] TPells67: You have 4 extra tempered glass
[4:16:11] omar_i_: is twitch broken?
[4:16:12] sp4wn999: 48 LUL
[4:16:22] silv: no :tf:
[4:16:25] Larklen: @omar21cu oh yeah
[4:16:32] PureSpider: very broken
[4:16:55] Askjong: If you refresh you can see the stream but can't type
[4:16:59] Smileynator: Waffle, what kind of world are you plaything this mod in? Lost cities, Void?
[4:17:01] All_Tech: wow nobody's streaming on twitch this site really is dying Kappa
[4:17:16] KnightofObv: missing a layer, right?
[4:17:23] DarkbuilderX: This seems short
[4:17:33] Smileynator: So you just up and left lost cities to build somewhere else?
[4:17:55] Mr_Jarv1s: don't forget to move the "middle-middle" block
[4:17:56] Smileynator: just underground
[4:18:22] Smileynator: "accurate" tetris is harder, yes :P
[4:18:26] OrangeW2: yeah, there's a specific set of rules for tetris and whatnot
[4:18:27] PureSpider: you can't LEAVE it, it endlessly generates city
[4:18:27] Sentinel1_9: need to move the middle block on that layer @Giantwaffle
[4:18:32] dennis3833: move the middle as karvis said
[4:18:33] CosmicAxle: middle on
[4:18:39] Smileynator: @PureSpider
[4:18:47] PureSpider: hole is in the wrong space now
[4:19:04] gonefishing88: !mc_pack
[4:19:04] Moobot: The December modpack, Nomifactory (GTCEu Port) is in full swing !!! | https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/nomi-ceu | The bois were unable to complete the pack before New Years. Can they still beat it in one month? Tune in to every stream to find out!
[4:19:05] Smileynator: You can actually leave to another dimension if the mods allow it :P
[4:19:08] All_Tech: i saw nothing loading and thought i was banned
[4:19:20] All_Tech: BibleThump
[4:19:26] M1k3D3l7a: D:
[4:19:27] Smileynator: You are banned KEKW site wide
[4:19:27] Larklen: BOP
[4:19:34] PureSpider: yea i'm super delayed, don't mind me :D dont wanna reload stream
[4:19:35] omar_i_: Sadge
[4:19:40] Daryl_Kay: You could just hardcode the rotating, its not too complecated
[4:19:41] poop_nukem: moon2NOO my account
[4:19:44] All_Tech: waffle got connections
[4:19:53] Sentinel1_9: @PureSpider just pause and unpause
[4:20:01] PureSpider: Sentinel1_9 does that not break the stream?
[4:20:08] Sentinel1_9: didnt for me
[4:20:11] Firstnecron: No, streams are fine
[4:20:13] PureSpider: 🤞
[4:20:23] PureSpider: okay cool, 1.5s delay now :D
[4:21:09] PureSpider: video (watching) and video (broadcasting) both say "major outage" on the status page so i was a bit concerned
[4:21:18] OrangeW2: there are 6 rotation rulesets for Tetris, but most modern ones use SRS, which is neat
[4:21:45] sneakyHoovy: PauseChamp
[4:21:58] OrangeW2: when unobstructed, yeah
[4:22:19] kane1941: hatches prob need something insane
[4:22:19] Moobot: You can sub to Waffle by clicking this neat link -> twitch.tv/giantwaffle/subscribe SUBprise
[4:22:24] PureSpider: if you know that the pieces in tetris are called "tetrominoes", you're a goddamn nerd seqKEK
[4:22:29] Smileynator: i mean, they needed to, because math was expensive
[4:22:33] OrangeW2: making Tetris as a first project is reaaaaaally daunting because of its surprising depth
[4:22:50] mechoriet: pepeLaugh they updated it now: " Service Negatively Impacted"
[4:22:51] Mr_Jarv1s: Didn't Patti make a generator for PTFE?
[4:22:57] IlsaGold: Feels wrong though that they will change row when you rotate
[4:23:06] Allmostdone: start with tic-tac-toe
[4:23:16] Smileynator: You can now use computercraft, and make tetris in lua, inside minecraft
[4:23:16] mechoriet: "We have received reports of impacted services. This could manifest in chat not working, login difficulties, search impaired, etc. We're looking into the issue."
[4:23:35] Larklen: KEKW
[4:23:42] OrangeW2: @Allmostdone tic-tac-toe was my first game project, the win condition was pretty fun to think about
[4:24:02] lukasalbert: thhats weird
[4:24:04] Allmostdone: it should be Waffle's too
[4:24:13] lukasalbert: maybe disable insert
[4:24:13] sp4wn999: the curcit is miussing
[4:24:17] lukasalbert: and then enable it again ?

[5:10:58] Appz: off socials since 2012 (minus twitch) and has been a blessing for sanity
[5:10:58] lgamer7: i think the main take away is people's intentions. if people intend to be disrespectful and hateful , it's not going to matter which words they use to do it. changing the language in which to do it is like putting a band-aid over a bullet hole and expecting the hole to stop bleeding

[5:13:17] Gamernxc: problems create problems
[5:13:18] CommanderUrsus: roads paved with good intentions
[5:13:22] TLV_TV: this woke thing will cause 10x more problems
[5:13:23] ItsHandyManny: Because we come up with a solution without thinking of the repercussions
[5:13:23] Rongoel: Yea. Its why i find the german thing of saying "Sie" when talking to someone as a sign of respect stupid. Cause i can say "Sie" with a whole lot of disrespect LUL
[5:13:24] Yogithebaer: what list are we talking about
[5:13:26] Smileynator: Yay sadness
[5:13:26] lgamer7: @Makaheehee  does it? A slur is a slur. and slurs are meant to be hateful and hurtful
[5:13:27] bcdmonkey: That’s war Bb

[5:13:37] Smileynator: It's called arms race btw
[5:13:38] yuhikyaku: just in everyday society
[5:13:40] Koeckie: we have too much time to think about something like that
[5:13:42] Smileynator: even though i can't use race anymore

[5:14:09] tomey36: @giantwaffle check if your barium alloy is crafting

[5:14:16] Daryl_Kay: Hold on, they say toi not use thug, but to use suspect or criminal, but then they say to not use convict becauuse it defines someone by their actions, doesnt criminal do that?
[5:14:16] GET_SHARKD: My favourite race is the 200m one :)
[5:14:32] AlphaWarrior987: u need power
[5:14:34] CxVH: you need power
[5:14:43] RoyalHares: While this list is suppose to be "inclusive" or corrections, it's also still exclusive. Example is it has "African-Amercian" but doesn't include other cultures as well. What about the other minorities? Seems like it creates more of a mess / confusion

[5:15:50] DaddyDiddy: well you need a couple thousand iridium and osmium so you'll be sending quite a few tier 4s
[5:16:10] Makaheehee: @lgamer7 What slurs are you talking about specifically? N gets used frequently between friends.
[5:16:19] bcdmonkey: “Hi! Do you have an engineering degree? Do you like job security? Do you want to be payed a lot to do not a lot? Are you ok with knowing what you help design definitely will be put on a weapon and the moral dilemma that comes with it? Defense Contractor is the job for you!”

[5:17:15] x1xamen: classic
[5:17:18] 0x4273: @Makaheehee if you call your friends those slurs then it says more about you than the list
[5:17:19] lgamer7: @Makaheehee makes sense.
[5:17:23] Daryl_Kay: Litterally the IT Crowd
[5:17:24] lvyEartman: have you tried turning it on and off again?

[5:18:35] TuomiO1: I once had to drive 30km to a site to plug in an UPS to powersocket. Onsite there was 10ish teacherse who could not figure it out.

[6:14:04] daemonaedryn: @phoss2k Getting into lategame stuff, more high-end-midgame
[6:14:15] nxusr: no DML, no coins, steam, no creative tank (replaced by another type of microminers), and harder recipes
[6:14:20] akitsuki_: magic mods are the best type of mods, fight me
[6:14:22] BuLLeT_LV: D;'
[6:14:22] rofl1436: magic mods succ hard
[6:14:23] lukasalbert: dude

[6:14:40] lukasalbert: this version is so much better already with just thte tablet <3
[6:14:44] coolcake2: I also really dislike when a modpack is forcing me to use magic mods. Last i played one of those, i straight cheated my way throught them
[6:15:00] nxusr: I'm also on team "fuck magic mods"
[6:15:03] akitsuki_: tech mods are always 17 different ways to to do the same thing. magic mods are all unique mechanics with cool gimmicks.

[6:16:58] coolcake2: @coolcake2 Im not gonna fight how any1 should play minecraft. Just wondering how many people prefer magic mods
[6:18:21] daemonaedryn: watch videos
[6:18:25] Purecrew: Anyone know if there is a way to do a floating world save between 2 computers or would I have to manually move it all the time.

[6:19:03] GameDadel: melvor?
[6:19:05] yonikasz2: VC?
[6:19:07] yonikasz2: what is VC
[6:19:10] yonikasz2: venture capital?
[6:19:13] 0x4273: version control
[6:19:16] luvistra: Heard some use github for MC world saves
[6:19:22] Purecrew: I guess I could just pay for a server
[6:19:25] sorefingers: i remember playing a modpack with friends, at the point my friend finished his Tavern and brewing mead i was zooming around burning 500 netherstars a second to fuel my definitely not a nuke factory hahaha
[6:19:33] Sui_Ume: shouldnt you keep it going, as it will be limiting you later on?
[6:19:33] yonikasz2: you said you needed VC to share  a world file
[6:19:39] sorefingers: we both had a blast
[6:19:42] tomey36: It could be overwhelming because not enough previous steps automated
[6:19:54] CeeDreamer: You want a fun and nice mental break check out Chef Amaury Guichon he makes some amazing things
[6:19:54] OrangeW2: @Purecrew maybe a network drive, have a script set up to migrate the save, and a script on the other end to pull the world save from said drive? just an idea
[6:20:07] sellinglobbies150: I think you need to have more sleeping streams, get rid of those tired eyes lol
[6:20:07] Trollsamaa: @sorefingers sounds like your blast was significantly bigger
[6:20:14] LuciferSpirt: YEP future waffle problem screw the red alloy dust
[6:20:24] yonikasz2: I don't do homies. Homies is on that Stanford List. Please stop using that word Waffle.

[6:20:32] boogerbomb01: Patreon*
[6:20:33] DareDeFlug: eww
[6:20:35] nxusr: can we ship you plushies to hug?
[6:20:36] Schutter07: click it
[6:20:38] b0ltz12: yea you would need version control to share a world. I think technically google drive has VC, but I wouldn't trust it.
[6:20:40] Atzgee: only fans allowed Kappa
[6:20:43] IHaveShirts: for onlywaffle fans
[6:21:09] Gotizie: @Purecrew you could check out Aternos they allow servers for free but are turned off once there is no activity in the server if that makes sense
[6:21:26] dennis3833: automate them?
[6:21:27] Gotizie: like user activity not in game activity
[6:21:30] boogerbomb01: Yes usually you do indeed make more stuff when you are out of stuff
[6:21:30] slyscaz: have yallbeen to the moon? and how close do you think yall close to beating this mod
[6:21:44] Flobu_: do we finally automate it?
[6:22:00] 0x4273: manually crafting circuits after 100 hours DansGame
[6:22:03] Flobu_: we did it now like 10 times manually already
[6:22:11] Gotizie: only draw back to Aternos really is the fact they may not have the mod pack you want
[6:22:26] DareDeFlug: Why not like now or tomorrow
[6:22:40] lilgangstagoth1: power
[6:22:44] Purecrew: I feel like a server wouldnt be very expensive and dealing with figuring out the vc issues isnt worth my time.
[6:22:50] LuciferSpirt: p2p?
[6:23:12] Sui_Ume: @Giantwaffle maybe it needs an own p2p network?
[6:23:19] boyownik: Is there renewable manganese source?
[6:23:21] Rongoel: Do it like me and run it on your microsoft surface LUL
[6:23:21] mobfarmer: you spent a couple hours  upgrading power today.

[6:46:09] MrHashbrowns: oh is that what happned to the servers?
[6:46:11] bandani: i feel like there is a 'supposed' to do things a certain way and what actually happens
[6:46:31] daemonaedryn: is it connected?
[6:46:54] mobfarmer: the problem is for longer runs,  even though the fiber cables start out on totally different routes, in some places many fibers get merged to the same conduit because its the best path between multiple cities
[6:46:58] plattnotpratt: We just put in a bunch of t-posts in the property, and had 811 come out to identify all lines around the property.
[6:47:39] plattnotpratt: they try to have it 3ft deep before grading of land

[6:54:30] PragmaticThoth: pepeLaugh
[6:54:31] Smileynator: isn't there a tool to do the math for you in this pack?
[6:54:39] TheWonderLlama: Should be done by New Years

[6:55:38] b0ltz12: might want to automate all the tungsten varients, I think there are 2-3 important tungsten alloys for progression iirc.

[6:57:42] suicidebolt: @R1Rider01 You are not wrong but everytime I had seen Minecraft before it looked to boring to me, this seemed challenging enough that I might not be able to to do it and that made me want to find out if I could.
[6:57:42] Moobot: You can find Waffle's Youtube channel here - https://youtube.com/giantwaffle
[6:58:03] R1Rider01: @suicidebolt good luck, lol

[7:01:30] Rongoel: The 8 plates
[7:01:32] Yakobro: more smelters :)
[7:01:43] jayrickson87: what about reactor fuel
[7:01:50] TOCO__: can't you automate that?
[7:01:55] daemonaedryn: reactor fuel is thorium
[7:01:58] Lupic: @suicidebolt as this is a tech pack, advice is to play in peaceful mode like waffle is doing so you're not bogged down with mobs attacking you or getting in the way
[7:02:00] daemonaedryn: which is just black granite
[7:02:23] Lupic: I put like 10 hours into starting this pack on the weekend before I ran out of time, I had only just got the first two tier 1 machines ha
[7:02:38] suicidebolt: @Lupic Yeah I did that so should be good to just mess about
[7:02:48] jayrickson87: you will need a stack of thermal centrifuges because of the long process time
[7:03:22] Grunden: gregTech has always been hardcore for sure.
[7:03:25] daemonaedryn: macerated black granite
[7:03:31] DaddyDiddy: A stack? @jayrickson87 I had about 7 stacks of thermal centrifuges for thorium
[7:03:33] b0ltz12: for the fuel
[7:03:39] DaddyDiddy: No for tbu fuel
[7:03:40] SailorWS: time to build out and upgrade all the EBFs?
[7:03:40] Yakobro: can you make the multi ebf yet?
[7:03:51] DaddyDiddy: You need thermal centrifuges
[7:04:08] Venamah: you mean 20 EBFS isnt enough?
[7:04:30] daemonaedryn: @DaddyDiddy Ah you were talking bout the next step, gotcha
[7:04:43] Saytos1: run all justli2Happy

[7:04:49] Venamah: just grind out the nichrome coil blocks
[7:04:55] b0ltz12: is wallsharing of the ebf's still a thing?
[7:05:10] tomey36: They are not running all the time they are not being used efficiently
[7:05:14] PowerDimex: are you running the hard mode/Expert mode ?
[7:05:21] dennis3833: why dont u wallshare them?
[7:05:40] b0ltz12: i see
[7:05:47] dennis3833: alright
[7:05:47] Moobot: Come join the Waffle House Discord! <# https://discord.gg/fhGFtMuzdS
[7:05:52] lukasalbert: makes enough sense
[7:05:54] DaddyDiddy: @daemonszyman yeah because of how much power I needed I was going through thousands of tbu fuel an hour for all my reactors
[7:05:56] Rongoel: Maybe do a set of 4 that do the sharing?
[7:05:59] Venamah: if your upgrading them all to nichrome, id shrink them down and have them wall share
[7:06:03] Caldarr: @PowerDimex no they arent
[7:06:16] end3avor_: you just... upgrade all 4
[7:06:18] PowerDimex: thanks
[7:06:30] 1killersquirrel: @Giantwaffle soon it might make sense to change the place of each crafting recipie so they don't stack on each other's processes, like randomise the recepies in the processors
[7:06:41] lukasalbert: what is that display ?
[7:06:45] lukasalbert: and how do you use it ?
[7:07:05] daemonaedryn: @DaddyDiddy Got it, I didnt do the fission part in our server I was focused on circuits LUL
[7:07:14] kane1941: like DSP / Factorio production line calculators
[7:07:25] Rongoel: missign 2 LUL
[7:07:29] lukasalbert: yo thats insane

[7:08:30] prairydog: kruzDerp
[7:08:35] Jolle450: It's not that bad, takes like 10 minutes to understand the controls.
[7:08:40] PureSpider: just run actual wires already
[7:08:42] Jolle450: And 20 minutes to learn to use it
[7:08:48] sorefingers: wouldnt you need a electric blast alloy furnace to smelt tungstensteel?🤔 so a normal alloy smelter can melt tungsten but an ebf is needed to melt the dust🙃
[7:08:56] Purecrew: what is the process of making the next power cable and runnning it through the base?
[7:09:07] PureSpider: @Purecrew none

[7:20:09] Tweeton: 171 down to 107, which if we get 4 out of 23.... hmm
[7:20:19] sorefingers: does a microminer only run on e so you only get a few stacks of materials?
[7:20:27] MrWardy_: why not have an ebf for every ingot?
[7:20:38] boogerbomb01: MOAR EBF's!!!
[7:20:59] Yakobro: @MrWardy_ they need more than one for some due to smelt time
[7:21:15] phoss2k: side quest Kreygasm
[7:21:21] MrWardy_: also why are they not wall sharing?
[7:21:29] boogerbomb01: Isnt thers some kind of new multiebf thingy?

[7:21:55] kane1941: you gonna need billions more
[7:21:57] Jolle450: More machines = faster
[7:21:58] boyownik: Yeah, that stage of pack where you price everything in time KEKW
[7:22:02] flamingblaster: @giantwaffle, you saying aluminum instead of aluminium is triggering me
[7:22:15] b0ltz12: if you think 6 hours of tungsten is a long time, don't look at how much neutronium you need.
[7:22:19] mobfarmer: make more machines to process the crazy stuff.
[7:22:20] Kuroiorb: welcome to america @flamingblaster

[7:22:23] Purecrew: If you had IV and EV circuits automated you could make ingots much faster right?
[7:22:39] daemonaedryn: At a certain point, materials become meaningless and the buffer is time
[7:22:40] boogerbomb01: Yeah Waffle, if you want to go full Euro on everything else you have to call it Aluminium now.
[7:22:52] kane1941: your buffers are too low

[7:23:50] Algias: Can't you just increase the requests?
[7:23:51] MrWardy_: i am at the same stage as you guys and have about 20x more macjines making passive stuff
[7:24:02] Sui_Ume: @Giantwaffle why don't you just increase the buffer, I mean the interfaces has 9 slots
[7:24:03] Minelmonia: can u autocraft into a regular chest and have a storage buss on that chest?
[7:24:05] The_Holas: yeah you showd just turn night mode on that autocraft stacks of items Kappa
[7:24:07] PureSpider: flamingblaster look i dont like it either but that's the way it's gonna be
[7:24:14] Kuroiorb: someone needs some tea
[7:24:15] DragonApoc: Are you still mining ores manually at this point ?
[7:24:28] Caldarr: now that you have warmed up with this pack, when GTNH?
[7:24:43] kane1941: @DragonApoc they stopped mining manually on like day 2

[7:31:05] dennis3833: put the energy input into the front and try to share the 4amps
[7:31:23] dennis3833: lets try^^
[7:31:47] Flobu_: can you see how much amp the machines are using?
[7:31:47] Moobot: Come join the Waffle House Discord! <# https://discord.gg/fhGFtMuzdS
[7:32:14] JHoyt74: Holy cow i havent been in this stream in forever
[7:32:17] simoncs: didnt u say 15
[7:32:17] lilgangstagoth1: didnt u say 15
[7:32:56] novicio_: @Giantwaffle  werent you supposed to finished this mod pack BEFORE 2023?
[7:33:03] Discoverer123: i think there are 5 of them arent there?
[7:33:34] Bulltank: @novicio_ COPIUM
[7:33:41] Ezrion1: 5
[7:34:01] novicio_: @Bulltank Copium it is
[7:34:03] Sui_Ume: @novicio_ he will finish it by 2023 COPIUM
[7:34:17] kidgrim2001_: Kappa200 do you think fusion energy is actually “20 years away” now
[7:34:29] JHoyt74: What happened to nerdfusion?
[7:34:38] Tapeman83: "sort of"
[7:34:49] ligerzerof: it
[7:34:49] Askjong: We generated 1.5x power
[7:34:51] splix661: electric tools for crafting could be useful?
[7:34:51] Smileynator: but yeah still many hurdles it seems
[7:34:53] Loopy9999: more a milestone than breakthrough
[7:34:59] Kuroiorb: became a different company, waffle left a while ago @JHoyt74
[7:35:00] ligerzerof: it's a scientific equivalent of a party trick
[7:35:06] kidgrim2001_: We broke even on the amount of laser energy put in but overall it was still negative
[7:35:08] Ricotez: fusion has been 20 years away for like 50 years now
[7:35:09] novicio_: @Sui_Ume  in 2023 or before the end of 2023?
[7:35:11] ligerzerof: it's completely non practical
[7:35:12] Sui_Ume: @Giantwaffle it's the first time they produced more power then they inserted, the problem is it lasted only for like a microsecond
[7:35:12] Smileynator: problem is "making it run longer, without massive overhead/cost/maintenance" for the most of them.
[7:35:15] Armathur: its not decay
[7:35:18] plattnotpratt: fusion is just combining
[7:35:21] coolcake2: E = MC^2. we sacrafise M for E
[7:35:22] Damos1212: the energy comes from the released neutrons i think?
[7:35:24] deadgolfer: combing element releases the energy
[7:35:25] Armathur: you fuse the elements
[7:35:26] JHoyt74: @Kuroiorb Oh okay Thank you! Havent been in stream in a bit
[7:35:28] Sam_1443: its not the daecay the fusion process releases energy
[7:35:29] Rollingx: It’s the process of fusion that produces energy
[7:35:31] Variosit: its not ammount of the energy we can currently get
[7:35:31] Loopy9999: yea its still net negative by factors
[7:35:35] DrYProtoss: heavy = 2 light + excess energy
[7:35:36] HolyIceCube: mass different
[7:35:36] prairydog: creates energy
[7:35:41] Grunden: It's the strong nuclear force
[7:35:42] Narcotical: 'just combining' is a bit of an understatement
[7:35:42] SuicidalSquirrel: You fire lasers at the elements to excite them and they fuse and release more energy. They have just released more than they put in
[7:35:44] Smileynator: fusion makes the same energy as atom splitting in atomic bombs
[7:35:45] DaChibi: Simone Gietz did basic fusion in her workshop in a recent vid.
[7:35:47] Sui_Ume: @novicio_ both LUL
[7:35:48] ligerzerof: no, it loses mass
[7:35:50] coolcake2: E = MC^2. We sacrafise M for E
[7:35:51] Variosit: its the ammount of energy we get out of a system vs putting in
[7:35:51] Kashada: Kashada subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 31 months! Good evening champs and champettes
[7:35:51] keittehvan: up to iron, the fusion releases energy, after iron it consumes
[7:35:54] SpiderQueen7202: Nah, the combining releases neutrons and heat
[7:35:54] Dagmoo: well not fusion but it was Lawrence Livermore labs hit a laser on some crystal and got positive energy
[7:35:57] Ricotez: if you're making something lighter than iron it gives off energy, if you're making something heavier than iron it takes energy
[7:35:59] monepok: the resulting atom has less mass than the ingredients
[7:36:00] DrYProtoss: the heavy weighs less than the sum of the two lights
[7:36:01] iKyuute: The breakthrough was that they put in less energy than they got back
[7:36:02] Askjong: Video time? PauseChamp
[7:36:03] PotatoWielder: it's the e=mc^2, the difference in mass get released as radiation
[7:36:05] jayjjalen: smart ass twitch chat for no reason xD
[7:36:07] omar_i_: the problem isnt with making the fusion happen, its all about making net positive energy from it
[7:36:08] DrYProtoss: the excess mass comes out as energy
[7:36:09] lazyhot: @coolcake2 correct!
[7:36:11] Grav1s: The problem was always that it took more energy for fusion than what it produced.
[7:36:14] Smileynator: 2 things combine, some lose parts come off AGRESSIVELY and those make for good energy.
[7:36:15] Lenny1130: @Giantwaffle In a fusion reaction, two light nuclei merge to form a single heavier nucleus. The process releases energy because the total mass of the resulting single nucleus is less than the mass of the two original nuclei. The leftover mass becomes energy. end qutoe
[7:36:15] zloezelo: fusion is IRL cheating
[7:36:16] Sam_1443: theres a good video on fusion
[7:36:17] jayjjalen: mfs just start randomly talking about nuclear fusion
[7:36:18] Gamernxc: probably the smartest twitch chat :o
[7:36:20] jayjjalen: funny af
[7:36:21] hombrahh: There is a press conference clip where the dude explains it quick and simply
[7:36:32] Kuroiorb: For react andy time @Giantwaffle https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0IIXINcCeM
[7:36:33] Dagmoo: the breakthrough wasnt fusion though technically
[7:36:34] Saytos1: yes
[7:36:37] Variosit: yeah but thats the breakthrough
[7:36:39] kidgrim2001_: Kappa100 when you fuse atoms it doesn’t necessarily add mass so when you get the new element that excess mass is turned into heat which makes steam and turns a turbine
[7:36:43] Variosit: we can now do that
[7:36:43] Stoods_: The energy comes from e=mc^2, so you take two hevier atoms and turn them into a light atom. The missing matter gets turned into energy.
[7:36:44] Blazedude99: what does a better muffler even do?
[7:36:47] Gamernxc: did u watch the new settled video btw
[7:36:52] Kuroiorb: we just finally were able to get more energy out of the reaction than we put in to make fusion happen
[7:36:53] Lenny1130: @Giantwaffle the mass of the atom created from the two atoms in fusion in less than the mass of the two atoms
[7:36:57] Andersxa: so with the e=mc^2 formula is it then energy = (m1-m2)*c^2? from fusion?
[7:36:59] BlueberryKing: Combining elements lighter than iron releases energy (so fusion is done with hydrogen). Splitting heavy elements releases energy (so fission is done with uranium), the changeover between those two happens at iron
[7:37:01] Venamah: basically fusion, is making a minutre sun on earth
[7:37:10] coolcake2: The Problem is that even thought "Techincally" we got more energy INside the chamber, the Total energy of the system is still negative @Giantwaffle
[7:37:12] Tapeman83: i'm not really a fan of the single inventory slot
[7:37:13] DJ_4point0: Lemme go crack out my phisics notes
[7:37:14] Askjong: no
[7:37:19] Gamernxc: i dislike the concept too
[7:37:19] Askjong: we like that stuff
[7:37:21] sogerr: 2 atoms fuse and release neutrons to keep stable, the neutrons released at high speed heat water next to it and then its normal steam energy flow
[7:37:24] minizen: is it the 1 inv slot?
[7:37:33] minizen: ohh i saw that, didnt click on it
[7:37:38] Tapeman83: what I did like was his idea of being able to unlock more slots as he goes
[7:37:40] 334Productions: Check out Real Engineering's video on the fusion company Helion
[7:37:46] daemonaedryn: so... its just going to be a lot of walking to banks?
[7:38:00] SailorWS: he did a 1 hp triple jad too
[7:38:08] SailorWS: and 1 prayer
[7:38:17] Armathur: @Giantwaffle basically if you try to fuse 2 hydrogen atoms they are heavier then the combined helium atom so the exess mass gets released as energy or something like this
[7:38:19] minizen: ^ i saw that
[7:38:23] Stoods_: Also, one of the main things with fusion reactors is that they need to produce tritium, since it is really hard to get tritium naturally
[7:38:34] Narcotical: Job for future Waffle
[7:38:47] prairydog: need more signs MiniK
[7:38:56] Smileynator: let's wind down, and watch videos of fusion reactors Kappa
[7:39:06] DaFez_: Can those share walls and reduce the amount of blocks needed?
[7:39:25] coolcake2: @Armathur you got it
[7:39:38] Armathur: @Armathur ty
[7:39:44] prairydog: bit tight der
[7:39:47] Tapeman83: EV energy hatches for max speed? majinPause
[7:39:47] Moobot: You can sub to Waffle by clicking this neat link -> twitch.tv/giantwaffle/subscribe SUBprise
[7:39:48] Thegrinch6: Are you having fun?
[7:40:08] coolcake2: @Giantwaffle yes but they use H2 and H3 (deutirium and tritium)
[7:40:15] Wetware: Yep
[7:40:16] monepok: you use hydrogen atoms with extra neutrons
[7:40:17] Lenny1130: @Giantwaffle hydrogen is 1 proton. deuterium and tritium are hydrogen with extra neutrons
[7:40:18] Armathur: It exactly what the sun does
[7:40:19] dukeseven: all the way up to iron
[7:40:20] Venamah: fusion is the same process the sun does
[7:40:25] Gamernxc: sun is a giant fusion reactor
[7:40:28] prairydog: mini sun :)
[7:40:33] Tapeman83: you're gonna be making deutirium and tritium in this pack YEP
[7:40:41] Jolle450: Sounds about right YEP
[7:40:44] Armathur: LUL
[7:40:46] PowerDimex: yes it is like the sun, but sun have way highre density and heat.
[7:40:46] AlfredTheSalmon: until it reaches iron and it can't support itself anymore. boom
[7:40:47] Lenny1130: i just loled
[7:40:47] Ricotez: it's magic :)
[7:40:48] coolcake2: 📉 Sanity 🧠 Copium 📈
[7:41:02] HolyIceCube: an isotop
[7:41:19] philipkatis: Does this pack not have fusion? Kappa
[7:41:25] Armathur: Can we use copium for fusion is the question ?
[7:41:25] prairydog: hb backward mmolecules Keepo
[7:41:26] Sam_1443: Scott Manley has a video on the fusion laser breathrough that came out 2 weeks ago that is great
[7:41:27] coolcake2: Hydrogen with an extra neutron (or an isotope) is deutriium
[7:41:32] stickman_02: good thing time is all relative so youre still doing this in 2 weeks
[7:41:34] The_Holas: Deuterium is Hydrogen with extra neutron
[7:41:55] Blazedude99: chat pls stop tyring to teach him nuclear stuff
[7:42:01] Tapeman83: KEKW
[7:42:06] Lenny1130: @Giantwaffle how many me drives do you have?
[7:42:12] coolcake2: educational stream :checkm
[7:42:14] Amraki: holy shit. so many experts in chat
[7:42:15] bEC69_: will be done in an hour :)
[7:42:19] coolcake2: educational stream ☑️
[7:42:42] Lenny1130: @Amraki were just jacks of all trades. masters of none
[7:42:57] b0ltz12: do you have power issues? seems like they are crafting way to slow
[7:42:57] prairydog: slacking NOPERS
[7:43:01] stickman_02: yeah let me hop on that planet every 7 seconds is a year so the pack should be done by the time im back
[7:43:07] Mr_hackz741: that planet has time going faster
[7:43:17] Amraki: fuck chatgpt. all we need is chatTwitch
[7:43:38] Gamernxc: is there a way to do automated thousands of on demand with this system?
[7:43:38] DefCom_: is there a noob version of the tech stuff?
[7:43:49] DaChibi: Waffle, how close are you to finishing Melvor Idle?
[7:43:53] mrsloth117: Does Pati stream??
[7:43:57] Amraki: @ynneI @ynneI true. so many people can build fission reactors. not one can talk to a girl OMEGALUL
[7:43:58] Gamernxc: !pato
[7:44:03] stickman_02: any pack without gregtech LUL
[7:44:15] Gamernxc: @mrsloth117 https://www.twitch.tv/piratepati
[7:44:24] davethulhu: you must
[7:44:38] JVM91: You should join
[7:44:41] DefCom_: LUL
[7:44:43] JVM91: Ah yes after ksp2
[7:44:50] 3phill: what is KSP 2?
[7:44:56] Collin3388: so in 6 months?
[7:44:57] Wazepas: GT: NH in 2024 PogChamp
[7:45:02] 3phill: ahhhh
