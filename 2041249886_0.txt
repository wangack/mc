[1:09:12] Lekerstein: @JonBams here's a clue: Redstone has 16 different power states
[1:09:15] uchihapappy: try 3 hoppers and put 16 items in de top hopper
[1:09:20] PedroMRP: you need a clock that ticks 15 times
[1:09:22] Saulted: oh 16 exactly is going to be some funky shit
[1:09:26] iitsmorning: why dont you do a redstone clock with a dropper and it drops 16 items
[1:09:26] idUNKNOWN: you need a clock
[1:09:29] Coorisnar: use a hopper clock with 16 items in it
[1:09:30] TheMulkeyway: dont torches get burnt out if you put too many signals in too fast? @JonBams

[1:12:39] slabstations: aernt you the vape nation guy
[1:12:44] Lekerstein: A full container will drop a comparator signal from 15 to 0 as it empties. An observer can pulse with that
[1:12:50] rubyhalo: where's biggavvy when we need him
[1:12:55] fatalfyre: could you not just do a redstone timer with droppers?
[1:13:17] slabstations: how sideways did h3h3 go?
[1:13:18] Harlando: I pulse with that mad heavy
[1:13:27] KenRenJr: just use modded
[1:13:28] Lurker987: comparator emits signal relative to how full that container is
[1:13:39] rockeva: make it so the item comes out the chest and into like a  dropper that spits it out into a upward water column leads back into the chest and loops around and around.. but it wont go off i guess. sounds silly
[1:13:41] Lekerstein: container = chest, barrell, hopper, basically anything you can stick your junk in
[1:14:03] Harlando: are we just saying minecraft words?
[1:14:03] slabstations: hit a button 16 times, let that new mouse live a little
[1:14:10] FrankFromDisney: so it works on your mom?
[1:14:12] TheMulkeyway: jon A redstone torch experiences "burn-out" when it is forced to change state (by powering and de-powering the block it is attached to) more than eight times in 60 game ticks (three seconds, barring lag)
[1:14:21] Lurker987: add observer to pulse on each change on redstone strength
[1:14:24] idUNKNOWN: pulse extender with a clock

[1:16:30] Tanthalas36: if you pull items out of the hopper with comparator faster than it pulls the next item, you’ll get a pulse on the comparator. a hopper minecart under the hopper will do that for you.
[1:16:30] TheMulkeyway: @Spiderbeen ive been trying to explain the burnt torch since he first asked LUL
[1:16:30] Harlando: you're going to want to add a hopper to a pulse extending piston and observer that into comparatating signal of the double suck party
[1:16:33] thatwentBTE: into the side of the comparator @JonBams
[1:16:33] Double_Trbl: run the redstone into the comparitor

This dropper has an observer connected to it which will run a clock to the dropper so that it shoots all of it's items but this clock is locked by an rs nor latch when i click the button the rs nor latch opens so the clock runs and all the items shoot into a hopper the pass by another one with a comparator which will flick on counting the items and this Cheer100 Cheer100

[2:05:35] somelucky_: Cheer200 Jon? Do you have guahcah-mol-eh? Can you make me some guahcah-mol-eh? Ok, I'll tell you how. First get some perfectly ripe avocados, not too firm and not too soft. Peel and remove the pits. For a creamy texture add onion and garlic powder, for chunky add fresh diced. Add salt and optionally, lime, and powdered spices. Mash with a fork in a bowl until combined to desired texture. Treat like a dip and serve with tortilla chips or spread like a sauce to enhance any sandwich, wrap or burger

[3:23:06] Closterfoebic: Run the track the other way?
[3:23:11] ktorn_: Jon, sorry to say this, but you may need to move the whole bucket collection row 2 blocks out
[3:23:14] MrLanny: just gonna have to extend the rails so you can power the end ones without locking the hoppers?
[3:23:34] SummitSummit: Total redesign?
[3:23:34] ktorn_: with a 3 block gap, you can power the middle block and not affect the hoppers on either side
[3:23:36] Ceilnguy: connecting minecarts..how dumb you can't do that
[3:24:32] mad_blue_duck: cauldrons are pushable right? could you fill them on a piston line and have 1 unloading station?
[3:24:33] slackertron: ok back to modded
[3:24:40] draco526938: here me out... shulker boat minecart. It will continue forever or you can do hoppers under mud and it will pick them up?
[3:24:40] Doppelgrahamer: delete a row of cauldrons to power rails from below ?

[3:26:22] jaridw678: Why not remove the hoppers, and make a normal block floor so you can power the rails. And then have another layer below that one with hopper minecarts like at the bamboo farm

[3:26:49] Lekerstein: Doesn't a detector rail power a line of powered rails? Would just lock the hoppers for a few ticks instead of permanetly

[3:27:31] PrincessVanellope: is it working? hypeE
[3:27:40] BornNaked2: @draco526938 To move Bams to empty all the cauldrons
[3:27:40] ktorn_: The sandstone gap that you have at the end of each row, you can make that 3 blocks wide, so you can power the rails with the middle block without locking the hoppers. it does mean redoing the whole redstone from scratch
[3:27:58] wheaties2k2: @JonBams detector rails is a good idea. Turns on for a second and only temporarily locks the hoppers
[3:28:13] slackertron: @ktorn_ best idea yet

[3:29:42] StardustDragon08: Idk Bams I think you would build a floor of hoppers for no reason bamKEK
[3:29:45] wheaties2k2: @JonBams his suggestion is to use a hopper minecart below the normal floor. Like the bamboo farm
[3:29:50] BornNaked2: @CaptainOkay We tried it, it was wonky
[3:29:52] SummitSummit: Couldn't a hopper minecart(s) cleanup the buckets?
[3:29:56] draco526938: did you power the furnace cart lol
[3:29:58] JuliusKobe: Let the vet gift 700 subs, so you can start with his sideproject, better option KEKW
[3:29:59] JammyHippy: would the red stone block under the cauldron work
[3:30:07] TheMulkeyway: what if you had a hopper minecart following you instead of hoppers on the floor?
[3:30:23] b_r_a_y: actually.. that does work
[3:30:26] slackertron: @JammyHippy he then would not be able to click it to harvest the lava

[3:30:53] jaridw678: Like the minecarts at the bamboo farm
[3:30:55] Lekerstein: Would a detector not work, and avoid a redo?
[3:30:58] Closterfoebic: Can you extend it past the hoppers and use power before/after like on the sides?
[3:31:10] b_rye36: where is the TNT?  blow it all up.
[3:31:12] bestem0r: oh no sir, you need a whole new build. Sunked temple 2.0
[3:31:32] jeeeebs: put a row in the middle of the 16 hoppers, with a row of redstone blocks and space on both sides? so 8 on each side of the redstone
[3:31:35] SummitSummit: Has TNT been suggested?!?
[3:31:40] JammyHippy: @slackertron good point
[3:31:54] alienbeingongaia: but then it wont be dumb. it will be big and smart.

[3:32:51] fatdonkey77: how do you collect lava doing it that way?
[3:32:56] cephus0879: Hopper Minecraft won't enough inventory space
[3:33:09] Stragmol: he's trying to drown himself
[3:33:10] slackertron: could send the hopper minecarts the other direction for more room too
[3:33:11] draco526938: only holds 5
[3:33:24] KingofJankTV: good day
[3:33:32] cephus0879: Lava buckets don't stack
[3:33:33] 4tw0ne: The Bamboo Farm knows :)
[3:33:44] slackertron: yeah thats what im sayin
[3:34:18] dw33z1l: It's not 35 buckets all at once. Dripstone is not that efficient
[3:34:36] wheaties2k2: @JonBams since the carts are running perpendicular to you, they'll only pick up a few at a time anyways. It'll be plenty
[3:34:42] slackertron: it wont be an issue, you wont be able to harvest all the cauldrens anyway, random drip they all wont be full at the same time
[3:34:56] ktorn_: @JonBams check twitter. 3 block wide works, and doesn't block side hoppers (tested)
[3:35:09] Denbrew: so smart
[3:35:11] MrLanny: so intelligent JonBams
[3:35:11] SummitSummit: You can't put rail on chest, can you?

[3:36:35] wheaties2k2: @JonBams they're suggesting you move the bucket system over 3 blocks to give more space
[3:36:45] knockinpistols: 3 BLOCKS WIDE WORKS
[3:36:51] ktorn_: I mean move the sides 2 blocks out
[3:37:04] BornNaked2: He is saying the blocks wont send a signal, so three wide is enough
[3:37:06] MrLanny: what sides?
[3:37:10] SummitSummit: Has 3 blocks wide been suggested?!?
[3:37:14] RT9009: just make it 4 blocks wide
[3:37:18] ktorn_: the sandstone
[3:37:25] JuliusKobe: I think 3 blocks wide work.
[3:37:25] ktorn_: yes
[3:37:27] Lekerstein: @JonBams detector rails + powered rails work for your current build
[3:37:29] knockinpistols: 3 BLOCKS @JonBams
[3:37:30] Exonerated_: 3 Blocks Wide right?
[3:37:31] skeptium: just put it wide right
[3:37:40] wheaties2k2: that's what's he's shouting about
[3:37:42] ktorn_: yup
[3:37:47] RollyPinder: quick, someone shine a big gavvy spotlight in the sky!
[3:37:47] draco526938: true
[3:37:51] ktorn_: ok
[3:37:53] JuliusKobe: But how wide do you need to go then?
[3:37:57] BornNaked2: :D
[3:38:05] Lekerstein: chat help me out here
[3:38:16] wheaties2k2: does anyone know why this farm doesn't fill the whole temple?
[3:38:35] slackertron: well at least use glazed terracotta for the floor
[3:38:41] wheaties2k2: @JonBams thanks. I figured :)
[3:38:41] knockinpistols: where is the 8th farm?
[3:38:55] b_r_a_y: LuL
[3:38:56] arebenji: You can do it Jon!
[3:39:02] draco526938: farm water yes lmfao
[3:39:14] Lekerstein: detector rails work as is
[3:39:19] b_r_a_y: a water farm is ridiculous LuL I love it hahaha
[3:39:26] JuliusKobe: That should win the price of DUMBEST build ever LUL
[3:39:27] jerrythomas55: I’m proud of you Jong

[3:40:06] draco526938: sucks water from mud
[3:40:08] dw33z1l: Drip water onto mud I believe
[3:40:28] skeptium: LUL
[3:40:33] draco526938: no no it is mud on top of dripstone and the dripstone sucks out the water
[3:40:33] Saulted: dripstone under mud dries it into clay slowly
[3:40:38] arebenji: No, no. Drip mud onto water over lava
[3:40:39] Ceilnguy: why would that give you clay?
[3:40:39] draco526938: to make lclay
[3:40:43] ruthlessrellik: mud on top
[3:40:47] BornNaked2: VIBE "Drrrrrrip"
[3:40:55] jeeeebs: dripstone UNDER mud. it sucks the water out of the mud and creates clay
[3:41:04] skeptium: put mud on top and drip the water out creating clay
[3:41:05] wheaties2k2: @JonBams WIKI: "If mud is placed above a block with a pointed dripstone underneath, the mud eventually turns into clay, although the dripstone does not deposit any water into a cauldron."
[3:41:19] arebenji: I love chat
[3:41:28] skeptium: @arebenji fr
[3:41:55] b_r_a_y: it is free clay, which is kinda neat
[3:42:01] arebenji: Use pistons to push the clay
[3:42:14] skeptium: @b_r_a_y i mean its not free, you have to pay with mud
[3:42:14] BornNaked2: Where is the SAND farm Mojang? BabyRage
[3:42:14] arebenji: Then I'm out of ideas
[3:42:34] wheaties2k2: bamboo farm is the way!
[3:42:35] ktorn_: you can automate it with a... nevermind kekw
[3:42:51] MrLanny: Jon why didn't you use pistons to move the sandstone for this build? Kappa
[3:42:58] TuddleWuvvins: decided what to do about the entrance? @JonBams
[3:43:07] BornNaked2: Entity distance?
[3:43:08] slackertron: how many subs to replace ceds cow with a tiny dirt dick?

[3:45:05] ktorn_: 5 streams to place the terracota in a nice pattern bamKEK
[3:45:07] krittermeister: make it lime green and then its really a pain
[3:45:16] RealWickedBrew: Wow, step away for a couple hours and now we are tearing it all down... Total JonBams build here...
[3:46:15] Lekerstein: you could power the rails with a detector rail
[3:46:19] knockinpistols: do it above
[3:46:23] Ceilnguy: time to leave life and RIDE THE RAILS
[3:46:34] wheaties2k2: in the new way, don't we just run the tracks over redstone blocks?

[3:48:28] KingofJankTV: wonder if Mojang will ever incorporate a recycle feature where you can take a crafted item, place it into a “recycler” and get the original components, at a reduced rate. thoughts?
