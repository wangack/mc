[0:14:39] Dynam1c_Dave: That is literally the biggest reason I miss living in Arizona
[0:14:42] Tech: Because light was expensive AF before, and it's hard to change standards

[0:14:55] Aarimous: That would be my political platform. Remove daylight saving, the penny, and move to metric system.
[0:14:55] aicoa: yup, hopefully soon we'll get rid of it in EU as well. but countries now want to "chose" if they want savings or normal time.. which makes it ridiculous complicated
[0:15:00] Vargh: Russia did this too didn't they? drop daylight saving?
[0:15:03] Tech: I mean the fact that we have not swapped to metric yet kills me
[0:15:11] jsullivanj: this is not the weirdest convo we've had in here
[0:15:22] complexprotein: @Tech You can pry my freedom units out of my cold dead hands
[0:15:27] ixwt: We would benefit from using a single time, not just not day light savings.

[2:02:10] mooaben: yea 7 sek
[2:02:25] Sandboxie97: @MrGoatsy thatsy why almost all players bind brake to a button oi have brake on A for exmaple (xbox controller)
[2:02:36] juvoo: is there a small shortcut on the first jump or
[2:02:47] MrGoatsy: @Giantwaffle O
[2:02:50] Juldron: Q

[2:03:51] Vargh: you can use both, but waffle is using a controller atm
[2:03:52] MrGoatsy: why break there?
[2:03:53] Curnil: @MrKupQuake he's on controller
[2:03:55] Joeynhl96: off the first jump people are going far left and turning as soon as they land
[2:03:55] MrGoatsy: don't break that corner?
[2:03:58] stakdd: ok
[2:03:59] Sandboxie97: @MrKupQuake he switched to controller 2 days ago, both work
[2:04:21] BurnedAether: @MrKupQuake You can see the inputs in the bottom left. Controller will be analog on left/right
[2:04:49] Sandboxie97: @MrGoatsy trackmania only has digital gas/brake iirc so a trigger doesnt make sense there
[2:04:51] 0omkins: brake and go deep inside on that corner

[2:05:27] Tabakhase: thats some solid COPIUM
[2:05:41] MrGoatsy: @Sandboxie97 also a trigger makes it slightly slower to break due to the travel time of the trigger
[2:05:45] Dagmoo: :kom -1.8 tho
[2:05:47] MrGoatsy: @Sandboxie97 so yeah
