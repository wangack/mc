[0:47:27] Kenji_QQ: rapport literally printed gold, life skills dont do that so gold deflates
[0:47:27] st3x_: rapport was gold generator
[0:47:29] Balafore: Players make gold, buy stuff on market that goes to bots, bots get banned. Gold ingame decreases

[0:48:04] nathrizen: yea i havent sold a high gold item in a while.. gold's drying up
[0:48:05] Blasian__: the real play was selling everything 2-3 weeks ago and sit on gold. most people did that and bought blue crystals
[0:48:10] Nightingale43: Only way to make a lot of gold is high rolling accessories and stones
[0:48:14] Nightingale43: right now
[0:48:14] CocoScruff: i'm swimming in gold like Scrooge McDuck Kappa
[0:48:19] bradleyking121: i hv 1.4k
[0:48:24] sam1390: @nathrizen I think pheons might be drying up
[0:48:34] YES_IT_WAS_MEEE: Selling great honor leapstones for 1k each and doing night fox which gives 8 so 8k gold at least daily was sooo good :(
[0:48:39] HKRage: blue crystals in almost hit 300 in us west Mari
[0:48:47] DeadlyBrother: They gave so much, how
[0:48:50] Xev_00: The main reason I wanted to rush 5 T3 characters is for a steady source of income from selling mats
[0:48:59] Balafore: I got a bunch of blue crystals at 306 yesterday
[0:49:03] explomis: !followage

[0:50:14] VamPipo: Right now I feel like I'm never going to get to 1415 being F2P
[0:50:38] DeadlyBrother: @AsHackDM you won't need that many pheons , why?
[0:50:38] Moobot: You can find Waffle's Youtube channel here - https://youtube.com/giantwaffle

[0:51:14] Allmostdone: I’m converting all my gold and blue crystals into shit coins
[0:51:15] DeadlyBrother: @AsHackDM yes, and blue crystals will only be used for pheons later
[0:51:31] Balafore: they admitted to releasing argus too soon so I think valtan will be acouple months min
[0:51:33] HKRage: i think you can hit 1370 before reset, you're in the 1360s right?
[0:51:42] simplyfrosts: you can get 5 pieces in 1 week
[0:51:45] YES_IT_WAS_MEEE: with the likely enhanced honing rates in line with KR and Russia version and cheap mats... you will likely get 1415 sooner rather than later
[0:51:47] myDuckIsFat: It will take you 2 weeks to get all pieces from hard mode and argos part 1
[0:51:51] HKRage: same boat, 3 successful hones away from 1370
[0:51:52] simplyfrosts: from oreha hard and argos p1
[0:51:58] myDuckIsFat: You can get all armour from week 1 between both sources
[0:52:05] bradleyking121: i hit 1370 and did argos this week. the new mats and books came in clutch
[0:52:13] queenofsalts: @Xerisz nah, Valtan will be delayed. They even said so
[0:52:15] Mandorake: @Giantwaffle just got a 10k gold bar from a gold chest
[0:52:18] AsHackDM: @DeadlyBrother  mari shop
[0:52:32] DeadlyBrother: @AsHackDM Most stuff will not be worth it later

[0:53:19] yaellian: you dodged a bullet lol
[0:53:25] HKRage: argos is only worth it for armor i think
[0:53:30] Ditchem: no one was able to buy them except whales so there was no big market for them
[0:53:34] bradleyking121: 100% not swiping is better. i got there f2p
[0:53:38] OhWhale: yup
[0:53:40] OhWhale: nuts

[0:54:34] VamPipo: damn, that's cheap
[0:54:36] bradleyking121: there's just no gold after the ban wave
[0:54:38] Allmostdone: Pull out the graph paper boys. The market is taking a dive!
[0:54:40] sam1390: surge purple is 38
[0:54:41] kingthrog: what server are you on?
[0:54:42] myDuckIsFat: Event
[0:54:44] EunWol: Bogged
[0:54:47] iTzMeMune: No more bots.
[0:54:49] DeadlyBrother: Gold is having value
[0:54:51] Kostas117: cause everyone is getting the books from the event
[0:54:51] kefyrasFTW: its the gas prices
[0:54:51] kurblet: people don't need purple books after they get them, its roster wide
[0:55:03] YES_IT_WAS_MEEE: I feel like no more whales to buy everything as they have everything now aftyer 1.5 months :(
[0:55:04] Orin_The_Sly: It is
[0:55:07] Leo_barks_at_sneezes: So would you say this is a good time to start the game?
[0:55:08] Kostas117: and when you hit 1370 you get a lot of books from the welcome challenge
[0:55:13] AsHackDM: invest on the items chat
[0:55:16] OhWhale: the books on mario kart are tradable so that doesnt help
[0:55:20] bradleyking121: im about to start to do my tomes so i can get virtue starts to report  for gold
[0:55:31] EunWol: People are holding back, not surpassing 1340 as well.
[0:55:35] Ditchem: people start hitting 1340+ so they realized how much gold it costs to hone KEKW
[0:55:45] Allmostdone: People are paying people to buy their stuff
[0:55:45] Mandorake: @Giantwaffle just got a 10k gold bar from a gold chest
[0:55:47] kingthrog: yea i love it lol
[0:56:00] iTzMeMune: If it weren't for the bots in the beginning the market would've been like this from the start. now ppls mindset is skewed on how much gold they can't make anymore
[0:56:04] nathrizen: it's a playground to test your own economic theories
[0:56:12] mrcndrgrx: !bynn

[0:56:53] Astro22t: oh man lol
[0:57:02] Ditchem: the economy changes so fast its really nice to play with
[0:57:04] Argentwingss: i have multiple friends who tried to run a specific part of the wow AH and it was a 80% failure KEKW
[0:57:14] Cozmo300: EVE is basically a big economy simulation
[0:57:20] Soul12eaver: do siablo3
[0:57:23] Allmostdone: I like characters using weapons that weigh more than they do
[0:57:27] Soul12eaver: diablo*
[0:57:28] EunWol: It's cool when it's working, unlike in other mmo's where there's no tax system. Other's old KMOO's Auction House are kind of broken because of bots and resellers
[0:57:37] DeadlyBrother: they don't KEKW
[0:57:38] kurblet: they don't a lot
[0:57:40] Soul12eaver: that was diablo3 before they changed things
[0:57:46] kurblet: bots fuck up POE a lot
[0:57:50] Kenji_QQ: they just bot the AH
[0:57:53] kurblet: they do chaos recipe and mess up the chaos price
[0:58:02] Palaegis: Trade bots in PoE
[0:58:04] Bogadisa: They do chaos reciepe, definetly heavily botted
[0:58:06] Malak044: poe bots are just trading currency nowadays i feels, making a chaos worth from currency trades
[0:58:08] SleepyRhino: i know someone who grinds a HH every league and sells it for RMT
[0:58:13] Ditchem: bots are the best in POE best people to buy from KEKW
[0:58:17] CutlasFury: trade bots are the BEST
[0:58:21] EunWol: They accept trade request fast KEKW
[0:58:31] CutlasFury: they dont scam either
[0:58:52] w1mon: PoE should just integrate an auction house instead of all the third party tools
[0:58:53] Moobot: Come join the Waffle House Discord! <# https://discord.gg/fhGFtMuzdS

[1:00:44] Tokinstaffel: shhh let them keep going. i like the free gold
[1:00:46] EunWol: monkaS That much different
[1:00:50] Blasian__: if they bid that much they must want more legendary card chances. cause the mats won't add up
[1:00:52] HKRage: treasure maps are really bad investment rn
[1:00:54] OhWhale: dude my map just went for 7k....
[1:00:55] bradleyking121: this is people that rmt and sitting on it before they realize they'll be broke soon
[1:00:56] Melfcin: Im so fucking happy that i have 60k gold in savings. I feel like im rich

[1:16:59] WellBrained: Sharpshooter can be Crit + Swift/Spec
[1:17:07] Allmostdone: How about a good personality?
[1:17:08] rezv: waffle ever seen the bard soloing valtan ghost phase video?
[1:17:20] Arimil: igniter = swiftness/expertise, reflux = crit/swiftness
[1:17:33] ThatExcitedViewer: like you've said, if it's about min maxing ur not playing as u should, if it's about havin fun, u r
[1:17:38] nxusr: it’s more important to have fun and not burn out
[1:17:41] Venxuri: @Arimil excuse me? you mean crit/spec for igniter? lol
[1:17:43] rezv: can I link the bard one?
[1:17:44] SomaticCarrot: how long till f1 qualy
[1:17:50] Arimil: @Arimil yeah oops
[1:17:51] Cozmo300: Cozmo300 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 55 months! 
[1:18:06] Arimil: @Arimil wait it was swiftness spec I thought shietzThonk
[1:18:09] Asthrun: Burnout is a boolean :)
[1:18:10] ThatExcitedViewer: and after those failed hones, it must be extra nice to be getting ur hones relatively quickly rn
[1:18:11] Archelonde: 1166 mokoko's hunting that 1200
[1:18:22] Kenji_QQ: igniter can be crit spec or swift spec, depending on the build
[1:18:27] Vangelis716: The daily limits on things actually made me quit KEKW
[1:18:33] Venxuri: yea I was just thinking if you have any more alt mats incoming that will taxi you
[1:18:53] rezv: You can cheese 1415 too
[1:19:08] rezv: after 1370
[1:19:33] Baluuuba: with the "additional" material on the honingpage. I dont get 10% + over the limit with the books? If 15 is max, 15 is max no mather what, right?
[1:19:34] Arimil: @Arimil yeah it's spec swiftness, igniter doesn't built crit because igniter buff + support gives a bunch
[1:19:34] ThatExcitedViewer: @Vangelis716 the loss to the company from ppl dooing so was probably predicted to be less than if they had no limits and had to deal with scams, lawsuits etc.
[1:20:00] Balafore: 4 successful hones. 1353
[1:20:01] SmartDoll: because tons of people online said that "this is not like other korean games"
[1:20:05] BladeScream: daily timers or also low % honings KEKW
[1:20:06] PlushReptar: I feel like most people that are complaining, never played BDO.
[1:20:12] CocoScruff: LUL
[1:20:16] rezv: 11 wep, 17/17 helmet, shoulders, 8/8 chest,pants, 17 gloves is cheapest way of getting 1415
[1:20:31] SmartDoll: @PlushReptar just because there's something worse out there doesn't make honing here any better
[1:20:38] WGD118: way more then $50
[1:20:44] valfea: You're talking like gacha games dont refine that shit since a long time
[1:21:02] ThatExcitedViewer: @Giantwaffle  that IS unironically exactly what has been happening, there are lots of studies to determin where that point is on avg amongst dift demographs
[1:21:10] rezv: Im just waiting for AGS to release the $100 smoother client dlc
[1:21:15] rezv: korean client way more smoother then ours
[1:21:16] rezv: Sadge
[1:21:18] Vangelis716: well i didnt look into what the game would be like, just started playing. Ended up just not being for me. happy others are enjoying it
[1:21:22] SleepyRhino: this is big data at its best, this is analyses to fuck
[1:21:26] Venxuri: @rezv I think I'm going to go for 17/17/13/12/12/11, because you can achieve it while having decent attack power at 1400 etc
[1:21:29] PlushReptar: @PlushReptar Im not saying that is good or a bad system, im just saying that anyone that didnt expect a korean MMO to be a slow grind never played BDO.
[1:21:31] SmartDoll: @rezv pay $100 to remove EAC pepeLaugh
[1:21:31] DewDragon: what is the point of being 1400 right now?
[1:21:46] rezv: Can I link the bard soloing video? its like 4minutes long

[1:22:22] LuaPride: i feel like gacha games arent good for na
[1:22:36] ThatOnneGuy: it's unfortunate because this sounds like the perfect game for someone like me, but I worry that by the time someone like me would get to like 1370 there wouldn't be much of a playerbase... there are already enough games to play with small playerbases
[1:22:37] ThatExcitedViewer: do those numbers include ppl playing in all regions?
[1:22:42] Qbertman: my problem is i have a buncha other shit i wanna play anyways

[1:33:33] wonly: says shes only worth 1.5-3 mill probably a little low but not bad for voice acting
[1:33:37] valfea: it's passionate people, like nurse no need to pay them decently

[1:33:42] CocoScruff: typically they're not really doing anything... LUL
[1:33:47] emanymanheman: I guess the main argument is without the ceo, the regular employee wouldn't have a job?

[1:34:16] rezv: dragon is so annoying

[2:46:24] Aarimous: I like that they aren't showing us the medical team, American sports show too much injury footage.
[2:46:32] bogat: @Bogat yeah but thats a bad sign
[2:46:36] Kuus2: going to the medical center, not hospital so good news
[2:46:37] Numsi87: hes talking and can move they said

[2:47:23] TCaillet: that car is not really repairable
[2:47:24] ryno0: he will be in too much pain to race tommorow
[2:47:25] pixfix2k2: I remember watching the Grosjean crash with my 8 year old son and thought he just watched someone die
[2:47:27] daedmissica0: i dont see him racing to tomorrow

[2:48:21] ryno0: the nature of a streetcircuit no?
[2:48:22] la6792: ah fuck oil all over the track?
[2:48:24] Kuus2: a rubber wall would be eveb worse at that speed
[2:48:24] bogat: '94 monkaS
[2:48:27] MisterZero_: cash is kinh
[2:48:30] BloeR: Schumachers are cursed Sadge
[2:48:30] JapanAirline: Theres also almost no exit routes on the track
[2:48:31] haitham506: Is it F1 who designed the Track? @Giantwaffle
[2:48:31] lamp614: @Giantwaffle Think about that crash compared to the Dale Earnhardt Sr. Crash. Crazy
[2:48:31] Mbkuling: Oil money
[2:48:32] MDrot: The same person that approved it also approved to race in a warzone lmao

[2:48:37] drifter_310: he is going to the helicopter they said
[2:48:41] TCaillet: Lets make the fastest track! Lets also have concrete walls right on the edge of it!
[2:48:42] Allmostdone: oh the tech in race cars are super super future safety
[2:48:44] mrminklemyer: They have to make sure there’s room for a nice concourse not safety

[2:49:05] MANCHES7ER_UNI7ED: well shit
[2:49:07] Joshuapetch: sheesh
[2:49:07] derwolff85: after a big hit like that (above a certain G's), it's mandatory the driver need to go to the medical center or hospital (like verstappen last year)
[2:49:09] MDrot: Look how far that car went from turn 10
[2:49:10] FlashfreezeBuddha: yeah, even if mick is fine no way they get the car ready for tomorrow
[2:49:11] MANCHES7ER_UNI7ED: some tape might fix it
[2:49:12] Denethor: jesus christ
[2:49:13] TheMegabuck: the luck of Haas...
[2:49:15] TCaillet: new car time...
[2:49:18] Kuus2: pit pit pit, damage
[2:49:18] ellipse__: i think its safe to say that car is not going to race tomorrow
[2:49:29] getlazy: the car would be ready but no chance he drives
[2:49:29] andyt53: that car will absolutely be ready for tomorrow LUL
[2:49:30] FuzzyOmega: Might need a bit more speed tape
[2:49:31] georgebv: they can build it np
[2:49:32] Ajoke22: 4hrs
[2:49:33] infamousdrywall: i know whats wrong with it. aint got no gas in it

[2:49:42] emil_pr8: poor gunther first grosjean now mick
[2:49:43] Beefadin: Flex Tape will fix it
[2:49:44] Awesomeaustin37: Is Haas just down to 1 driver while he recovers?

[2:49:50] TheWonderLlama: Yeah, he is one big bruise
[2:49:51] Myekos: a crew of 4 could build it from parts in 24 hours ez
[2:49:53] daedmissica0: is 6 hr to build a car thay say
[2:49:54] iivu1canii: Wait what happened ?

[2:50:07] Dmac7: can haas put in a sub driver?
[2:50:07] TacTeecLay: Time for Nikita reserve drive KEKW
[2:50:12] AlphaSchnauzer: why are they waving yellow flags?
[2:50:21] Lemon__peel: I hope that car has been safed
[2:50:23] y0ur0wned: Maybe he can drive, but is not allowed to drive
[2:50:24] MANCHES7ER_UNI7ED: Fittipaldi probably going to replace him @Giantwaffle
[2:50:24] bogat: 800kg this year yeah ?
[2:50:26] georgebv: is this Nikita's come back?
[2:50:27] drifter_310: @Giantwaffle im not super familiar with the rules, if he cant race do they bump someone up that got eliminated?
[2:50:35] rednibc: with all due respect and hope he's well....does ham now move up?
[2:50:40] SimonSez: @Bogat, 795
[2:50:41] Lupic: I'm surprised they haven't got a flatbed truck on the track to try 'scoop' the remains onto it
[2:50:46] MotownMoses: And they have no sub driver because they used their sub drive to replace Mazepin right?
[2:50:49] getlazy: you have to have done one session before the race
[2:50:53] Smile__Less: he's talking and concious
[2:50:53] Vangelis716: nicksims13 no, you need to have done practice / qualifying
[2:50:55] jamesp2793: what do you think of Lewis today?
[2:51:13] la6792: that looks like a lot of oil
[2:51:24] pixfix2k2: kitty litter
[2:51:25] P00nDozer69: Kitty litteR?
[2:51:26] AlphaSchnauzer: chalk
[2:51:27] bogat: chalk
[2:51:27] xLas: absol
[2:51:29] Skarpis: absorbant
[2:51:30] Ving3fyr: Can @Giantwaffle like Ferrari ??
[2:51:30] PJoee: kitty litter
[2:51:31] pixfix2k2: lmao
[2:51:32] prikmori7: kitty litter :)
[2:51:33] RegDenied: cat litter
[2:51:33] MANCHES7ER_UNI7ED: man I hope his dad whatever his condition wasnt watching this
[2:51:34] elkarr: sorbent?
[2:51:43] MDrot: Saw dust, litter all sorts of sand type stuff
[2:51:47] lyooto: lewis said he struggled with balance of car
[2:51:50] arcticae: speedy dry
[2:51:52] UnfitCheetah: Concrete powder
[2:51:54] Lupic: quali today has been nonstop
[2:51:57] la6792: slowest ambulance ride ever
[2:51:57] Ving3fyr: nice t shirt dude
[2:51:59] heracles1001: @giantwaffle Lewis drove a different set up…but they didn’t expect him not to do q3 with it still
[2:52:03] Kuus2: yeah "stuff" is the technical term
[2:52:05] Ticker147: This is the first time ive seen waffle not in a black shirt
[2:52:21] georgebv: half the car is still on track LUL
[2:52:27] lyooto: lewis still a class act imo
[2:52:33] JapanAirline: ambulance has to drive an entire lap to get to the exit route
[2:52:33] Moobot: You can find Waffle's Youtube channel here - https://youtube.com/giantwaffle
[2:52:37] JapanAirline: since there are like no exits
[2:52:39] TheForensicDuck: ambulance faster then hamilton
[2:52:40] y0ur0wned: @Ticker147 It hurts my mind
[2:52:41] Ohryuken_: He's conscious and going to the medical center
[2:52:42] Vangelis716: more speed = harder bumps
[2:52:52] NatoThePotato91: Holy crap ive never seen waffle not in a black T shirt
[2:52:52] Kryllyk: The ambulance may also be performing treatment, so staying stable/slow might be more important at that time
[2:53:02] Vangelis716: so slow and steady is desired for a ambulance in such case, especially as it's not life threatening
[2:53:03] Skarpis: You'd hope not to have an ambulance driver trying to set a track record.
[2:53:06] BloeR: how much km/h is that
[2:53:10] Flashx2: The track is bad, it should change next year
[2:53:10] Smile__Less: didn't something happen with a marshal who was removed, might be why Lewis was off today?
[2:53:11] iivu1canii: i wonder if michale his dad was watching ?
[2:53:15] BloeR: D:
[2:53:18] tsets: OMG, the car split in 2 pieces while lifing it off the track

[2:53:32] TobiIerone: 270
[2:53:32] ImVigdis: who crashed?
[2:53:32] nesse007: is 280 kmh
[2:53:34] AlphaSchnauzer: why didnt they design run-off areas? its a new track???
[2:53:39] Skorpio1: now they need a big vacuum cleaner to remove all that powder off the track
[2:53:40] JapanAirline: @ImVigdis Mick
[2:53:40] waffleslapps: 180 kmh
[2:53:41] Xevilmf: 170 is 273.xx

[2:54:29] iivu1canii: the track/venue is shit in general
[2:54:29] MANCHES7ER_UNI7ED: I think the track is great but way too dangerous

[2:54:31] PeggsterNO: spa?
[2:54:32] andurian01: Saudias displaying how much they care about human life with track design

[2:54:36] Raid_Zer0: also not too far from live fire.
[2:54:36] lyooto: the one with the lines
[2:54:37] Vangelis716: 325km/h on straights without slipstream (with drs) is sick
[2:54:37] SeriousSergio: parking ricard
[2:54:38] rednibc: love my austrian track
[2:54:40] DrAlien: France is terrible
[2:54:46] mrminklemyer: It doesn’t provide even good racing either

[2:55:23] iivu1canii: WAIT LEWIS OUT IN Q1 ?
[2:55:41] lyooto: so weird he was trained in england
[2:55:42] Skorpio1: fancy spoons
[2:55:47] akkueT: mazepin LUL
[2:55:50] KrupTionn: Exactly KEKW
[2:55:56] haitham506: @x1ruz is is not do not believe anything you hear
[2:55:56] iivu1canii: @lyooto well everybody is going to be upset about rookies in the sport
[2:55:58] andyt53: they changed a number of corners, I think chainbear did a video on it
[2:55:59] TacTeecLay: did you just here lewis interview?
[2:56:00] Konsi2481: paydriver still in F1
[2:56:04] MDrot: Except Mazepin was a horrible person lol
[2:56:07] Kryllyk: F1 has always been about the money
[2:56:08] ellipse__: well on the bright side Lewis fans get to say he was in q2
[2:56:12] Joshuapetch: yes
[2:56:13] nesse007: yes
[2:56:15] xLas: a quick one yeah
[2:56:17] PoloChubb: he did, didnt say much
[2:56:27] MoopCo: max chilton bought his way into f1 a few years back, lasted 1 whole year KEKW
[2:56:30] TCaillet: money is why they want to attract an American crowd
[2:56:30] la6792: just moving it out
[2:56:31] Helionti: lewis wasnt in the mood to talk
[2:56:31] reven_rx: it was always about money
[2:56:32] P00nDozer69: He moved the barriers
[2:56:33] y0ur0wned: @TacTeecLay He is worried about someone for the first time
[2:56:34] Flashx2: Thank God, the accident happened today. Imagine what it will be like tomorrow, with many cars close to it
[2:56:44] Xevilmf: he moved the wall
[2:56:45] Xevilmf: LOL
[2:56:49] MANCHES7ER_UNI7ED: shows how safe F1 is but fuck whoever gave the go ahead for this track
[2:56:49] georgebv: that cleanup car is hauling ass
[2:56:52] Nexhunter: so in F1 security situation the Houthi's (who launched the attack that hit Jeddah) have announced a unilateral crease fire for 3 days @Giantwaffle
[2:57:03] Argonauth75: The gear box completely out of place
[2:57:03] MisterZero_: the vacuum truck
[2:57:04] Aldizzert: They're probably gonna bill him for that.
[2:57:05] Denethor: this is ridiculous
[2:57:13] Lemon__peel: Hit the wall so hard it moved it jesus
[2:57:19] lamp614: It was fortunate that it was a ricochet rather than a full on hit
[2:57:23] akkueT: this track is stupid :S
[2:57:24] TCaillet: moving those concrete barriers a few inches is no small task...
[2:57:33] drifter_310: he kind of slid into the wall backwards which may have helped him a little bit, more support that direction
[2:57:46] lyooto: can the boys get a replay
[2:57:53] BloeR: hope they ban this track

[2:59:15] iivu1canii: there was fucking missile strikes like 10 miles away from the track
[2:59:22] Belgarath81: shame the race isn't on normal TV where I'm at
[2:59:27] b0tmau: I think it’s a good sign they took him to the medical tent rather than straight to the medical helicopter
[2:59:31] ellipse__: he is going to the hospital, they are saying a corridor is beeing open for the nearest hospital from the circuit, doesn't saound good
[2:59:31] Iiiiiiiii9999: may be he is using water base paint

[3:42:48] fells: better to qualify on tires you dont want to use?
[3:42:50] Weirwood: That change doesn't make any sense for competitiveness imo
[3:42:54] 747Overcast: Not enough softs left
[3:42:54] sam1390: maybe the Deg on their car is too high so they need the Medium instead of soft
[3:42:55] golden_canadian: my entire fantasy team is in Q3
[3:42:55] Canal9000: impressive to get better time after cleaning the accident
[3:42:57] Kamipulu: can the next gunpla video be the avalanche exia?
[3:43:00] Tech: You think it's only 2 stops?
[3:43:06] FAUSTnw: nah
[3:43:06] InternetPlumber: lance was like 1.5s slower than is Q1 time, he probably gave up on the lap
[3:43:10] Tech: Gonna be a 8 stopper with the 8 red flags
[3:43:12] FAUSTnw: It will be like 3 stop
[3:43:20] celadriel23: 27 corners some super high speed prob gonna have lots of tire deg
[3:43:20] supabeat: Is Q3 today or tomorrow?
[3:43:22] chuckymax: At least seems like Ric is doing well compared to Lando
[3:43:24] FAUSTnw: Bahrain supposed to be 2 stops and it was like 4 stops LUL
[3:43:26] Weirwood: I do like that we're getting at least 2 stoppers. The strategy changes are awesome
[3:43:27] celadriel23: q3 is in 5 minutes
[3:43:29] Selkies1: what happened to HAM i missed it

[3:43:47] StOrMy1100: 2 hour qualifying damn
[3:43:47] Tech: I am here for Bottas locking down 6th
[3:43:48] samzavin: Didn't Pirelli totally change the tire compounds from last year?
[3:43:49] ryan_tokki: bottas 6th kmag 7th, zho 13, mic 14 LUL
[3:43:49] Weirwood: out in Q1 @Selkies1 just slow
[3:43:50] celadriel23: he just couldnt get a good time
[3:43:54] Selkies1: wow
[3:44:02] Apple22: Hamilton said he might change setup and start in the pit lane
[3:44:03] Cybernethik: Im impressed with Renault, they dont share their engines with anyone and its pumping
[3:44:04] palmagranet: are landos wheel covers a google sponsorship?
[3:44:08] iivu1canii: hamilton out the points in Grand prix LUL
[3:44:11] celadriel23: bottas will prob be 55-6
[3:44:13] Psychlope: I wonder if Lewis will start from the pit
[3:44:16] DrAlien: @saycheeseberger yes LUL
[3:44:30] palmagranet: thats amazing advertizing
[3:44:31] Tech: I prefer cutting with the work object on my finger
[3:44:32] celadriel23: didnt we watch this one the toher day
[3:44:32] MDrot: I'd start from pitlane with changes tbh. Its worth it
[3:44:33] Weirwood: If Bottas actually gets a good start off the line 2mrw he might have a chance to make something happen
[3:44:34] InternetPlumber: only 2 cars farther back to start from the pit lane
[3:44:35] officialhunterx: front to back for ham
[3:44:36] Tech: To back it
[3:44:38] Tech: MiniK

[3:45:35] officialhunterx: 60 milion in the bin
[3:45:41] alan94x: alan94x subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 69 months! Nice
[3:45:42] iivu1canii: Cause everyone was slowing down and mazepin was at the back
[3:45:44] brag1: did you see Mazepin new project? https://youtube.com/shorts/C0pV8kJP2zw?feature=share
[3:45:44] pixfix2k2: It wasnt in a fast spot on track
[3:46:05] iivu1canii: No that was schumacher
[3:46:25] elkarr: that circuit sucks
[3:46:33] RuostePuu: mazepin texting damn
[3:46:34] JapanAirline: Man I miss the old graphics when seeing it again now. Doesnt take half the screen.
[3:46:35] BigOneInThePants: (F)ettel
[3:46:40] DrAlien: true that
[3:46:54] officialhunterx: its to tight not nought room to move
[3:46:55] StOrMy1100: @brag1 What a joke. The team canceled his contract, but they also had to because mazepin has fly restrictions so he wouldn't even be able to race
[3:46:59] Weirwood: It's a time trial circuit. Shit for actual racing
[3:47:00] maggischerz: actual race tracks > street circuits
[3:47:01] MDrot: This is like trying to pass in the special condition events in GT4 lmao
[3:47:04] InternetPlumber: it was total carnage last year
[3:47:05] Tamerlain: but Singapore even smaller in some corners @Giantwaffle
[3:47:18] JapanAirline: oh yeah KEKW

[3:47:22] D1CKENSS: that was so dumb
[3:47:23] DrAlien: just Max being Max LUL
[3:47:23] officialhunterx: break check
[3:47:24] MisterZero_: brake check
[3:47:24] nesse007: KEKW
[3:47:24] fells: brake checked.
[3:47:26] Damikiller37: YEP Max's fault
[3:47:26] iivu1canii: there should be a limit for width of a track like 4 wide car length i'd say
[3:47:26] MDrot: And Ham still won that race
[3:47:31] Pufflez: That is so no right
[3:47:36] richie385: i prefere the old graphics
[3:47:40] Apple22: how did he not get dq'ed brake testing
[3:47:44] maggischerz: :tf: 🤏 we do a little braking
[3:47:47] Orangekunpanda: remember the 2019 Italian qualy?
[3:47:48] Denethor: pepeLaugh
[3:47:49] Robohornet: They were trying to each be the second car over the DRS line
[3:47:50] pixfix2k2: Ham could  have passed so much earlier lol
[3:47:51] InternetPlumber: should have black flagged both of em
[3:47:53] TheForensicDuck: they both wanted the DRS
[3:47:54] Xevilmf: i dont get why ham is just sitting behind like that
[3:47:54] Weirwood: I see why Hamilton didn't take it at that spot though. He takes the overtake there next lap and gets instantly overtakne
[3:47:57] lukeyyboy2000: yes
[3:48:06] Pathfind3r: shows you how stupid drs is
[3:48:07] Hank_GPG: always leavea de space
[3:48:18] MDrot: Neither driver is stupid... DRS is stupid
[3:48:21] Robohornet: So Max was trying to give him the place back as ordered in a place where he could immediately take it back
[3:48:32] InternetPlumber: F1 needs a red card system :)
[3:49:01] notRaffer: 18 15 12

[3:49:03] Canal9000: even the DRS is broken design to this track
[3:49:08] FAUSTnw: Russell is only merc engine powered in Q3 LUL
[3:49:16] 619srt: @InternetPlumber they do its called a black flag
[3:49:19] celadriel23: cuz he is MR SATURDAY

[3:50:20] palmagranet: you gotta put up a sign saying you were a ferrari fan before the first race
[3:50:21] Speedglass: how are you watching f1?
[3:50:25] 747Overcast: Leclerc going to hit the wall
[3:50:27] InternetPlumber: @InternetPlumber nah I want to see an offical walking up to the driver and sticking the card in their face for being a dumbass
[3:50:28] emanymanheman: i think if haas earned p1 you would vip him
[3:50:32] noxiiiouse: hamiltons track time was last season 1.27.511 @Giantwaffle
[3:50:37] la6792: wtf
[3:50:43] OhWhale: 127.5 was ham's pole time last year
[3:50:44] Weirwood: it's on ESPN 2 if you like Sky Sports
[3:50:45] ns0z: I think Kevin will take a p5 here in Q3

[3:51:01] EkuyucaK: whats the countdown for you in top left @Giantwaffle  󠀀

[3:51:17] Doodle_Sneeze: will probably never see cars as quick as the last few years ever again

[3:53:58] pixfix2k2: plastic bag rolling around the track lol
[3:54:04] Weirwood: It's wild to see how much faster all the other cars are in the Speed trap compared to Merc
[3:54:18] Apple22: max in the mud Kappa
[3:54:22] 8Shuffle: jesus, thats so good, i miss watching the red car go vrun in front of others
