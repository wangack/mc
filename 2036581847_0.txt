[4:20:52] KodokuJ_YT: thats why i think we should boycott nvidia cause gpus are way too expensive nowadays. AMD and Intel gpus aren't crazy expensive as nvidia
[4:21:03] KodokuJ_YT: thats why i hate using photoshop and premiere
[4:21:07] oblivion_fox: people should always have more rights and voice than companies

[4:25:19] aubreezie: shubbies v starbucks
[4:25:29] opalstrawberry: People think I'm being dramatic or whatever, but natural does actually taste so much better
[4:25:36] theunworthyrecruit: Instead of Starbucks, go Dutch Bros… I’m obsessed with that one
[4:25:46] capncharlie_: aim for the wallet, then aim for the knees
[4:25:52] KodokuJ_YT: what i used to like at starbucks when i used to went was ONLY their caramel crunch something. everything else there sucked! and now i hate caramel within the past year so that company is dead to me even more than they were cause of the palenstine stuff
[4:26:04] oblivion_fox: tough it out? how bout grow some balls

[4:27:05] bowie_the_goblin_king: like the point of these types of companies were too give like good products at affordable prices but they cannot offer even that anymore, plus they treat their employees like poop
[4:27:23] JBirbby: i onnly really use twitter to use the messages
[4:27:29] KodokuJ_YT: my favorite "imma say some bullshit" tweet from you is complaining about you getting "this mccrispy bullshit"
[4:27:33] excuseme137: YOU MEAN X not twitter /j

[4:28:24] emilygoldstein1: i left twitter years ago and it's the best decision i ever made as a teen. so much toxicity. even the rebranding to X will not change my opinion
[4:28:35] JBirbby: i would probably officially delete twitter if the mods and shelby decide to move our GC LOL
[4:28:36] KodokuJ_YT: i cant even name an ubisoft game i own
[4:28:41] KodokuJ_YT: if i own any

[4:30:35] Massewindew: I only use adobe because my university pays for it
[4:30:36] oblivion_fox: i keep thinking its a baby zombie lol
[4:30:36] theunworthyrecruit: probably for the small developers that don’t get a physical release

[4:31:05] TheOthrPerson: I might use a "totally legitimate" version of Adobe but i dont need it so i havent bothered to get it
[4:31:19] JBirbby: Optional subscriptions where you can still use the product without are are better
[4:31:28] logangstatv: instead of photoshop i use a website called photopea it is a clone of adobe ps and is completely free
[4:31:46] actuallythesilliest: yeah adobe sucks bc it's so expensive for what? photo background removal?
[4:31:51] harif13: stand your ground
[4:32:05] TheOthrPerson: @logangstatv photopea  is amazing! i used it in my Computer Science class to make a logo
[4:32:46] emilygoldstein1: i use Final cut pro. $300 one time payment forever for your apple id
[4:32:52] JBirbby: use what works for youu :)
[4:32:56] KodokuJ_YT: i do want to just full switch over to sony vegas at this point but i'm scared i won't be able to edit well anymore

[4:34:36] logangstatv: @Mr_Ladybug i use davinci resolve for video editing
[4:34:49] KodokuJ_YT: if you own vegas can you put that key over to another pc or do you have to rebuy vegas?
[4:34:56] oblivion_fox: he o be jiggin tho
[4:35:04] emilygoldstein1: It's mostly premiere pro. Final cut pro isnt considered industry standard
[4:35:08] RockStar_173: What mod is this one?
[4:35:09] legally_bird: my husband works in video and he says there are multiple other options
[4:35:34] mondo_x9436: Hi Shubble! just got back from karate.
[4:35:41] MLozminion: premiere pro is gaining popularity in Hollywood. I think everything everywhere all at once was premiere
[4:35:47] KodokuJ_YT: oh gotcha, thought that meant one at a time. but i just interpreted it weird
[4:36:01] MLozminion: but Avid is industry standard
[4:36:05] TutU383838HERCA: what if you forget bulbasaur
[4:36:19] emilygoldstein1: forgot about avid
[4:36:46] MLozminion: Avid is a pain in the ass, if you started on premiere
[4:37:04] KodokuJ_YT: we stan a Sony Vegas Queen
[4:37:04] Moobot: Please don't backseat game or send spoilers! If I need help, I'll ask for it!
[4:37:09] Brrookella: Davinci resolve needs wider industry recognition, it’s free, open source, and excellent imo
[4:37:21] KodokuJ_YT: oh premiere and vegas as so different but it's all slightly different so its a pain so switch
[4:37:57] Mr_Ladybug: resolve was designed for box office films, but the past few years they've been moving into the creator industry more
[4:38:28] excuseme137: I think your videos look amazing without premiere
[4:38:36] mondo_x9436: hey shubble, what are the pros and cons of content creation, and what are some skills you have learned from doing content creation?
[4:38:55] MLozminion: it's free cause they have a paid version that has more features to it

[4:39:50] MLozminion: yea its a one time fee, if I reme
[4:39:56] MLozminion: remember correctly
[4:40:17] loafabun: yeesss tumblr
[4:40:21] emilygoldstein1: ive only played with Premiere for a few months. It's really hard to learn. Final Cut Pro feels more user-friendly.
[4:40:23] excuseme137: I pay my shubble twitch subscription
[4:40:25] KodokuJ_YT: $23 for Premiere and $23 for Photoshop, why do people just allow this
[4:40:27] MLozminion: @Brrookella yeah and the color correction is so good
[4:40:56] theunworthyrecruit: sub the her IG
[4:41:10] KodokuJ_YT: true, shubble exclusive IG content is there for sure
[4:41:14] aubreezie: netflix subscription is annoying nowdays

[4:46:10] KodokuJ_YT: thats how we make wall-e a reality, i will never have a robot be a little fetch guy for me. cause it starts occasionally as "my phone in the other room" then becomes like everything
[4:46:43] theunworthyrecruit: I got a tumbler suggested to me on IG of my exs favorite character and it was engraved with her name

[4:47:05] harif13: oxygen is now premium, and you will need a subscription
[4:47:06] actuallythesilliest: i'm so sad that tesla is run by a crazy person because the electric car thing is so good for the planet
[4:47:25] KodokuJ_YT: that was an insane vein tho
[4:47:30] taytay172: were gonna become the lorax

[4:51:03] loafabun: have to pay for shuffle to be off and for songs to play in order to

[4:51:50] maude1619: welcome raiders!! hi kara!!
[4:51:54] Massewindew: True shuffle would be there's a chance for the same song to play multiple times in a row or choose together
[4:52:03] emilygoldstein1: spotify has this subscription based deal where you get access to spotify premium, hulu, and espn for only $10 its really great
[4:52:04] excuseme137: gotcha
[4:52:04] Moobot: Please don't backseat game or send spoilers! If I need help, I'll ask for it!
[4:52:20] actuallythesilliest: yeah spotify premium boooo

[4:52:36] lizziegirl0099: Hey Shubble! How are you?
[4:52:39] gay__froggyy272: yeah you cant turn off shuffle without paying on mobile
[4:52:52] DarkJesterProductions: Yeah, free Spotify is only Shuffle.
[4:53:05] KodokuJ_YT: for spotify if you dont pay for premium you cant pick a song, its just a random playlist around the songs vibe with that song in it and you only get 3 skips a day
[4:53:19] taytay172: and you can’t play a specific song you want if you don’t have premium
[4:53:25] actuallythesilliest: spotify premium should 100% be cheaper but it makes sense why it exists because you gotta pay artists
[4:53:28] maxamaya__: damn haha I love it
[4:53:28] macaronmonke: thoughts on YouTube music?
[4:53:33] maxamaya__: I’m the one who said it
[4:53:37] JBirbby: spotify family plan with the fam is worth
[4:53:39] KodokuJ_YT: i hate pandora
[4:53:47] mamaneek: My kiddo said if you listen to spotify on your pc you can pick the song.
[4:53:51] loafabun: it’s why I use SoundCloud or yt on my phone
[4:53:56] honeydewmelon_: this texture pack is soooo cute
[4:54:00] TheOthrPerson: i dont use pandora because of their sketchy political donation
[4:54:05] capncharlie_: you’ll have to pry my Spotify wrappeds out of my cold dead hands unfortunately
[4:54:07] taytay172: i miss my student price for Spotify premium TT
[4:54:19] kirurubun: physical media will always be superior

[4:56:06] excuseme137: how do emulators work legally, like when are they legal and when are they not
[4:56:08] loza54: subscriptions for a game is just flat out wild tho
[4:56:09] Aldzarin: I'm making my home right now too, I need more calcite
[4:56:13] actuallythesilliest: i think that with the rise of vintage and thrifting physical media is a bit more prevalent, especially with vinyl
[4:56:21] emilygoldstein1: i still think how its absolutely crazy that hollywood producers have admitted that they wanted to ai background actors in their movies so they wouldnt pay them. Glad that Sagaftra went on a strike for that
[4:56:43] maxamaya__: ngl we don’t even own our homes. our homes even if they’re paid in full the government can still take it away
[4:57:00] KodokuJ_YT: same, thats why i dont want digital games if i can help it cause when the switch store gets shut down im just outta luck

[5:51:51] FlowerCrownedPikachu: Man, backseat gaming can be a nuisance when it comes to people who wanted to experience stuff on their own or are aware of their methods.
[5:51:56] mamaneek: It has Cobblemon but it is a modpack/
[5:53:30] FlowerCrownedPikachu: True. Like with QSMP stuff, we gotta respect the content creator's decisions. Same goes for chat hopping.
[5:54:14] Nikotia: hi all :)

[5:54:56] a_young_john_jay: What's chat hopping?
[5:54:58] FlowerCrownedPikachu: No kidding. That itself is the reason why i shoo myself out of Twitch. QSMP Purgatorys 1 and 2 were very intense.
[5:55:51] FlowerCrownedPikachu: @a_young_john_jay Chat-hopping is where one jumps from one streamer's chat to another streamer's to tell them something they shouldn't know or don't care about knowing. It's from the QSMP Wiki's Thesaurus.
[5:56:00] FlowerCrownedPikachu: This is usually discouraged.
