[0:51:16] rubyhalo: There's stim free pre-workouts
[0:51:20] A_Tin_Rat: depends on the kind
[0:51:22] piiixxx: Good preworkouts have other stimulants... caffein is meh.
[0:51:24] Maybe_Glizzengar: @Giantwaffle it's not 200mg of caffeine like drinking coffee. It has alot of nootropics like L-theanine to help combat the caffeine side affects
[0:51:32] AIex_0: the energy drink one feels like a toned down version of the pre-workout LUL

[0:52:05] A_Tin_Rat: @Veshic did it have beta alanine. that will give you that feeling
[0:52:06] OrangeW2: some of that nootropic shit fucked with me more than caffeine ever did OMEGALUL
[0:52:07] lazyhot: the question remains is the can fluorecent or is it the radiation of the liquid ????

[0:53:07] venom366: KEKW
[0:53:07] Grumpage: oh jesus is a chemical?
[0:53:09] mahoraz: so waffle turns from alpha to beta Kappa
[0:53:13] a_brink: Also make your booty hole itch
[0:53:13] iWALL_E: lulWut

[0:53:24] yaardi: proprietary blend usually means theyre under dosing
[0:53:25] A_Tin_Rat: @Maybe_Glizzengar typically underdosed
[0:53:27] Omniwrath: !mc_pack
[0:53:27] Moobot: Waffle has started the December modpack, Nomifactory (GTCEu Port) !!! | curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/nomi-ceu | Will he and his friends be able to beat it in 2 weeks? Tune in to every stream to find out!

[0:53:55] Miestro: an hydrous is de hydrated, just add water
[0:53:56] TigerLuv: C4 energy drink, by skittles
[0:53:56] Maybe_Glizzengar: @A_Tin_Rat but not pure sources of each ingredient. they are cheap formulations - even if they are under a typical dose
[0:53:58] PellyPlays: lol drink it, you wont!
[0:54:03] imTymp: Beta power - Betaine Anhydrous
[0:54:04] NoisyPlays: yeah, dont you have like a 2k camera KEKW

[0:54:23] SimonSez: Not coming to europe anytime soon then
[0:54:24] Miestro: it's just powder form of whatever it is
[0:54:24] piiixxx: @Giantwaffle  enhydronus is "more" concentrated caffein but its all about the total caffein value :D just brand names
[0:54:24] Stormflare: yes
[0:54:27] Yogithebaer: is it a monster or a different one
[0:54:28] A_Tin_Rat: @Maybe_Glizzengar for sure. they just want to sham the consumer for higher margins
[0:54:28] GGoodGGuy: ci lost :D
[0:54:30] jinkleft: It's pronounced beta al-ah-neen. It's common for companies to do prop blends of sups so they can skimp on the amounts.
[0:54:34] The_Holas: Ci is angy
[0:54:37] Stormflare: usually in chemistry it means its a pwder/solid rather than a solution
[0:54:40] TigerLuv: for the list - https://www.heb.com/product-detail/cellucor-c4-skittles/6007032

[0:54:54] TheIrishGuy: where does heee
[0:54:55] 0x4273: Pepega
[0:54:55] Maybe_Glizzengar: @A_Tin_Rat don't need to know how much of X ingredient - just as long as it's in there.... I can claim it.
[0:54:58] Grumpage: if I was Ci's boss, he would be so sacked by now :)
[0:54:59] 0x4273: cant read PepeHands
[0:54:59] Stormflare: Pepega
[0:55:00] NoisyPlays: its crazy cuz in canada we have those but with WAY different ingredients, none of those private compounds shit
[0:55:02] Vorzo: pepeLaugh waffle cant read
[0:55:02] Bionicremz: Waffle got hella brain fog today
[0:55:02] A_Tin_Rat: @Maybe_Glizzengar I just stay away from them anyways. I like to see the formulas
[0:55:06] SmartDoll: reading Sadge
[0:55:19] OrangeW2: waffle dribblin today
[0:55:31] dennixfailalot: @Bionicremz not only today
[0:55:33] Maybe_Glizzengar: @A_Tin_Rat there's alot of brands you can trust. Jocko makes good product. clean and highly verified/tested.
[0:55:33] piiixxx: if anyone wants crazy preworkouts look for old DMAA PW you can still buy.
[0:55:34] Traverus98: probably want to make another blast furnace at some point
[0:55:42] A_Tin_Rat: @Maybe_Glizzengar exactly

[0:56:04] Amenophiz: Pati Carrying

[0:56:12] TheIrishGuy: drink up and you won't be lazy @giantwaffle
[0:56:13] Traverus98: You can keep your LV machines busy too
[0:56:31] DragonApoc: That’s soooo satisfying
[0:56:40] Chilz_Dude_7: @Giantwaffle maybe prepare some fluid tanks for later use
[0:56:48] Miestro: @Maybe_Glizzengar +1 gorilla mind, their stim free pre workout is top tier
[0:56:53] Maybe_Glizzengar: BPN and Gorilla are great... ghost is approaching the same kind of "proprietary" level... but not to the extent of drinks like ASHOC
[0:56:54] iamforever27: Love that show!!

[2:22:28] mobfarmer: someone made a thing...
[2:22:43] PrimedDanny: what is the best launcher for modpacks?
[2:22:48] InternetPlumber: its AE, storage is mostly based on unique items not total quantitiy
[2:22:57] fishypooos: @nothenewmemeguy yeah it was kinda cool, worth checking vod
[2:23:01] galaxy_berry: I hate that computer storage mod. It never balances items correctly so it'll load drives with different items and not stack
[2:23:22] GSBressan: @Giantwaffle you said that if the people on that video managed to finish this modpack in 14 day, you could that with friend... you just forgot that one of those friends is Cy ! Kappa
[2:23:30] Balefati: higher better

[2:24:16] AlphaSchnauzer: higher first
[2:24:27] PrimedDanny: i got curseforge as a friend told me to get it but i was just wondering if there was a better one
[2:24:38] Chris_Cross_Crash: That sounds painful

[2:24:59] stormblaz: why is someone programming on a apple 2?
[2:25:04] InternetPlumber: especially when loops are fixed GOTO points... Ie go to line 10
[2:25:05] boltzmanC: @PrimedDanny multimc is a good one if you are familiar with setting up your own packs etc. curse forge does alot of the work for you and is just easy to use
[2:25:14] TheNothingness: Basic had line numbers
[2:25:14] Dagmoo: i learned a little QBasic back in the day

[2:29:41] Traverus98: @stormblaz network has drives just like a computer. as you put in more items it gets full. When it gets full you have to add more drives.

[2:40:45] ItsHandyManny: Due to the high pressure needed to store
[2:40:56] wonly: japan is the only one whos actually producing hydrogen at scale for any kind of transition with the HTTR
[2:41:03] stormblaz: so why is porsche wanting to try it
[2:41:03] Zapper_777: pump and endertank?
[2:41:04] 0x4273: hydrogen will likely never be practical for consumer cars but its promising for commericial vehicles
[2:41:06] a_brink: And potentially more dangerous
[2:41:08] ReySteaL: @Giantwaffle he meant they do e-fuels out of hydrogen
[2:41:09] krank13_309: Big oil would never allow something like that unfortunately
[2:41:31] ba_nanananananana: yeah but hydrogen is not just gas, it has shitty density and it goes really well with metal LUL
[2:41:32] dadmanandy: Is that oil node inifite?

[2:43:02] allking4: It would be much easier to just build a renewable source of public transit, but americans would lose their mind over that
[2:43:06] TheResinger: also nowhere near enough charging capacity
[2:43:10] Selven7: the mining isnt the problem, its the refining it
[2:43:13] gregcee: The power grid is going to see outages from car charging overloading the energy infrastructures
[2:43:18] stormblaz: na CEO wanta to drive that stovk to penny stocks

[7:20:40] noxiiiouse: how can you tell how many apms its using ?
[7:20:51] GoksiiLija: aaaaaaaaaaaaaa
[7:20:54] danilul9: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
[7:20:56] maimvice13: and rf power in is 20k
[7:20:56] theRealWesty84: aaaaaaaaaaaaaa
[7:20:56] creweton: Should I be playing Elden Ring as its the Game of the Year?
[7:21:02] LurkerNr5: can you get oxygen from the recipe that produces nitrogen? or is that not producing enough?
[7:21:36] pinhead_larynx: your other electrolyzer isnt on
[7:21:44] jordan2185: Did you fix the spider loot fabricator
[7:21:46] destroyerx97: yes
[7:21:46] pinhead_larynx: nvm
[7:21:59] DoubleOughtNot: @creweton Only if you want to. GOTY just means a lot of people liked it. Not everyone.
[7:22:39] Zonear: Decentralized on the block chain? HUH
[7:22:39] Moobot: You can sub to Waffle by clicking this neat link -> twitch.tv/giantwaffle/subscribe SUBprise
[7:22:43] GoksiiLija: horizontal scaling in Minecraft
[7:22:52] maimvice13: that's what i am doing at the moment and i use supertanks as buffer
[7:22:58] TigerLuv: DoubleOughtNot I am the same way. I play what I enjoy!
[7:22:59] Wolframpage: use AE and the fluid storage bus on drums. Then when you need a liquid just use a fluid interface in
[7:23:00] stormzwest: but then your relying on the extraction rate of the ender tanks
[7:23:12] destroyerx97: Why not do Machine > Drums(for large buffering) > ender tanks (for use)
[7:23:15] Sentinel1_9: that means you need 4
[7:23:20] Sentinel1_9: not 2
[7:23:34] lazyhot: @GoksiiLija More like service orientated planning
[7:23:38] Tompop23: How much do enter tanks hold out of interest?
[7:24:04] Sentinel1_9: so enough for a single run of a machine
[7:24:45] GoksiiLija: @lazyhot i agree
[7:24:59] LittleNukey21: Put copper wires back up top too
[7:25:18] tweak4242: !mc_pack
[7:25:18] Moobot: Waffle has started the December modpack, Nomifactory (GTCEu Port) !!! | curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/nomi-ceu | Will he and his friends be able to beat it in 2 weeks? Tune in to every stream to find out!
[7:25:25] noxiiiouse: how can you tell how many amps its using ?
[7:25:54] TigerLuv: I missed it, does the oil rig downstairs, does it send stuff up?
[7:26:03] LinkToTheJake: pieThink
[7:26:05] PureSpider: 128EU = 1A at medium voltage
[7:26:13] destroyerx97: Why not do Machine > Drums(for large buffering) > ender tanks (for use)? If you are already going to be splitting things off to do their own processes alone.
[7:26:14] TheWonderLlama: NOTED Will that be on the test too?
[7:26:18] PaulFlies: waffleSTARE MathTime
[7:26:18] noxiiiouse: gotcha
[7:26:20] noxiiiouse: ty
[7:26:30] PureSpider: ampere is depending on voltage
[7:26:30] LinkToTheJake: so 69EU = .5?
[7:26:33] PureSpider: just like in real life :D
[7:26:35] LinkToTheJake: nice
[7:26:41] lukasalbert: you get more machine speed from more voltage i think ?
[7:26:47] GoksiiLija: so irl
[7:26:50] MarquesCoding: is my twitch fucked? I'm subbed and still getting ads...
[7:26:55] xtragiicz: where can I play this pack ?
[7:27:08] lukasalbert: there is a cable for every tear of power thats without resistence
[7:27:14] Dagmoo: @marquescoding ad blockers can cause that
[7:27:14] Tyraelol: this would make me lose interest in this mp ^^
[7:27:26] PureSpider: think of ampere as "parcels", so one "parcel" of 128EU every tick is 1A
[7:27:26] LinkToTheJake: Kappa maybe try tier 3
[7:27:33] PureSpider: at MV
[7:27:35] Tyraelol: mp=modpack
[7:27:44] akmazero: @LinkToTheJake 128/2=64
[7:27:52] GoksiiLija: more EU
[7:27:53] MetalBBA: you don't pull less than 1 amp. the machines have a small buffer and will top up when 1 amp of their power tier is available. and any recipe done in a higher tier machine than the recipe will operate as overclocked to that tier of power
[7:27:55] NerdNik: I hate to not have an overview of "everything" in these type of games
[7:27:58] PureSpider: one "parcel" of the limit of that voltage is one amp, so 128EU/t = 1A at MV
[7:28:01] 19rhys: aint happening
[7:28:10] splix661: packets @PureSpider
[7:28:13] LinkToTheJake: pieDingus
[7:28:15] jdogg91288: if you just subbed after not being subbed sometimes you have to reload the stream to get sub stuff including not getting ads
[7:28:27] kingasasin177: When you have to start using Ohms law in minecraft
[7:28:28] Dagmoo: @marquescoding a while back twitch confirmed the "bug" that you can get ads if you have an ad blocker on even as a sub
[7:28:28] stormzwest: goes faster
[7:28:29] TigerLuv: you can play it by yourself Tyraelol
[7:28:41] lukasalbert: yeah it gets faster at 1 amp of the higher voltage yeah ?
[7:29:05] Tyraelol: this would make me lose interest in this modpack. hope now everyone understands :D
[7:29:09] GoksiiLija: new machines i guess
[7:29:13] TigerLuv: Tyraelol in peaceful mode, which is how waffle is playing it
[7:29:18] MetalBBA: overclocking runs at 4xpower and 2x operation speed per tier. ex an lv recipe in an hv machine would run 4x as fast but use 16x lv power which is hv power
[7:29:31] Soul12eaver: thought you had an MV exctractor
[7:29:40] TigerLuv: Tyraelol I am the same way, I play games solo in most games
[7:29:40] PureSpider: important thing is also that 32EU/t x 4 is not the same as 128EU/t x 1
[7:29:58] MarquesCoding: @Giantwaffle waffle you got plans for new years?
[7:30:13] maimvice13: and ulv will not get a speed buff

[7:36:56] PaulFlies: @ynneI Yes, but it's not guaranteed to work
[7:37:06] Helo_KiX: I remember seeing an article about a device being developed that would basically be a switch that would allow you to turn your sperm on/off

[7:38:11] jayerbuu: hmm
[7:38:12] Amraki: @ynneI low possibility to reverse it. they advertise as a permanent process but can also heal naturally in some cases

[7:41:39] Amraki: @PureSpider i recently had my consult so i only know what i've been told. i suppose it's hard for doctors to cover every edge case so as a general rule they suggest not getting the surgery if you think you'll want to reverse it in case it can't be undone.
[7:41:47] daedmissica0: @Giantwaffle what anime you waiting for in 2023 ? i can wait for Attack on Titan The Final Season
