[2:48:00] jettyyau: whats the intermission for?
[2:48:14] T2Needles: Most likely just some random throwaway account made to go around saying dumb stuff using bits on streams in hopes that they have TTS enabled to say things? account was made on Oct 13 of this year.
[2:48:14] ARedPandah: Breaks between stream segments
[2:48:15] ExaltedCrayon1: Nice job
[2:48:21] Jasott: @jettyyau Un-edited vod of today's stream
[2:48:35] jettyyau: ok
[2:48:52] Jasott: Next segment should be starting in like 12-15 minutes
[2:49:45] jettyyau: btw Repella fella is really fun game from the bundle guys

[2:51:26] ExaltedCrayon1: Elite dangerous,,?
[2:51:55] jettyyau: oh that was during trans shadow and lydia segment at the end on d2
[2:51:59] jettyyau: @Jasott
[2:51:59] jaysohm: @jasott near the end of bingo stream, coming up
[2:52:26] Jasott: Yea, previous years they've had stuff because some of the Yogs played it on their off time and their personal streams
[2:52:45] ExaltedCrayon1: Sorry still  drunk as a skunk
[2:52:54] ARedPandah: For dollars it was the during day 1 rebroadcast @jasott
[2:53:01] Jasott: I know Smithy used to do a monthly stream with one of their community team
[2:53:06] jettyyau: i cant wait for the civ v i hope lewis gets silly
[2:53:23] ARedPandah: Two civ streams this week
[2:53:28] Jasott: He was already getting drunk with OpenTTD, Civ 5 is going to be a complete mess
[2:53:32] ARedPandah: Both potential chaos
[2:53:44] jettyyau: yeah idk i never liked civ 6
[2:53:47] Jasott: Not so  much with Civ 6. It's only 3 hours
[2:54:04] ARedPandah: That's because it's a rush game ^-^
[2:54:10] ARedPandah: 3 hours of WAR
[2:54:33] ARedPandah: That's what potato said during open ttd I think
[2:54:45] Jasott: the 4 main staples of the jinglejam are JingleCats and OpenTTD, Civ5 at 5 on the 5th, RustRP with Pyrion, and Poker
[2:54:52] sparkzlee: sparkzlee subscribed with Prime. 
[2:55:11] ExaltedCrayon1: Don't like  war
[2:55:15] ARedPandah: That's 5?
[2:55:21] Jasott: the majority of them also don't like Civ 6 that much
[2:55:23] jettyyau: Rust and pyrion will be funny too i imagine
[2:55:36] Jasott: JingleCats goes straight into OpenTTD though
[2:55:41] Jasott: so I count it as one
[2:56:07] Jasott: @jettyyau depends if we get more Dr Whipples. He's the fan favorite
[2:56:12] ARedPandah: Yeah but its 4 separate segments plus this year it was a return of post open ttd elements td
[2:56:18] ARedPandah: LUL
[2:56:20] jettyyau: haha
[2:56:21] rare_oddish: @Jasott what about hat films music stream? D: and whatever chaos zoey is getting up to
[2:56:23] Xadarin: @Jasott Simon's Important Videos Playlist as well YEP Though that's a newer one.
[2:56:39] ARedPandah: Hat films on the 4th
[2:56:47] jettyyau: i think hat films is d3 like later today for  5 hours no?
[2:56:55] jettyyau: oh tom
[2:57:16] rare_oddish: LUL
[2:57:21] ExaltedCrayon1: Shadow <3
[2:57:31] jettyyau: ahh i already seen this i;ll come back later enjoy :)
[2:57:50] Jasott: While HAT films do have their annual segment, I recall it being on the lower side of viewership, both in live and cinema, since it's on the slower side and minimal commentary
[2:57:50] JaffaMod: @jasott => This isn't live, it's a rebroadcast of Day 2! The total in the bottom right is up-to-date though! See you tomorrow at 11am GMT for day 3 of Jingle Jam!

[2:58:35] rare_oddish: @Jasott it's still a staple tho, it's been going for ages pcGiggle
[2:58:35] ARedPandah: Always peaks and troughs with the streams
[2:59:02] GiraffeCubed: Keep the mask on it's safe
[2:59:06] T2Needles: Shadow unmasking OOOO ( Kappa )
[2:59:18] rare_oddish: OOOO Giggling
[2:59:19] ARedPandah: The hat boys can't keep people entwined with chats while they try and make music tbh @jasott
[2:59:33] ARedPandah: It would make the stream slower
[2:59:38] MrPewpyPants: How much to get Lydia to put her mask on? HEYOooooo!
[2:59:42] ARedPandah: As they try and make albums each time LUL
[2:59:50] ARedPandah: HypeHuh HypeHuh
[2:59:57] ARedPandah: yogWTF
[2:59:59] Jasott: like since Civ isn't as popular compared to the main channel, you'd expect lower viewer ship, but since there's 8 of them going and constant commentary, the stream viewership is fairly high
[3:00:27] ARedPandah: As long as people are donating it's all good
