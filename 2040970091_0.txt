[0:46:22] quinnbbles: pakc up ur car put a hand on ur heart
[0:46:28] noa_1ne: tass ur a W
[0:46:28] mercuryhype: he made blocks and boxxed in someone during the trial
[0:46:31] noa_1ne: this song is such a W
[0:46:34] conpro24_: he got penalized for it
[0:46:38] mercuryhype: and they couldnt escape so he got penalized
[0:46:39] Lipthulip: and then some person filed a ticket (they did not mean any bad intentions)
[0:46:39] quinnbbles: is that a bad thing
[0:46:40] grundle_dan451: the other players couldn’t break blocks but fruit thought it was harmless
[0:46:44] red_umbrella_: he trolled too close to the sun
[0:46:45] mercuryhype: he got sent to the death match automatically
[0:46:48] quinnbbles: i dont understand games
[0:46:52] mercuryhype: naur it was just a practice
[0:46:53] Lipthulip: and then twitch but them in teh elimination tourney
[0:46:55] conpro24_: he got put in dm cus of that and won it
[0:47:01] quinnbbles: trolled too close to the sun LMAOOO
[0:47:07] Lipthulip: where the bottom 21 players go and only 1 survive
[0:47:08] quinnbbles: bros icarus
[0:47:10] JJKALANI_: guys can someone queue a song for me
[0:47:18] noa_1ne: @JJKALANI_ what song
[0:47:27] grundle_dan451: they’re mad because he was way more skilled than everyone in the rest of deathmatch and he rolled everyone
[0:47:27] Lipthulip: and fruit was Sadge about it because it was clearly unfair for him to be in deathmatch
[0:47:29] Redlyrix: https://open.spotify.com/track/1eFwGEGY5bKKduE8ui8QcC?si=bef52a2917fd4a74
[0:47:29] JJKALANI_: gimme a sec
[0:47:29] Fraudfrost: Cody Fry - Waltz For Sweatpants requested by @Redlyrix has been added to the queue.
[0:47:30] conpro24_: he was put in the dm with the bottom players and won
[0:47:40] Lipthulip: and the punishment did not match the "crime"
[0:47:48] quinnbbles: i am hungry
[0:47:49] quinnbbles: ugh
[0:47:50] Lipthulip: twitch just handeled it very poorly
[0:47:52] grundle_dan451: no
[0:47:54] Lipthulip: absolutent not
[0:47:57] xxsbe4chxx: no
[0:48:02] quinnbbles: L twitch
[0:48:07] conpro24_: probably a misunderstanding
[0:48:12] noa_1ne: twitch is so mid for that
[0:48:13] Lipthulip: it was not a punishment looby
[0:48:16] Fraudfrost: Cody Fry - The End
[0:48:16] red_umbrella_: but also he ended up winning and had like 7k viewers, so alls well that ends well
[0:48:17] mercuryhype: yea the lobby was the bottom 21 players
[0:48:22] Lipthulip: it was the deathmatch for the bottom players
[0:48:23] grundle_dan451: it’s because he was punished by being put in deathmatch with the bottom 20 players
[0:48:30] Lipthulip: so putting fruit there was a bad move by twitch
[0:48:34] grundle_dan451: and he was not a bottom 20 player
[0:48:40] Lipthulip: for something that was a silly troll that did no harm
[0:48:42] JJKALANI_: @noa_1ne ill kill you (feat. jhene aiko) - summer walker
[0:48:47] noa_1ne: why tf was fruit a bottom 20
[0:48:57] Lipthulip: he wasn't at the bottom 20
[0:49:11] noa_1ne: oh i misread that
[0:49:15] Lipthulip: he got put there because of the punishment yeah
[0:49:22] noa_1ne: that makes no sense-
[0:49:23] Lipthulip: which was dumb by twitch
[0:49:25] Lipthulip: ikr
[0:49:36] JJKALANI_: i gave the song noa
[0:49:44] conpro24_: fruit didnt know boxing in people would actually grief them, then he opened a ticket after getting penalized and got donowall d, then he was put in dm for it and he won
[0:49:46] noa_1ne: @JJKALANI_ will ant refund me tho...
[0:49:48] noa_1ne: if its good

[0:50:19] JJKALANI_: its more antfrost style tbh @noa_1ne
[0:50:29] niemiemie: @conpro24_ its actually so silly that they put the top 20 player in the event against the bottom 20 players, and expect that to be a punishment
[0:50:30] quinnbbles: orange show speedway

[4:05:14] Saberknightlive: purple has been the highest predicted team from what I've seen
[4:05:16] Lommslomm: Unpopular opinion but I don’t actually think KYLE EFF is gonna win Pandoras Box. They’ve challenged them with an immediate disadvantage of being on a team with Feinberg, purpled and wolfeei... that’s gonna be really hard no matter how good they might be
[4:05:18] Saberknightlive: and i'd believe
[4:05:26] Saberknightlive: steph hasn't played mc in forever though
