Even if you don't know what that is, which I can kinda get, you'd probably ask what that was, right? This user responds with "It's plugged in to a charger at the moment". I'm actually triggered. How do these people survive to adulthood?

I of course don’t think what happened on October 7 was the solution but there was a lot of misinformation about what happened on that day too. at the end of the day, ending the occupation will end violence on both sides.

I can't prove it, and will likely have to put a camera in my room to do so. But for a while now, whenever I first turn on my Series S after work, it pushes out a smell distinctly reminiscent of my roommates' milk farts. Now, whenever I'm about to turn it on I huddle close to the exhaust grill and try to detect the smell.

So I put my soft pp into the hole of the DVD, and for a few seconds as I started getting harder, it felt pretty good, but then, once I was fully erect, it started being painful. My pp was stuck in the DVD, and I had to break it in half to get if out.
