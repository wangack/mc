[1:09:43] Dexterous_Alloy: @Giantwaffle The only reasons to use a sword is that it has a lower CD on swings, can have looting 3, and can have sweeping edge 3.
[1:09:51] daftMOOSE: When he uncovered that crying obsidian I thought the portal was completed and lit somehow.
[1:09:51] Amirh2296: @giantwaffle put torches in the hand!

[1:10:06] Tenkaichi500: usually near the bottom of the porta;
[1:10:06] who_threw_poo22: put torches under the sand and the gravity will break it on the torch
[1:10:08] CorSPACE: it goes down further
[1:10:16] Wazix11: this is one of the giant portals, it goes down a ways

[1:11:37] MarkSorin: chat, should Waffle let you play the game in his place? sucreDetectiv
[1:11:47] DrYoshi22: i just logged on and im so confused lol

[1:12:31] 4729_zex: you keep asking where is the chest, but never asked how is the chest doing
[1:12:35] The1_TS: makes me laugh that people think you can be "playing" wrong. Having fun? Ya doin' it right.
[1:12:35] Shadow_of_Pain: @MaskedGibbon6 cheers
[1:12:52] Vorxel_: The datapack does extend world height and depth - just tested it out

[1:13:36] MarkSorin: modpacks are almost dead Sadge
[1:13:41] FenixTheSnolx: Speedruns are satisfying
[1:13:42] phoenixxua: a lot of modpacks are similar and with time they become boring a bit

[1:13:47] Feist_: i dislike speed running

[1:14:06] bwofreedom2: i remember when factions first came out and the game was so different
[1:14:08] Kuroiorb: speed runs are seed generator sim
[1:14:08] Ethakis: I think it's because collectively the internet has played so much minecraft
[1:14:10] srgp2015: gambling?
[1:14:14] DakotaFoxes: i dont like speed runs, they are so boring
[1:14:16] clunkerz_: @sephyyx they are playing the valheisa pack
[1:14:19] CaptainMadrio: overcoming RNG with skill is satisfying
[1:14:19] MarkSorin: speed running is dumb, especially that you miss 99% of the content, you can't just speed run the shit out of a game
[1:14:21] Dumpified: I watch mine craft for the vtubers KEKW
[1:14:24] FenixTheSnolx: Attention span is short nowadays

[1:14:53] R4YVEN_: what was the game mode where you were restricted to like a chunk? kinda puzzle like, limited resources
[1:14:53] DaGMC: modpacks are on older versions and speedruns are on 1.16. in 1.16 you can be lucky to spawn next to a village
[1:14:55] RodriCraft93: get some jungle saplings
[1:15:01] Tenkaichi500: KEKW
[1:15:05] Ethakis: I don't think I've ever actually played any minecraft mods
[1:15:07] The1_TS: I enjoy watching the practice and design streams that factorio speed runners do more than the world record run.
[1:15:08] 4729_zex: have you ever done a long survival world converted to modded? @Giantwaffle
[1:15:12] CoolReal: That's an incredible base spot, show coords PeepoClap

[1:17:34] Zwazi: people die when they are killed
[1:17:39] kennycraig: just dont die
[1:17:42] 4729_zex: you could try to add mods to this world after you are done playing it, it gives a different experience
[1:17:43] RodriCraft93: i cant wait for you to start making conkweet of every color LUL
[1:17:45] Garzilla: @notziva No, you have to use a datapack for them, and worlds using the datapack will NOT be able to update to 1.18 when the time comes.

[1:33:33] mechoriet: @Tenkaichi500 that you can have multiple layers of biomes in a single chunk
[1:33:39] 514484: 3D biome means you have biomes specific to the underground
[1:33:42] Tenkaichi500: ouuhh
[1:33:43] Systox: @Tenkaichi500 underground can have a diffrent biom

[1:48:00] CoolReal: Modders seemed happy for java 16
[1:48:01] DaGMC: I hope so. Otherwise @Giantwaffle you need to develop a modpack.
[1:48:01] DaFuzzMan69: clay soldiers!! holy shit i forgot about those

[1:51:24] SamOliverNewman: I know a bunch of languages, Java would be easy to pick up. I reckon you could easy write mods in scala, kotlin and groovy as they all run on the jvm.
[1:51:24] daemonaedryn: Have we seen anything from Hytale?
[1:51:29] CorSPACE: nope
[1:51:30] CoolReal: You could mod league for custom skins, and then get banned LULW
[1:51:35] HostileLogOut: Hytale has been quiet for a long time

[1:52:12] TheOmyNomy: Pretty sure Hytyle has the server in Java and the client in C#. I think most mods if they will exist will be server-side.
[1:52:13] tommyfod: it won't be a new Minecraft if you can't mod it
[1:52:14] SamOliverNewman: It would be pretty awesome to write a mod using rust.

[1:52:44] CocoScruff: that's what all companies say after an acquisition LUL it stays the same for about 6 months until everyone moves on to the next story and then they gut the company

[2:10:58] atamala: did you see dominos pizza delivery thing?
[2:11:02] caferkurt: Drones like small aircrafts
[2:11:03] FestivalsandBass: I like the new drones that delivery companies will be used
[2:11:11] FestivalsandBass: soon*
[2:11:12] Allmostdone: pizza drones
[2:11:13] 0omkins: 100%. Shipping/Trucking etc.
[2:11:18] Dumpified: the domino's commercial says they have unmanned vehicles
[2:11:21] JacobSolo: iirc Dominos is doing that in a few cities
[2:11:27] atamala: dominos has commercials about it now
[2:11:32] Battokage: laws will be a problem at least in eu
[2:11:33] SnackableGames: uber
[2:11:39] FestivalsandBass: Drone delivery will be big in major cities
[2:11:42] WAN1K: AVs will compliment drones
[2:11:44] alonso_284: yo
[2:11:51] Allmostdone: why would that be a problem in the EU?
[2:11:52] remess0: some kids with slingshot shooting down my pizza
[2:11:59] JimTheShark: Holy moly! You're flattening this entire area?
[2:12:00] Frozen_Toilet: but how do you get it out of the car to the house? i am typically never home for a package
[2:12:04] Kohta_Sama: LULW
[2:12:04] bier_404: drones are so flimsy
[2:12:04] FestivalsandBass: Doesn’t Amazon already have delivery drones?
[2:12:06] SnackableGames: and you dont have to tip a shitty driver
[2:12:06] haradok: @giantwaffle why not get experience in coding by participating in open source projects, then with cv you can add portfolio
[2:12:06] Battokage: @Allmostdone laws and lawmakers
[2:12:06] zoth_: In dense cities like Chicago or New York, a drone might be better
[2:12:08] Kohta_Sama: Slingshot thieves LULW

[2:12:30] Allmostdone: That's not a reason
[2:12:33] Kohta_Sama: wannacry monkaS
[2:12:33] premalonetv: Armed drones? Sounds like skynet to me
[2:12:37] Dizz1227: I still feel like even in those fully autonomous cars someone still needs to be there to make sure it works as intended
[2:12:38] FestivalsandBass: Just use a military escort drone Kappa
[2:12:47] Aarimous: Give me DOGE coin or no pizza for you
[2:12:49] n8level: alexa drones, all the shared wifi
[2:12:57] Subo_ignorethispart: oh hey its raining free pizza
[2:13:00] peacekeper24: mini iron dome for each delivery drone
[2:13:00] Allmostdone: then someone wasn't doing their job
[2:13:07] JacobSolo: The company I work for owns a large share of telco real estate, we are POCs a few drone nest at some tower sites
[2:13:07] DaGMC: armed drones already exist, but they are operated by humans
[2:13:09] friesengeist: the would go into autonomous mode
[2:13:13] premalonetv: AI in the drones so they know how to dodge the slingshot thieves
[2:13:40] Allmostdone: but they are more like planes
[2:13:42] Kohta_Sama: peepoHmm
[2:13:43] fafuja: no way
[2:13:46] Aarimous: People freaked out
[2:13:48] Fortunate87: Automated Rifles will be allowed soon in NA, right? why use a slingshot
[2:13:49] dj2fan: It's against boston dynamics tos I think
[2:13:51] Eukee: maybe a stun gun
[2:13:57] CoolReal: Boston Dynamics doesn't like it
[2:13:58] BloodyKoally: is this vanilla?
[2:13:59] caferkurt: there are kamikaze drones too
[2:14:00] cloudyfate: those converstions happen 24/7

[2:14:06] Allmostdone: dealing with the recoil
[2:14:07] peacekeper24: @Fortunate87 no?
[2:14:09] Aarimous: No
[2:14:11] DaGMC: reminds me of the one black mirror episode
[2:14:14] Hyduss_: Drone tazers KEKW
[2:14:14] panchi64: Boston Dynamics would revoke their license I think. They have a strict policy against causing fear or harm with the robot @Giantwaffle
[2:14:17] CoolReal: They can disable their robots
[2:14:20] rollhen: that was the very first thought they had
[2:14:22] CoolReal: Remotely
[2:14:29] Okkelsskov: @Giantwaffle have you seen the video of the Boeing air refuelling drone.
[2:14:31] JadedOnyx19: Pretty sure they’ve been used within the military
[2:14:32] cloudyfate: military industrial complex is gonna find a way to strap a gun to anything
[2:14:34] GreenyZA: its not the gun on the drone that is the problem .. it;s the thing that controls the trigger
[2:14:37] Solitude411: boston dynamics probably didnt like their spot being turned into a piss bot either
[2:14:40] CaptainAlkohol: @panchi64 you dont think special forces care about licences do you
[2:14:47] Larklen: pepeSmoke
[2:14:51] zoth_: I think Bostin Dynamics would make them sign a contract to not militarize the robot
[2:14:52] signmatt: what are you building atm
[2:14:52] karlb42: interesting that you conflated police with military... Kappa
[2:14:54] Kohta_Sama: larklen still modded monkaS

[2:15:17] rollhen: he mised a block NotLikeThis
[2:15:31] KRAM941: TOS does not trump National Security
[2:15:35] dj2fan: Boston Dynamics is probably not doing great financially. It will only be a matter of time before they sell their morals anyway
[2:15:37] luminousAJ: when AI makes a decision thats a mistake
[2:15:39] ItzPLP: like i-robot
[2:15:51] fafuja: not google
[2:15:58] dj2fan: I thought they sold them
[2:16:00] Xicer_TV: they sold them again
[2:16:02] DuctTapeNinja_: can we agree that all killing is not good? .... and should be avoided at all costs
[2:16:04] FlopFlipOreo: didn;t hyundai buy Boston Dynamics?

[2:16:09] Larklen: Hyundai Motor Group
[2:16:09] Kohta_Sama: n3rdfusion owns them Kappa
[2:16:09] zoth_: Put a gun on a drone and wait for it to be hacked

[2:16:39] DaGMC: EU has/had a project for autonomous drones to mitigate crime, even anticipating your behaviour

[2:17:47] Larklen: Google sells Boston Dynamics in late 2017. Early 2018 they remove 'Don't be Evil'. Coincidence? MONKERS
[2:17:50] luminousAJ: quantum AI
[2:17:51] DaGMC: NVIDIA AI watching your work

[2:18:47] DaGMC: just fire 100% of employees even CXOs and run the company by AI
[2:18:48] nooobking: you need a workers union
[2:18:49] Larklen: "Human, you are experiencing higher than average bowel movements. You have been warned" MrDestructoid

[2:18:55] Foooks: look at that perfect hole in the top of that mountain for a base overlook.   Glorious!
[2:18:56] Hampswitch: I doubt it - people can come up with BS recommendations like that, but I don't think it'll make anything more efficient
[2:18:56] 0omkins: L E A N Methodology.
[2:18:57] luminousAJ: I dont think sentient AI will be a problem, the problem will be malicious applications with AI
[2:18:57] cloudyfate: if the company you work for or plan to work for doesnt have a union dont apply/quit

[2:19:42] DrWinston0Boogie: YEP

[2:43:03] Tabakhase: nothing else
[2:43:04] Gbusrt: perhaps they just raided a random account and claim it the ransom dudes

[3:15:39] im_toast_tea: @Giantwaffle you should check out React if youre feeling that way
[3:15:40] Gelil: Just do Flutter and move on with your life
[3:15:43] Mandorake: @Giantwaffle if we're talking about web developmetn most people use a javascript framework which fixes a lot of issues
[3:15:43] BelgiumBTW: have you tried threeJS
[3:15:44] ToneBacas: when programmers refer to front end, they mean front-end in the context of webdev, which is shit btw

[3:15:47] PendaTime: @Monochrom_E that's what UX designers are for

[3:15:53] nativeW01f: JS is fine! TypeScript is finer Kappa
[3:15:54] CocoScruff: yes - i love JS front end work but I feel like i'm the minority

[3:16:44] Kujo0: front end is my favourite by far

[3:16:48] cremey_beats: @Giantwaffle its helpful to get an ide that can autocomplete css for you. jetbrains makes a good one
[3:17:00] realbobmaster: Frontend is also probably the easiest way to get a job. You can always transition into something else later
[3:17:01] PendaTime: i wouldn't say frontend is minority. I feel its oversaturated
[3:17:03] Mandorake: @Giantwaffle if you learn a good javascript framework like react, angular, ember, etc you'll be able to go far in the dev world

[3:17:36] hk_doge: backwards
[3:17:36] franckor19: cap
[3:17:36] CantTouchDisNow: no way
[3:17:37] Gelil: API design is much much harder
[3:17:38] Ardrago: depends on the sive of the project you are working on
[3:17:38] NephilimXS: depends on what you're trying to accomplish
[3:17:38] Kohta_Sama: idk shit so maybe Pepega LULW
[3:17:39] im_toast_tea: nope
[3:17:40] CocoScruff: @Giantwaffle I think you should take some time to really learn react if you're going the JS route
[3:17:40] dasmako: I think back end is straight forward. half of it is engineering the idea then you just build it
[3:17:44] Nscott5535: you can kill those llamas for leads
[3:17:45] PendaTime: errr, kind of don't agree. I feel backend i bit harder
[3:17:45] ZyianDev: I think it easier for frontend because the amount of docs available is huge
[3:17:46] quicksplit14: efficient backend code
[3:17:50] BelgiumBTW: no
[3:17:54] Chronoes: it highly depends on what kind of person you are imo
[3:17:59] DatoPotatoDato: in my experience backend was way easier for me to learn then front end
[3:18:01] The_Ice_Cold_Killa: @Giantwaffle you can easily make something pretty, but its harder to make something functional
[3:18:05] 3DExtended: backend is way more design, experience and architecture than frontend @Giantwaffle
[3:18:05] strictlysolo: whats the difference between frontend and backend
[3:18:07] Gelil: To much kookaid
[3:18:08] Mandorake: react is pretty advanced so thats good to learn
[3:18:13] Amraki: no vue.js?
[3:18:14] Drewpoo99: React rocks
[3:18:14] im_toast_tea: backend usually needs to be much more performant
[3:18:15] quicksplit14: are you building a website waffle?
[3:18:18] dasmako: Its cause frontend is more "loose" and if you do front end wrong it makes it harder to work with. If you code properly front end, it's easy to manage
[3:18:20] GreyHadley: i disagree aswel
[3:18:20] BelgiumBTW: i think you should try THREEjs @Giantwaffle
[3:18:25] Jedidude77: Imagine liking typescript and hating on javascript
[3:18:26] cColour: back-end is probably more straightforward in concept, but more difficult in execution
[3:18:29] subfin: the UX side is a whole different aspect
[3:18:30] Myekos: I'd say SCALE is the limiting factor.  You can write code that is great for one-offs, but Wolcen learned the hard way that you can't have a team of newbies with great ideas and minimal exp
[3:18:33] PendaTime: Good @Giantwaffle , learn those 3 tools (Django, ReactJS, Typescript)
[3:18:33] cremey_beats: @Giantwaffle i think you may be confusing coding front end with designing front end
[3:18:34] Jedidude77: Actually I take it back
[3:18:35] atreau_: just yoink it from the UE4 store :)
[3:18:41] Bumbl3Bee_: It's UX problem, not the devs...
[3:18:43] CocoScruff: @Giantwaffle easiest way to make senior dev is to refactor a companies existing code into react
[3:18:44] Chronoes: UX over pretty baubles
[3:18:44] Pine_Noir: pretty, functional, and intuitive
[3:18:48] Caritien: @Giantwaffle league of legends client

[3:19:24] tracycodes: @Giantwaffle It's managed by amazon. Do you know what AWS looks like? Yeah it makes sense why it's shit
[3:19:25] Kieeps: Kieeps subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 80 months! 
[3:19:26] dasmako: No UX is diff from UI
[3:19:26] cremey_beats: coding vs designing
[3:19:28] ThENiNjaa456: UX-user experience?
[3:19:29] velvetcrayon: i can never find my auto-host list, it's impossible to find
[3:19:30] Kujo0: user experience
[3:19:33] DopeDominican2: ty chat <3
[3:19:33] NephilimXS: UI and UX go hand and hand though
[3:19:34] ToneBacas: UX/UI on Twitch's unfollow channel function was changed only recently
[3:19:34] Jedidude77: UI and UX are both front end
[3:19:36] subfin: UX is typically a whole different career path
[3:19:36] Gelil: Wait .. you have emotes?
[3:19:38] ZyianDev: UX is a super set of UI design
[3:19:38] unplugmic: is it possible to get below y=0 yet? I just get bedrock
[3:19:39] Nebulous39: I think UX is front
[3:19:41] Chronoes: UX encompasses everything
[3:19:41] tommyfod: UX is user experience
[3:19:44] Ardrago: its both
[3:19:44] cremey_beats: its not coding
[3:19:44] CorSPACE: for those interested, the complete 1.17 changelog (its very long) https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/caves---cliffs--part-i-out-today-java
[3:19:44] halcyyyon: Totally true
[3:19:45] Mandorake: @Giantwaffle UX is usually designers
[3:19:45] dasmako: You can have a good UX with no design really
[3:19:48] NephilimXS: you have a shit UI you have a shit UX
[3:19:48] stubtail42: definitely AWS is like that as well
[3:19:50] NeoPAro: well ux is both
[3:19:50] Drewpoo99: User experience is a concept, UI is the implementation of UX
[3:19:52] quicksplit14: nah UX departments tell the frontend devs what to build
[3:19:52] CocoScruff: UX is 100% front end lul
[3:19:52] Jedidude77: Don't listen to them
[3:19:53] dasmako: yes they work together though
[3:19:54] bedbuggies: easy to make things look good, hard to make things functionally good lookin'
[3:19:54] cremey_beats: there are entire careers separated out to do that
[3:19:55] artykQBR: UX is not done by developers
[3:19:55] Mandorake: @Giantwaffle UX is what Graphic Designers became
[3:19:56] halcyyyon: I thought only I thought it was crap
[3:20:00] tracycodes: @stubtail42 AWS console is MONKERS
[3:20:01] tommyfod: they're the same thing ish, but creating a good user experience doesn't always require great UI
[3:20:03] im_toast_tea: it is frontend but not a frontend dev job
[3:20:04] z3pp3lin: ux= the user's experience. They are TOTALLY front end. I'm a graphic and web designer
[3:20:05] Hibame: Depends, UX can be UI but at big places have UX designers that dont code
[3:20:09] im_toast_tea: thats a designers job
[3:20:09] Apan222: I would say UI is part of UX
[3:20:09] tracycodes: But the backend creates the experience
[3:20:09] NeoPAro: User Interface?
[3:20:11] Kujo0: im in UX and UI in school and it is front end
[3:20:12] Bumbl3Bee_: UX is the front but its designed but desginated people, not the devs, so as a programmer it's not your job.
[3:20:16] Tabakhase: you can have wonderfull UX with "black text on white background"
[3:20:18] tommyfod: a user could have a great experience using something that doesn't have an amazing UI
[3:20:18] Jedidude77: they experience the back end through the front end
[3:20:19] Gelil: UX is a best when a mix of devs and designers
[3:20:20] The1_TS: UX in large organisations is not a coding job.
[3:20:22] theerhyno: waffleSero
[3:20:22] nativeW01f: UX is mainly the designers job
[3:20:29] Mandorake: @Giantwaffle Right, but the actual people are different.  I have a UX designer I work with.  I code and they design what I code
[3:20:30] Aquarat108: UX is entirely front end
[3:20:31] Kieeps: if the user notices the backend something is usualy wrong
[3:20:31] dasmako: yeah
[3:20:34] MoonTory: the backend can affect ux if it's slow and clunky
[3:20:34] Kohta_Sama: peepoHmm
[3:20:35] dasmako: UX is just actual interaction. Yes
[3:20:36] AtchTwoOh: it's ppb a full-stack Dev job
[3:20:36] subfin: yes
[3:20:38] Gelil: Yes
[3:20:38] cremey_beats: yes
[3:20:39] Jedidude77: It's a design job
[3:20:39] The1_TS: its design
[3:20:39] Mordenak: Absolutely.
[3:20:40] dasmako: Thats why you have meetings
[3:20:40] ToneBacas: you can design UX/UI without coding
[3:20:40] tracycodes: Psychology
[3:20:41] cremey_beats: graphic designers
[3:20:41] imAWMan: Yes
[3:20:41] danilul9: YEP
[3:20:41] Moobot: You can sub to Waffle by clicking this neat link -> twitch.tv/giantwaffle/subscribe
[3:20:42] nxusr: yeah, our product designers and UX people can't code
[3:20:44] NephilimXS: oh god, WYSIWYG firms
[3:20:44] Mordenak: It's design not dev.
[3:20:44] Twigie_: Yea is design what do you mean
[3:20:45] CocoScruff: maybe company specific? UX is a coding job for sure
[3:20:45] dasmako: Its not dumb if you collaborate it makes sense
[3:20:45] quicksplit14: yes
[3:20:46] cowculator99: yes why noy?
[3:20:46] atrainplaysgames: yeah, they more or less product plan
[3:20:46] The_Outis: Ya
[3:20:47] inso80: of course there are lol
[3:20:48] subfin: they make the designs and hand it off to the dev
[3:20:49] NeoPAro: Nah. its fine
[3:20:49] ToneBacas: no need
[3:20:50] Jedidude77: It's like system design for back end
[3:20:50] Mandorake: @Giantwaffle Yep.  IT's a designer not a developer
[3:20:50] cremey_beats: they dont need to
[3:20:51] MiraPacku: what? KEKW
[3:20:51] Chronoes: what
[3:20:52] sogerr: UX is its own job
[3:20:52] LLC00LT: Absolutely
[3:20:52] tracycodes: @Giantwaffle Facebook has psychology PHDs working on their UX
[3:20:52] NeoPAro: who cares
[3:20:52] tuxwonder7: KEKW
[3:20:53] cowculator99: They don't need to
[3:20:53] PendaTime: It sort of its, but usually on a team, you have UX Designer that just the look of the website, while you have the frontend engineer who implements not only the view but the functionality @Giantwaffle
[3:20:53] Ardrago: they dont have to
[3:20:55] cremey_beats: you program it to their design
[3:20:55] quicksplit14: they are designers - prototypes
[3:20:55] nxusr: get someone else to code it
[3:20:56] phoenixxua: it's UX. you don't need programming
[3:20:56] ZyianDev: They don't have to
[3:20:57] complexprotein: Just make the thing do the thing
[3:20:59] Awesomeaustin37: You get someone else to implement it
[3:21:00] halcyyyon: Yes
[3:21:01] mickfeech: UX is typically designers.  You then have engineers implementing the design
[3:21:01] vanilla2011: wireframes, photoshop
[3:21:01] The_Outis: They understand functionality
[3:21:02] nativeW01f: YEP
[3:21:02] ToneBacas: you can design a website on paper, Waffle
[3:21:02] NeoPAro: its bout the user not how to programm it
[3:21:03] LLC00LT: They only design prototypes
[3:21:04] QwyIl: Using Adobe XD and similar software
[3:21:04] quicksplit14: don't need to know how to program it
[3:21:04] dasmako: Thats why you set meetings and then they understand. I used to work with a designer and I'd tell him limitations on the code and what would be easier or not and he would design the UX around it
[3:21:04] hk_doge: you dont have to understand entirely, only visually and mechannically is fine
[3:21:05] Mondgottheit: Thats why the sites are bad
[3:21:05] rawbits: that's normal
[3:21:05] Allmostdone: Oh yea that totally true
[3:21:06] inso80: It's often part of marketing
[3:21:07] im_toast_tea: designers usually work with the devs
[3:21:07] futilesine: Because UX is a consulting and design effort - it's things like "the customer shouldn't have to access 3 submenus do to X"
[3:21:07] Tabakhase: they just slap the button there, making the button do things aint htere issue
[3:21:07] Bumbl3Bee_: This is how it works
[3:21:07] Mandorake: @Giantwaffle Thats the job of the developer is to understand.
[3:21:08] Jedidude77: They just have a dream
[3:21:08] ba_nanananananana: there is a lot of "code" as in, rules, in UX development. Hundreds and hundreds of pages
[3:21:08] aCookienot: UX is design...
[3:21:08] halcyyyon: No. It’s after that way
[3:21:09] nxusr: they create mockups for engineers to code
[3:21:09] atrainplaysgames: because the user's experience doesn't involve code
[3:21:10] DuctTapeNinja_: because you are designing the user expirience
[3:21:10] maca134: design and programming are seperate
[3:21:12] Recurrsed: @Giantwaffle  A lot of ppl that design ui/ux can't write a line of code. THat's been my experience in 6 yrs of working as a FE dev
[3:21:14] MoonTory: It is, and it isn't
[3:21:14] phoenixxua: @Giantwaffle UX is user experience. they should know how to make interfaces look good
[3:21:15] futilesine: and then turning that into a requirement for a front-end designer
[3:21:15] Chronoes: no, it's specialization
[3:21:16] The1_TS: There are tools for layout of sites, that gives the requirement to coders.
[3:21:17] Omahabs: you cand esign a car dashboard without knowing how the engine works @Giantwaffle
[3:21:18] Zec: There are great tools to make UX mockups that designers use, that devs can then implement.
[3:21:18] Mandorake: @Giantwaffle Designer and Developer work together to make a website
[3:21:20] The_Ice_Cold_Killa: @Giantwaffle exactly, then the devs gotta find a functional way to recreate their vision
[3:21:21] Valsen: designers give a template and programmers match the template, essentially.
[3:21:21] Kamikizzle73: because its OUR job as the developer to map it happen, or express the risks / capabilities of that implementation
[3:21:22] draganovik: They research user interaction on a design/visual level
[3:21:23] Senrian: I work as a game tester and I know designers that have no idea how to code. They just tell programers what to do.
[3:21:26] ZyianDev: Waffle, Interior designers don't know how to make furniture
[3:21:26] Gelil: It’s not about programming, more about learned behaviors and user psychology
[3:21:26] quicksplit14: prototype tools allow them to build mocks and developers then take that and build the actual component
[3:21:27] KRAM941: You draw what the UI should look like and give it to an programmer who can code it
[3:21:27] tracycodes: @Giantwaffle Welcome to the world of software/web dev where job titles make no fucking sense
[3:21:30] NephilimXS: Bruh in a dev-ops world.. your fucked if your ux isn't part of the team LUL
[3:21:31] MiraPacku: atleast sit a ux person and a coder together
[3:21:32] The1_TS: gives consistent view for a huge project keeping it out of engineers hands.
[3:21:33] rpo_Mave: KEKW
[3:21:34] LLC00LT: They create mock-ups, and the engineers provide feedback on the mock-ups based on implementation
[3:21:35] rawbits: that is why you are hired! you are the programmer, you make things work
[3:21:36] MoonTory: Cause sometimes dev designing something is intuitive to them, but not to users
[3:21:38] caedrel_is_my_mid: waffleAngry
[3:21:38] subfin: someone who is both a good UX designer and a good developer is a high-value commodity
[3:21:39] Krisc00: LUL
[3:21:40] Mandorake: @Giantwaffle We just broke waffle
[3:21:40] Wetware: More efficient than me as back end trying to learn how to design UI properly?
[3:21:41] Jedidude77: Like a character designer doesn't need to model
[3:21:42] MoonTory: It's dev bias design
[3:21:42] QwyIl: They rapid prototype the experience in specialised software so you don't need to spend the time coding it.
[3:21:43] Ardrago: its not, large companies have people that specialize on the more theoretical side of ux, without having to worry about actually implementing any of it
[3:21:43] moon_monk1: text monkaS
[3:21:44] engram: one is the idea and the other draws?
[3:21:45] halcyyyon: Programmers designing interfaces gave us the Linux Desktop LUL
[3:21:45] Kujo0: im in school for UX right now and a HUGE part of it is programming and design!!!!!
[3:21:46] MushuTushu: UX is gernally artsy people
[3:21:48] Dune_Shadow: my job I can design scenery and not know how to build it
[3:21:49] imAWMan: They work together but UX is design and frontend is coding the design, if that makes sense
[3:21:49] KoalaCorgi: it’s definitely not inefficient if you have a large enough workload
[3:21:49] tommyfod: yeah I work in app dev and the designer designs it, the Devs build it
[3:21:50] atrainplaysgames: most UI/UX at my work are more or less graphic designers
[3:21:55] ToneBacas: no
[3:21:56] dasmako: No cause its a lot of fucking work KEKW
[3:21:56] Chronoes: If you're ready to pay top-dollar KEKW
[3:21:57] Zec: Design != Implementation
[3:21:57] subfin: those people are pretty hard to find
[3:21:58] cremey_beats: they spent their time learning design
[3:21:58] Gelil: No,
[3:21:58] sogerr: i think waffle is mixing software architects with UX designers
[3:22:00] pixfix2k2: Why would you want a programmer to design UX when they have no experience in that specialization
[3:22:00] Mandorake: @Giantwaffle Design and being a programmer are very different
[3:22:03] Aquarat108: I actually did take a UX class that didnt have anything to do with coding, it was just where things are placed and product ease of use
[3:22:05] Jedidude77: Yeah learning how to program can help with UX
[3:22:07] wojack3: larger companies like to silo off the disciplines
[3:22:07] phoenixxua: @Giantwaffle why designer would work as designer if they knows development?
[3:22:07] Drewpoo99: The UI implements the UX so they dont need to know the code
[3:22:08] Rangetuur: what will happen to the streams whene you get a job?
[3:22:08] KoalaCorgi: UX specializes in design, devs specialize in implementing
[3:22:09] cremey_beats: thats like saying the shoe maker should also know how to make learhter
[3:22:10] Kasa21: not all programmers are artists
[3:22:11] futilesine: Because a UI programmer won't have the knowledge of what makes the best customer experience necessarily depending on the customer - so a UX consultant can spend time testing with the customer, figuring out their needs, and working with the developer to translate those needs
[3:22:11] Tabakhase: gametesters cant code usually
[3:22:11] cremey_beats: leather*
[3:22:11] dasmako: You dont have to you just tell them its broken and they fix it LUL
[3:22:12] Hibame: Yea 90% of game QA dont know how to code
[3:22:12] artykQBR: the UX design is given to developers, normally designers have no cluet about programming
[3:22:15] ba_nanananananana: the real reason is: you don't have to pay designers a lot unless they're really good. And then you don't need that many of the really good visionary types LUL
[3:22:16] Tabakhase: would be way to expensive
[3:22:16] SSlotts: With pictures or videos
[3:22:17] Senrian: I am a Senior QA tester and I have no idea about programming
[3:22:17] PendaTime: It sort of its, but usually on a team, you have UX Designer that just the look of the website, while you have the frontend engineer who implements not only the view but the functionality @Giantwaffle
[3:22:18] nxusr: no, because when you have 50k employees you can hire specialists
[3:22:18] tommyfod: yes but they are different specialisms, so people can be experts in one but not the othe r
[3:22:19] 16MB: many qa testers don't program
[3:22:19] Nerurururu: "Guide you to bugs" LULW
[3:22:19] MushuTushu: None of the UX people ive worked with code. They focus on design and people interactions, studying what people like and dont like
[3:22:19] CantTouchDisNow: no they would be limited by what they think is possible KEKW
[3:22:20] The_Outis: lmao what?
[3:22:21] Tabakhase: its lowskill work
[3:22:22] Jedidude77: But i mean does a character designer need to know how to model??
[3:22:22] dompa93: game tester finds the bug and report to programmers
[3:22:22] TheBeavsterM: QA typically do not know how to code, just test
[3:22:23] quicksplit14: no - it is way faster to iterate via a prototype than code. Also developers give feedback on what is or is not feasible
[3:22:24] hk_doge: you split jobs esp if the copmany is large enough to sustain the R&R being very seperately done
[3:22:26] Gelil: Do you want them to test or to have a bias toward fixing it?
[3:22:28] lazermage24: Hi welcome to the real world, where companies do whatever they want and it doesnt matter if it makes senses to you
[3:22:28] kaetern: symptoms != cause
[3:22:28] Mandorake: @Giantwaffle It's the difference between the Building designer and the people who do the construction
[3:22:29] mickfeech: No, because UX design is larger than just UI.  Think process flows, copy, etc.
[3:22:30] aCookienot: what..
[3:22:30] A_Durian: Q/A testers don't know code. they just know something is broke and how to recreate it
[3:22:31] adamk33n3r: yes, it would be better if a UX designer knew how to code. because often they ask for things thinking they're simple when they're not
[3:22:35] KRAM941: Dont need to understand what is broken, just need to know how to document what you did to break it
[3:22:36] bm01: I mean it's like game designers, they generally don't know much about programming
[3:22:44] ba_nanananananana: no that's true
[3:22:44] Omahabs: it is
[3:22:45] phoenixxua: that is fully correct
[3:22:47] dasmako: it is though
[3:22:47] NeoPAro: its correct
[3:22:48] Myekos: that's pretty accurate
[3:22:48] imAWMan: It is
[3:22:48] KoalaCorgi: it is.. lol
[3:22:49] nxusr: that is 100% correct
[3:22:50] The1_TS: it is
[3:22:50] Mordenak: QA often doesn't even have access to the code LUL
[3:22:51] Senrian: @Giantwaffle I work in a QA company and nobody knows how to code
[3:22:51] tommyfod: that's fully true lol
[3:22:51] Mazari_: true
[3:22:52] subfin: it helps to have a little programming knowledge
[3:22:52] The_Outis: thata literally is
[3:22:52] Krisc00: LUL LUL
[3:22:53] Taureli: It is 100% correct
[3:22:54] CantTouchDisNow: KEKW
[3:22:54] amatherly666: how do you think beta testing works? we are the QA
[3:22:54] Tabakhase: go look at gametester job writeouts LULW
[3:22:55] Allmostdone: Think of it like how they build a car. You split things into parts
[3:22:55] cremey_beats: im guessing most of the people talking right now work in the field
[3:22:56] quicksplit14: 100% correct
[3:22:56] Frooonti: QA doesn't know about programming. They just tell you what is wrong according to specs/design papers.
[3:22:57] ba_nanananananana: QA in big companies is no coding
[3:22:58] KoalaCorgi: you’ve never been in a corporate setting obviously lol
[3:22:58] LLC00LT: It is true
[3:22:58] DeadeyeWolff: A developer designs the high level of what a program needs to happen and programmers make it work
[3:23:00] atrainplaysgames: most of the lower level QA at my work only know HTML/CSS
[3:23:01] 16MB: I'm a software engineer. That is 100% correctr.
[3:23:03] Deep_Frozen: You can QA test without knowing code. Knowing some coding basics though can help tremendously
[3:23:04] Recurrsed: Depends on what kind of a tester, but it is correct that they don't have to know how to code
[3:23:05] mickfeech: I have an entire QA team that doesn't code XD
[3:23:05] quicksplit14: manual QA does not know how to code
[3:23:05] NeoPAro: tester is just to find the bug
[3:23:05] dasmako: its not their job to figure out how to fix it just tell them whats broken then the dev should have a good idea how to fix it
[3:23:09] aCookienot: well, this is how you end up with jack of all trades, master of none
[3:23:10] KRAM941: That isn't important for QA
[3:23:12] Hibame: QA doesnt even get access to view code
[3:23:12] phoenixxua: QA needs to know how things work in general not how they are developed
[3:23:12] Trimar0910: that beard is amazing
[3:23:15] Mazari_: why do you think games have alpha?
[3:23:16] Bumbl3Bee_: whats the point of qa knowing coding? they just have to tell you reproduction steps and what doesnt work
[3:23:19] kaetern: QA's job isn't to find the cause, it's to reproduce the symptoms
[3:23:19] Kujo0: If what y'all are saying is true im gonna be able to get a job in UX super easily LUL
[3:23:19] NephilimXS: i think the problem is that UX/UI is a concept and not a "job" so there are designers who get shoved in to UX concepts
[3:23:20] NordESA: I know it's not Friday (yet) but I had to make two mini-pizzas danEat
[3:23:21] AlexPerfect271: Programmer = more expensive cant have him test him all day
[3:23:21] Kamikizzle73: nah, you're minimizing the skills required to be a designer. not only having to learn the tools and processes that go into design, but also things like user testing, theme building, etc
[3:23:22] complexprotein: Exactly, any programmer would know that, so the tester doesn't need to know
[3:23:22] Omahabs: QA doesnt fix bugs, just find them
[3:23:23] Wetware: 5 months? You don't even know how much you don't know yet KEKW
[3:23:23] tommyfod: yeah but if you've specialised in QA testing and not done any automated testing or anything, you've not coded
[3:23:23] The_Outis: Cool, the tester presents the videoi/image and the developer can figure it out
[3:23:24] Jedidude77: you're wearing all hats
[3:23:24] Gelil: White box vs black box @giantwaffle
[3:23:25] im_toast_tea: designs are usually standardised in the company which the devs understand @Giantwaffle
[3:23:27] MrBeardyFish: a QA tester that knows code will "know too much" and have a biased approach to finding issues
[3:23:27] subfin: guesswork isnt their job
[3:23:28] phoenixxua: @Giantwaffle it's white vs black box testing
[3:23:28] Nerurururu: That is what makes you a better dev, QA doesn't need to know
[3:23:28] dasmako: ask lirik its perfect. he can QA games no way other bug testers do KEKW
[3:23:29] cowculator99: Thats a good PLUS but not a need
[3:23:29] SSlotts: A QA person costs less
[3:23:30] Vkingineer: You could argue that if bein both were the best situation, then there would be noone who was only one
[3:23:31] cremey_beats: if you knew how to code, why would you work in QA
[3:23:32] The_Outis: It's not guess work?
[3:23:32] MrCatchy: QA only finds the bugs tho
[3:23:32] atrainplaysgames: We have a QA Dev who builds automated tests and the rest are not necessary to know code
[3:23:33] tommyfod: QA just find the issue, Devs find the cause
[3:23:34] Tabakhase: the "dummer" your testers the better tbh...
[3:23:35] Frooonti: Important just tells you what is wrong. It's the dev's obligation to know why it is broken
[3:23:35] Mandorake: @Giantwaffle Designers typically don't touch code.  They design the website and then the programmer makes it happen in code.
[3:23:35] ba_nanananananana: no what you describe is testing, that's not QA. You do that before you send it to QA
[3:23:37] KoalaCorgi: identifying and reproducing the issue is QA, fixing it is the devs..
[3:23:37] The1_TS: QA don't find where its broken, they find that its broken and notify.
[3:23:38] Senrian: No because the QA does not fix the bug, programmers do
[3:23:41] amatherly666: Have you seen every game in the passed 10 years? obviously QA is like the last thing on the list
[3:23:41] dasmako: its cause its a copy pasta application
[3:23:42] Kohta_Sama: 30 years experience at the age of 20
[3:23:43] A_Durian: If QA provide details on how to recreate an issue, the guys to program it can recreate the issue and fix it
[3:23:45] quicksplit14: test engineer is what you are thinking of waffle
[3:23:45] Myekos: QA isn't a designer
[3:23:46] inso80: QA is: Is it working as intended? No. then, tell the devs. They don't need to know development.
[3:23:46] Chronoes: because you're not doing design in those jobs KEKW
[3:23:48] KoalaCorgi: QA is really not as much experience
[3:23:49] Krisc00: LUL lmao
[3:23:49] dasmako: we ask for 90% more than whats needed on our job listings
[3:23:50] Aquarat108: coding is always beneficial, but almost never necessary in these kinda jobs
[3:23:53] Mandorake: @Giantwaffle Developers don't want design/QAS doing code
[3:23:54] Hibame: If QA can write code they would get higher paying job coding
[3:23:57] Senrian: @Giantwaffle No because the QA does not fix the bug, programmers do
[3:23:57] cremey_beats: most developers arent fully proficient
[3:24:02] NordESA: UX is a lot of fun to do
[3:24:04] tommyfod: it's not pushing it too far! but it's just not the way it's generally done
[3:24:07] bstkr: No bc ever application is built different. QA only has to recreate the issue
[3:24:09] Tabakhase: UX happens "before"
[3:24:13] aCookienot: cause then you'd want developers to know design too...
[3:24:13] Tabakhase: or should KEKW
[3:24:15] ba_nanananananana: programmers still do tests, but before sending it to QA.
[3:24:15] Equandor: there definitely are QA job listings that require you to know some programming
[3:24:18] Mandorake: @Giantwaffle Some QA can write code but the code is to automate testing usually
[3:24:21] Gelil: The most infuriating part is the people who represent the user, don’t know what’s feasible
[3:24:22] Krisc00: waffleHeart
[3:24:24] ChatonFurtif: That's because you coded it yourself. In big companies, you want to programmers to focus on programming, not doing the whole wheel. QA testers only need to tell you what's not working and how to reproduce it. When the programmer see the steps, we know what's not working. The QA doesn't need to know
[3:24:27] b0tmau: SUS
[3:24:28] quicksplit14: they need to be technical as in make REST calls or be able to independently test UI components. but not able to code the thing
[3:24:32] phoenixxua: @Giantwaffle UI and UX are also different things
[3:24:33] goldenwerewolf: @Giantwaffle QA testers have low requirements, you tell a coder how to recreate what you did physically, and they use their knowledge of the code to decipher what you mean, it's inefficient from a time standpoint, but can cost marginally less overall, it's entirely a money thing
[3:24:33] cremey_beats: they also choose fonts and colors
[3:24:34] bstkr: Of course overlaps are beneficial but generally not required
[3:24:34] tuxwonder7: KEKW
[3:24:36] Nerurururu: PogChamp
[3:24:36] BeastboySAW: Gru thinks up things, Minions make the things. Designer/programmer.
[3:24:37] aur1so: PogChamp a button
[3:24:37] TheBeavsterM: YEP
[3:24:37] NordESA: susHmm
[3:24:37] QwyIl: @Giantwaffle Actually not wrong but there is specialised software for it
[3:24:38] subfin: UX includes a lot of research, interviewing users, questionairs, etc
[3:24:38] KRAM941: You need monkeys banging away trying to break the product, and then engineers/programs to fix the things they were able to break
[3:24:39] sogerr: that is UI not UX
[3:24:39] KoalaCorgi: it’s inefficient to have your high paying skilled software engineers wasting time on QA when they could be moving to the next piece of development
[3:24:40] Mandorake: @Giantwaffle thats literally their job
[3:24:40] MrCoolBlueKid: KEKW
[3:24:40] Tenkaichi500: KEKW
[3:24:41] Thunderflux: @Giantwaffle you don't need to be a cheff to understand what a sandwich should be and be able to eat it
[3:24:42] deep5: susHmm
[3:24:43] BelgiumBTW: you're doing UI
[3:24:45] strictlysolo: thats it?
[3:24:46] Hibame: Not aligned 1/10
[3:24:46] kaetern: that's layout design - proper UX is persona/journey/efficiency design
[3:24:47] ba_nanananananana: You do code reviews, integration tests, blah. You test your crypto. But QA is just simulating a dumb persistant user trying to break shit from the outside
[3:24:48] z3pp3lin: That's what's called back in teh day, wireframing
[3:24:48] PendaTime: @Giantwaffle i think i understand what you mean. I feel that kind of extra skill would definitely be a preferr thing, but not a requirement when hiring such people
[3:24:48] Allmostdone: Ok that's totally wrong
[3:24:49] Jedidude77: wow rude
[3:24:50] Astronaut_SIoth: I wish my QA team at work had any understanding of how our codebase works
[3:24:51] Mazari_: its a problem of scales
[3:24:53] NeoPAro: not wrong :D
[3:24:55] Mandorake: @Giantwaffle First you need to go sit in a meeting and talk about it for 5 hours with other designers
[3:24:55] StefanGab95: bruh,,, that's not what a good UX does
[3:24:55] lofffff: more to the left
[3:24:57] NeoPAro: thats UI tho
[3:24:57] twoAze: thats what i do Sadge Kappa
[3:25:02] ZyianDev: Here take a look at this: https://www.figma.com/
[3:25:03] Drewpoo99: this is UI implementing UX
[3:25:03] bier_404: little more to the left
[3:25:03] Senrian: @Giantwaffle QA reports bugs and writes how to reproduce it. The programmers do all the work to fix it.
[3:25:04] junglejoe76: You want to be a Full Stack Engineer not a Developer.
[3:25:05] L3g3ndA: haha
[3:25:06] Kujo0: @Giantwaffle im in one of the first UX programs in my country that includes programming, 3D printing etc...
[3:25:07] dasmako: not UX
[3:25:07] cremey_beats: awful ux, the button should be left aligned or cenetered
[3:25:08] Myekos: design the layout, describe the functionality, give it to coders to create, have QA  do unit testing to confirm product meets requirements
[3:25:08] Sevgeni: PERECTION
[3:25:08] Kasa21: why a programmer would waste time playing/testing when they can spend more time on a code
[3:25:09] aCookienot: making fun of other people's jobs, nice
[3:25:09] atrainplaysgames: That's UI. UX would be wondering how that would affect the user and would it make their experience enjoyable
[3:25:11] formar: UX = user experience / UI = user interface
[3:25:12] aur1so: NODDERS
[3:25:12] Nerurururu: Not UX per se but that is another job
[3:25:13] artykQBR: In big companies you are working in different project at the same time, you can't have everyone doing everything
[3:25:13] sogerr: that is UI not UX
[3:25:14] MrCoolBlueKid: needs to be centered
[3:25:14] Exolve: these are the UI designers KEKW
[3:25:19] CocoScruff: @sogerr i think you're splitting hairs there - at a lot of companies UI/UX is one in the same
[3:25:19] Gelil: So that is design, now put it in front of a user group and get feedback.  That is UX.
[3:25:20] Jedidude77: that's UI design though
[3:25:20] dasmako: Then when you do it you have 5 people telling you its wrong or bad KEKW
[3:25:21] bstkr: That rectangle does not feel good there
[3:25:21] BelgiumBTW: that are UI designers
[3:25:23] kaetern: that's old-school layout design
[3:25:23] Equandor: this is not UI, no user can interact with this image
[3:25:25] KoalaCorgi: that is definitely UI not UX
[3:25:28] Mandorake: @Giantwaffle Honestly that is exactly what they do and its why the job is not for developers
[3:25:28] Tabakhase: the guy who said "put a button" is UX, the guy who makes the button is UI, the guy who makes the button actually do what Ux guy wanted is backend
[3:25:31] NordESA: I've done UI and UX for a game and found it fun
[3:25:32] ba_nanananananana: the worst part is you have to know all the rules for ui design of the target environment LUL
[3:25:33] The_Outis: that isn't remotely how things are done nowadays
[3:25:40] strictlysolo: omg yeah boring af moving boxes around chosing the colors
[3:25:41] sogerr: @CocoScruff doesnt mean its the same thing
[3:25:45] BigOhNotation: You need flow diagrams for it to be UX
[3:25:47] Allmostdone: but there is entire classes devoted to the whole thing
[3:25:47] steingrr99: Is this vanilla?
[3:25:51] Drew1: has he been in the new caves?
[3:25:51] Myekos: go for high ground
[3:25:52] HelvetianHobbit: chat we just had a big hail storm come through. did i miss anything in the last hour?
[3:25:52] ba_nanananananana: you can't just throw buttons at random places, there's a system in every OS, and consistency is usually needed
[3:25:57] Nscott5535: its over there :)
[3:25:59] goldenwerewolf: @Giantwaffle UI = the pretty stuff, UX = the cables behind the pretty stuff
[3:26:00] Gelil: no elp ratJAM
[3:26:00] pixfix2k2: NODDERS
[3:26:03] Tahj____: Shades of grey? 😳
[3:26:04] DatoPotatoDato: NOPERS no elp
[3:26:08] Tenkaichi500: ratJAM
[3:26:13] CocoScruff: @sogerr but it's the same JOB which is what waffle's talking about. some position "UI/UX programmer"
[3:26:14] complexprotein: 50 shades specifically
[3:26:15] The1_TS: UX says we put chat control and emotes in the same panel, UI decide how it looks on the page.
[3:26:16] MoonTory: Which font?
[3:26:18] CorSPACE: @Giantwaffle you should see the changelog for 1.17 its stupidly long https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/caves---cliffs--part-i-out-today-java

[3:26:55] Poppinheads1012: what time exactly will the update release for everyone today?
[3:26:59] BasedLemur: Roboto is great
[3:27:00] Deep_Frozen: I use Montserrat for a lot of things
[3:27:01] MoonTory: If you're an enjoyer of comics sans, then you need Drama sans in your life
[3:27:01] stubtail42: cascadia code is pretty nice too
[3:27:04] dasmako: Roboto the new helvetica lazy mans font KEKW
[3:27:06] Gelil: Roboto? Googles base material typeface

[3:27:13] Affroaffe: What are you doing?
[3:27:13] ZyianDev: I like Fira code with Ligatures
[3:27:16] The_Outis: roboto is the basic google font
[3:27:17] IEthesI: boring af

[3:27:19] Yonderford: I love Roboto

[3:27:36] MiraPacku: Roboco? 👁️
[3:27:40] SergentPeaches: Yeah but its san serif
[3:27:42] subfin: its part of google's initiative to make everything look like a google site
[3:27:44] 514484: Every font should be replaced by Papyrus :) :) :)
[3:27:45] dasmako: Did you know Arial was microsofts version of helvetica?

[3:32:46] CocoScruff: yea - but now you have a better understanding of divs and containers etc. @Giantwaffle
[3:32:46] aCookienot: just hired a designer who knows how to code
[3:32:47] keksinyymi: bootstrap it up baby
[3:32:48] PendaTime: well no @Giantwaffle , that good you used CSS/HTML cause there are some things you can't do with those lightweight frameworks
[3:32:49] A_Durian: Vuetify SeemsGood
[3:32:56] JimTheShark: is it really pronounced dajango?
[3:32:57] DatoPotatoDato: @twoAze a youtuber just look up techwithtim
[3:32:58] Stillglade: learning to do it by hand is important to understand how the frameworks work
[3:33:01] nxusr: the D is silent btw
[3:33:03] Tabakhase: @JimTheShark no KEKW
[3:33:12] dasmako: ive always used nginx or apache
[3:33:13] PendaTime: silent the D Waffle
[3:33:14] silv: the jenga
[3:33:15] Drewpoo99: Django is old I thought
[3:33:17] NephilimXS: django unchained
[3:33:17] nxusr: yep
[3:33:18] PendaTime: its like Jango
[3:33:18] twoAze: @DatoPotatoGames thanks! Glad its not TimTheTatman
[3:33:18] Allmostdone: but that can change on a dime
[3:33:19] tommyfod: Django is how you make great APIs fast or you can use it as the backend for web dev yeah
[3:33:20] Kohta_Sama: @dasmako apache widepeepoHappy
[3:33:23] SirNickGaming: nginx is solid
[3:33:24] BayrAttack: @Giantwaffle theres also a big distinction between React and Reactive Programming. Github has a gist breakdown to help understand Reactive Programming which is essentially what JS is.
[3:33:28] CorSPACE: da-jango sounds cooler
[3:33:28] PendaTime: yes
[3:33:29] DatoPotatoDato: @twoAze omg image rooKek
[3:33:33] bloodycliff: "the d is silent hillbilly"
[3:33:34] DatoPotatoDato: imagine*
[3:33:35] bean_machine_kid: it's just jango
[3:33:39] subfin: node is definitelly growing in popularity compared to other server frameworks
[3:33:41] The_Ice_Cold_Killa: @Giantwaffle django is pretty easy and straighforward to learn
[3:33:45] PendaTime: DaJango PepLaugh
[3:33:50] JimTheShark: I would assume that most web technology is going towards a MEAN stack rather than a python stack
[3:33:57] stubtail42: node op
[3:33:58] dasmako: start learning package managers makes life easier
[3:33:58] subfin: you can do anything in any language, really
[3:34:10] subfin: mongo, express, angular, node?
[3:34:10] quicksplit14: probably because a lot of startups used django with its templates. Likely Jinja, or there is one other one I forget. It is like ruby on rails was 10 years ago. All the startups that made it started with django services
[3:34:12] Allmostdone: node is everywhere
[3:34:12] BasedLemur: MongoDB, Express, Angular, NodeJS
[3:34:18] Gelil: Yes but node has some pretty harsh limitations
[3:34:18] bean_machine_kid: my job uses a Spring (java) framework for the backend and MERN for the front end
[3:34:23] PendaTime: naw, i dont think people are using Angular that much, it so bloated
[3:34:27] Chronoes: @subfin nobody uses just React, you'll need ReactDOM for websites
[3:34:31] Greedyro: yes
[3:34:33] Nadoli_: yes
[3:34:35] Drewpoo99: Its nice doing a Node backend if you're doing a JS frontend since its all one language
[3:34:36] aur1so: NODDERS
[3:34:36] Tabakhase: JS or PHP Kapppa
[3:34:36] Gelil: Typescript
[3:34:38] erdbeerex: @BasedLemur that was years ago
[3:34:39] bedbuggies: YEP
[3:34:39] bean_machine_kid: I don't know anyone who uses angular
[3:34:39] Mandorake: Javascript is literally the future forever
[3:34:39] DaGMC: our current stack is built on sveltekit/bootstrap for frontend and postgraphile/postgresql for backend
[3:34:40] PendaTime: probably React over Angular
[3:34:40] JimTheShark: It's what it started as but it's probably more like a MERN stack now
[3:34:42] ChillyFierce: 4Head
[3:34:43] MoonTory: TypeScript Kreygasm
[3:34:43] Hibame: Ditch js for typescript
[3:34:47] PendaTime: yessir Waffle YEP
[3:34:47] The_Outis: @Mima228 try literally most enterprise compnaies
[3:34:48] rbrody: just build a better runescape and win life
[3:34:49] Allmostdone: better is PHP
[3:34:51] dasmako: PHP everywhere just as common as JS imo
[3:34:53] bean_machine_kid: yes learn JS
[3:34:54] nxusr: you'll need js for web no matter what
[3:34:54] twoAze: what is @Giantwaffle  trying to make?
[3:34:57] CaptainMadrio: angular is pretty bad performance wise
[3:34:57] BasedLemur: Typescript is beautiful
[3:34:57] Mandorake: Yes sorta
[3:34:58] phoenixxua: @Giantwaffle you should choice one language and learn it without jumping to others
[3:34:59] ChillyFierce: here we go again
[3:34:59] f0WL: I started using typescript it's soooo good
[3:35:02] quicksplit14: learn javascript to understand why typescript is great
[3:35:03] bean_machine_kid: PHP is old and going out of fashion
[3:35:03] Klorell: please not php
[3:35:07] im_toast_tea: not php
[3:35:10] Allmostdone: JS has more holes than cheese
[3:35:10] QwyIl: Typescript is very nice for reducing bugs in code
[3:35:11] PendaTime: @The_Outis More are going towards Reactjs than Angular
[3:35:11] Magus66: Elixir
[3:35:12] panic_inducing_citrus: Where does R fall in? I just started with it
[3:35:15] The_Outis: Angular is fine performance wise if you actually know how to code it...
[3:35:16] bstkr: Typescript and SASS is the shit bro
[3:35:17] inso80: php = backend, js = frontend (even if we see more and more js as backend)
[3:35:19] Gelil: Just learn Typescript, will be easier to understand from c#
[3:35:23] Greedyro: js is a subset of typescript @Giantwaffle
[3:35:26] The_Outis: @Mima228 Outside the west coast not really mate.
[3:35:28] Drewpoo99: @desertpenguin27 R is usually for data sciences
[3:35:29] bean_machine_kid: kotlin != java
[3:35:29] atrainplaysgames: I would still learn PHP as most job postings I'm seeing want you to have PHP knowledge since most things were built on PHP back in the day
[3:35:29] dasmako: yea SASS for css is life changing LUL
[3:35:29] Magus66: Salaries are great for elixir Devs
[3:35:34] chris_186: If you're familiar with javascript typescript isn't super hard to learn :)
[3:35:35] subfin: theres no reason to not use typescript (but its still valuable to learn vanilla js)
[3:35:39] DaGMC: typescript makes it much easier without the quirks of js
[3:35:44] JimTheShark: typescript is definitely the best right now
[3:35:45] DatoPotatoDato: php is used in a lot of websites its more backend though, its not that difficult to learn
[3:35:45] Marenti: I dont know why php is still used
[3:35:47] the_one_wasabi: web dev DansGame
[3:35:48] JimTheShark: It's js but good
[3:35:49] bean_machine_kid: SASS is GOAT
[3:35:58] sogerr: @Marenti legacy systems
[3:36:00] KelseyGamer: A temporary staircase?
[3:36:01] Magus66: Php devs are cheap
[3:36:02] formar: php powers facebook
[3:36:03] JimTheShark: php is still used because of laravel and wordpress
[3:36:08] Chronoes: who tf calls PHP legacy KEKW
[3:36:08] quicksplit14: all the software engineers in the chat happy to be backseating. myself included, sorry waffle
[3:36:09] NephilimXS: learn javascript since it'st he building block for the rest
[3:36:10] dasmako: laravel is really solid framework
[3:36:13] Allmostdone: lots of old hats want to hold on the crappy JS
[3:36:15] panic_inducing_citrus: @Drewpoo99 makes sense :) I'm using it in my intro to data analytics class
[3:36:27] dasmako: YEP
[3:36:30] inorganic: YEP
[3:36:30] szabikkkka: thousands KEKW
[3:36:31] Mandorake: @Giantwaffle Not me.  cause most have bad opinions
[3:36:35] DaGMC: I don't get it why PHP is hyped, I've stopped PHP with PHP5, never again
[3:36:37] dasmako: its good perspective.
[3:36:41] Tabakhase: IRC since ever LUL
[3:36:41] The_Outis: thousands is a bit high
[3:36:42] Moobot: Support Waffle by using his Epic creator code: Giantwaffle
[3:36:43] bean_machine_kid: js over python just because it integrates into web better
[3:36:46] dasmako: PHP has gotten a lot better with newer versions @DaGMC
[3:36:47] atrainplaysgames: don't, because they all will tell you opposing beliefs and you'll never get started
[3:36:53] Stillglade: just don't forget that 80% of programmers suck @Giantwaffle
[3:36:57] The_Outis: community forums are nice
[3:36:58] CantTouchDisNow: now pay up
[3:37:00] DatoPotatoDato: I kind of agree but there is just so much bias
[3:37:00] calvinisonline: i like to think im generally not terrible
[3:37:00] subfin: honestly, I'm glad I learned through many failures rather than just being told how to do things
[3:37:00] That_Lurker: @Giantwaffle You can go to the code languages IRC channel and there a lot of people still share a lot of information
[3:37:02] ZyianDev: dude there's so much bad information in twitch chat sometimes
[3:37:02] Mandorake: @Giantwaffle honestly the one thing i got from going to college was figuring out what i liked to do
[3:37:08] YOhodges: why did you dig out that area if you arent building anything there
[3:37:15] dasmako: college KEKW
[3:37:15] CorSPACE: the future is lua Kappa
[3:37:18] quicksplit14: go learn whatever interests you, our perspective is only nice for understanding what the pros and cons of each language/framework is
[3:37:20] bean_machine_kid: I love python it's probably my favorite programming language but I think things are trending towards JS
[3:37:23] dasmako: never went to college for programming I went for design then dropped out
[3:37:27] szabikkkka: @Mandorake honestly same
[3:37:28] Bumbl3Bee_: isnt just programming so wide topic, so everyone can have their own opinion on that?
[3:37:31] Drewpoo99: @desertpenguin27 Thats awesome! You wouldn't use R like you would JavaScript to make a website or something similar
[3:37:31] quicksplit14: also computer science degrees don't talk about anything like this
[3:37:32] bstkr: Lua KEKW
[3:37:36] twoAze: i went to college for CS Sadge
[3:37:36] PendaTime: my college tuition to get a BS in computer science PepoSad
[3:37:42] Magus66: CS degrees are math degrees
[3:37:46] Magus66: i have one. lol
[3:37:49] DaGMC: @dasmako its getting better since php3, but the world has changed, microservices are a thing
[3:37:52] JimTheShark: CS degrees are googling degrees.
[3:37:56] DatoPotatoDato: i actually did ask other peoples opinion for learning programming and ended up learning JS for my first language because i was told it was a good first language but its use case didnt fit what i wanted to do at the time
[3:37:58] quicksplit14: @Magus66 ++
[3:38:00] dasmako: @DaGMC Very true
[3:38:03] atrainplaysgames: I went to college for CS and learned more on YouTube and Udemy lol
[3:38:06] Gelil: CS is a bit different than just this.
[3:38:13] NephilimXS: Computer Science gives you the building blocks for everything.  if you go in to comp sci thinking you'll be a good programmer, RIP
[3:38:15] quicksplit14: nope CS is much more theory based
[3:38:16] BrutusHammerfist: @quicksplit14 yep, I just got my Masters and learned C++ and like Java. And theory behind programming.
[3:38:17] bstkr: Got a CS degree and am starting my masters in management in august now
[3:38:19] Soul_Synergy: I have a CS degree and never touched front end work
[3:38:21] szabikkkka: CS in my experience is much more than programming
[3:38:21] Magus66: when you can design a mips processor using only google lmk
[3:38:29] PendaTime: We didn't get that much frontend in college, a lot of backend and theories @Giantwaffle
[3:38:32] Allmostdone: maybe. Depends on when you went to school
[3:38:36] Hexonex: @Giantwaffle are you hyped for all what comes with mc 1.17?
[3:38:37] quicksplit14: depends on the university, but a lot of the degree is useless for the jobs we get after college
[3:38:46] T7878: im literlly taking a class where im learning about doping solicon wafers lmao
[3:38:47] strictlysolo: woah making your own wafers
[3:38:59] panic_inducing_citrus: @atrainplaysgames finding the materials on youtube and Udemy is sometimes the best part. It reinforces that the answers are out there for the job setting
[3:39:01] XAAM: does the datapack add the cliff gen?
[3:39:04] Allmostdone: collage is about finishing
[3:39:04] CorSPACE: no
[3:39:08] BrutusHammerfist: the only thing I think I really got from college is the actual programming knowledge of like...how to...
[3:39:09] T7878: more specifically its MEMS design
[3:39:12] Lucasdeath: That was me this semester with my microprocessor systems class that was just learning assembly language
[3:39:16] RoboticNugget: What’s in the update so far?
[3:39:19] Sunny_Boy: @Giantwaffle that is exactly how i feel with my classes for semiconductors and circuit theory
[3:39:21] Magus66: CS is not going to prepare you to be a programmer. it’s going to make you a person that can do the math underlying computers
[3:39:21] kenpetto: what does part 1 include then?
[3:39:23] witty_pup: same thing with chemical so much stuff I didn't care about
[3:39:24] Drewpoo99: @theoneoneoneone  Oh that's really interesting, I've only heard of it being used for data processing and stats
[3:39:28] szabikkkka: did you ever finish university? @Giantwaffle
[3:39:33] CorSPACE: @kenpetto https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/caves---cliffs--part-i-out-today-java changelog
[3:39:39] NephilimXS: at the end of the day, it doesn't matter what tool you use, as long as it's maintainable and gets the job done
[3:39:46] Sunny_Boy: Logic design was fun
[3:39:51] quicksplit14: if you just want to be an engineer at an internet company, I 100% recommend just doing a bootcamp
[3:39:57] DaGMC: I hated URI so much, logic is fun
[3:40:12] RainDoc: my tool it isn't much, but it does an honest work
[3:40:13] atrainplaysgames: @desertpenguin27 It's so true. All the Engineers at my work tell me 99% of the job is just searching Stack Overflow and copy/pasting.
[3:40:15] Drewpoo99: @theoneoneoneone I'll check it out, sounds interesting. Never wrote R before
[3:40:20] PendaTime: when so many companies still use java PepoSad
[3:40:25] im_toast_tea: yeah bootcamps are really good for web dev
[3:40:28] twoAze: any scala devs here?
[3:40:31] robsta107: @DaGMC i live right near URI :)
[3:40:34] Sir_Darkstar: That’s what my Aunt and Grandfather said about their EE degrees from MSOE, a lot didn’t apply to what they wanted to do. Design radars for missiles and planes. @giantwaffle
[3:40:35] panic_inducing_citrus: @atrainplaysgames that is the same thing my friend who is a programmer says.
[3:40:36] Magus66: PHP is a great choice because you can pay the majority of your developers only like $75k and have maybe one or two higher paid people.
[3:40:39] shoes6699: when's the next Launch?
[3:40:41] Adam_RT: I'm finishing my master's degree in programming in a month, and 3 months ago i decided to quit programming and start 3d art. My uni made me hate programming cuz it forced me to use Java even tho i was a C# programmer. @Giantwaffle
[3:40:46] NephilimXS: there is ALWAYS going to be a new shiny javascript frame work.. i never understood the fascination with hoping from frame work to frame work
[3:40:48] petaloudoskatoulaki: among us web devs SUS is widely accepted as the superior language
[3:41:05] Mandorake: javascript dates hiroCry
[3:41:08] Stillglade: when I was at Google, the interviews were mostly whiteboarding with data structures
[3:41:14] DaGMC: @robsta107 are we talkin about the same URI, I meant U=R*I
[3:41:16] dasmako: new Date() @Mandorake KEKW
[3:41:16] sumophlux: that is a super common question
[3:41:20] Magus66: @nephilimxs it’s so cute watching javascript mature like the rest of the languages. they still are making the same mistakes though.
[3:41:21] quicksplit14: also people dog on Java really hard, but it has withstood the test of time and is a great language for a scalable backend due to the spring framework. I am including kotlin in this since it is all the same
[3:41:27] Marenti: dates are hard
[3:41:30] robsta107: @DaGMC thought u meant the school haha
[3:41:31] dasmako: dates are a pita
[3:41:31] Magus66: truth.
[3:41:36] Allmostdone: @Adam_RT GO BACK! finish the degree then you can never touch it again
[3:41:38] Magus66: screw dates.
[3:41:40] zetsuro: Clap
[3:41:40] Mandorake: @dasmako Haha hope you're int he same timezone
[3:41:43] formar: @Giantwaffle clap clap
[3:41:46] DatoPotatoDato: Clap
[3:41:46] sarkany6: what was the question?
[3:41:48] wojack3: Waffle better then google pog
[3:41:52] dasmako: @Mandorake Right hahaha
[3:42:03] poginnit87: Is there bundles
[3:42:18] Adam_RT: @Allmostdone oh i didn't quit my uni i just gave up on working as a programmer
[3:42:19] wojack3: as architect sometime fresh eyes are better than experienced eyes
[3:42:21] phoenixxua: kind of
[3:42:22] PendaTime: xqcEZ Clap
[3:42:22] dasmako: you never do
[3:42:25] DaGMC: @robsta107 yeah, where is URI ? in which country?
[3:42:25] dasmako: in my experience wtf
[3:42:27] DatoPotatoDato: what website do you do your practice problems again?
[3:42:28] Ranctifier: no its fucking awful
[3:42:31] DKFrits: its rly weird
[3:42:31] The_Outis: lmao what
[3:42:34] 16MB: that's mental
[3:42:36] Nebulous39: in a google doc?
[3:42:36] Drewpoo99: oh gosh no
[3:42:36] twoAze: its comon for google interviews
[3:42:37] tsnipezx: LOL
[3:42:37] phoenixxua: @Giantwaffle for FAANG it's happens often
[3:42:39] quicksplit14: thats wack
[3:42:39] dasmako: that WAS the test he didnt ask for an IDE KEKW
[3:42:40] NephilimXS: was it actual code, or was it pseudo code?
[3:42:40] bedbuggies: CodeWars
[3:42:41] Soul_Synergy: Some technical interviews don't let you use an ide
[3:42:42] Mandorake: @Giantwaffle Not having an IDE for coding is really annoying in interviews
[3:42:51] PendaTime: its weird, but a lot of times they just use some notepad during interviews
[3:42:52] BasedLemur: I could see it, but it is weird
[3:42:53] PendaTime: or even on paper
[3:42:53] KyloHD: google interviews are done over google doc. that was my intern interview.
[3:42:56] QwyIl: Sounds like psuedocode coding
[3:43:00] quicksplit14: but a basic coder pad is a normal expectation, definitely do that before entering an interview, it can through you off
[3:43:01] DatoPotatoDato: its not uncommon tbh my professor in one of my classes made us write code in word
[3:43:02] Ranctifier: using a word processor for development is trash
[3:43:04] robsta107: @DaGMC its in the United States, it stands for University of Rhode Island or URI for short haha
[3:43:05] DaGMC: jupyter hub
[3:43:05] Nebulous39: I'd rather code in notepad than google doc
[3:43:07] humanshjake: Notepad is way better then google docs
[3:43:08] BasedLemur: Another option could be someling like Live Code in vscode
[3:43:08] phoenixxua: interviews not about IDE it's about your thinking
[3:43:09] quicksplit14: my company allows engineers to use IDE of their choice
[3:43:12] Allmostdone: @Adam_RT Oh thank god. 10 years down the line you would have hated not finishing
[3:43:14] sonorantoad: Why not use notepad?
[3:43:15] dasmako: I just had to send code samples for my interview but it was not a standard interview process at all
[3:43:19] DKFrits: idk that sounds really stupid
[3:43:24] NephilimXS: my code was hand written when i got interviewed LUL
[3:43:25] nxusr: we use coderpad.io at work
[3:43:28] jksingh96: In person interviews are usually on a whiteboard
[3:43:28] tommyfod: calendar.findAppointmentsForMe() lol
[3:43:29] JimTheShark: Most technical assesments/interviews are done on tools that are more like an IDE than google docs.
[3:43:31] BasedLemur: LiveShare* in VSCode
[3:43:48] CaptainMadrio: google docs has JS integration you can properly code there
[3:43:50] stubtail42: you can turn off the formatting in google docs if you know you have to use it ahead of time
[3:43:56] charlieurbanz06_: When dose the update come out
[3:43:58] quicksplit14: where do all the software engineers in the chat work? Engineering Manager at Ibotta checking in here
[3:43:58] dasmako: theres a couple web based that are nice for doing quick mock ups and stuff
[3:44:00] Bumbl3Bee_: Every IDE is just notepad with extra steps
[3:44:03] nxusr: but we also make people write code on a whiteboard afterwards KEKW
[3:44:06] twoAze: this is what i used for my interview
[3:44:19] BasedLemur: Unity Collab is an incredibly half-baked solution
[3:44:24] panic_inducing_citrus: This sounds terrible
[3:44:25] phoenixxua: @Giantwaffle interviews can be done anywhere. it's not about IDE.
[3:44:27] Dark_Mift: i see no valid scenario where an interview about coding is using a doc instead of an ide
[3:44:29] Came_Honor_Face: On my old world the new blocks are spawning in the ground but I still have bedrock spawning at 0-5 deth
[3:44:30] LinkeBanaan: Most IDE's help you by showing where compile errors are at. By having the interview in notepad, you have to think yourself
[3:44:33] peacekeper24: j
[3:44:34] dasmako: F

[3:44:59] nxusr: maybe it was a dedicated toucan account
[3:45:00] 16MB: We use teams at our company for normal use a interviews. So just using Teams screen share is good enough.
[3:45:00] NephilimXS: when i went through Comp Sci, i focused on software engineering which took out some of the theoretical stuff and focused more on full stack
[3:45:09] Came_Honor_Face: @yohodges how do I get that?
[3:45:20] PendaTime: you aren't allowed to leToucan?
[3:45:22] pixfix2k2: I HATE Teams

[3:45:32] Ruan_A: @Mima228 you are, just dont mess it up
[3:45:32] JimTheShark: nah we use slack
[3:45:33] The_Outis: not everyone
[3:45:33] quicksplit14: Slack > teams
[3:45:37] Flamingass: My company uses slack and it is shit
[3:45:41] Marenti: I dont like teams
[3:45:42] subfin: yea
[3:45:43] PendaTime: monkaS @Ruan_A
[3:45:43] Sysceau: you have a debuff what is that
[3:45:44] ZyianDev: Yea Teams is back, but Slack is only a little better
[3:45:45] dasmako: I think they added it yea.
[3:45:46] tommyfod: yes
[3:45:48] NephilimXS: salesforce owns slack now, pass LUL
[3:45:49] dasmako: slack has built in calling now too
[3:45:50] TractorRider: @Giantwaffle yeah we use Zoom screenshare for interviews in our RnD dept
[3:45:53] eddie_lover: ???
[3:45:54] looptime: @quicksplit14 I found my  people
[3:45:54] 16MB: We use Teams because we a re a microsoft partnered company.
[3:45:55] quicksplit14: yes
[3:45:56] JimTheShark: Yes you can
[3:45:57] eddie_lover: wait really
[3:46:04] DatoPotatoDato: random question chat im out of ideas for what i want to learn to code next i dont know if i want to learn unity or ML or what
[3:46:08] BasedLemur: Is there a difference between slack and discord at this point?
[3:46:13] LVL97Magikarp: the goverment uses teams and its a shitshow lol
[3:46:19] Warcry1000: Warcry1000 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 20 months! waffleHeart
[3:46:30] dew1ttew0lff: Isn’t screen sharing only for paid slack?
[3:46:32] Tabakhase: @16MB condolences KEKW
[3:46:34] NephilimXS: ML? machine language? fuck that LOL
[3:46:39] YOhodges: @mtn_dew_her its on the minecraft feedback website dont think i can post links though
[3:46:44] Allmostdone: @Adam_RT I think in my day it was only 2 years or less. But in the course of your work carrier it's nothing
[3:46:49] formar: i would suggest godot
[3:46:49] 16MB: @Tabakhase It's not that bad lol.
[3:46:54] boopbeepshmoop: i just started learning python during my summer break and its very fun
[3:47:01] DaGMC: learn kubernetes and make CKAD exam
[3:47:01] humanshjake: Android studio is pretty easy to get started on as well. If you wanna learn Java
[3:47:01] Fourseason_: @NephilimXS Machine Learning
[3:47:11] Kohta_Sama: Just learn assembly Kappa
[3:47:12] twoAze: twoAze subscribed with Prime. 
[3:47:12] Moobot: Thanks for subbing, twoAze! waffleH
[3:47:13] RyanIsSalty: what time do you wake up in the morning @Giantwaffle
[3:47:14] strictlysolo: so should i just start with python?
[3:47:16] Zec: If you learn programming in an easier language, you'll have a far easier time learning the more complex languages later.
[3:47:19] JimTheShark: TensorFlow is a thing though
[3:47:20] Tabakhase: !datapack @mtn_dew_her
[3:47:21] Moobot: Waffle is using this 1.17 datapack for the caves and cliffs | https://bit.ly/3g3heux
[3:47:27] DatoPotatoDato: I already know python, c# and a few other languages but after learning some i really do not know what to do beyond that
[3:47:29] Tabakhase: there is the link and how to
[3:47:31] firepher: assembly is cool
[3:47:33] GenerlKat: so unreal or unity?
[3:47:33] Flamingass: @Giantwaffle Python is very easy to grasp but it is verry hard to switch to a propper oop afterwords
[3:47:38] Came_Honor_Face: @yohodges I’m on Xbox so shouldn’t it have updated with my game?
[3:47:46] BasedLemur: Anyone else find python one of the hardest languages to work in? Not for getting a small project up and running, but in terms of tooling for deployment of anything
[3:47:49] YOhodges: why are you still mining with a stone axe
[3:47:56] Chronoes: Python is useful either way, for many things
[3:48:01] Allmostdone: start out in Cobol
[3:48:04] scappa_1986: i have been doing a degree, we started off with scratch, then python, now java
[3:48:04] the_one_wasabi: if you have a strong math background then machine learning is easy. If not you're gonna struggle a bit
[3:48:05] humanshjake: I would suggest finding a project you wanna do and research the best language. If you don't start with a project in mind, you'll probably burn out
[3:48:07] rawbits: that is not exactly true! Python is a very useful language but in concept, it differs a lot from other mainly used languages
[3:48:19] TheNeonian: Do you have a use case for ML or do you want to learn it out of curiosity?
[3:48:20] YOhodges: @mtn_dew_her oh, nah its not part of the new update technically so it still limits the world generation y evel
[3:48:26] firepher: im not a fan of python
[3:48:26] Supposedd: !datapack
[3:48:27] Moobot: Waffle is using this 1.17 datapack for the caves and cliffs | https://bit.ly/3g3heux
[3:48:29] strictlysolo: isnt python extremely versatile
[3:48:30] NephilimXS: python is highly utilized in script work on servers too
[3:48:37] Bumbl3Bee_: @Giantwaffle This whole dev topic made me want to catch up on my old forgotten projects xD
[3:48:37] Fourseason_: @the_one_wasabi I mean I have a minor in math and machine learning is very complex and difficult
[3:48:37] Exolve: Waffle probably knows more general stuff than me at this point but I'm doing my undergrad thesis on isolated keyword recognition with Python/TF/Keras KEKW
[3:48:39] jim_mee: js > python
[3:48:43] Nammor: I don't understand a single thing y'all are talking about danDerp
[3:48:45] DeadeyeWolff: you may want to plant some quad sapling trees . So wen you come back up you have plenty of wood on hand.
[3:48:58] Chronoes: it's not really designed around data, it just happened to be that because of it's simple syntax
[3:49:01] Flamingass: It is very hard to switch from Python to C# / C++ / Java/ Kotlin
[3:49:03] Lytto: @Giantwaffle so whats not included in this patch?
[3:49:03] Allmostdone: then use matlab
[3:49:10] Tabakhase: 90% of "learning programming" is understanding if, while, for arrays, variables and such - actual "language" is marginal...
[3:49:12] PendaTime: i beg to differ lmao @Flamingass
[3:49:23] paragonmouse: paragonmouse subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 10 months! HTML is the most ill do lol
[3:49:28] formar: i you learn C++ u can learn anything
[3:49:30] Kohta_Sama: same, html is ez wide
[3:49:30] quicksplit14: switching between java/kotlin and python is brutal lolol always typing the wrong things
[3:49:31] aaronsully113: Hi
[3:49:32] Kohta_Sama: widepeepoHappy *
[3:49:39] quicksplit14: ```fun``` gets met everytime
[3:49:45] DeadeyeWolff: quad spruce give you about 75 to 100 wood
[3:49:46] twoAze: i learned java and C then moved on to other languages.
[3:49:48] ballindelaney: Senior computer engineer and we’ve been working mostly with C , but I had a final project my freshman year in a python class and we made a simple 2d game and it was so much code lol
[3:49:49] strictlysolo: rip crucible
[3:49:52] ThENiNjaa456: paragon Sadge
[3:49:56] Flamingass: @Mima228 It was really hard for me, since I was used to having everything very easy to implement
[3:50:00] aCookienot: doesn't Paragon have another name now?
[3:50:08] Nammor: paragon's dead
[3:50:11] Kohta_Sama: remember scalebound widepeepoSad
[3:50:13] Ranctifier: nah paragon is long gone
[3:50:14] quicksplit14: any Rust fans in the house?
[3:50:19] DatoPotatoDato: I already know a few programming languages including python and C# but i really do not know what I want to do next in terms of projects thats where im stuck rn
[3:50:28] quicksplit14: Rust the programming language not the game lol
[3:50:29] Dumpified: is it weird of me to have a very low basic understanding of Lua because of wow?
[3:50:36] Chasetor22: @quicksplit14 the game rust? 👀
[3:50:45] Chasetor22: nvm
[3:50:46] PendaTime: @Flamingass i started off using Java syntax which made it easy to go to C#, C and even Javascript, but the syntax always threw me off in python, but eventually got the hang of it
[3:50:53] CoolReal: Computercraft
[3:50:56] AnimatedPanda: I know a basic of LUA from GMOD LUL
[3:51:03] djfrankfurter: yeah i was going to say garrys mod
[3:51:05] DatoPotatoDato: i know some LUA from roblox LUL
[3:51:07] quicksplit14: @Chasetor22 fan of the game too, but the language is awesome
[3:51:10] PendaTime: Roblox LUA PogChamp
[3:51:13] strictlysolo: new gmod?
[3:51:14] Nammor: lua is that user agreement stuff ?
[3:51:15] Wetware: The computercraft reactor control code was fun to mess with
[3:51:17] the_one_wasabi: I think lua was used for civ 5, too
[3:51:20] The_Newspaper: Pog
[3:51:22] ThENiNjaa456: new gmod PogChamp wtf
[3:51:22] Tabakhase: I managed to use lua @ work FeelsAmazingMan mysql-proxy middleman scripting 🙈
[3:51:38] DaGMC: @quicksplit14 rust is cool and maybe the future but can be brainfuck at the same time, and the binary size is huge
[3:51:41] Hurtwolf: Kreygasm
[3:51:44] SairuNai: WHAT
[3:51:48] BasedLemur: @Mima228 That's my exact scenario. Except before working in python, I started in JS/TS where deploying to npm was built in and easy
[3:51:49] Goldenlion5648: where the software dev hirers at?
[3:51:50] Diop_: Kreygasm
[3:51:54] RusUrtel: Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm
[3:51:55] ThENiNjaa456: thats really hype wtf
[3:51:55] Little_Lady_Lauren: yea computercraft got me started in programming
[3:51:58] peacekeper24: my cousin works with them and he gave me a developer key
[3:52:01] SairuNai: Okay you got me when you said vr and desktop
[3:52:02] Greedyro: what??
[3:52:10] Flamingass: @Mima228 I am currently programming on Java/ Kotlin after working with Python only for over 7 years and it was not that hard however I tried taking some courses in C# couple of years back and it really threw me off.
[3:52:12] peacekeper24: or whatever he called it
[3:52:19] Allmostdone: yea VR is so popular... not
[3:52:23] BasedLemur: But for some reason in Python, the first party stuff relies on third party stuff, and third party stuff in turn relies on the first party stuff, and nobody updates documentation because they both expect the other to
[3:52:25] MiraPacku: didn't he say he didn't want to publish it?
[3:52:25] scoobydoocd: it out yet?
[3:52:34] im_toast_tea: what is this for?
[3:52:35] Exolve: key-virus monkaS

[3:53:19] ThENiNjaa456: no pixel VR gmod RP 1.0 PogChamp
[3:53:29] TheMelodicMuse: Time for a resurgence of gmod type videos like prophunt and guess who?
[3:53:31] Kohta_Sama: monkaS
[3:53:31] Ranctifier: like callous row on that stuff
[3:53:37] CaptainMadrio: digging down on a mountain OMEGALUL
[3:53:37] Allmostdone: until they can get the fundamental issues with VR it will not be popular
[3:53:53] Kohta_Sama: lost already widePepeLaugh
[3:53:59] Drew1: wait, these are old caves?
[3:54:01] Nammor: @Giantwaffle  or you working on a serious game project or is it just to fuck arround & learn ?
[3:54:02] leo_k4n: chat is he playing vanilla minecraft?
[3:54:02] fathertoast1: when does the update come out?
[3:54:15] Diop_: peepoHappy sunset

[3:54:26] twoAze: are the caves cool
[3:54:35] twoAze: are the caves cool for the update*
[3:54:36] BasedLemur: Caves haven't been updated in this update

[3:55:08] ThENiNjaa456: what is it going to do?
[3:55:08] Kohta_Sama: full stack Kappa
[3:55:20] killerjoseph245: @Giantwaffle what's your project about?
[3:55:21] unclepenz: what do you mean with data science
[3:55:22] calvinisonline: templeOS?
[3:55:35] xymenez: life of every fullstack
[3:55:38] TractorRider: @Giantwaffle how are you tracking what needs to be done? Like a trello board or something?
[3:55:38] Bumbl3Bee_: Just go by little steps and not overthinking it
[3:55:40] xymenez: FeelsBadMan
[3:55:47] Chronoes: as long as you don't need to worry about browser compatibility KEKW
[3:55:53] PendaTime: frontend good YEP 👍
[3:55:54] dompa93: @calvk14 holy C KEKW
[3:55:54] NephilimXS: @Giantwaffle if you like having a visual or materialistic reward, front end is really fun
[3:55:55] Klorell: it's not hard just do it
[3:56:13] Fernandox28: the update out?????
[3:56:16] RodriCraft93: is that the new copper?
[3:56:18] Goldenlion5648: pygame?
[3:56:24] Goldenlion5648: tkinter?
[3:56:27] Dilwad: would you use tkinter?
[3:56:37] DeadeyeWolff: i got podzul all around my 50 x 50 Iron farm by planting spruce trees all round i think it looks awesome
[3:56:37] CorSPACE: tkinter pepeLaugh
[3:57:02] Exolve: tkinter is triggering my PTSD NotLikeThis
[3:57:05] Z3D____: !keyboard
[3:57:09] Ranctifier: qt is useful in python but well...any ui dev is awful
[3:57:12] peacekeper24: podzul?
[3:57:12] DaGMC: tkinter with the motif looks from the 80s/90s
[3:57:17] GenerlKat: so is unreal not very good compared to unity?
[3:57:28] CaptainAlkohol: looking to end the streaming career?
[3:57:40] justvibing87: what is your project for this world, you know yet?
[3:57:41] twoAze: looking for a job?
[3:57:41] firepher: i love c++
[3:57:42] Kohta_Sama: just learn C++ Kappa
[3:57:47] GenerlKat: oh, I learned c++ with my degree
[3:57:48] KingGEAR: I love Unity
[3:57:49] Dilwad: what user interface works well with python other than tkinter
[3:57:53] KingGEAR: it's so easy to clear C#
[3:57:54] Initial_: Can you just lie to the starbase developers and tell them that you work for NASA and should release the game today since you work at NASA? I cant wait 9 days
[3:57:55] GenerlKat: that was the main language
[3:58:00] Nammor: Working with programmer they all seem to love Unity over Unreal
[3:58:04] helios34: ugh that ugly cobblestone block
[3:58:14] TheUnrealOculus: I've got to be honest,1.17 is not as hyped as 1.18 or 1.16
[3:58:20] Kohta_Sama: they're using swift Kappa
[3:58:21] CRUCIFYX: Are you looking for a job since you're adding resume pieces?
[3:58:21] dompa93: c++ will stay for a long time man
[3:58:25] bazketcase: depends on your industry. you're bias.
[3:58:26] eikonotora: i m learning it
[3:58:27] Ranctifier: c# and java are way easier to program in than c++
[3:58:28] That_Lurker: @Giantwaffle Rust is slowly taking over
[3:58:29] szabikkkka: the car industry works with loads of C & C++
[3:58:30] jodli: because c++ is cancer... Everyone jumps on the rust train <3
[3:58:31] nxusr: you probably don't know many people working on core infrastructure
[3:58:32] Flamingass: You are not right
[3:58:33] BasedLemur: Yea it seems like it to me as well
[3:58:39] GenerlKat: I got a Bachelors in CS and c++ was the main lang we learned
[3:58:40] firepher: so much stuff is built on c++ lol
[3:58:41] GeneraISpy: idk im learning it in school
[3:58:42] braaedy: Performance dependent applications are always going to be c++ or another low level
[3:58:43] Allmostdone: lots of people think its to hard
[3:58:49] peacekeper24: waffle has a really nice way of wording things
[3:58:50] bugsplatter23: I enjoy learning c++ but it is challenging
[3:58:58] PendaTime: well in the industry, it's going to stick around for along time, even though there is alternatives like rust and go
[3:59:02] AtchTwoOh: most embedded development is in c
[3:59:03] the_one_wasabi: C++ is huge in scientific computation and high performance computing
[3:59:03] boopbeepshmoop: i feel like python is very popular mainly bc the computer industry is growing so much and people want to learn
[3:59:09] bugsplatter23: It has no pr machine
[3:59:15] the_one_wasabi: only rivaled by Fortran
[3:59:16] szabikkkka: yeah but microchips in cars like a brake assist cannot be big / slow
[3:59:20] trigol: Seems like C and C++ are used for the "tools" so to speak and far fewer people are working on the actual tech vs using it. Like there are far more mechanics that work on cars than the engineers that actually design them
[3:59:24] braaedy: The thing is, almost all the libraries you work with, they're probably written in c++.
[3:59:24] bobolpwnz: And those tools are written in C++ :D
[3:59:27] Bloodstein: robotics and ros development is mostly c++
[3:59:28] GenerlKat: what can you do with the copper?
[3:59:29] twoAze: C DansGame
[3:59:29] xymenez: compromising performance timmacHMM
[3:59:30] QwyIl: Low level is also slowly moving over to the Rust language as it gives guarentees on memory safety that c++ can't give
[3:59:31] peacekeper24: pog
[3:59:32] w1mon: C teaches u a lot about other programming languages, how they work internally
[3:59:33] strictlysolo: imagine floppys
[3:59:34] Flamingass: @Giantwaffle C++ is still relevant even with new technologies e.g. confidential computing
[3:59:36] Ranctifier: i'd argue a lot of industries uses c and c++ because of Catia
[3:59:38] jodli: even for the small stuff everyone will migrate to rust some time in the future
[3:59:44] braaedy: Like numpy and scipy are all c++
[3:59:45] teej_dv: Rust, btw :TM:
[3:59:49] Allmostdone: Fortran is the way to go
[3:59:49] jodli: its memory safety is unrivaled
[3:59:49] Magus66: the thing about C is that it’s portable
[3:59:54] Magus66: it will run on anything
[3:59:54] Chronoes: A lot of Python is actually processed by C code, so it'll be there forever
[3:59:59] DaGMC: rust is a language
[4:00:00] Mandorake: @Giantwaffle Have you ever thought about making a factory builder game?
[4:00:02] erkro1: It's already happening, lots of things run on Electron nowadays
[4:00:05] dasmako: Roller Coaster Tycoon being made in assembly was nuts
[4:00:09] Magus66: it’s also only a low level abstraction over the actual computer.
[4:00:13] Tabakhase: rust is a language
[4:00:14] twoAze: Rust Master race PepeLaugh
[4:00:14] teej_dv: LUL at people saying everything will be rust
[4:00:16] nxusr: python is aVM
[4:00:16] Zec: Rust is quite cool. Have played with it a bit.
[4:00:18] DakotaFoxes: Clap
[4:00:20] AtchTwoOh: python is interpreted
[4:00:21] braaedy: Option is interpreted
[4:00:21] twoAze: Rust Master race KEKW
[4:00:24] TheOmyNomy: Python is an interpreted language, not a compiled language.
[4:00:24] Allmostdone: Electron bloatware
[4:00:25] BasedLemur: C will exist literally forever
[4:00:26] braaedy: Python*
[4:00:28] QwyIl: Rust is a lowlevel language like c++ but it has really cool maths behind the language rules that is great for low level programs.
[4:00:30] minedmatrix: you should go find a stone cutter for stairs
[4:00:33] the1_ajc: Where do you start to learn all this?
[4:00:35] Magus66: C will never die.
[4:00:41] Ranctifier: cobol and fortran need to die
[4:00:41] firepher: python isnt compiled my guy
[4:00:46] braaedy: COBOL should die
[4:00:47] nathanvsw: stone cutter D:

[4:00:51] Moobot: You can find Waffle's Youtube channel here - https://youtube.com/giantwaffle
[4:00:51] PxlSauce: waffle, if you make a stone cutter making stairs is more efficient
[4:00:55] braaedy: But it won't because the government is cheap
[4:00:58] Flamingass: Python is runtime
[4:01:00] Tabakhase: CAREFULL there
[4:01:01] Siyrax: interpreted
[4:01:01] GenerlKat: it is interpreted
[4:01:01] Chronoes: it's interpreted at runtime
[4:01:02] Ranctifier: python *can* compile if you do it a certain way
[4:01:02] Magus66: Because the interpreter or compiler for your higher level language is probably in C
[4:01:04] sogerr: python is runtime
[4:01:07] twoAze: python is interpreted
[4:01:14] BasedLemur: Python tooling is so confusing
[4:01:16] trigol: I work for a supermarket chain and remember seeing a job listing in the break from for the IT dept and had Cobol as a requirement
[4:01:16] nathanvsw: make sure to use stone cutter to get more blocks
[4:01:23] whyyoutrying: when he doesnt use a stone cutter
[4:01:24] Tabakhase: .pyc devCheck .py
[4:01:25] Chronoes: Same for Javascript, PHP etc
[4:01:26] Magus66: most languages cannot ever compile themselves.
[4:01:29] lofffff: susHmm
[4:01:31] Flamingass: literally everything is runtime executable in Python even classes
[4:01:35] Bumbl3Bee_: Python is just same as JS - script lang
[4:01:36] Skelly82: you can run python as an interactive shell
[4:01:39] nathanvsw: 1 stone for 1 stair
[4:01:40] PxlSauce: for stairs yes
[4:01:41] calvinisonline: yeah its 1 for 1
[4:01:44] 514484: stonecutters are more efficient for stairs
[4:01:45] tsnipezx: yes
[4:01:47] DeadeyeWolff: yes very efficient
[4:01:48] firepher: which is why python is often slower, it must be interpreted everytime
[4:01:52] DeadeyeWolff: for slabs also
[4:01:55] TheMelodicMuse: more efficient for stairs, the others i dont think so
[4:01:55] n8level: it is condensed to bytecode however, and libraries are often written in C
[4:02:03] PxlSauce: slabs is equally efficient
[4:02:06] braaedy: Python is generally interpreted but you can use some other distros that get closer to compiled. Also, sometimes others can be just-in-time compiled
[4:02:10] Zec: C# is more or less interpreted at runtime too. That's why it's fast to compile. It's only compiled to an intermediate format first.
[4:02:14] Munschmann: Java is also a interpreted language
[4:02:15] bedbuggies: Python is C
[4:02:15] Came_Honor_Face: Does bedrock not go below 0 height coordinates? I just made a new world and bedrock is still at 0-5
[4:02:17] Allmostdone: it all comes back to C
[4:02:23] Magus66: if you want it to run on everything from a toaster to a space ship, use C
[4:02:32] Klorell: RIP Jython
[4:02:38] Munschmann: Yes C runs on everything
[4:02:38] CoolReal: @mtn_dew_her you need to have the datapack installed
[4:02:41] Goldenlion5648: dang so many programmers in the chat
[4:02:42] Tabakhase: @mtn_dew_her then you didnt install/load the datapack correctly i guess
[4:02:50] NordESA: @Magus66 So perfect for my space ship toaster then? susHmm
[4:03:02] Came_Honor_Face: @coolreal I’m on Xbox so how can I add that? I updated my game
[4:03:04] Magus66: cylons probably ran C
[4:03:14] HostileLogOut: c# is compiled into IL
[4:03:19] iDelore: He's gonna leave us for programming widepeepoSad
[4:03:20] CorSPACE: KEKW
[4:03:20] Tabakhase: @mtn_dew_her this is Java, not Bedrock
[4:03:22] Goldenlion5648: anyone in chat hiring for software devs? haha
[4:03:23] twoAze: @Munschmann partially interpreted i believe
[4:03:23] LatHund: "Waffle I'll hire you" PogChamp
[4:03:24] teej_dv: that's pretty much what happened for me -- i've known a few other programming streamers who had a simialr thing
[4:03:32] Nammor: then you say no Kappa
[4:03:37] mephisto__ttv: yeah - me too, pls

[4:03:47] poolers215: the one time twitch chat actually helps seems sus
[4:03:49] Rob_Kebab: The long con
[4:03:50] Kohta_Sama: because twitch is turning into a porn site
[4:03:53] Kohta_Sama: LULW
[4:03:55] peacekeper24: lol streaming is the pre step
[4:03:58] boopbeepshmoop: oof
[4:04:07] Came_Honor_Face: @tabakhase That’s why I asked does bedrock version go below 0. I updated my game but it seems like the old world limits are still the case
[4:04:13] September2030: @Tsimentokourado always
[4:04:14] LadineL337: Did you watch the launch video for this update hilarious
[4:04:22] simplykoko: or even add mir adds
[4:04:25] Mandorake: New feature that forces you to never play real music
[4:04:29] DaGMC: @Giantwaffle maybe you should lurk George Hotz streams he is also looking for people to hire
[4:04:32] teej_dv: waffle, if you want to find software ppl looking to hire, you could consider raiding sci & tech -- there's a lot of programmer out there.
[4:04:33] Equandor: isn't that how git hub and LinkedIn works? companies contact you instead
[4:04:34] Noob_Killa: Twitch is celebrating its 10 year anniversary... too bad the 10 years of VODs got deleted
[4:04:40] SuperBigFace: 100% is desktop only and 80% of views for facebook are mobile
[4:04:47] Mandorake: Granted the ffacebook deal is really terrible
[4:04:50] LatHund: LULW
[4:04:53] dasmako: KEKW

[4:05:30] Barney__: I only watch Gothalion
[4:05:33] poolers215: watch Goth every now and again
[4:05:33] Mandorake: I think you can make a 'gaming' account
[4:05:39] DakotaFoxes: toast streams on facebook...?
[4:05:40] Nammor: didn't even know he switched
[4:05:41] sogerr: boomers are on facebook, i guess they watch streams
[4:05:43] tsnipezx: Yea Gothalion thats is
[4:05:46] PxlSauce: I watched a couple of Vader streams for GTA Rp
[4:05:47] complexprotein: Farmville gamer

[4:06:07] bluetip84: its way less interactive chat wise
[4:06:07] NephilimXS: Goth went to mixer, than took the FB deal
[4:06:08] Tabakhase: more a "gaming profile" - after the realname fiasko KEKW - fake accounts they are really alergic too
[4:06:11] Rob_Kebab: yes you can watch if you don’t have an account. But you can’t chat
[4:06:11] tsnipezx: Yes
[4:06:14] TheOmyNomy: People actually took the migration deal from Mixer to Facebook? LUL

[4:06:22] Exolve: I watched Toast a lot on twitch but didn't bother since he moved to FB (plus amogus wast my cup of tea)
[4:06:24] kyanpeppaa: toast big brain to still stream on twitch with anything not related to gaming
[4:06:29] usernameNull: who wants to chat under their real name?
[4:06:31] 16MB: We not gonna mention youtbe streaming?
[4:06:34] tommyfod: Goth didnt have THAT big a fan base... weird move
[4:06:38] teej_dv: @usernameNull monkaS
[4:07:01] Caritien: @Giantwaffle Toast isn't trying to be successful, he's trying to be happy.
[4:07:09] Coffeeworld: Toast doesn't care for the success. He got paid. He got his friends success.
[4:07:14] The_Newspaper: I have seen him streaming on Twitch too sometimes too
[4:07:15] TechNaOkami: i really liked goth and even tried to watch him on mixer and after he went to FB i never even bother watching him again

[4:07:28] fluffysheep357: DIdthey add only clifffs
[4:07:31] Caritien: Toast was given $20k to make a promotional video. Instead of using the money to make one (like when Shroud and Ninja did for Mixer) he donated it to a local hospital
[4:07:32] mechoriet: wait leaked prices D:

[4:34:01] September2030: oh bet
[4:34:01] Tabakhase: wouldnt you want to make something new - rather then update enderIO KEKW
[4:34:05] b0tmau: vertical redstone
[4:34:08] TheMelodicMuse: I want a mod that adds a block that takes textures from adjacent blocks to create a more blended transition between them
[4:34:17] September2030: rip
[4:34:24] masztufa: implement SPICE to calculate losses on the copper wires Kappa
[4:34:29] September2030: 13-12
[4:34:32] PxlSauce: not anymore
[4:34:42] Watertoad: there used to be a better redstone mod
[4:34:42] Red_Fog18: 12 or lower for diamonds
[4:34:43] dexbits: Is it still 12? I thought they changed the ore levels.
[4:34:47] ShionSinX: redstone is like a phone USB cable, transfers data and energy :)
[4:34:47] Watertoad: that you could go up walls
[4:34:48] Red_Fog18: ore gen was changed heavly
[4:34:52] Watertoad: but it never got updated
[4:34:55] Stillglade: I could see vanilla getting electricity in a couple years
[4:35:08] Nammor: that's a vanilla feature
[4:35:15] September2030: oof once everything updates my mining at 13 is gonna suck  LUL
[4:35:16] CiVR: @ninopanda I have, have you seen FD: TUNGFDRPGIESTRL
[4:35:31] ninopanda: yes!!!
[4:35:32] masztufa: vanilla is already a tech mod. Fortune doubles ores, so it's technically that
[4:35:39] Caritien: @Giantwaffle netherite pick
[4:35:40] Joshuapetch: @CiVR did you just have a stoke on the keyboard MONKERS
[4:35:41] Joshuapetch: KEKW
[4:35:42] zoth_: Chisel & bits lets you blend any textures /s
[4:35:51] masztufa: fortune works on metals too
[4:35:52] CiVR: @joshuapetch that’s it’s abbreviation
[4:35:56] Joshuapetch: Jesus
[4:35:58] Kuroiorb: for what?!
[4:36:02] Kuroiorb: peepoPat @ninopanda
[4:36:02] ninopanda: @joshuapetch you would have to know it
[4:36:04] TheMelodicMuse: Kinda got the idea playing Minecraft Dungeons a lot and seeing how those texture transitions look
[4:36:08] masztufa: so it's basically ore doubling. And every tech mod has ore doubling (even AE2)
[4:36:10] ninopanda: hey kuro
[4:36:21] Kuroiorb: movie tonight?
[4:36:22] Caritien: I want you to mine with a netherite pick instead of stone
[4:36:25] Caritien: get to it moon2A
[4:36:38] Feist_: i think he means that enchantments can be considered a "mod" for vanilla?
[4:36:44] ninopanda: I am down if all the other mods are down.
[4:36:45] aldriik0: so what all did they put in the update?
[4:36:46] TheRealTweex: No Remorse On Amazon is great
[4:36:47] justchillinjay: was pretty good
[4:36:48] Itachi_Siller: A quiet place Part 2 was good
[4:36:49] firepher: a horror movie?
[4:36:52] Joshuapetch: @Kuroiorb movie peepoHappy
[4:36:53] masztufa: no. i don't mean that
[4:36:53] Nammor: horror movies ResidentSleeper
[4:36:55] BigMan510_: Love the beard. How long have you been growing it for?
[4:36:57] PxlSauce: @Giantwaffle can you allow me to post a link to the new ore distribution? it on the minecraft wiki
[4:37:00] Tabakhase: widePepeLaugh netherrite?
[4:37:04] BurnedAether: @Giantwaffle I think Conjuring 3 is not as spooky but a lot more of a story so it's good.
[4:37:05] September2030: netherite ax becomes Mjollnir Kappa
[4:37:06] PxlSauce: if you are interested
[4:37:16] dexbits: Haven't ore levels changed?
[4:37:19] Patchi_: Patchi_ subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 18 months! 
[4:37:31] PxlSauce: yes
[4:37:33] Caritien: it goes negative now, no?
[4:37:35] b0tmau: something like that
[4:37:35] PxlSauce: look at my comment
[4:37:36] Wetware: Watched 'Predestination' last night, very strange time travel movie
[4:37:36] PlayingCarrot: yes
[4:37:41] aldriik0: yea
[4:37:43] Deadfox74: I didn’t think so
[4:37:43] aldriik0: goes -60
[4:37:45] 514484: it will go negative in 1.18
[4:37:45] The_kid_as_a_teen: yes
[4:37:45] laidher: it goes negative now
[4:37:48] 514484: no changes now
[4:37:53] milkshakeman405: diamonds still spawn at same level i believe
[4:37:54] PxlSauce: @Giantwaffle can you allow me to post a link to the new ore distribution? it on the minecraft wiki
[4:37:54] BasedLemur: Different Y levels for different resources
[4:37:55] king_goozie: that part hasnt happened yet
[4:37:57] The_kid_as_a_teen: KEKW
[4:37:57] prairydog: ruh roh
[4:37:59] dexbits: Google it, there are ore distribution infographics now.
[4:38:01] CiVR: @joshuapetch Full Dive: The Ultimate Next-Gen Full Dive RPG Is Even Shittier Than Real Life is the title to the anime
[4:38:02] DatoPotatoDato: in 1.17 they kept the Y level the same
[4:38:02] Red_Fog18: i did say they drasticley changed ore gen
[4:38:03] 514484: that's in 1.18 guys -_-
[4:38:05] nathanvsw: yh they do
[4:38:07] 514484: lmao
[4:38:07] CorSPACE: @Giantwaffle https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/minecraft_gamepedia/images/0/0f/21w18a_approximate_ore_distribution.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20210505174329
[4:38:08] Deadfox74: Y level is 1.18 I thought
[4:38:11] September2030: google the graph
[4:38:11] Plastic_buddha: Imagine over 60 levels of diamond spawns Pog
[4:38:12] nathanvsw: i just found some at y 14
[4:38:15] Karnaxx: that's all in 1.18
[4:38:16] zoth_: I mean, its part 1 of 2 for the update
[4:38:17] Rangetuur: the lower you go the more diamonds you get i think
[4:38:19] Joshuapetch: @CiVR wtf LUL
[4:38:20] mechoriet: there is a diagram for destribution
[4:38:20] PxlSauce: that link
[4:38:24] LikeAKnife: @CiVR googling it only shows 1 person using that abbreviation on Twitterl lol
[4:38:27] Caritien: @Giantwaffle the problem with it is Diamonds spawn one vein per chunk. It goes from 14 to -60 though
[4:38:28] Red_Fog18: wiki says 5-12 for diamonds in 1.17
[4:38:28] b0tmau: is part 2 going to be 1.18?
[4:38:29] Stillglade: you should put flat levels to the sides and let the stairs go straight down
[4:38:31] PxlSauce: yes the datapck one
[4:38:33] aldriik0: but in different abundance so be careful about mining at y13
[4:38:43] mechoriet: yeah thats what mojang showed off
[4:38:46] The_kid_as_a_teen: not final
[4:38:54] BeastboySAW: 14 To -63.  More at deeper levels
[4:38:55] dexbits: @Giantwaffle There's been slight changes, but that's true.
[4:38:56] masztufa: it's a meme that every tech mod has ore doubling (macerator, pulverizer, etc.). Now with fortune metal ores drop more than one "chunks". So vanilla can double ores, therefore it's a tech mod
[4:38:59] CorSPACE: thats what it was for the snapshots
[4:39:09] zoth_: can we get the datapack link rq
[4:39:12] DatoPotatoDato: around y=-60 would be perfect
[4:39:12] mightyturtle_21: chat do you guys know how to add the datapack to a server? before the world is generated
[4:39:18] Tabakhase: !datapack
[4:39:18] Moobot: Waffle is using this 1.17 datapack for the caves and cliffs | https://bit.ly/3g3heux
[4:39:23] zoth_: ty moo
[4:39:28] CiVR: @likeaknife lmao
[4:39:33] CoolReal: Ore gen is different now, don't forget that
[4:39:36] PTK9: who mines iron, just make a iron golems farm LUL
[4:39:41] blizzardmagic: remember the best place to mine iron is close to the top of the world in a mountain biome
[4:39:41] PTK9: or its not in 1.17?
[4:39:44] CorSPACE: @mightyturtle_21 generate the world then add it to the server folder
[4:39:44] nathanvsw: i have bedrock lad at the bottom of mine
[4:39:54] XxTeam48LowesXx: KEKW

[4:51:35] CoolReal: Chat, is he going to ignore the diamonds he found in the water? KEKW
[4:51:42] Soul_Synergy: You can craft those ore clumps in to blocks and should also be able to find them in veins as well
[4:51:50] PlayingCarrot: i think so
[4:51:52] Kohta_Sama: Datapack = Walmart discount mod Kappa
[4:52:04] shakeweII: so the new vanilla update has the same old caves. none of this

[4:52:41] thealbanianguy: @giantwaffle diamonds in the water!!
[4:52:58] CorSPACE: @delnith17 because default generation in 1.17 is similar to prior 1.17, the datapack adds in the cave generation we saw in the snapshots

[4:55:07] Kohta_Sama: ikr, seeing negative height is so strange now

[5:39:27] nxusr: e.g. we'd be able to send you an erasure request
[5:39:28] phoenixxua: @Giantwaffle GDPR requires you to remove all user related information if user requests it
[5:39:30] CorSPACE: @Giantwaffle could you build a part of your website for that, to show your stats etc
[5:39:30] rawbits: GDPR?
[5:39:33] Itachi_Siller: Black Mirror Twitch Version

[5:39:37] kingcodcat: if it does not collect personal information you should be fine
[5:39:43] TxMaverick88: @Giantwaffle i THINK as long as you dont SAVE the chat its fine. You can scrub, grade, trash
[5:39:48] nxusr: for GDPR purposes, even a user ID or username counts

[5:41:47] The_Newspaper: yeah it is eU
[5:41:49] Sagrotth: yea US doesnt care
[5:41:53] Zonear: @Giantwaffle I work in IT, and from what you say you are logging, a username/ID number and a score based on a calculation from chat messages/chat behaviour should be cool with GDPR - there is no reason for the freak out
[5:41:58] nxusr: GDPR is EU, but check out CCPA for what you'll have to deal with in the US

[5:42:44] Jackel148: @Giantwaffle you are correct that an ID is not an ID you are not tied to that. it has to be tied to you specifically. In the US there is no basis for using a username to be tied to you
[5:42:44] ThatOnneGuy: aCookienot you do realize most people use simple wifi passwords and wifi can reach outside your home right?
[5:42:47] That_Lurker: @Giantwaffle Twitch is already logging all chat to vods and that is fine so why would you doing it be any different
[5:42:47] complexprotein: I'm going to need you to reset my social credit score, my cat ran across my keyboard
[5:42:48] Lhation: i feel bad for the one guy that is actually true
[5:42:55] CocoScruff: so then those guys who got hit for distributing music through nabster back in the day were found using IP address and were held accountable for what happened on their address, no?
[5:42:55] MakerOfThingys: "My cat hit the enter key, please unban me"
[5:42:56] ThatWeirdoGuy: I guess if you are just using (logging) the data already publicly available on twitch (like current viewer list) there would be no reason for you to get issues unless Twitch also does.
[5:42:57] LtCol_Carter: It's quite simple to bypass anyway if it is an issue, as all you need is an opt-in message that pops up before watching the stream once
[5:42:57] moon_monk1: my dog was being racist
[5:43:04] ThatOnneGuy: YEP
[5:43:04] lomein43: yea
[5:43:05] CorSPACE: ya
[5:43:07] nightfallxyz: y?
[5:43:09] Frankenstain: Art. 4 GDPR (Definitions) lists "an online identifier" as "personal data" but I agree this is a grey area.
[5:43:13] DigitallyAdmiringHumanity: I used that excuse when I hacked on a Minecraft server
[5:43:13] ShionSinX: in the past 5 years, yes
[5:43:14] nxusr: no, because I can ask twitch to scrub it
[5:43:18] CorSPACE: i see streamers look at chat logs all the tim
[5:43:19] atrainplaysgames: yeah pretty sure it's in the ToS
[5:43:21] GummiKu: As long at it links to a person, you have to be careful with the data you collect. Doesn't matter if your system doesn't use it. If it's stolen, then you are in trouble.
[5:43:22] N4RCO5: but that gets stored at twitch
[5:43:22] ShionSinX: I think before 2015 they didnt
[5:43:23] DigitallyAdmiringHumanity: Still haven’t been unbanned
[5:43:24] Tauruntino: that is the most common excuse when asking for an unban
[5:43:24] nxusr: if I send them an erasure request, they will drop all my data
[5:43:24] MakerOfThingys: Just have the ability to remove it upon request
[5:43:26] Kohta_Sama: yep
[5:43:26] mechoriet: YEP
[5:43:27] Jackel148: no
[5:43:29] scary_shini: yes
[5:43:29] DyldoBaggins97: yes
[5:43:30] Beergrillz: yea
[5:43:33] brymstax: It's 2021 guys, time to say that your SISTER was typing on your account in those ban appeals
[5:43:34] kskskskskskskssss: it's more like a stream, then logging no ?
[5:43:36] aCookienot: @ThatOnneGuy sure
[5:43:37] Wetware: I think Discord probably has enough info to fool you mother in a chat conversation
[5:43:37] scary_shini: at least you should be able to
[5:43:38] K3ll06s: yes its an eu thing
[5:43:40] LtCol_Carter: Yeah
[5:43:41] nxusr: yeah
[5:43:43] CorSPACE: @Giantwaffle you can see chat messages from years ago
[5:43:44] IceBlueFire: GDPR is all about associating an online screen name with personal information. If you are just associating online stuff with more online stuff and not trying to trace it back to a physical person, you're fine
[5:43:45] scary_shini: yes
[5:43:45] AtchTwoOh: you have the right to disappear,
[5:43:47] pixfix2k2: LUL Thats like asking Facebook to "delete" your account
[5:43:53] N4RCO5: must be op in
[5:43:55] JohnBohnn: are the new cave generations in this update?
[5:43:58] Kroggie: it has nothing to do with GDPR
[5:43:58] senornasty: must be opt in
[5:43:59] Miaoux: That's just what the CCP would say
[5:44:00] mechoriet: YEP and we can also request a zip of all the data twitch has on me :)
[5:44:04] davethulhu: hurting people is a bonus :)
[5:44:04] TxMaverick88: @Giantwaffle neutral??? Nah just ban the opt out KEKW
[5:44:05] Sagrotth: right...thats what china says too
[5:44:06] Jackel148: that isn't a viable reason because you signed a user agreement with twitch to log that info
[5:44:06] Gokunerk: Thats what they all say Kappa
[5:44:06] LtCol_Carter: ATTENTION YEP
[5:44:07] DyldoBaggins97: GDPR requires you to remove data, if requested by the user, that's the issue, not that you can't collect data
[5:44:14] Mazari_: social china score? FeelsGoodMan
[5:44:16] ThatOnneGuy: YEP doesn't ever read mod messages
[5:44:17] CorSPACE: would offline chatting count for more? PepoThink
[5:44:17] digipex12: has to be opt in so make it a command in chat to accept
[5:44:19] Takii: Ive asked google to delete info of me for me @giantwaffle
[5:44:19] ThatWeirdoGuy: Well asking Twitch to "opt out of it" does not delete the memory of the people who happened to watch the list with your name on it.. Is that then illegal to know?
[5:44:19] atamala: would it take into account how long someone has followed and/or age of account?
[5:44:22] Beergrillz: twitch has to have someone on payroll to control gdpr and answer qiestions about it aswel and there has to be a limit how long they keep it
[5:44:24] RdyWasTaken: it's a public forum and does not sell it self as being private in any way
[5:44:28] LtCol_Carter: yes
[5:44:29] aCookienot: @Giantwaffle you could use your own chat, like Destiny xD
[5:44:33] LtCol_Carter: YES
[5:44:33] mechoriet: YEP it has to be opt in
[5:44:33] imAWMan: yes
[5:44:35] LadineL337: Did you have any problems starting Minecraft 1.17 @Giantwaffle . I cant seem to figure out why it puts my monitor into standby mode when I launch it :(
[5:44:36] That_Lurker: no
[5:44:38] N4RCO5: yes
[5:44:39] iTents: You Opt in when you create your Twitch Account
[5:44:39] AtchTwoOh: you do that when you accept the tos
[5:44:39] senornasty: yes
[5:44:40] Frankenstain: it's probably part of the twitch terms & service
[5:44:41] TheWonderLlama: both
[5:44:43] digipex12: yes
[5:44:49] mechoriet: NOPERS its not its my data :)
[5:44:51] digipex12: thats what the cookie message are
[5:44:51] Munschmann: Yes every kind of data-collection/-tracking is opt-in
[5:44:52] LtCol_Carter: It's a simple like tickbox though, so it comes from ToS as said above
[5:44:56] PwninXcore: Hope you have a wonderful stream brother! Beard is looking majestic.
[5:44:57] The_time_is_out_of_joint: that what they say oinkBad In china if your score is too low, you cannot rent a car or take a taxi
[5:44:58] Jackel148: just ban EU game over
[5:45:02] Wetware: Might want to read the Discord TOS LUL
[5:45:10] mechoriet: and the tos checkmark isnt allowed to be filled in already
[5:45:17] BobPatience: KEKW sure EU is the crazy on
[5:45:19] mechoriet: or newsletters
[5:45:27] pixfix2k2: Literally Black Mirror
[5:45:27] Moobot: Come join the Waffle House discord https://discord.gg/G5FeeveP3c and chat with the community! Remember to link your Twitch account in the Settings (gear) > Connections for subscriber channels.
[5:45:33] ThatOnneGuy: Anyone with an EU ping be like "why does it say this stream isn't available in my area" pepeLaugh
[5:45:33] nxusr: KEKW
[5:45:42] Chyromyr: I mean, you have to opt-in, but look at how websites handle cookies. Using the site is treated as opting in, or disabling them is made so inconvenient nobody does it, which I'm pretty sure violates the law but /shrug
[5:45:45] EmotePerMessage: @Giantwaffle will it be just a bot, or a full twitch extension?
[5:45:46] Battokage: yeah we got a somewhat good data privacy
[5:45:46] DyldoBaggins97: it's because the US can record anything whenever the fuck they like, GDPR is honestly much better, everywhere should have it
[5:46:02] mechoriet: also we are allowed to request a full data dump of what twitch has of me as a user :)
[5:46:03] Kamzy_11: why using a stone pic and not iron?
[5:46:04] isfil: what is the epic creator tag for waffle?
[5:46:13] Battokage: @DyldoBaggins97 👍
[5:46:20] Kuroiorb: !creator @isfil
[5:46:20] Moobot: Support Waffle by using his Epic creator code: Giantwaffle
[5:46:21] The_Newspaper: people exploit it
[5:46:25] senornasty: basically any website is forced to tell us who they are selling our data too and it is opt-in, for old accounts we got emails etc
[5:46:25] Munschmann: Sounds like every law in the eu :D
[5:46:28] Ladon_Dragon: that's about ANY EU internet law
[5:46:31] Kroggie: its such a misunderstood concept :D
[5:46:32] N4RCO5: ofc its politics making it
[5:46:34] digipex12: yeah there is lots of grey wiggle room on the rules
[5:46:35] Ladon_Dragon: perfect summery right there
[5:46:43] peetur_: inconvenient but excellentfor the user
[5:46:47] LtCol_Carter: I mean all "extreme" porn is illegal
[5:46:49] LikeAKnife: peepee porn is banned too
[5:46:50] lomein43: tried to make it 18 plus by using a credit card or pass port
[5:46:54] NinjaKeywee: face sitting or something
[5:46:55] iTents: But you can go to London and leagally hire a working lady LUL
[5:46:57] lomein43: to verify
[5:46:58] MiraPacku: UK pepeLaugh
[5:46:58] DrymSP: why not an iron pickaxe ?
[5:47:00] N4RCO5: we have upload filters coming too
[5:47:00] DyldoBaggins97: It isn't inconvenient at all? it's just a legal right to say "remove the data on me" that's it in a nutshell
[5:47:06] LikeAKnife: Australia banned shaved and small boobs
[5:47:09] nxusr: @Giantwaffle https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/long-list-sex-acts-just-got-banned-uk-porn-9897174.html
[5:47:10] DyldoBaggins97: it's good
[5:47:13] rudi_human: what porn is not illegal in the EU wtf is this XD
[5:47:17] Rendarion87: That's what she said.
[5:47:20] mechoriet: @Giantwaffle also cool we can request a full data dump of our account with everything that is linked to it :) as a zip widePepeLaugh
[5:47:22] RainDoc: no stairs, eew
[5:47:27] rudi_human: bruh thats fake
[5:47:28] GummiKu: If you open google in incognito. In the US, do you have to agree to user data storage before being able to search?
[5:47:33] LtCol_Carter: Pornsites just need to have the "Challenge 18" popup before they access the website
[5:47:38] CorSPACE: what?
[5:47:41] Kohta_Sama: yeah, it's stupid

[5:59:25] zylancee: i got it at 5€
[5:59:26] iTents: Not cheaper just imbalanced inflation LUL
[5:59:26] SeriousPotatoBot: Wasn't minecaft also a browser game at the start?
[5:59:30] Gberqz: even at 57, diamonds feels a lot rarer.
[5:59:38] derpinbran: i bought it when it was 4.99
[5:59:41] Robbiie_: the demo was a browser game
[5:59:48] boopbeepshmoop: does anyone remember the og cube world ?

[6:00:16] GummiKu: Yea it got up to 10
[6:00:26] swoonithkey: does the new update have new cave generation because mine does not
[6:00:27] CorSPACE: it didnt mention it cause its part of the datapack
[6:00:55] theunderjack: Do diamonds still spawn once per chunk?
[6:01:00] Robbiie_: @swoonithkey data pack with experimental features
[6:01:02] CorSPACE: well it will probably change again in 1.18
[6:01:05] cherrylxght: @swoonithkey no it does not, thats coming christmas time
[6:01:10] swoonithkey: ah thanks @Rawooo_
[6:01:25] DatoPotatoDato: i believe diamonds are in smaller blobs but more frequent last i heard but it may have changed now in a later snapshot
[6:01:28] Hamiltown: @theunderjack is that how it worked before?
[6:01:29] Keifer48: is that a new type of stone or is that a texture pack?
[6:01:33] thats_cap: can u locate the biomes for the deep caves?
[6:01:49] theunderjack: @theunderjack I belive so
[6:01:49] Moobot: You can find Waffle's Youtube channel here - https://youtube.com/giantwaffle
[6:01:55] Blakejh_: daimond mining will also be harder anyways because the new deepslate is harder to mine
[6:01:59] Robbiie_: @keifer48 all new blocks
[6:02:03] n8level: there's python code to parse the save file, I'm sure Sev already has the numbers LUL
[6:02:08] CorSPACE: cave biomes arent in but the blocks for them are
[6:02:12] CorSPACE: at least the ones we know of
[6:02:20] swoonithkey: @Giantwaffle what code would you recommend getting into first?
[6:02:30] Amirh2296: @giantwaffle gonna make a rail later?
[6:02:38] Solitude411: i thought the deep caves was like one of the major components of this update
[6:02:40] Bulva: when you mining looking up like this, its sometimes make you feel like looking down the mine shaft
[6:02:41] mvxswell: isnt that what xray hack is for?
[6:02:42] Roy323: that probably means no more instant mining with beacons
[6:02:52] Solitude411: i feel like making us wait til 1.18 is kinda shitty
[6:03:01] dubscian: Hello
[6:03:06] SeriousPotatoBot: NOP Oh boy my current download speed is 50kbs
[6:03:09] TheMelodicMuse: they didnt do it on purpose
[6:03:10] CorSPACE: @Roy323 correct, deepslate cant be insta mined
[6:03:52] Lackysami: can you make a server with that datapack?
[6:04:08] Gberqz: @Lackysami yes, I currently run one
[6:04:08] zoth_: Can't wait to try an amplified world with the extra height
[6:04:16] CorSPACE: i think delaying part of it will also allow for better content rather than stripped for deadlines
[6:04:18] Solitude411: does that mean we dont even have skulkers
[6:04:23] DatoPotatoDato: do you plan on building a base on the mountain?
[6:04:32] Kwezio: imagine now the tnt perimeter hole Kreygasm
[6:04:37] CorSPACE: why wouldnt we?
[6:04:39] mrkaszkeit: No skulk sensors yeat
[6:04:44] Solitude411: those are the sound sensors basically
[6:04:50] CorSPACE: the sensors are creative ONLY
[6:04:50] Lackysami: @Gberqz where did you get the server file? or do you run the 1.17 and add the datapack to the server somehow?
[6:05:15] SeriousPotatoBot: widepeepoSad Chat are not waffles "buds"
[6:05:39] skynetcloud: @Giantwaffle  it does work but you need make the datapacks  folder and add that datapack before loading the  world on a server
[6:05:43] Invalidm_: whoa
[6:05:44] lomein43: WutFace paragragh
[6:05:44] AtchTwoOh: @Zonear try to make it a bit shorter mate
[6:05:47] Solitude411: ik im sounding like a debbie downer but i thought this was gonna be a much bigger chnage than just cosmetic stuff

[6:05:54] XxTeam48LowesXx: Rip Minecraft Sadge
[6:05:55] Gberqz: @Gberqz I create a world folder by hand, then create a "datapacks" folder in that folder. Put the preview data pack in there. Then start it
[6:05:57] Invalidm_: tldr that shit
[6:06:00] firepher: i like it
[6:06:04] TxMaverick88: powerwashing? peepoLeave

[6:06:10] Thulen: HahaReindeer eh they taking forever to add things
[6:06:11] Robbiie_: I like it a lot
[6:06:15] nxusr: I think the datapack is the MVP here
[6:06:24] DatoPotatoDato: the update is okay but the datapack makes it way better

[6:06:48] nathy_rl: wait whats the datapack?
[6:06:49] Ruan_A: @Giantwaffle I just made one, I'm having some issues with the data pack loading in a few chunks later, with adding the datapack in with starting up the server I'm not getting the data pack working at all
[6:06:51] n8level: its perfect (with the datapack) for some UHC fun
[6:06:52] Giantwaffle: https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/minecraft_gamepedia/images/0/0f/21w18a_approximate_ore_distribution.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20210505174329

[6:07:10] Boprino: !datapack
[6:07:10] Moobot: Waffle is using this 1.17 datapack for the caves and cliffs | https://bit.ly/3g3heux
[6:07:19] detectiveextralarge: do you like power wash more than Viscera Cleanup Detail?
[6:07:38] Apparentthreat: @Giantwaffle if I have to watch you slowly wash away gunk line by line I'm going to ppOverheat LUL
[6:07:48] ShionSinX: are there no upgrades left for you to get?
[6:08:40] Gberqz: @Ruan_A Had the same issue, I created the world folder by hand, then create a "datapacks" folder in that folder. Put the preview data pack in there. Then start it for the first time.
[6:08:51] mechoriet: soap me :)
[6:08:51] Solitude411: use it for the car

[6:10:20] McDreamyh: yes
[6:10:36] mikeyharper: Yeah
[6:10:40] Karnaxx: OSHA? that's why we're getting some 16 yo kid to do the power washing

[6:16:11] BONBONNIE13: gachiBASS
[6:16:19] DrunkOrNah: A butt white hole, if you will.
[6:16:29] ForgottenTime: the worst thing about power washing IRL is youd gets soaked in a situation like this or in general
[6:16:45] Includeiostream: It's hard phisical work, sometimes it's fun but only as a part time or a hook up job. Would not recommend it full time
[6:16:48] jdk2233: why do i like watching this
[6:16:59] BobPatience: you don't
[6:17:00] Ruan_A: seems to be working now, made a single player game with the datapack in there, let it load every up, then move that world folder over to the server pc
