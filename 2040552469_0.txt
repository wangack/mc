[1:33:44] Another_JT: that pearl on the hotbar has me worried
[1:34:13] TheRooPlace: @Another_JT I keep thinking he is going to yeet himself into the lava or stuck in a wall
[1:34:17] Bjornar97: rdtvLuck rdtvLuck
[1:35:13] Panoplyx: your rabbit foot definitely ran out
[1:35:17] NBCoffeePrince: hi ren
[1:35:56] daredevil2300: rdtvSOS still in nether?!?!
[1:36:06] Bjornar97: btw, what happens if you put a boat on a lava lake? Ive never actually tried that :D
[1:36:22] daredevil2300: should we get a rescue party started?
[1:36:26] sidriss_: That really is a big Fortress
[1:36:32] brothersquirrel: death @Bjornar97
[1:36:38] touch_of_improv: wonder if it's a double run-on fortress
[1:36:47] TheRooPlace: @Bjornar97 I think the boat just breaks and dumps you in the lava. It's been so long
[1:36:51] Bjornar97: @brothersquirrel Sounds plausible :D
[1:36:58] DeltaicZap: Nice!
[1:37:15] Roxa_Bandita: You lucky duck. The rib template took me 10 fortresses to find
[1:37:18] sidriss_: Wait, the horse is called Airbus?!
[1:37:19] okiedokiecrisco: did we find airbus last stream or is he still lost
[1:37:23] asmiles: HypeLUL
[1:37:32] kiragoesMC: Did some piglin bartering yet?
[1:37:40] Another_JT: @okiedokiecrisco airbus hasn't been lost, it's Camela that is lost
[1:37:43] pj_in_the_loops: was that rib arm or?
[1:37:44] PeanutGallery76: @okiedokiecrisco Airbus has been found.  He's in the cow pen.
[1:37:54] Another_JT: @kiragoesMC haven't seen any piglins
[1:37:59] ocorrigan07: @sidriss_ yep, he started floating at one point
[1:38:03] ocorrigan07: Don't ask
[1:38:20] sidriss_: @ocorrigan07 Amazing! :D
[1:38:46] Another_JT: I dunno, I think Crimson Forest might be more dangerous
[1:39:02] yukii_hikari: yes yes
[1:39:04] avonay: ren, the resistance
[1:39:28] kiragoesMC: Just keep swimming...
[1:39:45] pj_in_the_loops: swim
[1:39:47] sidriss_: Well that gap isn't panic inducing at all.....
[1:39:47] avonay: fingers crossed
[1:39:48] moayark81: ender pearl
[1:39:51] lastjaybird: Do you have fire res to come back tho
[1:40:04] Bjornar97: *looking through fingers*
[1:40:08] TheRooPlace: Yeah he's got two more potions
[1:40:21] Another_JT: what we don't have is blocks....
[1:40:21] beouwolfe: this feels like a bad plan...
[1:40:24] daredevil2300: hot bar not ready for this endeavor
[1:40:27] TruePat: Yes
[1:40:28] summerflower1234: please shift
[1:40:29] pj_in_the_loops: leakage
[1:40:33] Another_JT: depends on how deep that lava is
[1:40:34] TheRooPlace: I would just pearl down
[1:40:40] BlossymWyrm: I am so nervous
[1:40:41] PeanutGallery76: Those sound disturbingly close to famous last words.
[1:40:48] skellyelly28: This seems bad
[1:40:51] Roxa_Bandita: nerves of steel
[1:40:54] mcsallie: NO
[1:40:59] skellyelly28: Okay it's all good
[1:41:10] Panoplyx: did you pick up the boat?
[1:41:20] kiragoesMC: Do you have boats left for endermen?
[1:41:22] PeanutGallery76: How long until he hits a zombie piglin?
[1:41:22] theochan: Finished work, and there is a ren stream. Bliss
[1:41:26] jonosmithers: YHTSI
[1:41:27] avonay: and some feather falling, maybe
[1:41:28] TheLifeofL: we almost got to find out what happened if you put a boat on lava @Bjornar97
[1:41:28] beouwolfe: @Panoplyx he did not
[1:41:29] Another_JT: Can you check if that's Nether Wastes biome?
[1:41:35] avonay: slow fall, my bad

[1:43:08] jonosmithers: hey Cyberdogs o7
[1:43:16] Another_JT: Well, distracting one is a thing
[1:43:23] kill_dolores: Ayy
[1:43:41] TheLifeofL: @sidriss_ He doesn't always go to it, he sometimes just locks it in and looks himself
[1:43:53] touch_of_improv: easy way to get crying obsidian tho if you don't have that one yet
[1:43:53] Another_JT: The Piglin Bartering one is "Oh Shiny" where you have to distract an angry piglin with gold
[1:43:58] jonosmithers: this isn’t precarious at all
[1:44:13] avonay: my timbers are shivered
[1:44:30] blondebeauty_96: this is nothing…he’s already popped a totem
[1:44:30] sidriss_: @TheLifeofL Ah right, I didn't know if it was my interwebs!

[1:47:38] LumiKat117: Heya Ren!
[1:47:50] CocoShock: :D
[1:47:57] sidriss_: You might be under a lava lake
[1:48:09] Knight_Avalon_: o7 slackl1Bheart jenfirRose x33nHug
[1:48:12] Another_JT: not a fan of the bed method, personally, but that's just me
[1:48:23] avonay: my timbers are heavily shivered
[1:48:28] LumiKat117: Yeaaah that was weird
[1:48:42] greystone83: You should really get back and make that bridge home before your potion runs out. Time is ticking.
[1:48:45] TheRooPlace: @Another_JT I always do more damage to myself than to the surrounding blocks
[1:48:50] dogracerSheri: scittering? my new favorite woed
[1:48:55] dogracerSheri: word
[1:49:01] viktoroslav_: Byeeeee I need to go to sleep so I can function tomoroow
[1:49:07] LumiKat117: I just joined in on the stream, is this a modded world or just a normal Hardcore?
[1:49:12] sidriss_: The sound keys in the Nether are always so creepy
[1:49:20] viktoroslav_: Hardcore
[1:49:23] Bjornar97: @LumiKat117 Normal hardcore
[1:49:33] Another_JT: much more boring that plummeting to your death
[1:49:34] okiedokiecrisco: ren i could listen to you narrate paint dry lol
[1:49:49] LumiKat117: Thanks Bjornar
[1:49:54] Another_JT: and then you got the skull, what luck!
[1:50:19] LumiKat117: Hey at least there aren't any Ghasts
[1:50:22] Another_JT: I won't suggest the striders this time
[1:50:29] paradiddleponderer5: no noise… that’s ominous
[1:50:44] greystone83: Tick tick tick
[1:50:58] blondebeauty_96: wish potions could stack
[1:51:03] cherrifire: good morrow my good people
[1:51:09] distilledbiscuits: how far are you away from your portal?
[1:51:35] touch_of_improv: @cherrifire hello o/
[1:51:55] highlordspaghetti: may wanna kill a zombie pigmen in overworld so you dont anger THE HORDE
[1:52:05] mcsallie: you have a huge lava lake to cross
[1:52:12] Trubbas: wait, there's a potion belt?
[1:52:18] Palayam_: your pick is melting BibleThump
[1:52:25] Another_JT: @Trubbas Only in Ren's dreams
[1:52:44] Another_JT: You just need the two forests, yes
[1:52:48] LumiKat117: This is a huge Nether Wastes biome
[1:52:50] LaurelBay: A little part of me likes the potions not stacking, cause it gives me sort of a timer for what I'm doing. Like, since you can make 3 at a time, it's a max 24 minutes of whatever you're making. So if I'm digging around in an Ancient City, I have a 24 minute timer which is usually about when I'm getting bored of the task.
[1:53:04] TobyLovesCatss: Hiya! I have one hour until deployment from the Polish Military and I just want to see love your content and love you.
[1:53:15] drforgthefourth: hello
[1:53:23] MusicFreeGaming: It seems a little hot & spicy out there.
[1:53:26] kiragoesMC: Is this series all about advancements?
[1:53:29] Another_JT: this is a one way tunnel
[1:53:37] LumiKat117: At least it's a straight shot
[1:53:39] Another_JT: @kiragoesMC yes, it is advancement hunting in hardcore
[1:53:43] daredevil2300: @tobylovescandy stay safe fellow cyberdog
[1:53:44] TinMyren404: TinMyren404 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 4 months! 
[1:53:45] Trubbas: @Another_JT would be nice though since Potions takes up so much space... like 1 potion for 64 m3 of rocks
[1:53:53] Another_JT: !adv
[1:54:02] mcsallie: mark the entrance on your way back
[1:54:10] Riff_Raff_: oh no
