[0:39:31] cmmeth: takes time to do the sinny crackle fusion YEP
[0:39:49] mechoriet: YEP a shitload
[0:40:01] Tapeman83: The chaotic injectors are faster at charging, but the fusion takes the same time
[0:40:01] DigitalVortex92: I swear in one of these mod packs they had a multi block fusion crafter. maybe I'm wrong though
[0:40:07] Tapeman83: So yes, you need a lot
[0:40:10] Morlega: I don't think they differ in speed
[0:40:18] Tapeman83: Much faster for charging
[0:40:30] Morlega: Charging is nearly instant if you can provide enough power iirc, regarding of tier
[0:40:34] ketzall: @Giantwaffle injectors restrict energy transfer, so top tier is best for speed on high energy infusions
[0:41:01] Tapeman83: Pog
[0:41:04] iQuantumFlux: you should put T1 on there, too
[0:41:23] Gh3ttoboy: there is kill a chaos guardian in the end
[0:41:27] Duke1454: 310 heart of the universe?
[0:41:28] Koeckie: so we should start with the T8 right now

[0:41:51] mechoriet: YEP a frick load
[0:41:54] Gh3ttoboy: @dizz1227 the enderdragon and chaos guardian do spaw
[0:42:07] LsTheRoberto: make a few extra to be sure

[0:42:51] Tapeman83: No, they’re significantly slower @swingeing_folk
[0:43:02] greggarry: don't you need 10 injectors for some recipes
[0:43:15] mechoriet: KEKW eye of ender
[0:43:17] BMYGRLFRND: those miners are the ones that were stuck

[0:44:29] mechoriet: pepeLaugh we perhaps made a few eye's of ender
[0:44:44] Swocoom: check your eye of ender quantity
[0:44:47] Tapeman83: Huh, that’s a cool addition, much like all the other multiblocks. When I beat Omni, none of those existed, and I just used like hundreds of individual machines. It’s much nicer now
[0:44:54] mechoriet: pepeLaugh check eye of ender quanity
[0:44:58] iQuantumFlux: eye of ender machine is eating all ender pearls

[1:06:11] mrleonehart: Is there a mass solidifier? Like a big machine @Giantwaffle
[1:06:16] Immp: Multiple Solidifiers as you have infinite fluid?
[1:06:21] kitofmaadnes: pati just put hydrogen in a big machine
[1:06:22] Morlega: Just multiblock into a compact drawer?
[1:06:35] DigitalVortex92: also, connecting drawers should take away the need for the crafters
[1:06:41] stickman_02: Good morning what are we working on today?
[1:06:57] Dioxinn: ya, compacting drawers for sure.
[1:07:12] Danishwiz: @PureSpider I got 310 x 4 x 64 x 60.75, pretty sure that's the same math waffle got

[1:08:04] Gh3ttoboy: chat is helpfull sometimes 😜
[1:08:13] Tweeton: can't hurt to have one solidifier there and a second elsewhere haha
[1:08:25] Danishwiz: @PureSpider Well that would be the total time it would take to make the hydrogen for the 310 hearts
[1:08:25] Swocoom: its pull only
[1:08:33] Minelmonia: Its extract only
[1:08:34] daedmissica0: is  only out
[1:08:37] Rtonne: but isn't the wall export only?
[1:08:42] Bagz_69: Put on Liquid side @Giantwaffle
[1:08:48] PureSpider: just store by hand and be done with it

[1:11:12] Bagz_69: 256x it @Giantwaffle !!!

[1:14:27] fbritoferreira: 16a uhv and bigger inputs and parallel
[1:14:29] GangstaQuad49: use draconian power maybe or am my wrong?

[2:37:16] Bulltank: You can have just 1 export bus on the controller too
[2:37:24] DX_Plates: Sounds like you product team need to get cleaned out and replaced with a team who knows how to estimate engineer hours.
[2:37:34] Bulltank: or multiple export buses for the amount of items you need
[2:37:37] WalrusPug: @DX_Plates but ye also i handed in my notice, so frick them peepoHappy
[2:37:50] ketzall: If you only need a stack, put a storage bus (export only) on an interface

[2:38:48] thecodealive_original: will it not pull from the drawers and input into the drawers?
[2:38:48] Bulltank: Since youre putting 1 export bus per drawer and exporting only, you dont have to lock the drawers
[2:38:56] Minelmonia: The assembly line will be busy 24/7
[2:39:06] Silver_Skeeter: why not just keep a stack of those at all times?
[2:39:12] TheResinger: TheResinger subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months! ratJAM
[2:39:19] DX_Plates: Nice.  Yea I willing make less, because I know my company is amazing. No crunch, no OT, highly believe in life work balance, and thats from the execs down so the other teams don't try and push us.

[2:41:14] kbigLiar: exporters need "crafting only"
[2:41:15] thecodealive_original: why are the export busses not taking items from drawers just to put them back in again?
[2:41:39] dcjrracing11: Because it’s just looping. It’s taking the one in the drawer and putting it back constantly.
[2:41:52] DecoyOcelot: make a recipe that contains all the pieces for an assembly line and output it to a chest, so you can request a whole line at a time
[2:41:55] kbigLiar: it's the button that appears after you add the crafting card

[2:48:13] fbritoferreira: Just move the pattern to another machine ?
[2:48:31] PureSpider: you told the storage bus to not take anything out
[2:48:33] PureSpider: so you can't use them now
[2:48:40] inforv: Couldn't you use an ME interface with a crafting card attached to a storage bus instead of using this drawer system?
[2:48:50] PureSpider: ah! you're right
[2:49:01] daedmissica0: copy tool them
[2:49:07] R1Rider01: copy gadget

[2:49:24] PureSpider: @inforv for a single stack, yea
[2:49:25] DrYProtoss: the one on the end is the longest you need

[2:51:51] BloodBlight: It just makes thing....  Chunky.
[2:51:52] DX_Plates: Vert?
[2:51:52] MrMoneyy2325: ItsWhatIts
[2:51:56] Nahkurii: oh god no
[2:51:56] LinearLayer: Just like how he just did but yesterday

[2:52:01] inforv: Its chunkloaded ones that mess up
[2:52:01] PureSpider: inforv well then you might as well do it with drawers :D
[2:52:03] Nahkurii: risk it breaking

[2:52:16] inforv: Yes
[2:52:18] OtonP: NO, NOT CENTERED D:
[2:53:04] drsnaki96: yeah should be ok since they don't unload the chunks. Problem exist when you chunk load only like a part of the machine
[2:53:12] inforv: If its in a chunkloaded and going to a nonchunloaded chunk is what messes it up
[2:53:42] Bulltank: Oh oh

[2:55:22] inforv: Crazy how 75% of the base gets neglected at this point in the game lol
[2:55:53] ninopanda: @Bulltank I have it set up to do a backup every hour.  I usually will run a full backup once a day where it grabs all the files and configs
[2:56:10] boogerbomb01: Because you told us it wasnt necessary
[2:56:11] GGoodGGuy: are we there yet?

[2:57:56] Billiards: Shouldn’t the end blocks all be machine hull/case not the input/output block?
[2:58:27] DecoyOcelot: its either shift click or ctrl click but you can skip the plannign step and start the craft immedietly

[3:27:05] Marguti: LUL
[3:27:08] nothenewmemeguy: Waffle talking while counting
[3:27:13] MetalBBA: do they not have MAX in this pack?
[3:27:17] SolarisFall: @arkun_ I ci LUL nah but thanks for the info
[3:27:18] drsnaki96: talking and counting never work well together Kappa
[3:27:28] snurre: so confused lol
[3:27:31] DarkKnghtt58: you've already fucked them up lol
[3:27:32] itsjusttriz: bit late for that
[3:27:36] banshay3: KEKW
[3:27:37] SailorWS: waffle having many skill issues with counting
[3:27:39] Ponzotron: KEKW
[3:27:39] FusRohDakkaDakka: so, bonkers wasnt enough
[3:27:42] Intohimos: don't worry you messed up like 3 of them already KEKW
[3:27:42] BMYGRLFRND: @Giantwaffle recheck all of the prios for the lasers, you fucked up a few times
[3:27:46] Kilowatt31: the other line had two 8s
[3:27:47] mechoriet: YEP
[3:27:51] PMM67899: 2 8s again
[3:27:52] DigitalVortex92: @Giantwaffle Your priorities are ALL sorts of fucked up on the other lasers you did LUL
[3:27:53] banshay3: LUL
[3:27:55] ipman89: @Giantwaffle can u show me the first power generator i can build easy? plz
[3:27:57] Ponzotron: other line had 2 8s
[3:28:02] Mehssi: KEKW
[3:28:06] WestsideGecko: So what do you call it now when it is more than bonkers? LUL
[3:28:39] DarkKnghtt58: @ipman89 steam dynamo with sugar cane on snad
[3:28:48] thecodealive_original: can you turn diamonds into diamond ore?
[3:28:55] SebastiaanO: ultimate bonkers
[3:29:00] Morlega: There's no liquid ore from ore washing or so?
[3:29:51] GuardMoony: Isn't it better to have the same recipe in multiple lines? that way it could craft some in parallel
[3:30:09] SebastiaanO: ^
[3:30:09] Moobot: You can sub to Waffle by clicking this neat link -> twitch.tv/giantwaffle/subscribe SUBprise
[3:30:44] LinearLayer: Is there not a limit for the number of AE channels?
[3:30:50] inforv: Nope
[3:30:54] sam1390: do you need to connect the lasers to the chest still?
[3:30:56] itsjusttriz: @LinearLayer Channels disabled in this pacl.
[3:31:09] Nexhunter: nikezSuffer push more power
[3:31:14] xDeadBringerx: Time for EIV powe
[3:31:21] LinearLayer: That is a great change for this pack, 10/10
[3:31:22] cmmeth: UIV PauseChamp
[3:32:04] deadgolfer: should be fine
[3:32:05] Moopoop: did u connect the output bus?
[3:32:48] GuardMoony: Don't think it's got a crafting card to make them
[3:33:08] GuardMoony: the drawer wall
[3:33:17] thecodealive_original: we?
[3:33:30] kbigLiar: need to make ultra bonkers voltage to halve the craft time again KEKW
[3:33:30] Marguti: lul
[3:34:20] Intohimos: It's 25 sec a craft you definitely need those acceleration cards OMEGALUL
[3:34:20] Blazedasthesun: waffleSip
[3:34:29] inforv: Did you see the iceberg that broke off the antartic ice shelf?
[3:34:30] Purecrew: pati lol
[3:34:31] daedmissica0: pati
[3:34:31] deadgolfer: Pati is
[3:34:32] Zucate: i am guess pati is
[3:34:40] oohoo3: ItsWhatIts
[3:34:49] Smithii: Can you use parallel processing in the ass line?
[3:34:50] deadgolfer: did you put the crafting card down below
[3:34:53] deadgolfer: ?
[3:35:07] bballaustin: Stretch time?
[3:35:49] boogerbomb01: Waffle idea is the correct one
[3:36:04] deadgolfer: the first one isn't running
[3:36:31] lvyEartman: but if you have machines parrallel crafting they will have more up time
[3:36:41] Intohimos: you should really stop with those stack upgrades it's hindering your progression
[3:36:50] TheMeowstardCat: RIP?
[3:37:34] PMM67899: @Intohimos think so aswell hes always missing items because he set it to small
[3:37:49] Beergrillz: stack restriction slows you down
[3:38:14] Wazepas: Jebaited
[3:38:14] Moobot: You can find Waffle's Youtube channel here - https://youtube.com/giantwaffle
[3:38:14] Intohimos: @PMM67899 it's fine pati will remove it
[3:38:18] kbigLiar: I don't think Pati realizes this is ME crafts to the drawer? vs the other passive craft lines you made a week or 2 ago
[3:38:31] Intohimos: At this stage it's pointless to do stack downgrades
[3:38:40] Wetware: Yeah  I'm a little slow sometimes
[3:38:48] Beergrillz: we need 10 k to finish the pack limits items to 64
[3:38:58] teddiii_: chat also said the wetware needed the chicken farm
[3:39:11] drsnaki96: @Wetware ItIsWhatItIs
[3:39:37] Intohimos: Its waffle's secret plan if you keep the downgrades you can play this modpack longer LUL
[3:39:48] DX_Plates: @Intohimos Pete and Repeat were on a boat, Pete fell out, who was left?
[3:40:02] deadgolfer: i don't think the first assembler doing those up top was running, might be something wrong
[3:40:33] msfWEBdude: you have 18 cpu's holy hell
[3:40:34] thecodealive_original: put the wetware pattern back to the ass line
[3:41:09] WARHERO322: Is it making it in the clearn room
[3:41:13] msfWEBdude: I thought I was fancy by having a few cpu's, damn I need to up my game
[3:41:26] itsjusttriz: any chance you didnt fix the other laser lines priorities that you messed up?
[3:41:50] kbigLiar: blocking mode missing so it jam?
[3:41:58] Sharlaw: is it waiting for the one you manually removed to put in the drawer?
[3:42:09] Lufcthorpy: Check priority
[3:42:31] Morlega: Item Interface is dumb, why would it know that?
[3:42:40] Purecrew: You canceled patis 128 craft lol
[3:43:08] Thegrinch6: in my opinion - why set one to be only a particular item, instead of letting the system distribute by itself? Not sure I understand the advantage of a dedicated assembler.
[3:43:15] ineedsleeps: Have you made enough buckets?
[3:43:29] Purecrew: wetware mainframes
[3:44:00] Purecrew: 256 parrallel things
[3:44:14] mrleonehart: Restart the craft
[3:44:15] brsmith2358: Something else is using the machine
[3:44:16] mrleonehart: Its stuck
[3:44:18] GuardMoony: old system ?
[3:44:18] deadgolfer: machine busy making something else?
[3:44:22] bobolpwnz: machine is busy?
[3:44:23] PMM67899: patis fault he disconnected most stuffs :D
[3:44:25] LinkHub_Pro: you changed recipe
[3:44:45] Purecrew: Check the other  hatches they might be crafting something else on that machine
[3:44:49] kbigLiar: are other things taking higher priority in that machine?
[3:44:49] mrleonehart: Go check the machine
[3:44:51] L0cius_: what packmode does he play?
[3:44:53] WARHERO322: The assemble might have something in it
[3:44:57] grid_space: is something else useing the machine?
[3:45:03] deadgolfer: maybe just busy?

[4:04:18] mrleonehart: Does it require Clean room?
[4:04:24] PureSpider: if it has multiple copies of the same recipe, it picks one at random

[4:07:40] Morlega: @Giantwaffle you mentioned needing a laser on the Item Interface, did you forget that at the assembly lines?
[4:07:49] kbigLiar: one of them had 2 pearls
[4:07:57] Lost_Leviathan: ^
[4:08:06] Thegrinch6: whoa the outside world
[4:08:33] winulff: sensitive ass fusion crafting
[4:08:38] MisterRabbitHead: why do I wanna blame Ci KEKW
[4:09:08] boogerbomb01: Does one creative tank proivide all their fluids?
[4:09:20] Code4Coffee: Ass .. line? HUH
[4:09:30] DaFez_: Co processors?
[4:09:34] winulff: @boogerbomb01 yeah. and they fluid solidify it to blocks/ingots
[4:09:38] stickman_02: @boogerbomb01 nah they have hundreds of them
[4:09:39] Morlega: Missing laser on Item Interface?
[4:09:41] Zucate: boogerbomb01 once they can create 1 tank they can create an infinite amount of tanks
[4:09:42] Qbertman: nbt? power?
[4:09:49] mrleonehart: Check the Lasers....I think you messed them up
[4:09:53] Purecrew: Trying crafting 1 then another and another
[4:09:56] boogerbomb01: ty
[4:09:59] Purecrew: see if it spreads out the crafting
[4:10:08] Bagz_69: Double it, For the rest of the pack!
[4:10:12] GuardMoony: try 4 separate crafts? too see if it works then?
[4:10:22] winulff: ItIsWhatItIs
[4:10:34] Larklen: ItIsWhatItIs
[4:10:37] AleXanDreMau: ItIsWhatItIs
[4:11:05] CyberrPickle: ItIsWhatItIs
[4:11:12] GuardMoony: don't convert just add them?
[4:11:13] Bagz_69: False, we need 1 super uber crazy 1
[4:11:16] deadgolfer: make sure you got the right liquids for those too
[4:11:18] Morlega: why not just keep both patterns in? monkaHmm
[4:11:44] Mister_Nova: Do you need a pattern card in the export interface similar to the empowerer?
[4:11:44] Moobot: Come join the Waffle House Discord! <# https://discord.gg/fhGFtMuzdS
[4:11:50] dylan0806: Fluid
[4:11:52] R1Rider01: fluid
[4:11:52] Purecrew: No fluid in those machines for it?
[4:11:54] tomey36: Remove the recipe from the old ass machine
[4:12:02] GuardMoony: other liquids?
[4:12:14] Morlega: Did you forget to connect a laser?
[4:12:29] RogueLightning_: Pretty sure you messed up priority numbers
[4:12:31] stickman_02: its using the old ass line
[4:12:31] Sanduckchan: so it made those.. but not on these assembly lines
[4:12:34] mrleonehart: The laser  setup is wrong
[4:12:41] bismarcksd: have you tried turning it off and on again?
[4:12:44] mrleonehart: Check the number
[4:12:50] Rollingx: is every machine connected to one another?
[4:12:54] Dioxinn: Lasers wrong 100%, they aren't connected right.
[4:12:54] Purecrew: Time to setup 1 assembly machine for each item and make it passive lol
[4:13:03] Mister_Nova: @Giantwaffle What cards are in the terminal on the old line vs the new line?
[4:13:07] coolsnowdog1: it's like only one thing can be made
[4:13:10] Vikingsarethebest: crafting card
[4:13:45] PureSpider: seqChat
[4:13:55] Zucate: I wonder if the crafting card from the chest can only request 1
[4:14:09] piebobs71: piebobs71 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 7 months! 
[4:14:12] GuardMoony: the new EBF :D
[4:14:32] Dioxinn: "can they share walls?"
[4:14:43] PureSpider: @Dioxinn literally
[4:14:48] PureSpider: all these knowers in chat
[4:14:52] IAmJester: Do they have large talons?
[4:14:57] deadgolfer: that one hasn't worked since the start
[4:15:11] bubblebrainer: wetware is probably in another interface aswell
[4:15:15] Purecrew: Something is broken on the first machine
[4:15:16] mrleonehart: You messed up the laser on that first one
[4:15:19] stickman_02: check to see if you messed up the lasers
[4:15:19] zzzDai: Take both patterns out then put them back in
[4:15:20] tomey36: Probably because it’s waiting on components
[4:15:20] Morlega: check the laser
[4:15:29] iLu_786: Hey pc wizards is my pc decent for a first time - I7 3770 processor, 16GB ram, NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 TI, 128GB SSD, 1000GB HDD, 700w power supply.
[4:15:29] mrleonehart: Compass
[4:15:36] Morlega: No laser on the Item Interface
[4:15:55] mrleonehart: Liquid on first???
[4:16:07] TheIrishGuy: disable the working one and see if it goes to the non working one
[4:16:15] WestsideGecko: Nbt issue waffleLUL
[4:16:20] mrleonehart: ^^^
[4:16:24] GuardMoony: Didn't we test that last one? before we did the others :s
[4:16:24] Purecrew: Yea disable working one to check if it goes to the other one
[4:17:50] boogerbomb01: Are there any items stuck in the inputs of the broken one?
[4:17:56] PureSpider: if you wanna craft more than one, can't you request a stack or whatever from an interface with a crafting card, then export that to a drawer?
[4:17:57] Morlega: It's crafting 4 at a time which seems fine
[4:17:58] mrleonehart: Soft hammer time
[4:18:12] Thegrinch6: break fluix
[4:18:14] StingrayNine: drawer controller has a crafting card?
[4:18:16] MrSilverMatch: Can you say in the crafting export bus how many to craft ?
[4:18:17] TheIrishGuy: steal my idea and get noticed @Purecrew
[4:18:25] Intohimos: this is a start of a great system
[4:18:29] Purecrew: I was reaffirming your idea
[4:18:32] ns0z: You probably have 10-15 crafts in input chest
[4:18:41] Feist_: NBT Kappa
[4:18:42] Tabakhase: twitch twitching devCheck
[4:18:48] Morlega: Chat is just guessing random stuff at this point Pepega
[4:18:58] PureSpider: @Morlega "at this point"
[4:19:10] Sanduckchan: disable this line try the other
[4:19:11] Thegrinch6: unlimited items glitch?
[4:19:14] CoolAcid: A watched chest never empties.
[4:19:17] Larklen: PauseChamp
[4:19:19] GuardMoony: wasn't it on blocking?
[4:19:23] Morlega: @Morlega Well, at this point they're guessing things that aren't even possible LUL
[4:19:35] boogerbomb01: Are the inputs on the one not working stuffed with something?
[4:19:38] Larklen: break the block :) pepeLaugh
[4:19:41] tomey36: Just break the drawer interfaces
[4:19:51] mrleonehart: Wrench it
[4:19:51] Moobot: You can sub to Waffle by clicking this neat link -> twitch.tv/giantwaffle/subscribe SUBprise
[4:20:00] Makaheehee: Its probably Ci. Its always Ci. Kappa
[4:20:02] TheIrishGuy: is it PATI
[4:20:04] mrleonehart: Pati?
[4:20:13] tomey36: The drawers?
[4:20:14] Bagz_69: energy hatch or somthing
[4:20:16] Morlega: Item Interface's inventory is a representation of the inventories of the blocks connected with lasers, the II itself has no real inventory
[4:20:23] Makaheehee: KEKW
[4:20:24] Thegrinch6: LOL
[4:20:25] Marguti: KEKW
[4:20:28] IronGajeel: Pepega s
[4:20:30] Metti83: Clap
[4:20:30] BlackKnight17: KEKW
[4:20:31] coolsnowdog1: hHahah
[4:20:31] quickclassy: KEKW
[4:20:31] Morlega: KEKW
[4:20:34] Larklen: KEKW
[4:20:36] Venamah: KEKW communication is key
[4:20:40] Lost_Leviathan: KEKW
[4:20:48] banana_assasin: The item interfaces inventory is a copy of all the inventories connected by lasers
[4:21:11] tomey36: It’s still doing it
[4:21:13] TheIrishGuy: check clean room for crafting cards
[4:21:18] skignas: storage box?
[4:21:19] Sanduckchan: cant u check which machine is usiung the wetware processor stuff
[4:21:21] Larklen: can you search for the machine thats requesting?
[4:21:22] ih_shevtsov: just disconnect your system below
[4:21:25] plattnotpratt: Power?
[4:21:26] Morlega: Some interface probably
[4:21:27] BlackKnight17: This pack has been a perfect example of how when it comes to collaborative working, 1+1 usually equals like 0.8. KEKW
[4:21:34] deadgolfer: just soft hammer it?
[4:21:34] tomey36: Nbt issue
[4:21:48] Morlega: Both of your interface terminals
[4:21:50] mrleonehart: Check the drawer wall
[4:22:07] GuardMoony: those are the crafters
[4:22:14] Morlega: You were searching the Output field
[4:22:17] Morlega: skill issue
[4:22:22] Sanduckchan: break the line see if it swaps to the other maybe?
[4:22:24] Fufcia: letMeCi
[4:22:35] Thegrinch6: LOL
[4:22:48] Purecrew: the crafting behavior change you made
[4:22:57] chochi314: Isn't card in the UVH things in drawer?
[4:22:59] Purecrew: maybe it doesnt need a card?
[4:23:00] SailorWS: is it the craft option you changed to make it not loop
[4:23:04] Rocknsugar: Ci does all this trolling, good thing he doesn't just autocraft garbage xd
[4:23:05] Moopoop: turn off import export on the storage bus?
[4:23:33] SailorWS: its 100% the crafting preferences
[4:23:42] zzzDai: Does one crafting card work on the entire thing?
[4:23:43] WARHERO322: Break the bus and and replace
[4:23:44] Wetware: Deus ex machina
[4:23:53] itsjusttriz: Does the bus treat all the drawers as one?
[4:23:58] TheShaddo13: didnt you put it in crafting mode? maybe it remembers, that it was in crafting mode
[4:24:01] SailorWS: it might save that preference
[4:24:05] deadgolfer: maybe it is glitched and stays
[4:24:05] SailorWS: even without the card
[4:24:07] WARHERO322: The bus might be bugged and saved the preference
[4:24:14] Morlega: It would be a bug if it kept doing that without the card
[4:24:18] deadgolfer: because the blocks are still crafting too
[4:24:18] ih_shevtsov: just do export with crafting card
[4:24:28] Redvlurpee: the drawer system might only need one crafting card
[4:24:55] Morlega: nope drawers have nothing to do with crafting cards
[4:24:55] Moobot: New here? Welcome! You can usually catch Waffle Mon-Sat at ~1400 UTC. Feel free to hang out in chat before the stream and/or join the !discord. waffleEgg | Use !thisweek for any changes.
[4:24:58] PureSpider: maybe try exporting from an interface
[4:25:18] PureSpider: yea i would try that
[4:25:23] R1Rider01: cant setup just like your DML setup?
[4:25:24] PureSpider: just do one
[4:25:25] StingrayNine: i remember in my old DDSS save, i used export buses directly on the controller/slave and let it handle it on its own
[4:25:26] ih_shevtsov: no, you could request two items
[4:25:31] ih_shevtsov: it will be good
[4:25:35] AdamMcAdamson: test the assembly line
[4:25:35] Morlega: Just pipe it into the Drawer Controller
[4:25:53] PureSpider: if you do 1, it will still only queue 1 at a time, why not make 64 or something
[4:25:59] Sobbex: but isnt its going to pull that one from drawer so its like endless circle
[4:26:00] Moopoop: yeah its looping
[4:26:01] Morlega: Does the interface even support "always craft" ?
[4:26:08] Morlega: This will loop yeah
[4:26:08] Nerudeus: sont this take it ouf the drwaer ;)
[4:26:10] ns0z: Use interface to push into assembler with precise amount. Have a emitter to limit amount stored in AE system
[4:26:15] biggerginger: level emitter ?
[4:26:20] R1Rider01: cant setup just like your DML setup?
[4:26:43] Morlega: Does it still auto-craft the Mainframes if you break the bugged export bus?
[4:27:04] GuardMoony: that would limit the machine to only to make a few items
[4:27:07] Sup4545: can you just increase crafting quantity so that you do not have to worry about buffers
[4:27:13] PureSpider: it's not gonna craft if it has enough
[4:27:15] MrSilverMatch: I think the setup you had before was good, but you should have put a quantity in the export bus to craft X at a time
[4:27:26] sidedims: Cant you set the interface to craft only or is that only for export bus? @Giantwaffle
[4:27:29] deadgolfer: first machine is still broken, chat was saying something with NBT data maybe
[4:27:30] SeanTKE: why do you need the drawers? cant you just store in the interface and put a storage bus against it?
[4:27:41] ns0z: You will need a buffer no matter what tbh
[4:27:45] StingrayNine: i still think you should only have one export but onto the controller and let it handle it
[4:28:00] PureSpider: was it glitchy though?
[4:28:00] Moobot: You can find Waffle's Youtube channel here - https://youtube.com/giantwaffle
[4:28:10] PureSpider: interface with storage bus is a common "keep in stock" solution
[4:28:13] StingrayNine: i did in my old DDSS world. should be fine
[4:28:15] Morlega: That's how you make subnetworks. A network subnetworking itself isn't great pepeLaugh
[4:28:18] iQuantumFlux: Time to get the Tier 1 drones spitting out
[4:28:38] Morlega: Nope
[4:28:38] StingrayNine: the items, yea
[4:28:38] PureSpider: no, empty export bus exports nothing
[4:28:58] PureSpider: yes
[4:29:21] PureSpider: interface with storage bus NODDERS
[4:29:22] Morlega: Nothing stops you from having multiple export busses though (well, kinda)
[4:29:24] PureSpider: commit
[4:29:27] deadgolfer: something is wrong with the first one i think
[4:29:28] nathy_rl: its always the middle one too
[4:29:30] meller127: capacity card
[4:29:37] tony_rex666: prios?
[4:29:42] MrSilverMatch: NBT ?
[4:29:45] SomethingLikeTheVoid: Why not share the chest between the two?
[4:29:48] Generic_Gamer: Is round Robin a thing with assembler?
[4:29:55] Moopoop: lol so weird
[4:29:56] rektumtv: where soaryn when you need him
[4:30:01] deadgolfer: weird for sure
[4:30:13] R1Rider01: no way to set round robin on those?
[4:30:13] GuardMoony: it's the shortest path so it's logical it would use the 1st one on the first craft. But a 2nd craft should take the other one :S
[4:30:14] Redvlurpee: just do one and auto craft
[4:30:22] Morlega: You got co-processors right?
[4:30:23] Danny____Lyecer: Must be NBT Kappa
[4:30:28] Redvlurpee: just keep it constantly crafting
[4:30:29] fbritoferreira: Check both interfaces in blocking mode
[4:30:29] Kayserzero: co processors?
[4:30:39] tomey36: It probably doesn’t have enough material to fill both
[4:30:41] deadgolfer: two export buses down below?
[4:30:41] meller127: do you ca co-processors on the cpus?
[4:30:43] ns0z: Try to set the second one to -1 prio
[4:30:44] Maximus439: are the prio's the same?
[4:31:00] Moopoop: when you make the recipies you can "stack" recipies that are the same. Maybe for some weird reason the two recipies are diffrent and you just need to remake them?
[4:31:05] kitofmaadnes: maybe the fits recipie wasnt identical becouse it was from before update
[4:31:10] Purecrew: You will need to have something requesting more than 1 or it will only ever use 1
[4:31:12] kitofmaadnes: first
[4:31:12] Maximus439: ItIsWhatItIs just let pati fix it
[4:31:16] Sanduckchan: update server maybe its fixt :D
[4:31:18] W84M3: maybe it just works but only if you request large amounts... 16 loooked like it worked
[4:31:19] deadgolfer: put the other items in the interface below
[4:31:24] Morlega: I imagine the patterns aren't 100% exactly the same and AE2 decides to only use one of them
[4:31:34] Apparentthreat: it's been 2 hours since you got up last
[4:31:35] Morlega: only thing left tbh

[4:32:58] Moopoop: this seems like a bug with the recpies b/c pati I think ran into the same issue with trying to have things craft at multiple places at the same time
[4:33:00] Makaheehee: "They" Oh?
[4:33:19] Apparentthreat: !vacay
[4:33:21] Moobot:  Waffle will be going on vacation at the beginning of February. He probably has "lounging with the bois" on the agenda.

[4:34:46] Fufcia: Can we make a complain to HR? pepeSmoke
[4:34:53] Sandiro1: pepeSmoke
[4:35:03] Makaheehee: There is no HR here. Kappa
[4:35:04] Warkless: @Apparentthreat Corpa i guess i will have to reevaluate your position
[4:35:13] Purecrew: If you use an ME interface with a crafting card can you do that setting that makes you craft to export like on the export bus instead of pulling from storage?
[4:35:21] Morlega: @Giantwaffle you *could* use a single interface for all 4 lines (like with Molecular Assemblers) by surrounding the interface with Item Interfaces (with different "laser networks")
[4:35:39] Twin5un: @Giantwaffle when you brain fully rots in 2 hours, you should work on the base decoration :)

[5:08:07] ricdesc26: @Bronain if you use ffz, you can add 7tv as an addon
[5:08:12] Morlega: Jsut add an icon in front
[5:08:12] MissingCriticalKnowledge: if you're looking to stay with vanilla JS look into data attributes
[5:08:13] daedmissica0: https://github.com/dowjones/react-dropdown-tree-select#screenshot
[5:08:20] Larklen: You can also change the icon thats beside the text
[5:08:20] daedmissica0: any good
[5:08:22] Apparentthreat: you could literally add the |- character to the text too pepeLaugh
[5:08:24] TigerLuv: so close to the end of this pack
[5:08:25] 0x4273: I think indenting moons is fine
[5:08:35] conservegravity: the data structure should be independent of the view anyway
[5:08:42] unnoticedx: what did i join into
[5:08:47] unnoticedx: unnoticedx subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 27 months! 
[5:08:49] deadgolfer: carrots are good, definitely the carrots
[5:08:49] LokiRulez: ill have to dig through some of my code, but i can dm you some cool stuff ive done in the past
[5:08:50] Moobot: You can sub to Waffle by clicking this neat link -> twitch.tv/giantwaffle/subscribe SUBprise
[5:08:52] JJenson: monkaCozy mobile
[5:08:56] Thermaight: dropdowns are always a nightmare
[5:08:58] Morlega: @Giantwaffle first of all, what framework/library are you using? React? jQuery? Angular? ...
[5:08:59] BilusTheTiny: What are the limitation are you trying to use a framework? do you have a plan for a component library?
[5:09:06] Hugzie89: using a <select> will guarantee responsive. Using a positioned <div> will F you on mobile
[5:09:06] JJenson: @Giantwaffle do a filtered dropdown then
[5:09:07] Lightning00Blade: Search for something like folder sturucture and it may have search it self
[5:09:08] Makaheehee: Id be cautious with things you have to click on. I fucking HATE small icons that you need to click on precisely.
[5:09:09] StefanGab95: mobile is quite powerful
[5:09:10] daedmissica0: gpt chat it waffle
[5:09:10] Jaydepps00: yeah it must be expandable
[5:09:12] BlazeAndDaze: just add a search on top of the dropdown?
[5:09:14] deadgolfer: make the dropdown also searchable?
[5:09:14] Krysvac: Add a max length and a filter box
[5:09:15] Thermaight: as a phone user, I usually hate dropdowns
[5:09:18] Slowkill333: allow it to be an input box with a filtered list?
[5:09:20] Brianmose12: search box FeelsOkayMan
[5:09:25] wondox: react with tailwind??
[5:09:27] Thermaight: filter box, please
[5:09:27] Allmostdone: why would you say it a nightmare for drop downs
[5:09:28] shifty_keyz: Limit the height and have it scrollable
[5:09:34] CoolReal: Dropdown with search is fine
[5:09:34] even__odds: collapsible sections on touch
[5:09:35] Morlega: @Giantwaffle which framework/library? React? jQuery? Angular? ...
[5:09:35] deadgolfer: filter the dropdown
[5:09:37] Killelitemaste: You can do dropdown with search
[5:09:38] daedmissica0: gpt chat ask it lol
[5:09:39] 0x4273: react native
[5:09:41] wondox: daisyui is good and uses tailwind
[5:09:41] unnoticedx: scrolling isnt bad for mobile i enjoy it more than that. or drop down with filter
[5:09:44] DatoPotatoDato: having a search bar
[5:09:44] StefanGab95: tailwind is garbage KEKW
[5:09:44] Brianmose12: NOP
[5:09:45] FishhNado: never played KSP but do u know the names of the planet? if not a search bar might fit
[5:09:46] WhoAmIErik: scrolling sucks
[5:09:47] King_Ponto: Search box probably
[5:09:48] Krysvac: Add a search box as well
[5:09:49] xaytana: you could do a nested dropdown instead of two
[5:09:49] ricdesc26: i use ionic, but i cannot recommed LUL
[5:09:50] geeeegeeeeeeee: ye just ask GPT
[5:09:54] TigerLuv: search to sections
[5:09:56] BlazeAndDaze: and why putting all these items in the dropdown in the first place? Perhaps a table?
[5:09:56] WhoAmIErik: I like filter boxes
[5:09:59] kyf3r: open a scrollable list on  the bottom maybe
[5:10:01] WhoAmIErik: with a search
[5:10:02] daedmissica0: https://ant.design/components/tree-select
[5:10:04] Morlega: Mobile browsers might full-screen the dropdown anyway
[5:10:04] Larklen: how often is it going to be pulled up on mobile while playing ksp
[5:10:05] Mystichal: fa fa-moon
[5:10:06] IlsaGold: Make it in popup windows?
[5:10:10] Mr_Jarv1s: Use native selector (selector wheel)
[5:10:11] Simon04090: Make it searchable
[5:10:15] Allmostdone: Yea scrolling on mobile seems a little off
[5:10:16] Bronain: ItIsWhatItIs
[5:10:20] Thermaight: as a user: let me type, I have more than 1 finger
[5:10:24] Bahhman: This is great. I don't know shit about programming. And ain't learning shit. Still love the stream.
[5:10:29] 0omkins: ItIsWhatItIs  ItIsWhatItIs
[5:10:38] listikuss: you drop into like filters and option, so you see non at he first time and more, the more filters you set!? IDK @Giantwaffle
[5:10:42] deadgolfer: searchable can limit your list, would be the best for sure
[5:10:42] BilusTheTiny: tailwind won't fix your issue, you should try to find a component library that have this kind of feature mui.com for react Have something like this
[5:10:47] WhoAmIErik: @Giantwaffle gonna finish in 5 days with this level of sidetracking?
[5:10:48] DX_Plates: Mobile Web or Mobile App? Mobile Web I would just handle with CSS for mobile viewports.
[5:10:55] TimmyVRC: yeah isnt KSP2 gonna have entirely new systems
[5:10:57] hades_cross: not issue
[5:11:09] DX_Plates: @TimmyVRC Eventually...
[5:11:11] Larklen: System -> Planets -> Moons
[5:11:12] ElfmanB: mc_pakc!
[5:11:13] Morlega: @Giantwaffle Instead of a dropdown, make it a button that pops up an interactible map SeemsGood
[5:11:14] lvyEartman: a drop down menu on phone i not bad, but it has to fit the screen. Scrollable is bad
[5:11:14] FuzzyOmega: Just wait till you get into a11y and have to make everything accessible by screen readers and keyboard navigable
[5:11:17] Minelmonia: well my link got timed out :S
[5:11:21] TimmyVRC: @TimmyVRC I see
[5:11:23] YaBoiDreamy: !Haedphones
[5:11:26] Invalidm_: my god
[5:11:27] xaviermanifest: what about one drop down menu for main bodies and another one which appears if they have other bodies
[5:11:30] YaBoiDreamy: !headphones
[5:11:31] Thermaight: before you design the ui, spend some time looking at lots of components/design languages, it gives you an idea of how to solve the problems you are going to run into
[5:11:38] mrkaszkeit: Well then you get up-down scroll for planets and left-right when you clik on the planet?
[5:11:41] 0x4273: hardcode all the planets EZ
[5:11:43] ElfmanB: mc_pack!
[5:11:44] daedmissica0: System -> Planets -> Moons
[5:11:44] Jaydepps00: @YaBoiDreamy ath m50x
[5:11:54] DonnieQuest: this is so cool
[5:11:55] YaBoiDreamy: @Jaydepps00 thank you <3
[5:11:55] xSascha1337: ppOverheat
[5:12:01] SailorWS: toggle switch for modded/not
[5:12:03] 0x4273: @daedmissica0 thats the way to do it
[5:12:05] Allmostdone: importing form?
[5:12:10] DX_Plates: Mobile Web or Mobile App? Mobile Web I would just handle with CSS for mobile viewports. That way you can just reskin the site for the viewport.
[5:12:10] ElfmanB: !mc-pack
[5:12:16] Krysvac: Make it a public git repo and viewers can contribute
[5:12:18] listikuss: that's way easier, ofc .... XD
[5:12:20] Morlega: 3 dropdowns right next to each other (instead of below each other) could be very fancy
[5:12:23] BloodBlight: Ya, some quick filters near the list would be good.
[5:12:28] Garrett41: you are able to use ul and li in the same list
[5:12:29] ricardo_z: ricardo_z subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 17 months! 
[5:12:36] BloodBlight: And then gray / hind things that don't match
[5:12:38] BlazeAndDaze: also, alphabetically sort planets?
[5:12:55] Brianmose12: I always do search boxes when a select list is large
[5:13:05] daedmissica0: @Giantwaffle https://ant.design/components/tree-select look at top  Example
[5:13:11] Thermaight: NO
[5:13:12] Morlega: @Giantwaffle you still didn't mention whether it's plain JS, jQuery, React etc. Right now looks like plain JS/HTML. jQuery UI has searchable dropdowns iirc you can easily set up
[5:13:12] DigitallyAdmiringHumanity: what pack is the patreon server on?
[5:13:14] Garrett41: @Giantwaffle What is you just added a - before each moon ?
[5:13:17] IlsaGold: Make the moonlist a 3D rotatable list?
[5:13:18] xaytana: nesting + scroll would make this work, system > planet > satellites then scroll when multiple nests are open, search would also help
[5:13:20] Jaydepps00: @BlazeAndDaze ordering by distance from kerbol prob smarter
[5:13:23] inforv: just hopped back in what we talking about?
[5:13:30] fREAST: search is also useful on mobile for dropdown lists
[5:13:39] Allmostdone: nothing wrong with a search box
[5:13:48] CantTouchDisNow: yoink
[5:13:50] Thermaight: @Giantwaffle think about how awful scrolling 100s of items on mobile is - dropdowns on mobile suck
[5:13:53] Jaydepps00: EZ yoink
[5:13:55] deadgolfer: search on mobile is nice too
[5:14:01] deadgolfer: same for both mobile and desktop
[5:14:02] Linkitch: So much joinking
[5:14:07] 0omkins: ItIsWhatItIs  ItIsWhatItIs
[5:14:08] ItsSABER_: search is very nice on mobile
[5:14:11] BlazeAndDaze: @Jaydepps00 I kinda dropped into the stream without full context. If you can track current position dynamically, then yea - the context changes, could make sense
[5:14:14] listikuss: The question is, do YOU use search bars? ^^
[5:14:18] unnoticedx: i use search to legit open every app i have on my phone

[5:14:40] Thermaight: @unnoticedx right, I just hide everything and search at this point, on my computer too

[5:55:22] Narakah66: just make alot of sand making machines
[5:55:47] Vizion_TV: What are we working on?
[5:55:58] Morlega: It's already Hardened
[5:56:03] chaoskub: Pati is fixing power (via exploit)
[5:56:20] TippletonJohn: Wonder if you can 4x the upgrades?
[5:56:27] Morlega: 3 more coils NODDERS
[5:56:31] Vovosunt: does he need the specialization?
[5:56:33] jdogg91288: speed augments rights?
[5:56:40] inforv: @chaoskub you ratted kids cheating on tests didnt you Kappa
[5:56:46] Morlega: add 3 coils for extra speed NODDERS
[5:57:16] kypudo: use the upgrade kits too
[5:57:22] inforv: @kypudo he did
[5:57:23] GGoodGGuy: faster forge hammers and multiple cobblestone generators
[5:57:23] ketzall: Isn't there an infinite water thing that you can use instead of those tanks?
[5:57:24] Yakobro: im making 10 sand/sec with just an HV forge hammer lol
[5:57:32] lvyEartman: wrong plates
[5:57:34] Maddog_CS: Just found out you can swipe the bottom of your iPhone to swap apps fml
[5:57:38] Jimanjim: wrong plates
[5:57:43] Purecrew: It requires the compactor'
[5:57:45] chaoskub: Compacting drawer? lol
[5:58:03] Lightning00Blade: In the back wall
[5:58:06] Purecrew: you just passed it
[5:58:11] Bulltank: This is never going to be fast enough. You're going to need a lot of machines
[5:58:11] Purecrew: in the back alone
[5:58:57] Morlega: Not Enderium either
[5:58:57] Moobot: You can sub to Waffle by clicking this neat link -> twitch.tv/giantwaffle/subscribe SUBprise
[5:59:15] Bulltank: You need 120 of those lol
[5:59:17] Jimanjim: yeah, not worth it
[5:59:17] Bulltank: or 256 machines
[5:59:19] YaBoiDreamy: ResidentSleeper
[5:59:20] aundros: Maybe need more?
[5:59:22] geeeegeeeeeeee: so slow
[5:59:24] inforv: Forge Hammer time
[5:59:24] Yakobro: just feed multiple cobble generators into the forge hammers
[5:59:25] DecoyOcelot: uhv macerator time
[5:59:28] primo_qwe: forge hammers are easy solution
[5:59:32] primo_qwe: why are you doing this?
[5:59:32] kypudo: you can use the forgeplate for faster with cobble to gravel to sand
[5:59:39] lazyhot: what is the spot/slot under the energy bar is for?
[5:59:46] Morlega: @Giantwaffle check the specialization, it might not be needed for Sand and slow the machine down
[5:59:46] kypudo: yhea forgehammer
[5:59:50] Deamp: we can use the "rock breaker" to generate cobble
[5:59:52] primo_qwe: use canning machines for automating buckets
[5:59:56] primo_qwe: its really easy
[6:00:04] YaBoiDreamy: ForgePlay? Wankge
[6:00:07] just_cro: just make 50 of them
[6:00:14] mysts_07: u can do fluid autocraft
[6:00:19] primo_qwe: yes filling them with lava and water
[6:00:40] primo_qwe: you can do pattern for them
[6:00:41] Deamp: rock breaker is faster than the cobble generator
[6:00:55] primo_qwe: just but empty bucket to left and lava/water bucket to right
[6:01:02] kypudo: see usages
[6:01:04] Morlega: Pattern for bucket -> water/lava bucket and just put a crea tank on the filler
[6:01:05] LsTheRoberto: breaks rocks
[6:01:07] LsTheRoberto: probably
[6:01:08] d3vrand0m: its how you made obsidian
[6:01:12] InternetPlumber: it's like the igeus extrdruder from thermal
[6:01:15] kitofmaadnes: isnt pati making milions off cobble for quarts
[6:01:19] Mike190Twitch: ROck breaker just generates the item that goes in
[6:01:20] lazyhot: Also plain stone POG!!
[6:01:21] Morlega: "Cryogenic Magma Solidifier"
[6:01:26] GrumpyEngineer: there might be a stack upgrade?
[6:01:28] Minelmonia: "magma solidifier"?
[6:01:31] primo_qwe: dont you need water and lava adjacent to rock breaker?
[6:01:45] GGoodGGuy: you are asking to much waflu
[6:01:47] InternetPlumber: @primo_qwe yes but it doesn't consume it
[6:01:48] Zapper_777: Lava liquid?
[6:02:05] inforv: @Zapper_777 Thats just lava lol
[6:02:17] primo_qwe: idk im using dense cobblestone on UIV for doing quartz, its fast af
[6:02:20] chromea1: I think if you push CTRL + in the crafting menu it will automatically craft stuff you have recipes for @Giantwaffle
[6:02:22] kane1941: processing array of rock breakers KEKW
[6:02:57] IamtheJK: You could do green machine with rock breaker
[6:03:00] chromea1: In refined storage the + is the pull items from storage in REI
[6:03:09] Simon04090: Can that do cobble or gravel directly?
[6:03:23] inforv: ^^
[6:03:48] lazyhot: But how to get adjecent lava and water in the processing array with rock brakers?
[6:04:21] Yohan460: can you just use the tool?
[6:04:27] Yohan460: do a replacement over an area?
[6:04:28] eldersage69: i think you need lava and water on each side of the rock breaker they dont get used
[6:04:35] InternetPlumber: you don't... you put the machine next to it
[6:04:47] primo_qwe: yes
[6:04:48] Purecrew: He has creative tanks
[6:04:48] Mike190Twitch: water/lava are placed in world
[6:04:51] Yakobro: you do at lower voltages, idk about UV
[6:04:51] Deamp: yes you need that
[6:05:00] Mike190Twitch: I've never made a processing array rock breaker so I can't say
[6:05:04] InternetPlumber: @Purecrew it needs to by physically next to it
[6:05:12] lvyEartman: why 140k buckets?
[6:05:14] Yakobro: kekw
[6:05:14] Morlega: KEKW
[6:05:17] TheWonderLlama: KEKW
[6:05:20] IlsaGold: Isnt this how you make sand allready?
[6:05:20] Jaydepps00: KEKW
[6:05:22] Yogithebaer: i dont think you have enough buckets
[6:05:31] Yakobro: KEKW
[6:05:32] Jaydepps00: infinite liquids, cant get a bucket of water OMEGALUL
[6:05:34] Morlega: No regular water KEKW
[6:05:35] Cdup07: infinite liquid and you cant bucket it lol
[6:05:36] Marguti: lul
[6:05:37] JonnyL: OMEGALUL

[6:06:52] Yakobro: slower
[6:06:55] primo_qwe: thats slower than dense cobble
[6:06:55] inforv: How about gravel?
[6:06:55] Sanduckchan: slower
[6:06:55] lvyEartman: slower
[6:06:56] Moopoop: slower
[6:06:57] Dibbsu: Susge Kinda slow
[6:06:57] YaBoiDreamy: quite slow
[6:06:57] Jaydepps00: much slower
[6:06:57] Moobot: You can find Waffle's Youtube channel here - https://youtube.com/giantwaffle
[6:06:59] YaBoiDreamy: make 10
[6:06:59] N13ls_k: slower
[6:07:00] mysts_07: uhv
[6:07:03] Yakobro: just stack up the NC generators?
[6:07:03] Jaydepps00: one guyd

[6:07:06] primo_qwe: classic chat
[6:07:08] kane1941: make processing array?
[6:07:17] TheWonderLlama: MOAR POWER cohhBoom
[6:07:25] CantTouchDisNow: can it make gravel?
[6:07:27] JustGlennBE: Just make the cobblestone gen
[6:07:28] InternetPlumber: cobble gens don't need poewr :)
[6:07:29] Bulltank: 6 days chat COPIUM
[6:07:31] Morlega: Could probably do that
[6:07:32] lvyEartman: multiblock rock breaker LUL?
[6:07:39] chaoskub: Can you do Glass -> Pane -> Sand?
[6:07:39] GGoodGGuy: send Ci with hammer to get some.. the fastest way to get cobblestone
[6:07:47] JustGlennBE: We on a time schedule guys
[6:07:50] lazyhot: cobble gen('s) would be faster imho
[6:07:52] Minelmonia: "borrow" the one in the Clean room to test? @Giantwaffle
[6:07:58] mysts_07: y cant we have molten cobble like from tinkers Sadge
[6:08:00] Baysyxx: just postmates cobblestone
[6:08:06] Morlega: Processing array with 64 would be dozens of stacks per second monkaHmm
[6:08:12] Bulltank: You can drop a ton of cobble generators easily and generate shit tons of cobble fast
[6:08:39] Yakobro: @Morlega 64 NC generators would be 128 stacks/sec, they're just the best for cobble really
[6:08:48] SailorWS: PepeSpin
[6:08:53] Joewiibox: just get a bunch of noobs with wooden pickaxes = infinite cobble
[6:08:59] Koeckie: what is he trying to get again? I am so lost waffleEE
[6:09:04] loganpod2000: @giantwaffle are you going to end up playing Hogwarts legacy?
[6:09:14] Yakobro: @Koeckie cobble for sandd to get certus quartz
[6:09:14] SailorWS: waffleWave  RainTime lol
[6:09:24] Morlega: @Morlega Yeah but a processing array would only be a single structure that you'd have to build and hook up
[6:09:30] stickman_02: I can't wait for hogwarts legacy
[6:09:33] nellydocs: seablock right after nomifactory PogDog

[7:20:31] arkun_: ItIsWhatItIs
[7:20:38] inforv: Thought it did 256 of the ingot
[7:20:43] Morlega: @Giantwaffle no, x256 means it does 256 of the recipe at once. If the recipe outputs 2 items, it means an output of 512 items per cycle
[7:20:46] drissical: Was there another 512 one in there
[7:20:47] Askjong: bronce rods are also 512
[7:20:53] HuntingButcher: Guys don't tell him about the other one

[7:20:58] Moobot: You can find Waffle's Youtube channel here - https://youtube.com/giantwaffle
[7:21:03] boogerbomb01: one ingut usually makes 2 rods right?
[7:21:04] cmmeth: there are multiple 512 things KEKW
[7:21:15] Morlega: x256 means 256 recipes at once, so if each recipe outputs 2 rods, it's 512 rods YEP
[7:21:18] Swingeing_Folk: the bolt things were 512 as well KEKW
[7:21:21] cmmeth: screws as well
[7:21:24] cmmeth: or bolts

[7:24:07] BroCreed1: If you think about it. All the side quests are for the main quest. So really they are the main quest
[7:24:25] BroCreed1: But really the main quest is the friends we've made along the way
[7:25:01] deadgolfer: is there a multiblock polarizer?
[7:25:11] StingrayNine: this really is a 256 step main quest with a smattering of 32 step side quests baked in
