[0:42:41] xopa: ApuPeek bananaTime
[0:42:46] Daphness: I have Windows 11 and have never crashed.  No problems at all.
[0:42:46] MandaLin: probably can't downgrade on a new pc that came with Win11 mandal3THINK CoconutYoshi had just upgraded, kept crashing, then downgraded within a day or two
[0:42:53] xopa: yo yo yo broski
[0:43:01] Abrakaidabra_: Xopeepi Peepi
[0:43:18] Amandroid: linkzzeyNod looks like you have to downgrade within 10 days of upgrading
[0:43:19] Daphness: Mine is fine with Windows 11
[0:43:21] MandaLin: it was just her Fortnite that had issues mandal3NOTES
[0:43:30] CoconutYoshi: if you upgrade you can downgrade within 10 days
[0:43:40] xopa: sure its not just a blerp? I troll sizzle all day with USB blerp alerts
[0:43:44] CoconutYoshi: @MandaLin and discord
[0:44:10] MandaLin: mandal3THINK is it not getting proper power?
[0:44:32] Amandroid: linkzzeyNod
[0:44:47] Daphness: Battery needs charging. Do you have buttons to hit on your backup batter?  Does it show the battery health and how many of the bands are full?
[0:44:48] Amandroid: sorry, nodding as in I understand
[0:44:52] CrabbyKronos: you can downgrade to 10 but its a whole process
[0:44:53] Xendisabu: If your backup is like my old one, the computer pulls more power than the backup provides, and it will eventually run out of juice and sound warnings.
[0:45:37] Daphness: The left button. Click it a few times and see what information comes up to see your health.
[0:45:51] CraftyCat200: linkzzeyHm

[0:53:51] MandaLin: @HavokTracks his backup power that he's got his pc plugged into seumPanic no big deal
[0:53:55] xopa: probably just goose with a toy "oh he's playing again... ferretPeek "
[0:53:55] ghostina9: @HavokTracks His battery backup octoGiggle
[0:53:55] Daphness: Oh, yes!  Your Batter UPS is probably not strong enough for your new PC.
