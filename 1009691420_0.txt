[1:16:34] grimmn: yeah, that can only be learned the hard way
[1:16:47] Allmostdone: @ninopanda Oh yea... he just refuses to do it
[1:16:52] Overkrow: Just check Clean Coders series by Robert Martin

[1:17:55] Rangetuur: java better
[1:17:55] Little_Lady_Lauren: @ElTankoJoe congrats. mopefully you dont get really sick tomorrow like i did
[1:17:56] ZyianDev: null checks
[1:17:56] grimmn: rust does that too
[1:18:00] ColonelBundy: c# has that too...
[1:18:01] Brianmose12: c# has that too, safe navigation operator

[1:18:38] Allmostdone: Oh ok... not unusual
[1:18:43] Little_Lady_Lauren: @ElTankoJoe same just a little sore
[1:18:50] TheIrishGuy: var Player : String?
[1:18:58] Overkrow: You can also use Elvis operator ?:
[1:18:59] BeornTheChief: nullable string

[1:19:21] Stegmurmulis: HeyGuys Waffle HeyGuys Chat pepeSmoke
[1:19:29] Zec: That's for value types, not reference trypes. Strings are nullable by default as they are reference types. But yeah, the ?-suffix makes a valuetype a nullable variable.
[1:19:29] ElTankoJoe: @Little_Lady_Lauren Well I might want to get my housekeeping out of the way before then.
[1:19:31] vanilla2011: it's in C# but it's newer
[1:19:34] DakotaFoxes: LUL

[1:40:20] Doritobob269: @Giantwaffle Never sell off all of it though. Always keep a tiny bit incase of a massive spike up
[1:40:22] Tech: Since you'd be better served just putting the loss directly in
[1:40:25] Drazer_: Staking of etherium is also deminishing the chance of a drop because the staked shares can't be sold
[1:40:26] Mr_Perril: i put 2k in ETH 2-3 months ago... seems like that was a good idea
[1:40:34] Tech: Because you can buy directly
[1:40:39] KekMannetje: you can buy instead of mining
[1:40:40] witty_pup: that still doesn't make sense tho just put the losses into buying it

[1:48:04] Moobot: Support Waffle by using his Epic creator code: Giantwaffle
[1:48:08] Wasabi76: code running on the blockchain
[1:48:11] Tech: Smart Contract is logic and code attached to a transaction
[1:48:11] witty_pup: @mana_burn sol summer pls lol
[1:48:31] i_W4tCH_i: ETH is cracked
[1:48:32] Silver_Skeeter: like NFTs
[1:48:40] Tech: Well everything is a transaction. You can't think about transaction as money exchange
[1:48:49] Lajnuss_: its so funny to watch waffle, here it seams like crypto is such a big thing. but this stream is the only place i hear of crypto ever LOL
[1:48:55] Juantaguan: contract transaction built into code?
[1:48:56] Tech: Exactly
[1:48:56] daanus12345: And the base fee burn + POS rewards will change the ETH incentive economy to a long term HODL economy in my opinion.
[1:49:08] leafeey: ethereum is tiring complete
[1:49:09] Doritobob269: @Giantwaffle What is the best way to learn how to mine crypto?
[1:49:09] manaxburn: @witty_pup haha
[1:49:10] Lajnuss_: i guess
[1:49:15] leafeey: turing*
[1:49:28] schwebels428: how much does a fuck ton weigh?
[1:49:32] obtoe_: peepoEZ
[1:49:35] Tech: I mean you hear about crypto a lot in other realms, you just don't see it in everyday circles because it's not a generic and useful technology yet.
[1:49:45] ItsOnMax: @schwebels428 as much as you mom KEKW
[1:49:56] orillion: @schwebels428 well when you forget how much a ton is and you write w/e
[1:50:00] Warkless: Tree farm has some NODDERS
[1:50:09] schwebels428: LUL
[1:50:10] witty_pup: we always talk about @tech especially when he's not here
[1:50:19] Wuzley: Eth to the moon :)
[1:50:19] manaxburn: @itsQuaff was great before they increased staking min to 200 Dot, haha. But it seems like a good project.
[1:50:22] dogma802: @Tech I mean it's a useful technology it just won't be anything consumers are hyper aware of other than currencies
[1:50:25] Wasabi76: I like DOT because I was in at $4 but not sure if I am gonna bet against ETH right now
[1:50:34] yellowspy: Waffle will you buy a helium miner?
[1:50:40] Face_32: do you think ity will ever get there?
[1:50:41] Wuzley: Sold all my DOT for Eth today (Already had quyite a bit of Eth)
[1:50:47] ImStoneBear: We are still early in the game yeah
[1:51:03] Wasabi76: if you buying gpu's now fgor miningh you doing it wrong
[1:51:15] Tech: marqueezus well that's the thing. It's not useful because it hasn't yet become a better alternative to traditional fiat
[1:51:20] Nilau: What does staking/stacking(?) mean?
[1:51:20] Joshuapetch: Can't wait to receive my aeron!
[1:51:20] legacy2529: isnt crypto a way for rich people to get richer
[1:51:40] inorganic: ^that's capitalism
[1:51:40] Tech: But once it's easier to use, easier to actual spend on everyday items, it will be mainstream
[1:51:45] Face_32: crypto seems like a good place to clean money LULW
[1:51:51] pengeg: @legacy2529 everything involving money is
[1:52:10] Eccodoit: @Giantwaffle  where did you buy your miners?
[1:52:11] dogma802: @Tech I was saying it had other applications than just currency and that currency is just way average consumers will interact with it
[1:52:13] legacy2529: true true
[1:52:17] Tabakhase: says the rich kid KEKW
[1:52:19] Xerexos_: @joshuapetch twinsies
[1:52:20] Tech: Ma'
[1:52:25] osamagate: Or they influence the media to pump...
[1:52:27] schwebels428: im just waiting for a bubble to come along and pop
[1:52:32] FlaminJurr: hey Waffle and chat o/
[1:52:44] Joshuapetch: @Xerexos_ PogChamp we rich cool kids now YEP
[1:52:44] Just_Walter: I invested 100bucks into ETH when it was at like 300, no idea how to cash out tho LUL
[1:52:45] Tech: marqueezus true, it's just that those other useful applications have a marginal share in potential value compared to currency
[1:53:08] Wasabi76: ya rich my ass, I started with a single RX 570 in 2017
[1:53:12] Wuzley: Still have a load of Fiat in my account waiting for a DIp /sigh. did use a bit earliere thankfully. And luickily bought a large stake the last BTC dip (Power outage)
[1:53:14] corvettesummer: And they have more disposable income to spend.  When crypto becomes more mainstream it will also get regulated by a government who doesn't understand what it is
[1:53:15] manaxburn: a good case use of crypto is Axie Infinity. People in the Philippines are making a living wage playing a game.
[1:53:17] mr_dewey: mr_dewey subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 13 months! 
[1:53:20] LinearLayer: Its just people who are afraid to buy too high
[1:53:23] CocoScruff: Haters gonna hate
[1:53:25] ninopanda: @Tech hey there bb ninopa1Love
[1:53:27] schwebels428: tbh, i don't have the money to invest right now. if theres a bubble, then i'll go out hooking so i can get money to invest
[1:53:28] Xerexos_: @joshuapetch pepeD I only played 500 tho
[1:53:33] Tech: Hey ninopanda euiikKiss
[1:53:34] Tenkaichi500: anybody in canada know how to invest a little bit of crypto?
[1:53:46] Tenkaichi500: *invest in
[1:53:54] legacy2529: same can't invest, got school to pay Sadge
[1:53:54] RodriCraft93: wait for correction then jump in, 50% wins in 20 days, cash out, repeat
[1:53:55] Joshuapetch: @Xerexos_ PogChamp get it from some office closure or something?
[1:54:01] ImStoneBear: Well if the price tanks i will be buying more
[1:54:10] Tech: YEP
[1:54:11] Xerexos_: @joshuapetch YEP
[1:54:12] Mr_Perril: 24x 3060 Ti's waffleD
[1:54:15] WcEnte_7: Is there anything in this modpack to get rid of fluids ?
[1:54:16] BIRDFRUIT: explain how im still losing then YEP
[1:54:23] BIRDFRUIT: PLTR YEP
[1:54:25] ChetSteadman_: unless you buy Coinbase
[1:54:33] Ananas99: Im smart Pog !
[1:54:33] Wasabi76: very true waffle
[1:54:51] liljoy98: liljoy98 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 52 months! 
[1:54:54] Wuzley: I prefer the dips, when its ATH after ATH I get anxious wether I should takje profit or not
[1:54:55] RodriCraft93: you can still make money shorting crypto
[1:54:55] Benkka: Everyone is a genius until they have puts on Disney :)
[1:55:04] OneGamerGrinds: @TheGrogLives whats wrong with coinbase?
[1:55:07] Xerexos_: just under a year old to no damages or scratch neither
[1:55:16] Face_32: how easy is it to get crypto cashed out? is it something that can happen in an hour? @Giantwaffle
[1:55:25] RodriCraft93: true
[1:55:30] Spinerek: based
[1:55:31] dasmako: yep
[1:55:40] DrHax_: "I cant have it so other people shouldnt have it either" those people in a nutshell
[1:55:43] osamagate: I just have the fear of missing out.. I'm missing out now :|
[1:55:48] Minelmonia: Honest question, what is Etherum used for?
[1:55:49] Mikael_x: Is US developing a goverment crypto?
[1:55:52] Wasabi76: I think he talking about -> fiat?
[1:55:54] orillion: if its on an exchange however those can be done instantly
[1:55:59] daanus12345: Some unfortunate people are exploited financially because their monetary system is failing.   Also cross border remittance fees are way to high so oversea workers are exploited even more, crypto can solve these issues.  This tech is just plain good for humanity, its not just about big gains.
[1:56:01] Tech: And most exchanges don't actually put a transaction on the block
[1:56:09] Mikael_x: like e-$
[1:56:09] Moobot: You can sub to Waffle by clicking this neat link -> twitch.tv/giantwaffle/subscribe
[1:56:11] Tech: So it's faster for them
[1:56:14] Wasabi76: coinbase will instant transfer to your bank account but fees at coinbase are crazy
[1:56:16] craul0: Do you have any tip in getting into stocks?
[1:56:20] Benkka: Might be a stupid question but do you have to pay tax on crypto?
[1:56:22] DakotaFoxes: PogChamp
[1:56:28] orillion: @Benkka yes
[1:56:36] Appz: Benkka when gains are realized yes
[1:56:42] Wasabi76: yes crypto trading, mining, etc. are taxable events
[1:56:47] bedbuggies: Hi :)
[1:56:51] LinearLayer: Whats the best way to buy and hodl crypto?
[1:57:02] mechoriet: poopy water?
[1:57:08] obtoe_: DansGame
[1:57:08] Wasabi76: IMO best way to hold is an offline hardware wallet
[1:57:10] sellinglobbies150: @Giantwaffle Do you think Twitch needs a softcore porn section?
[1:57:15] obtoe_: stinky water
[1:57:19] BIRDFRUIT: @LinearLayer metamask is nice :)
[1:57:21] LinearLayer: Yes ok good
[1:57:23] Allmostdone: I can't believe after all these years I'm still giving out IT business advice
[1:57:32] Bolt_Vanderhuge_: think there's another dip coming?
[1:57:40] sonorantoad: Invest in some cold storage and then subsequently lose it in a boating accident
[1:57:43] UECNSNemesis: cover it in epoxy resin, cuz metal will rust :)
[1:57:58] Joshuapetch: I have my keys on my work pc pepeLaugh
[1:57:59] Mr_Perril: type it in a public pastebin KappaRoss
[1:58:05] RodriCraft93: ETH at 4k by the end of May? honest opinion
[1:58:10] BIRDFRUIT: KEKW
[1:58:11] osamagate: get rid of ada and buy eth?
[1:58:11] RevBanger: Waffle what do you use to buy/trade?
[1:58:15] manaxburn: there are even Crypto  ATMS if you can find them in your city
[1:58:15] dasmako: YEP
[1:58:16] Nilau: Get a tattoo between your ass checks with the words WAFW
[1:58:16] ZaneKyber: I'd say store it in multiple different places though, because what if.. your house burns down
[1:58:16] a_seductive_sloth: tattoo on your butt?
[1:58:19] Tech: Oh, that's another thing about mining compared to buying. Unless you are going to file as a business, you have to pay tax on the earned crypto from mining without being able to write off the expenses.
[1:58:22] Wasabi76: I don't know if you are understanding what an offline wallet is...
[1:58:22] dasmako: they werent even hacked they got phished lol
[1:58:30] LinearLayer: Yeah store it on ICloud
[1:58:32] DrHax_: store it in my cloud storage which has definitely never been hacked YEP
[1:58:35] Tech: Which means you have to be above your marginal tax rate for your profits
[1:58:36] Allmostdone: You could use Waffle's Titanium wall with the 24 hour guards
[1:58:42] Xerexos_: I have it on a notepad file called comp sci homework
[1:58:42] BONBONNIE13: tattoo it on your gonads so that way if they want your key they're going to REALLY want it
[1:58:46] dancarrol0710: What mining pool do you use
[1:58:51] daanus12345: A hardware wallet is a dedicated signature device that conceals the secret phase from ever to be exposed.
[1:58:58] mechoriet: LULLW
[1:59:00] Tech: Well I'm saying you can, but for the average person getting into mining who likely has a W-2, it's not a simple add
[1:59:04] sellinglobbies150: Taint. Not gonads.
[1:59:06] Dagmoo: yeah thats a big OOF
[1:59:07] obtoe_: thats prob so painful.
[1:59:08] Xerexos_: also that's a long tattoo
[1:59:09] Joshuapetch: I don't have enough room for my key F
[1:59:11] Vangelis716: Xerexos_ thanks for the info Kappa

[2:00:17] YeahThatFits: yes

[2:00:19] DrHax_: @Vangelis716 so wrap it around it a few times, I'm sure it'll fit somehow KEKW
[2:00:20] pengeg: @Giantwaffle where did you get your metal stamps from
[2:00:21] iTents: Yes, the order matters
[2:00:29] navalship55: when do you think that some guys going to make another wannacry or iloveyou but instead of ransom or sending emails, they just mine bitcoin with the botnet they've created.
[2:00:30] manaxburn: yeah
[2:00:33] Vangelis716: DrHax_ font size 2 pepeLaugh
[2:00:38] UECNSNemesis: make it a puzzle like The Room

[2:00:51] Joshuapetch: @ninopanda hey bb peepoHappy
[2:00:51] Xerexos_: just buy a lazer cutter EZY
[2:00:54] BONBONNIE13: KEKW
[2:00:58] sellinglobbies150: Why not a piece of paper....in your safe.
[2:01:01] Tabakhase: wtf no LUL
[2:01:03] Chyrion: aluminum can oxidize easily if not properly protected
[2:01:04] FroZenThai: I think it's fine if it can be cracked. Then at least someone has the ability to get the crypto after your death, like your family
[2:01:04] RodriCraft93: iLUL
[2:01:05] DrHax_: @Vangelis716 then they really gotta get close to read it tho OMEGALUL
[2:01:05] grimmn: @navalship55 crypto mining malware already exists
[2:01:05] Silver_Skeeter: if my house burns i have other problems
[2:01:07] AlfredTheSalmon: yeah don't hold on to it for too long, otherwise quantum pc's could just brute force it LUL
[2:01:09] Roystak: i hear that in chile a company use their on cryto as a token for investing in a solar park, so it was like buying watts/hr or somthing like that, it name was "solar token" ( i dont really know what i am talking about, but its blockchange related)
[2:01:10] pengeg: aluminum oxidizes super fast
[2:01:19] manaxburn: fireproof bag
[2:01:19] BIRDFRUIT: aluminum melts at 660 c, gold at 1000c
[2:01:25] Tabakhase: 600c and allu is done
[2:01:26] ZaneKyber: what tool or device do you use to punch those symbols into metal
[2:01:29] RodriCraft93: you coated in titanium
[2:01:31] masztufa: aluminum's oxide forms a protective layer
[2:01:33] Xerexos_: the outside of aluminum is already oxidized
[2:01:44] LinearLayer: House fires can reach 800+C
[2:01:45] misledcon: anodizing is aluminum oxide
[2:01:46] BIRDFRUIT: house fires range from 1000-2000F, hotter than aluminum melting
[2:01:48] masztufa: so it oxidizes fast, but stops the rest
[2:01:49] blisteringcold: fire is like 800c
[2:01:53] pengeg: YEP ive melted plenty of cans in bonfires
[2:01:54] Mandorake: @Giantwaffle a good pizza oven could get that hot i think
[2:01:56] masztufa: exactly
[2:01:57] misledcon: and is harder than diamond
[2:01:59] RodriCraft93: yes white
[2:02:01] Face_32: thats how most oxidization works isnt it?
[2:02:03] BIRDFRUIT: TL;DR dont use aluminum for anything you want to keep
[2:02:03] Vangelis716: grimmn2 just like malware that checks your clipboard and when you copy a btc/eth address it replaces that with their own address. So you sent to them instead of the intended account
[2:02:12] manaxburn: Fireproof bags should be able to withstand up to 1,550 degrees Fahrenheit
[2:02:13] M1k3D3l7a: was the plane noise at yours or mine?
[2:02:16] Tabakhase: grilling is far from that, just like 400ish
[2:02:21] Crossed_legion: go tungsten
[2:02:30] BONBONNIE13: Quick, someone unplug the fireplace before it burns the house down! MONKERS
[2:02:34] ImStoneBear: Etch it into a block of diamond
[2:02:34] UECNSNemesis: bruh you probably shouldn't be worrying about the aluminum in your house if you're also in the house
[2:02:36] 0omkins: Etch it on a diamond
[2:02:48] Xerexos_: micro laser engrave it into a diamond ring
[2:02:56] LinearLayer: @Tabakhase You grilling at 400C PauseChamp
[2:02:58] BIRDFRUIT: ring with a microscopic engraving PogChamp
[2:03:04] navalship55: guys, guys, its easy just remember  the code for many years
[2:03:22] masztufa: just e-mail the code to yourself Kappa

[2:05:15] tommyfod: everyone thinks xrp is a scam but it's really not, just had a lot of bad press from the bitcoin world I think. it's got great prospects and I'd probably one of the best positioned to be used in the real world. not decentralised though as such
[2:05:18] DimensionalShadow: Be the youngest person there

[2:43:51] xHASHTRONAUTx: had to get airlifted one time cuz my heart stopped however nobody authorized and it was also deemed unnecessary so insurance took most of the debt...
[2:43:51] BeastboySAW: They were made in the late 80’s for the Marines. It probably has passed thru many people’s hands and got contaminated or abused. That’s why you only shoot new or reloaded by you.

[2:45:55] parsow: Mortgages are negative as well though
[2:45:56] chuckg0tstuck: What're you talking about? The bank uses your cash and then you pay tax on dividends in a savings account...
[2:46:02] Archelonde: That sounds like they want people to invest rather than store their money
[2:46:02] TheeGr8estDane: for every £1 you give to the bank they can *borrow* £10 from you
[2:46:04] Christo_Disco: @giantwaffle It's odd yeah. But it came after they lowered the interest rate on loans 30 year loans to about 0,5% - 1,5%

[2:46:21] Breadw: @Christo_Disco exactly
[2:46:23] nwl1515: Our national bank have negatives rates too, so the bank will have to pay them for holding our money, so they put the interest on us
[2:46:24] Yatzy2D: In Norway we have a tax if you have too much money. Too much is around 150k$, I believe. The bank doesn't take anything though.
[2:46:25] witty_pup: people think this kind of stuff is ridiculous then vote dem
[2:46:31] dennixfailalot: because us plebs need to pay

[2:46:54] dahcmi: Oh great here comes politics
[2:46:54] Yatzy2D: It is there so people are encouraged to keep money in circulation.
[2:46:59] parsow: No. Interest is litteraly negative on short variable mortgages

[3:47:32] QuesoBad0nga: Mac "pro" LUL
[3:47:33] BigOhNotation: @Orin_The_Sly because of unix compatibility
[3:47:39] dogma802: It's because it's unix based
[3:47:39] lazycdog: my office uses macbooks for dev work.
[3:47:39] zebadrabbit: perl is high-paying because perl devs are hard to find
[3:47:40] Liam0914: now i have to wait 2 years for a update to release geez
[3:47:41] WoofWoofDude: @Giantwaffle Hey i'm reading a blog on legacy systems and i think it's applicable to your mentality thoward the modpack you wanna make. Want the link ? (sorry a little out of context)
[3:47:42] Twin5un: sheesh LUL
[3:47:43] Jamswhat2: @Orin_The_Sly You can program in both Windows and MacOS maybe?
[3:47:44] aman36000: Have you figured out what kind of mod you wanna make yet? Im excited for those streams
[3:47:46] Bambooyah_: If you're full js stack developer or front-end mac's are really good
[3:47:46] nativeW01f: macs are easily the best for the majority of programming
[3:47:47] RodriCraft93: @Giantwaffle  ETH got to 3333.32 on kraken KEKW

[3:48:00] ninopanda: When I dropped my top-of-the-line Microsoft laptop on the asphalt, I figured it was ruined Turns out I had barely scratched the Surface.
[3:48:04] Twin5un: not really but I see what you are saying
[3:48:06] Xerexos_: used a MacBook pro specifically to do coding
[3:48:09] Liam0914: the only downside is macs arent the best for gaming
[3:48:15] nxusr: @ninopanda KEKW
[3:48:17] Mega_R: also iOS development is locked to macOS. So you might as well use macOS
[3:48:19] Brianmose12: @ninopanda Clap
[3:48:36] b_pricey: U have like 120 in ur storage
[3:48:41] BigOhNotation: @Giantwaffle you can't
[3:48:43] zebadrabbit: you can build swift in linux
[3:48:46] Atomic5_: @Liam0914 Well Macs arent meant for gaming anyways, theyre just productivity computers
[3:48:48] grimmn: objective-c
[3:48:48] QuesoBad0nga: XCode @Giantwaffle
[3:48:49] BroCreed1: You can't sign at least

[3:48:51] grimmn: or swift
[3:48:53] Bambooyah_: can't build swift if not a macbook or xamarin
[3:48:55] Atomic5_: Swift
[3:48:57] Hunter_Boone: they use swift now
[3:49:00] BigOhNotation: You can use any language to make mac apps
[3:49:01] 1StClassAlcoholic: You cannot run the iOS simulator on anything other than macos
[3:49:03] SlaughterSteve: yeah as a mobile engineer you cannot create iOS apps on anything but Mac os
[3:49:09] FoxxyDingo: you cant use apple development environment with mac
[3:49:10] ItsOnMax: If you want to release or build anything for a apple device, you need a apple device.
[3:49:13] dogma802: You probably can't build for IOS. You can use the language but you probably need Mac to build an app for iphone
[3:49:25] Xerexos_: xcode and swift are macos
[3:49:26] Brianmose12: that is a big factor
[3:49:33] dogma802: Perl isn't that bad but it has way too many language features
[3:49:43] DatoPotatoDato: what about go?
[3:49:45] Atomic5_: You need to have XCode to make iOS apps and Xcode is only on Mac
[3:49:45] Mega_R: You can only compile to ios with macOS. Tried other ways but its a struggle
[3:49:51] nxusr: the top ones are either new languages, or languages with a bad reputation. all harder to hire for.

[3:50:19] ninopanda: i pre-ordered an xbox. I just felt sorry for my homeless ex girlfriend
[3:50:19] UselessSlime: You just can't get the SDKs on anything other than macOS, so basically you're SOL if you're not building them on macOS
[3:50:20] nxusr: @Silentlightning lots of legacy shit written in it, poorly. so it gets a bad rap

[4:43:53] Omeyn: that's why I love/hate Mekanism, it's so much fun to play with but it makes everything so easy later on it's pointless
[4:43:59] daftMOOSE: @masztufa Yup, this pack takes place completely within compact machines, Waffle still hasn't made it to the Overworld yet.

[4:46:30] nekoaaa: Can you  go to nether?
[4:46:43] Madarion: project ozone wasnt rly complex, it was just grindy as hell
[4:46:45] masztufa: different
[4:46:54] TheSparMan: different are good imo
[4:47:02] Hunter_Boone: you coding it by yourself?
[4:47:02] DaChibi: Only vtubers mod pack.

[4:47:21] MiraPacku: SevTech monkaS
[4:47:25] masztufa: it's very hard to stand out among 584849 standard packs
[4:47:30] Tasar_: Will you involve Mobs?
[4:47:31] AlfredTheSalmon: gregtech monkaS
[4:47:39] xDiglett: If DOGE can be $1, ETH can be $20k.
[4:47:46] Theduskflyer: Do a decent fucking armor progression, that’s actually hard. @giantwaffle
[4:48:06] Mega_R: yea its all the same
[4:48:06] Moobot: You can find Waffle's Youtube channel here - https://youtube.com/giantwaffle
[4:48:20] totally_anonymous: yep everything is the same just with more and more powercreep to make it appealing
[4:48:29] masztufa: TBH that's why i like GTNH. It made me use mods i've not touched in years
[4:48:37] Tasar_: You could brick??
[4:48:38] MiraPacku: Quarrys were so Kreygasm
[4:48:40] EmVvVv: @Giantwaffle Do you have any fun modpack to play with friends?
[4:48:44] MiraPacku: monkaHmm
[4:48:46] MiraPacku: meteors PogChamp
[4:48:57] Jamswhat2: you mean make tools?
[4:48:59] Theduskflyer: Fuuuuuck sieving
[4:49:00] JommyBee: but doing that in modded i think would bore alot of people
[4:49:04] TheBiggestBread: How many Gregtech packs have you played? @Giantwaffle
[4:49:05] SuperbaeRS: mining planets?
[4:49:07] daftMOOSE: I'd like to find a modpack that turns MC into an ARPG.
[4:49:07] MiraPacku: make mining roombas PogChamp
[4:49:15] Testimony_: @Giantwaffle did you play modpack called Greg Tech New Horizon? I have a feeling you will like it, it's a quite hardcore pack
[4:49:17] Omeyn: I like using the turtles to strip mine, those are fun times
[4:49:24] WGG25: by "easy" and "hard" do you mean not-grindy and grindy? grind is not fun
[4:49:26] itzSimondr98: Sieving / Bonsai / pellets sucks KEKW
[4:49:29] Madarion: @Theduskflyer problem with armor is that it requires mops that need it. and mops is like meh as a difficult lever
[4:49:32] aman36000: How many ETH do i have to donate for you to plat GT:NH
[4:49:41] Jrd1000: i just use emc lol
[4:49:46] tvfriestie: Terrafirmacraft xp
[4:49:47] MiraPacku: SevTech with the giant clusters was really cool NODDERS
[4:49:50] JommyBee: but if you need like 10k of some iron
[4:49:50] Hunter_Boone: are you coding it by yourself or do you have a team?
[4:49:54] JommyBee: do you wanna mine 10k iron
[4:49:59] F6MaxDamage: or you use plants for resourcce. LUL
[4:50:01] Tasar_: Mine in minecraft? The nerve!
[4:50:06] JommyBee: NODDERS
[4:50:21] AlfredTheSalmon: Journey to the core was my favorite grindy kind of pack
[4:50:25] Apparentthreat: Tinkers Construct Hammer would like to have a word with you. Same for mining gadget0
[4:50:26] Frooonti: Bees are so fun :)
[4:50:31] maxxxwinder: i think working up to the tech level is the fun..takes a ton of manual labor to reach the automation
[4:50:34] SuperbaeRS: bees WutFace
[4:50:42] masztufa: railcraft tunnel bore?
[4:50:49] GolfingTurtle: Kind of the beauty of minecraft becasue someone like you can go and manually mine, the problem is modpacks have the creative style end goal that require singularities/huge amounts of items
[4:50:56] SuperbaeRS: magic tricks PogChamp ?
[4:51:00] Omeyn: I like the old school quarry where it actually slowly digs out the quarry
[4:51:07] masztufa: sounds like GTNH, not gonnal like Kappa
[4:51:08] Venxuri: GregTech packs do that, right? with the huge clusters
[4:51:13] Venxuri: I mean Omnifactory does for sure
[4:51:15] UECNSNemesis: This is why studying idling games is important. the way they add artificial convenience is pretty genius in certain cases
[4:51:19] MiraPacku: monkaS Lithium
[4:51:26] Madarion: but pls better ore trippling and so than mekanism :( always felt weird the progress of these weird water towers
[4:51:33] Testimony_: sounds like @Giantwaffle wants to play gtnh but ignores chat when we tell him about it LUL
[4:51:38] aman36000: ???
[4:51:44] masztufa: 100% sounds like it to be fair
[4:51:55] Frooonti: @Omeyn yeah the old buildcraft quarries were fun. But of course chunk updates kill performance so that eventually was a nono danSad
[4:51:58] maxxxwinder: some people actually enjoy mining
[4:52:11] DaChibi: Sleeping. You get a set amount of resources per sleeping period. Balance that with mob-only drops and then the player has to choose which resource to get.
[4:52:24] Omeyn: @Frooonti Truuuuue but damn watching them was so satisfying
[4:52:36] JommyBee: what i dont like is having a modpack with like 4-5 different ways to get resoruces but 1 of those is always the best way
[4:52:41] JommyBee: rather than all same but in different ways
[4:52:48] FroZenThai: Would it be interesting if mining was hard on it's own? even stone takes long, and it forces you to make drill machines?
[4:52:51] Madarion: yeah, but with anvil repair, enchants doesnt feel special anymore
[4:52:59] tvfriestie: different ways should have different pay offs
[4:53:03] maxxxwinder: i liked the ender IO stuff
[4:53:18] Frooonti: @Omeyn when you can watch that little drone thingy build the drill frame danGachi
[4:53:20] AlfredTheSalmon: computer craft?
[4:53:24] lennon7770: You should check out the GreedyCraft modpack! If u want a pretty hard pack (with expert mode) but has that ''old school'' modded feel to it
[4:53:28] Crozbo: so basically moded minecraft go from prof of work to prof of stake Kappa
[4:53:29] daemonaedryn: But would it require you know how to program? If yes you are blocking anyone that doesnt know how to code from the pack
[4:53:32] MiraPacku: remember psych or what it was called? the program magic mod? PogChamp
[4:53:34] Sandiro1: Like the game autonauts
[4:53:55] WGG25: @mirapacku psy
[4:53:58] masztufa: what if you used the more esoteric methods of automation? Like logistics pipes, railcraft tunnel bores, steves carts etc.
[4:54:02] itzSimondr98: DaemonSzyman You mean like this pack for automating compact machine walls? KEKW
[4:54:19] daemonaedryn: @itzSimondr98 YEP though I think waffle did it with redstone
[4:54:19] Thefriis: So Autonauts for MC? 😍
[4:54:52] Omeyn: @Frooonti yup LUL good times
[4:55:02] itzSimondr98: DaemonSzyman Well the average person doesn't know how to do it with redstone either, so same problem tbh YEP
[4:55:09] grimmn: higher yield
[4:55:09] Tasar_: Purity and loss
[4:55:19] masztufa: this is hilarious actually, waffle has been describing GTNH for the past 5 minutes, but doesn't even realize it
[4:55:30] aman36000: @Giantwaffle I know this is like a completely different mod than what you want, but have you ever played Terrafirmacraft
[4:55:33] Arisonius: gtnh?
[4:55:35] grimmn: dealing with additional waste outputs is a cool addition too
[4:55:38] MiraPacku: monkaS needing high percentage iron for specific recipes
[4:55:41] Apparentthreat: so late game mekanism?
[4:55:41] masztufa: gregtech new horizons
[4:55:59] Apparentthreat: watch the dots
[4:56:14] Crozbo: vanilla minecraft, proof of work, moded prof of stake

[4:56:20] WGG25: that's a threat monkaS
[4:56:58] masztufa: addendum for the processing thing: make it use some sort of acid maybe. So you'd only use the highest levels of processing for the prescious stuff. Not the usual common stuff
[4:57:05] PapaJazTv: Complication for the sake of complication has never made any sense to me. Gregtech perfect example.
[4:57:33] grimmn: It also doesn't have to appeal to everyone
[4:58:07] MiraPacku: rebuilding bases for the 9th time pepeLaugh
[4:58:20] grimmn: factorio does it very well imo
[4:58:20] nekoaaa: @Giantwaffle  can you go to nether in this modpack?
[4:58:20] drsnaki96: ngl i enjoyed ftb interactions after the early game
[4:58:26] Crozbo: it is hard to balance pack, because some people play 2h week, some 5h day
[4:58:36] OddfellowX: kindaoddfellow subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 8 months! 
[4:58:51] JerryLubrano: when you dont have a ton of time to play, things taking a bunch of steps or long timers makes it nearly unplayable.
[4:59:09] tracycodes: Dynamic variables  LUL
[4:59:21] WoofWoofDude: @Giantwaffle Isn't just what modders do with upgrades ? like speed or stack upgrades
[4:59:26] BONBONNIE13: monkaHmm
[4:59:28] daemonaedryn: Build a dyson sphere YEP
[4:59:33] jake_gt_: Yo
[4:59:34] Kavokane: @Giantwaffle Good concept, the other balance is not to expand into too much tech breadth progression. That gets annoying too.
[4:59:36] cartloyal123: Feed the beast remake eh?
[4:59:46] Crazyfox55: sounds like the easiest
[4:59:48] masztufa: oooh, original FTB
[4:59:50] MiraPacku: space elevator drone ship drops PogChamp
[5:00:53] PapaJazTv: But here's the thing..Could you still use a comodore 64 for a single simple part of your daily running business?  yes. Does it make any sense? not at all because there are 1000 better options
[5:00:53] BONBONNIE13: susHmm what if I keep it taking 10 times as long so I can build my own monument monkaHmm
[5:01:25] pikabuhhh: just create a mod that sets the theme for a modpack and adjust mods around that as you progress?
[5:01:45] FroZenThai: Just a random thought. dangerous environmental world and the monument increases the safe area until the entire world is clear.
[5:01:54] MiraPacku: could be a recycle feature, or multiblocks monkaHmm
[5:02:05] MiraPacku: oh yea, you gonna put in special mobs?
[5:02:07] masztufa: man, you need to play blightfall
[5:02:12] ItsME_Harvey: reverse of pollution
[5:02:16] MiraPacku: monkaS cvHazmat ?
[5:02:22] masztufa: you will also see the problem with that approach
[5:02:24] Star579: You don't make modern computers with the same tools used to make the commodore.

[5:24:05] richie385: Where you not getting a lot of power from the fusion reactor I thought that’s what is was for
[5:24:24] Azafure: no power
[5:24:45] grimmn: it only generated ~2x the amount of power needed to keep its electromagnets running
[5:24:53] masztufa: also, have you played seablock (factorio)?
[5:24:53] daemonaedryn: Honestly I think the Fusion Reactor is a pretty bad part of this pack, it feels like the next step in energy but is essentially a large crafting station

[6:06:41] TheWarGoddess: hey could have just fallen out of love with each other
[6:06:51] Archelonde: If I want money to go to a charity im donating it myself, not to a streamer's charity of choice.
[6:06:52] Orin_The_Sly: I reccomend to anyone, If you ever want to donate, Donate DIRECTLY to the Charity I.E. St.Judes. Not Joe Blow on his Charity Stream
[6:07:14] Chickinlegs: how much power did the reactor end up generating ?
[6:07:34] MiraPacku: NODDERS
[6:07:34] richie385: The hair one is a scam aswell they sell the hair and make like 5 wigs a year for people who need it
[6:07:37] daemonaedryn: And people who dont want to give to charity might decide to donate to a streamer
[6:07:40] punkgeek: Child's Play and Extra Life are both pretty good with how they spend their money
[6:07:45] BlancoPollito: #saveGiantwaffle
[6:07:48] Troupster: I misspoke, her sister Nancy Brinker is the bad person, Susan G Komen is the one who died of cancer, and I retract my statement, the foundation is dogshit though
[6:07:51] SnackableGames: Yogscast are the charity kings
[6:07:58] Troupster: apologies.
[6:08:05] mechoriet: depends how that streamer has it setup if you want to do it monkaHmm like is it via his donations then mass to them or via a charity site thing but only notifications linked
[6:08:05] Nilau: Handing over the collected charity money must feel insane
[6:08:16] SnackableGames: Any jinglejammers here?
[6:08:24] Orin_The_Sly: Right, Like "Redacted" is doing his St.Judes month right now "Redacted" is giving ALL the money to St. Judes. I d onated to him.
[6:08:31] MiraPacku: NODDERS very wholesome
[6:08:46] daemonaedryn: A lot of trust in a streamer needed for that
[6:08:48] MiraPacku: monkaHmm
[6:08:51] BaseMouseTV: There's GDQ
[6:08:55] TexxLive: there are still streams like that, sadly

[6:09:20] mechoriet: monkaHmm like lud?
[6:09:32] mechoriet: i mean he already had a big sum
[6:09:38] bugsplatter23: why?  the original contributors aren't claiming them.  Should giving not be claimed?
[6:09:47] TimmyVRC: Weird intentions but in the end you're still giving to charity
[6:09:53] daemonaedryn: Imagine how massively our society would change if suddenly we were incapable of lieing to people.
[6:09:56] mechoriet: don't think it would have mattered in the end
[6:10:15] Chickinlegs: how much power did the reactor end up generating ?
[6:10:16] mechoriet: yeah only the last day or something would go there
[6:10:19] Wozatron256: 1 dollar per sub he donated
[6:10:23] daemonaedryn: @Chickinlegs Like 40k rf/tick
[6:10:34] K3ll06s: But isnt the income taxes greater then charity benefit of donating? Never worked that out on paper
[6:10:37] brankomir: @Giantwaffle how was ludum dare ?
[6:10:39] SnackableGames: Who cares. He earned it, and the charity benefits.
[6:10:42] Chickinlegs: @DaemonSzyman thank you
[6:10:53] BaseMouseTV: I think a lot of streamers donate because it helps build thier community, and they have more money than they know what to do with

[6:12:47] Wozatron256: @mechoriet yah it was on friday
[6:12:48] Chelovekokek: scala is better java haha
[6:13:00] Pitje_: Pretty much everything is better than Java
[6:13:01] WoofWoofDude: which also opens the door to depression :)
[6:13:04] mechoriet: kotlin just compilles too java in the end tho KEKW
[6:13:05] masztufa: matlab > anything else
[6:13:07] TheSavageCoder: Anything on the JVM is better than Java sadly
[6:13:17] kymset: What about flutter which is made by google?
[6:13:19] TheSavageCoder: @mechoriet It compiles to JVM byte code
[6:13:33] DecoyOcelot: @Giantwaffle VIP bet you need 30 more
[6:13:34] kymset: Which is the dart language
[6:13:42] Hunter_Boone: javascript doesn't use the jvm
[6:13:47] WoofWoofDude: @mechoriet that's the point.. using a "better syntax" to do the same thing in the end.. no idea how kotlin is better
[6:13:51] masztufa: ye, that's java
[6:14:07] Deflate__: might have to learn kotlin then
[6:14:09] mechoriet: @WoofWoofDude maybe only readability ?

[6:14:18] mechoriet: @WoofWoofDude never used it tho KEKW
[6:14:19] masztufa: there are memes about getting dual monitor setups so you can see the entire method name, so...
[6:14:34] WoofWoofDude: @mechoriet same
[6:14:36] Pizzzaking21: java is a whole paragraph just for an input-output method
[6:14:39] mechoriet: @TheSavageCoder so basically AOT compille for kotlin?
[6:14:52] nxusr: Wat is a 4min talk. https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/wat
[6:14:57] ZyianDev: ^
[6:15:08] masztufa: ooh, can you link that "language quirks" video? I think i saw that but can't find it

[7:32:24] AleXanDreMau: KEKW
[7:32:27] calebhub514: KEKW
[7:32:30] Wazix11: you should get those diamonds from mining with the diamond pick
[7:32:33] Wazix11: I think
[7:32:34] DaChibi: Importer/Exporter is basically a block breaker/placer. It breaks anything.
[7:32:34] daemonaedryn: Damn they're really making you work for it huh
[7:32:35] omar_i_: the pickaxe should get u more diamonds
[7:32:38] DecoyOcelot: your gonna need more for sure
[7:32:42] Aurielli: dont you have a lot of crushed coke?
[7:34:16] Wazix11: every diamond pick, if it has unbreaking 3, should get you about 60 diamond nuggets @Giantwaffle
[7:34:21] DarkKnghtt58: well if you're able to enchant that diamond pickaxe, it should give you plenty of diamond nuggets no?
[7:34:22] Moobot: You can find Waffle's Youtube channel here - https://youtube.com/giantwaffle

[7:35:00] Silver_Skeeter: you can spawn slimes
[7:35:03] kisudawisu: also youd have to keep making unbreaking 3 picks
[7:35:14] ZOZE55: @Giantwaffle can you automate it so that it will work by it self without you puting or moveing things to get diamonds ?
[7:36:23] N3rvrackD: @giantwaffle didnt you make that XP upgrade thing for thermal expansion?
[7:36:37] DecoyOcelot: desh is pretty good KEKW
[7:36:46] N3rvrackD: the specialization that makes an XP farm basically

[7:37:09] Wozatron256: trap wither in ceiling
[7:37:10] WGG25: hold shift to pause it?
[7:37:11] Igneous3: make a platform so you can punch its legs
[7:37:28] Wazix11: I think an unbreaking 3 diamond pick would yield 4 bedrock pieces
[7:37:32] Wazix11: if I did the math right
[7:37:46] Wazix11: 6000 ish uses
[7:37:50] UECNSNemesis: 1/.00069*27

[7:38:00] Nexhunter: oh boy my company got bitched out by our big client KEKW

[7:39:55] R1Rider01: @Borlaq convert % to decimal
[7:39:56] WGG25: he adds the extra 2 zeroes to turn it from percentage to actual amount
[7:39:58] OhTick: @Borlaq its 0.069%, which is 0.00069
[7:39:58] grimmn: 0.069% = 0.00069 as a decimal

[7:45:16] Wozatron256: smelt stone is probably the easiest
[7:45:44] MrWizard1974: Bottle of enchanting?

[7:45:54] jchillin707: iron furnace? @giantwaffle

[7:49:43] Wozatron256: It will just stay in the collector right?
[7:50:19] Wazix11: you can get rid of 2 caches then right?
[7:50:54] alotron_: @Giantwaffle Did you take a look at the infuser thingy from thermal expansion? There is an upgrade for it which should allow you to repair items with RF.
[7:50:54] Moobot: Support Waffle by using his Epic creator code: Giantwaffle
[7:51:00] Igneous3: chicken room
[7:51:06] Azafure: You had 4 levels already LUL you got like 2 bars
[7:51:12] Wazix11: you should be able to let it extract automatically but it still stores xp so when you manually remove an item it gives all the xp
[7:51:17] booth8604: @Giantwaffle im pretty sure you can auto extract the stuff and it will store the levels
[7:51:21] TheSparMan: does that exp work in a redstone furnace? will make it easy
[7:51:33] Wazix11: no @TheSparMan
[7:51:45] Wazix11: at least not that I remember
[7:52:13] aman36000: @Giantwaffle Furnaces are I sided
[7:52:25] Aurielli: conuits?
[7:52:29] Wazix11: you have to put items in the top
[7:52:34] MADodds: you'll need access to the top of each furnace to insert cobble
[7:52:49] Wazix11: back access is the fuel slot
[7:52:53] MOJAD0: Smelting 1 cactus is the same xp as smelting 10 stone
[7:52:58] booth8604: @Giantwaffle with ender io i believe you can put coal and stone in the back iirc
[7:53:39] DaChibi: Logic Cables can input into selected slots.
[7:53:55] Wazix11: @Giantwaffle cactus farm into furnaces is best xp
[7:54:09] Wazix11: cactus gives 1 xp per while stone gives 0.1
[7:54:22] kisudawisu: cant you pick up the cobble and wood caches and replace them with empty caches?
[7:54:41] RodriCraft93: damn i was gone for 20' and we almost hit 3400
[7:55:23] WGG25: do a stairway like shape
[7:55:35] Wazix11: bottom is extract
[7:55:58] Wazix11: right, Im saying you cant input in the bottom
[7:56:09] Evoti: yuo can use power ones
[7:56:19] Bloodridger: redstone furnace give xp

[7:57:00] Troupster: yes you're shadow banned
[7:57:12] ruccoa: Yup, sorry bud
[7:57:17] DecoyOcelot: F
[7:57:18] Borlaq: @Giantwaffle In Vanilla, the XP is stored in the furnace untill you extract 1 item manually. No mather how many stacks you have actually extracted with a hopper, so it will just bank it.
[7:57:18] sogerr: @N3rvrackD yes
[7:57:27] WGG25: has anyone seen N3rvrackD around? i swear he's banned
[7:57:36] Aurielli: how many diamond nugs?
[7:57:37] Nexhunter: god damn I am sad 68% gain since I bought into eth and I had put $700 into normal stonks that day and only $100 in crypto biotoxzSadge
[7:57:38] Troupster: yeah havent seen him in ages @WGG25
[7:58:07] Zonear: You can extract automatically with hoppers from the furnace and it will keep the experience, then block the hoppers with a red stone signal like a lever on the furnace and manually extract some stone to get all the experience the furnace currently holds
[7:58:19] N3rvrackD: just making sure my messages are going through, I swear there was a sword upgrade thing for a machine and it might make XP easier? unless it needed Morbs
[7:58:24] Aurielli: alert notice went out for tomorrow, but not an evac notice hmm
[7:58:39] Troupster: @nex I sold my ADA at 1.40 and bought the dip at 98 but split it 50% btc 30% eth 20% ada feels pretty pog
[8:00:03] Nexhunter: @Troupster even more alt than eth is sketch for my still but biotoxzSadge so many gains left on the floor cause I valued dividends over longer term

[8:01:54] R_U_S1rius: yep
[8:01:54] DecoyOcelot: there is also an augment version for secondary outputs
[8:02:14] DecoyOcelot: yes

[8:03:25] complexprotein: @Troupster I've been wanting to split my 100% BTC holding half into ETH, but I don't want to realize those gains, but at this point it would have already paid for the tax KEKW

[8:04:34] lalashkin_G: Every 60 minutes in Africa an hour pass
[8:05:04] Ras2709: @Giantwaffle why not just repair the dia pickaxe???
[8:05:09] gunthler: wat do pepega meen? Pepega
[8:05:31] ChetSteadman_: monkaHmm
[8:05:40] Azafure: @Ras2709 Because most of the tiems it costs the same to repair as it would to replace
[8:05:58] omar_i_: mending to repair isn't it?
[8:05:59] kisudawisu: same enchant upgrades
[8:05:59] Silver_Skeeter: no that is just to level up the enchant
[8:06:02] R_U_S1rius: so every desh pick gives a dia pick as output?
[8:06:04] WGG25: are there repair machines?
[8:06:10] TarMonA: why not with a raw diamond??
[8:06:12] maiph_: waffle doesnt know how to minecraft any more
[8:06:13] Ras2709: i mean you can just repair with exp?
[8:06:16] adkampy: is there an anvil that repairs based on energy?
[8:06:29] passthewater25: no you dont, you can repair enchanted pickaxes with normal ones
[8:06:42] RodriCraft93: any pickaxe with no enchantment
[8:06:52] Aurielli: this is soooo complicated
[8:07:05] navalship55: You can repair an enchanted pick with a regular in an anvil, but you could also use a diamond itself
[8:07:07] MrWizard1974: why not just repair with diamonds?
[8:07:11] Silver_Skeeter: but you should do it with an unbreaking one
[8:07:11] Surge43: PepoThink

[8:09:26] aman36000: waffleD
[8:09:28] TarMonA: cant you use ingot to repair ??
[8:09:29] Wozatron256: it gets exponential after every time you repair in cost of levels
[8:09:31] Wazix11: it takes more levels the more you  do it, so one pick can only get repaired a few times before being too expensive
[8:09:35] boomerbrown: yeah but you csn only do that so many times @Giantwaffle
[8:09:58] aman36000: @Giantwaffle Its very cheap if u name your tools
[8:09:59] RodriCraft93: 3400 wall achievement @Giantwaffle
[8:10:14] BuffManKyle: can you make enchanted books in a machine? i was able too in a different pack
[8:10:19] kisudawisu: Clap
[8:10:23] Wozatron256: good for good enchants but for unbreaking 1 not worth
[8:10:23] WGG25: can't you just "repair"/transfer the enchant to a new pick with the same cost every time?
[8:10:44] Wazix11: no
[8:10:44] Aurielli: it was at +8% when you started
[8:10:49] Ving3fyr: Almost 21000DKK :D
[8:10:53] RodriCraft93: $400 in 1 day
[8:10:59] s7tungsten: 100% cash rn feelsbadman
[8:11:04] Wazix11: @WGG25 it uses the unenchanted pick as a repair item
[8:11:07] DecoyOcelot: A Nether Star gets you mending KEKW
[8:11:15] Amraki: enderio enchanter?
[8:11:16] osamagate: Eth = 3422
[8:11:21] navalship55: Cant you repair items using the energetic infuser with an augment from thermal dynamics?
[8:11:27] WGG25: @Wazix11 even if it's in the first slot in the anvil?
[8:12:03] Wazix11: @Wazix11 pretty sure that either doesnt work, or it repairs the unenchanted pick
[8:12:17] passthewater25: @navalship55 That augment needs liquid xp to function
[8:12:23] kisudawisu: im surprised there isnt a way to get xp better
[8:12:24] Bitterhusky: Bitterhusky subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 21 months! 
[8:12:30] Silver_Skeeter: with lvl 30 enchants it's really ez to get unbreaking 3
[8:12:31] nomaddd19: o
[8:12:42] ItsOnMax: o
[8:12:49] WGG25: @Wazix11 i know for certain it transfers the enchants, i just don't know if it gets more expensive
[8:13:02] Amraki: this pack have enderio enchanter?
[8:13:14] Aurielli: no
[8:13:24] Ras2709: cant you cook something better than cobble for exp? like cactus?
[8:13:26] Amraki: ah ok
[8:13:27] OhTick: how many diamond nuggets so far?
[8:13:50] Goldenlion5648: any plans for next pack?
[8:13:51] Weras57: KEKW last day
[8:13:53] Aurielli: check the nuggets dad
[8:13:58] srgp2015: cap
[8:13:58] Ras2709: did you complete the glitches?
[8:14:08] Aurielli: Pogdog
[8:14:13] navalship55: @passthewater25 alright, but it doesn’t need other resources just energy and exp, and an exp farm with liquid esp shouldn’t be to hard
[8:14:31] aman36000: @Giantwaffle Go ahead and repair the pick?
[8:14:32] Wazix11: do you have more nuggets stored already?
[8:14:41] Wazix11: 2nd pick time Pog
[8:15:05] Kevincav: Neat, my flight school is doing the GI bill now so free flight training
[8:15:10] Wazix11: the first repair should only be a couple levels
[8:15:18] OhTick: i think you need more picks before you start repairing
[8:15:40] Aurielli: just get another Unbreak 1
[8:16:03] Azafure: It only costs two
[8:16:11] adkampy: always check the other enchants at lvl 1 cause you can get unb 2

[8:16:26] mcgirly629: hi
[8:16:27] Wozatron256: any bedrock?
[8:16:33] Azafure: You need to have 3 levels but it only takes 2
