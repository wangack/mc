[0:59:58] Cetsuo: factorio is like dakka

[1:05:11] rosariaa___: @jellyfish_rights thats on another character :p
[1:05:30] NeutralQuartz: Curious how survival mode will work as the game definitely requires some fast travel. More so than Fallout and Sktrim as POIs are so are so far apart.

[1:18:54] thecolde: All romantic comedies are usually deeply dysfunctional and terrible advice
[1:19:06] checkemtest: are they explaining incels too
[1:19:42] NeutralQuartz: I prefer some basic filters over just being dropped into a giant dating pool.
[1:20:12] thecolde: When everything is just a swipe away, it's easy to be super picky
[1:20:13] emelgeepreaux: what other depressing topics can we talk about?

[1:21:52] NeutralQuartz: Absolutely no blemishes is a good tell for AI, excluding aesthetic ones.
[1:22:03] HowToBeQuiet: She started flossing and Daltos just ghosted.
[1:24:08] thecolde: Daltos, please. This is just too sad
[1:24:13] HowToBeQuiet: What
[1:24:17] Sanyiel: zoeyTeehee
[1:24:23] jake2500: @HowToBeQuiet oh man. I read that as flossing her teeth. I'm so old lolipFP

[1:27:53] Flashgo1: i remember the yogcast back when it was just 2 guys messing around on minecraft
[1:28:00] NeutralQuartz: is lolip still planning to do that LoL bait stream LUL ? I remember shadow mentioned it.
[1:28:05] ApatrosMiner: theColde honorary member of the yogscast

[1:29:12] thecolde: Dota 2 4 LIFE

[1:29:25] NeutralQuartz: LoL has cuter chars and that's end of story for me NODDERS
[1:29:42] NeutralQuartz: and better lore
[1:29:47] thecolde: @NeutralQuartz But Dota has balance
[1:30:17] jellyfish_rights: i miss the dota in-house league so much

[1:30:54] jellyfish_rights: lolipLUL i love daltos so much
[1:30:56] thecolde: I knew Daltos would go there
[1:31:12] HowToBeQuiet: LoL and DotA? I'm top 50 world ranked Candy Crush, you casuals.
[1:31:17] Cetsuo: denying creeps is like 30% of dota though
[1:31:35] thecolde: @HowToBeQuiet My condolences to your credit card
[1:31:37] NeutralQuartz: This reminds me of those "professional" minecraft pvpers who raged when they removed the nuanced spam clicking
[1:31:45] Lilly_1337: LoL is a toxic saltpit

[1:32:24] EverPopularKat: What? You're supposed to have fun with games?
[1:32:24] elastichedgehog: LUL
[1:32:39] Glendening: I have the same problem with LoL as I have with Overwatch. I can only handle being told to [redacted] myself so many times before I don't want to play anymore.
[1:32:41] thecolde: @EverPopularKat Not with Dota 2
[1:32:42] jake2500: Pyrion is online now, wanna drag him in? Kappa
[1:32:42] fr00tch0p: ...
[1:32:45] BlueKnight866: lolip is girlboss, daltos is gatekeep and lewis is gaslight
[1:32:48] jellyfish_rights: he's just baiting lol
[1:32:54] RedSnt: I mean Daltos isn't completely wrong. Just look what happened to gaming when Sims found out they can just print money by carving up the enterprise selling a gazillion DLC's
[1:32:58] Lilly_1337: ragebait LUL
[1:33:00] thecolde: I love this
[1:33:01] Visstix: the fact that you call it candy crush games instead of bejeweled games makes you a toxic gamer
[1:33:01] NeutralQuartz: There is something to be said about making games for smaller audiences. Not every game has to be for everyone.
[1:33:08] thecolde: Next you should discuss tipping culture in the US
[1:33:32] NeutralQuartz: it was sorta true, and it was hilarious
[1:33:39] HowToBeQuiet: Ah so Dota was feeding instead of jungling
[1:33:41] jake2500: @thecolde Don't get me started
[1:34:00] NeutralQuartz: redirecting the stats site felt like an IRL shitpost
[1:34:25] thecolde: @jake2500 oh, as a regular Daltos viewer, we've had repeated discussing with Daltos, he is consistently wrong
[1:34:46] Glendening: A game doesn't have to be good to have a lot of people playing it. Skinner boxes and FOMO are things.
[1:34:49] NeutralQuartz: Lore in LoL is interesting
[1:34:56] Cetsuo: @thecolde he is but sometimes there's a nugget of truth here and then
[1:35:01] Glendening: Or as I say "Destiny 2, I hate it. It's my favorite game."
[1:35:04] NeutralQuartz: Dota is meh lore wise
[1:35:06] HowToBeQuiet: "Their #1 game in the world kinda sucks, yeah. Trust me."
[1:35:07] Lilly_1337: all the K/DA stuff was a stroke of genius by riot

[1:35:35] checkemtest: now you have play a series a games you don't like for subs
[1:35:39] Sanyiel: yogNO
[1:35:47] justfloof: I wouldn't say beeing a community manager at League would be a life of luxury tho LUL
[1:35:49] thecolde: Daltos integrity is worth more than the entire Daltos
[1:35:49] jellyfish_rights: idk i'd kinda want my community managers to play the game they manage for
[1:36:12] galactictee: lmao lewis
[1:36:17] Jeffru_: league of legends is for people that already play it, i never recommend people to play it
[1:36:27] Jeffru_: new player experience is dog shit
[1:36:38] elastichedgehog: That's MOBAs generally
[1:36:39] emelgeepreaux: I think MOBA's are just bad
[1:36:42] thecolde: @Jeffru_ To be fair, that is also true for Dota 2
[1:36:51] galactictee: lollip is trying to fight with daltos' whole persona
[1:36:52] RedSnt: I tried learning it, spent like 100 hours in the game - didn't get a single moment of fun out of it
[1:37:01] Cetsuo: lmao
[1:37:03] jellyfish_rights: knowing how to play league is a hindrance in dota because a lot of the habits league teaches you aren't applicable
[1:37:10] emelgeepreaux: but the DEVs wont ignore them!
[1:37:13] galactictee: daltos whole personality is hating ari aster
[1:37:20] emelgeepreaux: no, Daltos is right
[1:37:25] thecolde: @galactictee It's great
[1:37:33] Flashgo1: battlefront series
[1:37:34] NeutralQuartz: WoW
[1:37:34] Cetsuo: @jellyfish_rights it's almost as if they are two different games
[1:37:51] galactictee: the thing
[1:38:18] Glendening: That is a lovely spaghetti base you have.
[1:38:21] Cetsuo: we havent even mentioned that LoL doesnt have a turn rate for champions LUL
[1:38:22] jake2500: LUL
[1:38:31] galactictee: MOMS ARE SCARY
[1:38:35] jellyfish_rights: everyone knows the cornermom
[1:38:38] curiousCephalopod_: curiousCephalopod_ subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 60 months! now talk about hereditary daltos

[1:39:10] Glendening: Horror is looking into a dark cave in Minecraft, unable to see anything, and not walking in due to what you imagine is in there.
[1:39:12] ApatrosMiner: @HowToBeQuiet yogLog
[1:39:19] justfloof: Poltergeist was the first horror that gave me sleepless night as a kid
[1:39:24] Flashgo1: there was a scifi horror back in the 60's that still scares people today
[1:39:26] HowToBeQuiet: @ApatrosMiner I SAID IT
[1:39:34] jake2500: @HowToBeQuiet that's a great burn. I'm stealing that
[1:40:32] jake2500: Lewis rn: so ... factorio?
[1:41:03] HowToBeQuiet: 'Die Hard' and 'Miracle on 34th Street' were the exact same movie because they happened duing Christmas.
[1:41:03] Glendening: Just quietly doing the work in the background.
[1:41:17] Cetsuo: Daltos always picks the right point of discussion but always has the worst opinion
[1:41:27] BlueKnight866: @jake2500 when lolip (and daltos i guess) go into the movie rabbit hole, nothing else exists
[1:41:31] Cetsuo: which is why i enjoy listening to him
[1:41:51] Cetsuo: it's like he has foresight but is blind
[1:42:07] GabeTheProgrammer: blumhouse used to be fire
[1:42:17] checkemtest: lewis already does this podcast
[1:42:20] Cetsuo: Lewis: "We live in a society"
[1:42:26] Indelacio_co_uk: we're living in a society
[1:42:46] Glendening: Remember Maxis? Or Westwood?
[1:43:00] justfloof: The irony is. There's more choice than ever, but im watching less than 15 years ago
[1:43:10] Glendening: I want more smaller game devs.
[1:43:34] Doccymad: This is cheerful
[1:43:34] emelgeepreaux: creativity is being destroyed
[1:43:43] Jimbo_Slice093: p-p-pandering companies
[1:43:53] dogfood__: That's working with the assumption people don't seek out what they enjoy
[1:43:54] HowToBeQuiet: I just want the three characters to sit around a little table and stop building entirely and keep debating film theory.
[1:44:12] Mlarns: I agree with daltos
[1:44:14] Glendening: Monetized, sanitized, and designed by committee.
[1:44:38] Glendening: Looking at my 3k hours in Factorio. Looking at that smelter line. Giving a thumbs up while crying.
[1:44:40] wowisthatGami: daltos is the new don draper

[1:46:34] Glendening: "It just works"
[1:46:52] jellyfish_rights: i love A24 from the standpoint of someone who doesnt watch horror; a lot of really good films are being made that otherwise wouldnt have the budget or means to really
[1:47:18] RedSnt: This is now a Yogscast board meeting
[1:47:21] Glendening: My brain is just screaming "ratios!!!" while I just smile and nod. Almost everyone starts with pasta bases. You can absolutely beat the game doing so.
[1:47:59] ApatrosMiner: I think daltos is just saying that things could be better, not that everything is bad
[1:48:46] justfloof: So at what point will new generations of people get used to data creating mindless movies and games and our generations that knew what originality used to be dissapear
[1:48:49] Glendening: Dopamine go brrr.
[1:48:59] Mlarns: Thats a good way of describing it
[1:49:40] jake2500: assBEN
[1:49:42] HowToBeQuiet: "I'm immune to jumpscares because I'm dead inside. Checkmate."
[1:49:57] Mummsi_: !followage
[1:50:08] Glendening: I wish more people knew the difference between horror and startling.
[1:50:41] Glendening: A jumpscare is not horror. Can it be a part of horror? Sure. But it isn't by itself.
[1:51:05] RedSnt: DLSS upscaling is already kind of like the graphic card "dreaming" up the extra resulotion @justfloof - just a matter of time
[1:51:15] Jimbo_Slice093: Horror is something where you go to sleep and still see that image or theme
[1:51:31] pinewood_mist: a24 is trash, just leddit big brain bait
[1:51:37] Glendening: A creeper blowing you up is a jumpscare. Looking around with paranoia for creepers however...
[1:51:40] GabeTheProgrammer: put algorithms in business decisions XD
[1:52:09] Doccymad: I love most a24 movies I've seen xD

[1:53:08] jellyfish_rights: i love being unsettled; i dont like being scared
[1:53:12] jake2500: It seems like everyone loves A24 except Daltos. So the system is working great (except for Daltos).
[1:53:12] Glendening: There is something ironic about the biters blowing up the wall making assemblers.
[1:53:23] Doccymad: The Green Knight is really good
[1:53:29] jake2500: LUL
[1:53:30] EvoIon: you say they are boring but they continue to make them because there is an audience for it right?
[1:53:34] HowToBeQuiet: I bet the Biters love A24 movies
[1:53:37] Pirithous1: hi
[1:53:46] pinewood_mist: @Doccymad FeelsWeirdMan bruh
[1:53:50] Pirithous1: pirithGiveMeSomeLoves

[1:55:22] Pirithous1: what is "men"
[1:56:05] RedSnt: I love black and white. Not for the sake of it, but it's like it removes distractions. M from 1931 is excellent. I also like the Danish movie "Voksne Mennesker" aka "Dark Horse" from 2005
[1:56:11] Glendening: I don't like horror things myself. Over produce adrenaline. So I get sick afterwards.

[1:56:56] pinewood_mist: that snl wes anderson skit
[1:56:56] jellyfish_rights: parasite rules
[1:57:00] HowToBeQuiet: "The Borrowers" is a home invasion movie.
[1:57:20] HowToBeQuiet: omg "Monsters Inc" is a home invasion movie.
[1:57:34] Glendening: Phasmophobia is a home invasion game.
[1:57:43] jake2500: @HowToBeQuiet lgioGasp
[1:57:45] OddVariety: I caught an ad. Was The Purge on that list?
[1:57:46] jellyfish_rights: a24 had nothing to do with parasite, but i can see why you'd think they did

[2:00:51] Glendening: Factorio. Back to me internally crying and yelling at my screen.
[2:00:59] justfloof: Dark times maybe, but I do miss the cable tv days where there were like 1-3 good movies a week on or something
[2:01:33] Glendening: Make this, that makes more wall. It needs more resources. So get those. Now you can make more walls. Which need even more resources. So you...
[2:01:44] pinewood_mist: @justfloof like brink!
[2:01:49] Glendening: "Why do I have 14 steel chests full of walls?"

[2:05:44] Glendening: Well done. Quality A++
[2:06:27] justfloof: What is the penalty for dying in this game?
[2:06:38] Glendening: Technically the pollution is feeding the biters. But they are making the pollution. So.. still works.
[2:06:44] Glendening: The penalty is having to walk and get your stuff.
[2:06:55] Nightjar: oh god
[2:07:01] Indelacio_co_uk: I heard "I managed to sedate someone"

[2:07:25] justfloof: @Glendening Do you lose your stuff if you die again getting it?
[2:07:32] Indelacio_co_uk: royalty with a shark
[2:07:42] Glendening: @justfloof No. But your body does have a despawn timer. I believe.. 5 minutes?
[2:07:53] Glendening: The shark is the plush.
[2:08:10] HowToBeQuiet: Anyway they're a millionaire scuba diver.

[2:09:17] wowisthatGami: smooth
[2:09:18] Steephv: look Lewis, if she doesn't appreciate that, she's not for you
[2:09:22] GabeTheProgrammer: won the lottery matching with you instead of reply wouldve been better
[2:09:27] GabeTheProgrammer: hindsight
[2:09:46] Glendening: I need to go waste money on the lottery tonight. Yay brain chemicals. And only for $2
[2:09:48] Visstix: that's calling both of you boring lol
[2:09:50] Nightjar: Nah, doesn't sound cringey as such. Just makes you sound a little nervous
[2:09:56] Nightjar: Exactly
[2:10:01] Indelacio_co_uk: true
[2:10:10] Nightjar: Notifying
[2:10:25] Glendening: Dating apps and websites are awful. There is no feedback to why you get rejected or ghosted. So you don't know how to get better.
[2:10:33] bang_di: You gotta pretend you don't like them, that's a super turn on hatMilk
[2:10:42] redburd: people just want to get their foot in the door though
[2:10:58] Glendening: Though sometimes when there is "feedback" it is just awful stuff. Which leads to people blocking first to prevent such things.
[2:11:10] Nightjar: If that response came naturally to you, then I think it's fine. If the other person doesn't like the response, the date probably wouldn't go great anyway
[2:11:38] Nightjar: But I am also forever alone by choice so LUL my dating advice needs a whole serving of salt with it
[2:11:54] Glendening: Some people are really picky about height differences.
[2:12:09] jake2500: Everyone just skipping over the fact that loads of matches are just scam bots
[2:12:12] mondomg: sure Daltos COPIUM
[2:12:21] Glendening: Woo. 5'9.?"
[2:12:24] nolo418: It’s not about size
[2:12:29] Nightjar: To reach the high shelves
[2:12:31] Nightjar: duh
[2:12:33] GabeTheProgrammer: it's the marketing of guy's height
[2:12:34] HowToBeQuiet: There's logistical concerns.
[2:12:45] Nightjar: To reach the low shelves
[2:12:47] bang_di: hatShook
[2:13:02] Nightjar: bobsEw
[2:13:03] thegreatmoleofthenorth: Says the guy who only dates girls under the drinking age
[2:13:06] jake2500: oh no

[2:16:03] justfloof: It's surpsingly normal now to date a cougar. Just a few people who haven't caught on too it yet lol
[2:16:04] thegreatmoleofthenorth: The weird and wonderful dating life of Daltos.
[2:16:09] HowToBeQuiet: Today's Topics: "Mobas, Movies, MILFs"
[2:16:11] cajunkitsune: lolipLove
[2:16:12] Nightjar: @Visstix if both parties are aware of what's happening and why, I don't see an issue with it tbh
[2:16:27] thecolde: Is Daltos now praising Logan?
[2:16:36] galactictee: openly mean
[2:16:41] SpecialK_852: being mean and honest is way better LUL
[2:17:18] Glendening: Being mean without being hurtful.
[2:17:26] Nightjar: I'd legit go for a sugar daddy/mama at this point in my life if they weren't going to expect something physical/romantic in return yogS I'm happy to go to the cinema with them and make tea but apparently the kink of giving me money in exchange for nothing is few and far between FeelsBadMan

[2:18:59] justfloof: The npc trend on tiktok is cursed
[2:18:59] Nightjar: shoving their kids into shelves while they have a master bedroom
[2:19:10] Glendening: If you ever attempt van-life, don't buy a fixer-upper. Get a nice one you can upgrade. Fixers are just holes you pour money into.
[2:19:14] bang_di: I'm fairly sure Lewis already has a van for his hobby
[2:19:14] HowToBeQuiet: Vanlife is just Crossfit after your roommates kick you out for being weird about Crossfit for so long.
[2:19:26] SpecialK_852: i only hate that now the price of vans has skyrocketed because of it
[2:19:31] cajunkitsune: It's too weird for me
[2:19:33] Nightjar: van-life away if you're an adult and have the money/need to, but dear god, please don't take kids with you NotLikeThis
[2:19:56] NuclearSlayer52: i thought you meant mental breakdown and not a physical vehicle breakdown
[2:19:58] RedSnt: Poor Nilesy
[2:20:06] Glendening: A friend of mine wants to do the camper van when he retires.
[2:20:06] HowToBeQuiet: During Lewis's 'Thrill Kill' years
[2:20:06] thecolde: "If you can't handle me at my worst, you don't deserve me at my best" is probably the biggest red flag there is
[2:20:19] Nightjar: I did see a good van-lifer parody though NODDERS and a good mini documentary about the harm of vanlifing on kids
[2:20:21] ViceyThaShizzle: Some Scottish guy turns up at Yogtowers in a Bongo.
