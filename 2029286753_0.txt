[0:43:23] Idifee: Based on Minecraft days it's Linkzzey > JonBams > jamal_

[0:43:48] somelucky_: so, they're new minecraft players that just don't know any better other than the youtube videos they've watched
[0:43:49] ZukoIsAlone: I think people just like hearing the numbers. not necessarily if they mean anything
[0:43:50] Spookmans: kinda like how human age doesn't say anything about how mature or smart they are but ppl kinda do assume that
[0:43:51] c00lboi73: FUCK VANILLA !
[0:43:54] JarlVarl: Taneesha should be close
[0:43:56] 4tw0ne: there needs to be an algorithm to properly calculate the "age" of a minecraft world, taking into account things like game time played, times slept, etc

[0:53:54] StardustDragon08: @StardustDragon08 This is factually incorrect. Eggs sold in stores are not fertilized nor will they become so. Don't spread misinformation

[0:54:24] Denbrew: i havent seen many streamers getting the ban for dmca recently im sure it will be coming soon jonbams
[0:54:28] Ogre_Plush: that's why I stopped playing music on my streams. NODDERS

[0:54:54] bu1dak: people are getting banned for that now
[0:54:58] JayoRed: Yea its scary all the way around
[0:55:07] Denbrew: its such an outdate law right now
[0:55:11] StardustDragon08: DMCA was supposed to be a shield, now it has been turned into a sword Sadge
[0:55:14] BornNaked2: gachiBASS "Breaking the law, breaking the law!"
[0:55:15] b0redm4n: They act like bc they can't be caught in the act they can get away with copyright
[0:55:17] JayoRed: "One false move" lol
[0:55:27] bu1dak: temp bans of course, but still Twitch is trying to enforce it

[0:56:14] DeePick: that must be why I played D3 so long... WHIRLWIND BARB FOR LIFE
[0:56:15] bu1dak: I prefer coco pebbles
[0:56:18] mafackinwyll: @StardustDragon08 Store-bought eggs can be incubated if they are whole, uncracked, and appear to be healthy1. However, most store-bought eggs cannot hatch because they are unfertilized2. This is especially true if they come from farms where only hens are present and there are no roosters to fertilize the eggs before they are laid3. Farm-bought fertilized eggs, on the other hand, can hatch, except in certain situations such as if they are refrigerated3. straight from google.
