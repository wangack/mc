[0:11:43] Exerion09: Stack it!
[0:11:47] JBourden: oh our boy bn3 then
[0:11:52] Ghost0447: it said 3 in the tweet right?\
[0:11:59] UltraScientism: @BoooFN: exactly, a stainless steel silo KEKW
[0:12:02] FenixTheSnolx: Nope it's BN3 100 percent, bn2 is a tiny test tank
[0:12:14] Ghost0447: bn2 is a test tank\
[0:12:36] JBourden: i wanna see the booster land nvm starship lol
[0:12:40] zynithtv: tech companies cant count KEKW
[0:12:41] UltraScientism: I think they actually scrapped them
[0:12:45] FenixTheSnolx: Elon us weird with naming schemes
[0:13:03] Crazyfox55: They made bn1 for sure
[0:13:23] Exerion09: To the Moon!
[0:13:25] BobPatience: cranes are cooler than rockets cohhSip
[0:13:27] Apparentthreat: @Giantwaffle wym not really? "XAEA-12"
[0:13:28] UltraScientism: they made parts for them and then scrapepd them
[0:13:42] JBourden: bn1 was just to figure out how the assembly goes
[0:13:54] JBourden: that aft dome is wild
[0:14:26] FenixTheSnolx: We think they're still going for 28 engines based on the methane manifold
[0:14:29] JBourden: thrust puck?
[0:15:17] JBourden: how many tons per minute KEKW
[0:15:41] kjx1: big ass crane
[0:15:42] Exerion09: The future is here :D
[0:16:16] FenixTheSnolx: I hope they have good views of the ship reentry
[0:16:17] JBourden: its gonna be a show
[0:16:20] podwe: do u follow Daz at Boca Chica? https://www.twitch.tv/dasvaldez
[0:16:41] Pict1on: is there a "ton" in the imperial system ?
[0:16:42] skokpo: yeah something is definitely gonna fail

[0:16:47] espi: that's a big crane
[0:17:11] JBourden: monkaS
[0:17:15] skokpo: Wtf monkaS
[0:17:33] podwe: M110000 is a big crane
[0:17:33] Moobot: You can find Waffle's Youtube channel here - https://youtube.com/giantwaffle
[0:17:38] Apparentthreat: how long are those crane segments?
[0:17:50] JBourden: i see they also got that elevator installed
[0:18:06] AtchTwoOh: have you seen the recursive liebherr cranes?
[0:18:06] leafeey: are they using this to catch superheavy
[0:18:42] podwe: do u know why the struts are the wrong way? i mean they face down rather than up?
[0:18:48] espi: imagine being that crane operator
[0:18:51] skokpo: yeah because if bn2 fails it would destroy lots of facilities
[0:18:51] ike2ike: VolumedDeadike subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 36 months! 
[0:18:53] leafeey: hmm, I'm thinking if they use trial error method, it's gonna crash a few times
[0:18:55] FenixTheSnolx: They will catch super heavy with this tower, until the catch system is ready they will do soft water landings. Booster will never have legs
[0:18:59] JBourden: wonder if works are curently being preformed on the oil rigs
[0:19:01] MrPooter: crypto red monkaHmm
[0:19:24] Driitzz: BOP
[0:19:24] skokpo: if they try landing it on land and it fails*
[0:19:36] CoolReal: It's going to be a very big boom

[0:20:20] kjx1: wtf
[0:20:20] Pict1on: just imagine the amount of energy/thrust this will generate

[0:20:49] Mini___1: pop that badboy in miata
[0:20:56] espi: "super simple"
[0:21:00] captain_chew: That is a lot of thrust LUL
[0:21:05] JBourden: i wonder if the center gymbals as a cluster or individually
[0:21:09] FuzzyOmega: That's like KSP level builds
[0:21:26] Exerion09: There's no way that doesn't blow up first attempt haha
[0:21:27] a_brink: I’ll show you thrust
[0:21:36] podwe: has to be fake as its too much ejsaDragon ejsaKerbal
[0:21:38] a_brink: nb3Gasm
[0:21:47] skokpo: are they the same engine they use for starship ?
[0:21:55] podwe: thts Ultra Heavy LS
[0:22:00] christiansen95: much engine, very thrust
[0:22:02] herritic1: KEKW
[0:22:03] JBourden: how much does that picture cost to realize LUL
[0:22:12] bEC69_: there are CARS at the bottom pepeLaugh
[0:22:14] 4729_zex: what stage is this?
[0:22:18] thomasausen: the big crane lifting the small crane
[0:22:40] a_brink: Just 26 million
[0:23:01] Nexhunter: unrealistic for a company
[0:23:03] FenixTheSnolx: Have you seen this reentry render PogChamp https://twitter.com/AlexSvanArt/status/1397672098479366152
[0:23:06] Nexhunter: not for a government timmacLAUGH
[0:23:11] JBourden: man hours of 26 engines oof
[0:23:51] CoolReal: If it gets to the ocean
[0:23:56] Nexhunter: if they don't need all 26 engines to relight burning then should be good
[0:24:00] MrPooter: So what ship is this for? The name?
[0:24:02] Siyrax: ikr
[0:24:05] Asneakyninja1: you have pizza as well? soarynNom
[0:24:16] CoolReal: Unsalt the ocean to save te engines
[0:24:19] JBourden: well the first ones going to hawaii or some shit isnt it
[0:24:20] 4729_zex: do you think starship can lower the price to 10$/kg
[0:24:28] UltraScientism: probably only center ones gimbal
[0:24:51] MrPooter: Whats the name of this ship? Or the ship this will go in to?
[0:24:52] 4729_zex: it's 1700$/kg
[0:24:55] 4729_zex: lowest
[0:24:59] Trilex: they have to smelt Alot of titanium Kappa
[0:25:00] Asneakyninja1: yeah 10k per kg would be insane
[0:25:06] FenixTheSnolx: Outer engines are basically just on and off, no throttle or gimbal but massive thrust. They're called rboost
[0:25:07] Sander20011: What is that image?
[0:25:08] Asneakyninja1: oh
[0:25:13] LordDynom: Per m^3?
[0:25:14] Asneakyninja1: rooThink
[0:25:24] LordDynom: Or per ton?
[0:25:26] DuckyBert: For example, the SpaceX Falcon-9 has a cost per kg of around $2,500 to low earth orbit, whereas the much smaller Rocket Lab Electron rocket has a cost of around $22,000 per kilogram
[0:25:32] Asneakyninja1: with how many F9 launches there have been maybe its true?
[0:25:33] AleXanDreMau: @Giantwaffle hows crypto doing today ?

[0:25:59] AtchTwoOh: https://www.futuretimeline.net/data-trends/6.htm
[0:26:00] Traupick: 8000
[0:26:00] Asneakyninja1: that's 4T to mars transfer orbit
[0:26:16] Asneakyninja1: ~23T
[0:26:16] JBourden: wait wut f9 can reach mars??
[0:26:20] skokpo: They can probably afford to do that thanks to fixed prices
[0:26:26] 4729_zex: $2,720 per kilogram falcon9
[0:26:28] skokpo: fixed costs*
[0:26:32] JBourden: dang son block 5 aint playin
[0:26:49] Asneakyninja1: @JBourden almost any rocket can get a payload to mars, the difference is how big that payload can be
[0:26:49] DuckyBert: The cost of just getting a kilogram to Mars varies, but Mars Curiosity cost about $2.47 billion to land an 889 kilogram rover on Mars, for a per-kilogram cost of approximately $2.78 million/kg.
[0:26:50] Trilex: waffle should go mining for them Kappa
[0:26:53] herritic1: Damn, that's pretty good!

[0:27:48] 4729_zex: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_launch_market_competition
[0:27:53] MrPooter: @KhaosSlayer1 Is starship the ship that will take the engine we just saw?
[0:27:55] Durabull: Happy Birthday @Phantm9
[0:27:57] Asneakyninja1: waffleHeart
[0:28:05] NevaDaha: I just ordered pizza PETTHECUTIE
[0:28:07] Venxuri: hiiiii HeyGuys
[0:28:17] Asneakyninja1: now compare that to SLS (which is somehow ahead of schedule which is awesome)
[0:28:20] innvisX: with starship we can build a titanic in space
[0:28:24] nxusr: @giantwaffle at these prices, we can have “twitch plays cubesat”
[0:28:31] Asneakyninja1: in terms of payload capacity
[0:28:33] Asneakyninja1: rooGasm
[0:28:44] Nexhunter: that is def too true KEKW
[0:28:48] AtchTwoOh: wasn't the calculation for falcon 9?
[0:29:02] dcel82: @Giantwaffle would you go to mars on the first rocket if able?
[0:29:03] CoolReal: 650 dollars per person
[0:29:09] MrPooter: @Giantwaffle Is starship the ship that will take the engine we just looked at?
[0:29:17] JBourden: KEKW space shuttle
[0:29:17] Asneakyninja1: thinking about it, $10 per kg feels too low... how much does the fuel cost to fill the starship and booster back up?
[0:29:21] nxusr: I’m telling you, twitch plays cubesat is the meta we need to unlock
[0:29:26] skokpo: Starship 10$ KomodoHype
[0:29:28] Sander20011: what is vanguard?
[0:29:29] UltraScientism: these prices are not "clean". Some of it is probably subsidized by the governments etc.
[0:29:36] Asneakyninja1: o
[0:29:40] Asneakyninja1: radiantNotes
[0:29:43] Bombdog1244: Makes me wanna build spaceships
[0:29:49] 4729_zex: this just show how revolutionarry spaceX is
[0:29:52] FenixTheSnolx: Starship launches will cost 6-8 mil roughly

[0:30:24] CoolReal: Sold my ADA, can't wait for it to jump to 2 euros now that I sold it :)
[0:30:28] Asneakyninja1: yeah i bet it'll be much lower than F9 for sure
[0:30:39] MrPooter: why you guys selling?
[0:30:40] 4729_zex: the goal is to get below 1000$
[0:30:49] DuckyBert: Sadge meh
[0:30:59] Asneakyninja1: stonks go brrr
[0:31:01] Ghost0447: wait so for 2720 i can shoot 1kg of my shit into space
[0:31:03] Asneakyninja1: soarynFine

[0:31:17] CoolReal: I lost 1%, I'm fine
[0:31:23] shinigami312: triple day weekend?
[0:31:37] skokpo: Do you think companies and labs are already starting developing payloads that could be in starship ?
[0:31:50] Nexhunter: the folks who had a good day are the folks who held onto AMC from the initial shenanigans and were awake this morning to sell KEKW
[0:32:18] UltraScientism: some Pog space telescopes
[0:32:19] xtherapie: waffleHey
[0:33:01] innvisX: watch nasaspaceflight they live streaming the tower its getting huge
[0:33:13] CoolReal: Mining time PogChamp
[0:33:16] UltraScientism: James Webb started construction in 2007
[0:33:21] Asneakyninja1: we live in a great time for space regardless

[0:33:42] herritic1: that thing is cruising
[0:33:51] FenixTheSnolx: This is a shell, it goes over the current tanks
[0:33:51] CoolReal: Poor tires
[0:33:51] Nexhunter: speaking of rovers Lockheed and GM have started development of a new lunar rover danHmm
[0:34:01] kjx1: RC car
[0:34:10] herritic1: Yeah, its like a huge RC car KEKW
[0:34:10] Asneakyninja1: yep pretty much KEKW
[0:34:15] MrPooter: Imagine they fuck up monkaS
[0:34:18] merscever: don't mind me just moving sn15 with an xbox controller
[0:34:28] kjx1: complant
[0:34:48] Nexhunter: no
[0:34:50] Nexhunter: they had no money
[0:35:06] SodiumDoggo: they already did no?
[0:35:08] Nexhunter: so the NASA budget didn't have enough to move forward with two companies although it was supposed to be two companies at once
[0:35:09] 4729_zex: Blue origin is losing right now
[0:35:37] Nexhunter: Sen. Cantwell wants to up the budget and get a second selection for the program but they would have to restart the full process
[0:35:42] Ghost0447: but lets be real, we saw the launch prices why would you not choose spacex
[0:35:49] Nexhunter: Sen. Cantwell is a senator from Washington
[0:35:53] merscever: don't think the trial will impact nasa budget much
[0:35:55] FenixTheSnolx: Yeah, it won't go anywhere, but the Cantwell amendment is concerning
[0:36:03] Ghost0447: and we can see how realible spacex is
[0:36:04] podwe: also @giantwaffle do u have permission to stream LabPadre? they're pretty heavy handed with it tbh
[0:36:05] Asneakyninja1: seeing the recent talks and hearings they MIGHT be willing to put more money into this all, the house at least
[0:36:05] Nexhunter: NASA just didn't have the budget to go with both options is the main issue
[0:36:08] 4729_zex: jeff really want to steal from elon KEKW
[0:36:18] MrPooter: Hyped for the ufo report?? @Giantwaffle
[0:36:42] Exerion09: I thought they said the price was the determining factor
[0:36:50] Math354e: spacex was the only one they had money for
[0:36:55] Nexhunter: @MrPooter bokeh ma dude KEKW
[0:37:33] innvisX: bezos dont wanna put more of his own money Kappa
[0:37:41] moon_monk1: complacent
[0:37:41] FenixTheSnolx: SpaceX had the highest score in ever category, so they were chosen. SpX was also cheapest and the only choice NASA could afford
[0:37:42] brewerdc: Complacent
[0:37:43] bedbuggies: complacient?
[0:38:03] Sander20011: SpaceX also doesn't have to deal with the government
[0:38:06] The1_TS: IBM is the worst
[0:38:12] Exerion09: ^ yep lol
[0:38:13] Nexhunter: @FernTheSnolx the afford is the main point but they were supposed to select two companies so there is backups
[0:38:14] Kylexyz003: intel and apple are the largest
[0:38:19] Liquighost: haha iphone go big
[0:38:22] vordican: but the launch business was mostly state run players. the innovation was being private and making it work
[0:38:36] podwe: complacement
[0:38:38] Nexhunter: IBM is not your dad company now timmacLAUGH big blue is doing shit consumers will never see or care about
[0:38:40] UltraScientism: But what's there to add to a phone? Their chips themselves are top notch.
[0:38:50] nesse007: you have tesla ev cars same as appel
[0:39:02] MrPooter: competition fuels inovation
[0:39:05] sleepymisaki: the fun part is AMD copied at first the Intel chips etc
[0:39:08] Asneakyninja1: BrAnD LoYaLtY
[0:39:10] Exerion09: AMD probably just focused on talent, on the long game
[0:39:12] Asneakyninja1: radiantShrug
[0:39:12] ro6ch: except dark souls
[0:39:15] Nexhunter: @nesse007 tesla gotta get their shit together now with Ford actually making a good truck for folks KEKW
[0:39:21] Meat_Skirts: Dude, what you just said about not innovating, i feel that but about some big streamers. Timthetatman is a good example. Amazing streamer, cool guy, but what has he done new in the past 3 years??? Streamers that innovate grow!
[0:39:23] herritic1: How big is that tank?
[0:39:29] 4729_zex: yup KEKW
[0:39:30] Nexhunter: like bidirectional charging is fucking huge with the F150 lightning timmacLAUGH
[0:39:33] Nexhunter: it already happening
[0:39:36] FenixTheSnolx: @nexhunter NASA could select 0-3 options, the main reason SpX was chosen is because they gave the best lander, money wasn't the main reason. They outlined that decision in they're report
[0:39:36] MrPooter: @Nexhunter lmao whats bokeh?
[0:39:46] K4shira: agree
[0:39:52] merscever: f150 is the turning point for market
[0:39:56] herritic1: its so funny to see something the size of a small building just rolling down a road
[0:40:08] 4729_zex: why?
[0:40:10] brewerdc: 10k towing
[0:40:11] JacobSolo: Did you see the new mkbhd on the lightning?
[0:40:14] brewerdc: lbs
[0:40:15] Asneakyninja1: fun fact, it was because of Tesla that Ford was able to make the F150 Lightning as epic as it is. all because Elon sold them a Model S a few years back for like a buck because he wanted competition @Giantwaffle
[0:40:17] Liquighost: EV mean electric vehicle?
[0:40:17] zynithtv: missed the beginning of the conversation but did you hear about tesla removing radar from the model 3 and Y
[0:40:18] Nexhunter: bidirectional is a fucking huge thing
[0:40:24] K4shira: and also ppl want a reliable car that is fixable. and Tesla's are neither LUL
[0:40:29] 4729_zex: yeah everyone is making car now KEKW
[0:40:30] Nexhunter: timmacLAUGH available
[0:40:33] FenixTheSnolx: The f150 lightning is more expensive and less capable lol
[0:40:40] Exerion09: What are they going to do about batteries?
[0:40:42] UltraScientism: I read today that Tesla's roadester with SpaceX package is going to have cold air rocket engines. KEKW
[0:40:44] MrPooter: okok, you've convinced me. Im buying ford stock
[0:40:50] Nexhunter: @Giantwaffle don't forget bidirectional charging so that you can power your home from the truck without needing to buy a powerwall and other crap timmacLAUGH
[0:40:53] Venxuri: are you buying?
[0:41:02] slyjedi: Michael burry who was one of the short sellers from The Big Short - holds a short position on Tesla expecting them to fial
[0:41:08] Tabakhase: may go as far as not call it failed - but "done"... - "elon doesnt rly wanne sell cars, he just wants to push EV"
[0:41:11] MrPooter: buy me one :)
[0:41:12] Nexhunter: @MrPooter a lense effect when dealing with apetures and that jazz
[0:41:12] KillaKelso: self driving only worth it for highway driving
[0:41:15] LMNTRX92: waffleHey
[0:41:17] BlueConfetti: Buying a new car KEKW
[0:41:26] dasmako: owning a car is 9000% better just maintain it. it's cheaper
[0:41:29] Venxuri: I drive a Fiesta Pog
[0:41:29] JacobSolo: I have an F150 and wanted to ge tthe cypbertruck, but this new F150 is looking very promising
[0:41:31] bedbuggies: dont even go out that often KEKW

[0:41:37] kjx1: what is it
[0:41:39] dasmako: I gotta change my high pressure fuel pump today cause I tuned my car KEKW and it's going out on me
[0:41:40] camertime: Self driving is gonna be just like 5G. “Everybody wants it!” Then it releases and nobody wants to pay. Also telsa is not good for cars - they’re fun for tech. Their build quality is shit hahaha
[0:41:40] diverse114: ill rather have an old car then new. The classics still rocks
[0:42:04] Nexhunter: the ability to power the home from the truck is so big especially for folks that live in areas where owning a generator might not be common place
[0:42:09] BONBONNIE13: 1969 Dodge Challenger Kreygasm
[0:42:12] LiL_LiLi_ALi: What car it is ?
[0:42:13] UltraScientism: theay are not very good in car accidents
[0:42:21] indicaSalad: Mach1  Kreygasm
[0:42:25] zynithtv: i want an old car and just gut the interior and bring it up to the 21st century
[0:42:28] Asneakyninja1: okay okay hear me out, a friend pointed this out.... when the Lightning comes out you are for SURE going to see body swaps if the chassis mount points are the same and they look to be
[0:42:31] Sandiro1: Where is the weeb livery waffle
[0:42:32] LiL_LiLi_ALi: What car do you have ?
[0:42:39] FenixTheSnolx: it's 12 m wide
[0:42:41] skokpo: is that a tank ?
[0:42:42] Asneakyninja1: we might see old truck body swaps onto the lightning chassis

[0:43:05] Harrierfalcon: i just want an electric car with the 65-75 car style
[0:43:06] jiivey: I think people do want actual full self driving. What they don't want is where it is at right now.
[0:43:08] SpeedGolf: Kebab Friday here
[0:43:22] camertime: Commercial applications of FSD are more exciting than anything else.
[0:43:25] camertime: I agree.
[0:43:34] Nexhunter: the F150 is a perfect fleet vehicle
[0:43:38] Harrierfalcon: no\

[0:43:50] FenixTheSnolx: Yes, the lighning is literally more expensive
[0:43:51] herritic1: heck no
[0:43:52] vordican: deff no
[0:43:57] Grumbagz: has the Cybertruck been officially delayed or is it still slated for end of this year/next year?
[0:44:00] vordican: as long as charging takes longer than filling a tank it won't happen
[0:44:02] Tabakhase: well see about availability KEKW
[0:44:04] davethulhu: form factor
[0:44:07] Harrierfalcon: people like the current truck looks
[0:44:08] Nexhunter: the truck bodies, and also the amount of power outlets
[0:44:09] slyjedi: part replace would be resdicoulous
[0:44:09] UltraScientism: Tesla doesn't provide replacement parts, so you can't do repairs yourself
[0:44:12] shoes6699: I work for the a state Gov. and all we have are Fords
[0:44:13] Nexhunter: 240v, and 120v outlets mehdiGASM
[0:44:14] JacobSolo: iirc Ford has a special lightning model for corps
[0:44:17] RaedTihsAigan: What if the cybetruck ends up being cheaper though? I think that will matter more than anything...
[0:44:19] PossibleScam: I think the lighting will be a hit.
[0:44:21] n8level: rednecks gonna lift their f150s 2ft in the air - can you do that with the cybertruck?
[0:44:23] ro6ch: isnt cybertruck a meme car?
[0:44:27] Apparentthreat: who tf said lightning was more expensive?
[0:44:28] Nexhunter: @Giantwaffle don't forget the power outlets on the lightning
[0:44:31] 0omkins: F150 Lightning is kind of insane - it can power your house for like 3-10 days (if you ration appliances)
[0:44:34] BlueConfetti: Can't wait to get my cybertruck dbrand
[0:44:37] dasmako: YEP

[0:45:07] BennyF_Jr: @Giantwaffle did you see that the EPA rating on the lightning is with 1k lbs in the bed?
[0:45:10] Mapleton: wafflePoint waffleT3 waffleThink
[0:45:14] PossibleScam: Battery not confirmed yet though.

[0:45:24] Tiggaboo: 4
[0:45:27] Asneakyninja1: all we know is that the 300mile range estimate is when there is 1000lbs in the bed @Giantwaffle , some reviewers recently saw there was an estimate 360~ with 80% charge
[0:45:30] Nexhunter: the 240v is going to be great for construction fleets
[0:45:36] twiQsP: @ThemDemo what reason did they have to hate?

[0:48:09] Tasar_: ATV
[0:48:11] Nilau: In Germany we say "Combi und Anhänger"

[0:49:15] Liquighost: the cybertruck needs tank tracks widePepeLaugh
[0:49:17] Garzilla: @Apparentthreat That's my view on it, i wonder why they actually bought it? Do they think trucks have some sort of status symbol or something?
[0:49:21] MiraPacku: that crane is so big KEKW
[0:49:21] Nexhunter: TBH having a lightning would be cool for bike trips

[1:18:10] brunosousa20: @Nexhunter not for my wallet ahah
[1:18:10] ForgottenTime: I just rented a van when I bought my wood
[1:18:11] shavinglove: I aam still looking at a $5000 used F150
[1:18:14] vordican: so what... you are gonna man mode the appliances out of the bed of your truck?
[1:18:14] Soultiger777: truck > van 10000%
[1:18:16] dasmako: if you aren't using it all the time it just depends
[1:18:21] meduimdockplays: vans are just made for parents with children

[1:18:39] Mapleton: I want a Ford ranger :(
[1:18:39] Soultiger777: vans are more for kids right?
[1:18:40] n8level: @orangecreamsicle3 not if its just a load or 3, cost of a new truck >> rental for the day
[1:18:40] CtrlShiftR: renting or delivery for one time stuff

[1:19:02] Houdini_Seven: you need a truck 1% of your life.
[1:19:03] originade: towing range is poor,  but its decent otherwise
[1:19:04] Nexhunter: this is actually utilitarian unlike say a F150 raptor KEKW
[1:19:13] Pa3n0x: kind of funny how everything working related in US is trucks but in EU its Vans
[1:19:20] Mandorake: @Giantwaffle I tried to by 12 foot baseboards and there are literally like 10 total in the DFW metroplex
[1:19:22] Apparentthreat: Nexhunter but you can jump a raptop Kappa
[1:19:24] Apparentthreat: raptor

[1:19:32] barbill_: I have a truck. Use it all the time to haul shit.
[1:19:32] dr_Griff: What advantage does a car have over a truck? Why do you need a reason to buy a truck but not a car?
[1:19:40] exo_pho3nix: Honestly I think a clean and tidy vehicle is better and much more attractive then an expensive one
[1:19:42] Offwing10: The Ram TRX tho monkaSTEER
[1:19:45] SmoothBlizzard: it kinda wierd that in EU we can live without trucks
[1:19:45] orangecreamsicle3: I am in training for electrician so having a truck is a must
[1:19:49] UltraScientism: It's probably possible to find some rubber like mat for an SUV, and that would accommodate most dirty cargo
[1:19:49] Mapleton: Better off buying land and your own mill for lumber
[1:19:57] AIex_0: Its cause they don't sell F150's in the uk

[1:20:29] dabeda1: trucks are often times way to wide and long for EU roads
[1:20:37] dabeda1: and parking is hard
[1:20:38] Apparentthreat: to be fair, a van is better for lots of things
[1:20:40] Pa3n0x: ofc it is, Vans are so much better for electricians and pluimbers. At least most of the people in EU think that way

[2:37:01] Simuil: Last night when I was taking photos of the moon I caught star link satellites in the images, sucked
[2:37:12] coolcake2: windows 8 is like windows 10 that accidentely got pushed to pruduction in the early stage
[2:37:17] Fourseason_: @Simuil Some would argue the presence of the satellites are more important but any image stacking software will get rid of them
[2:37:21] dexdiman: Is this an ad for the soyuz or oneweb. lol.
[2:37:47] richie385: @DatBlindArcher what that made no sense in my brain
[2:38:13] dexdiman: I know they're just talking up the soyuz a lot
[2:38:15] Simuil: @Simuil Not when the string of satellites are as long as the star link trails, like 1 min of a streak
[2:38:17] DatBlindArcher: @richie385 windows 8 was just a blasphemy of all OSes ever.
[2:38:19] Ycrems: the Russian rocket was Pavel Bure and he didn't look like that

[3:25:15] Moobot: If you find that Waffle's stream is glitching, lagging, or rubber-banding, try turning off "low latency" in the stream settings and/or switch the stream resolution off of Auto. This issue is on Twitch's end.
[3:25:31] Cyberwire69: same ish LUL
[3:26:15] CarlWheeser: it still doesn't get too fast though
[3:26:18] Venxuri: just higher pristine chance

[3:26:52] ParAd0xA: @Giantwaffle In order to use the ender pearls for Pulsating matter you need to be in the MV age
[3:27:17] K4nteh: @Giantwaffle : to find urinite, u can buy it with omnicoins and then search them with ur detector
[3:27:17] DecoyOcelot: you can fully automate polymer clay with cobble and pearls. uraninite is not useful after that
[3:27:23] Venxuri: no, you can use a transformer
[3:27:25] CarlWheeser: the best data model has a 42% chance of pristine
