[2:21:02] DaddyDiddy: i have a draconic injector setup as well waffle if you need that
[2:21:37] Morlega: You can surround the 4 sides of each interface, to double it
[2:21:40] Mike190Twitch: blocking mode will make sure that hte recipes get split between machines
[2:21:43] Morlega: not that interfaces are expensive
[2:21:46] Mike190Twitch: technically you can do 4 machines
[2:21:46] TheSpeedGames: I love being an adult, just ate 8 average cinnamon rolls for lunch
[2:21:57] DaddyDiddy: i just put xp on the side with a fluid export bus
[2:22:00] slornfoot: Once you get the creative chest doesn’t that get rid of a lot of these problems?
[2:22:01] Mike190Twitch: probably fluid conduits
[2:22:02] DaddyDiddy: and i have liquid xp on my tank wall
[2:22:14] Ardrago: does it make sense to just queue up some of the stuff you will need that is going to take long? like the draconic stuff? @Giantwaffle

[2:28:00] heistleague: whay?

[2:32:05] Zucate: Swocoom creative tank on each one
[2:32:06] primo_qwe: use export bus, its really fast
[2:32:07] That0neGeye: It can only use so fun Xp at a time
[2:32:11] Saishu_: creative tank + fluid lasers
[2:32:12] buji_bujinson: can't you creative tank exp?
[2:32:39] DaddyDiddy: yeah i did it the way i did because I already had liquid xp on storage bus but if a tank with conduits is faster, definitely do that
[2:32:42] Morlega: Remember the memory card
[2:32:56] deadgolfer: <message deleted>
[2:33:14] Morlega: Memory card would've made setting up the export busses easier I mean LUL

[2:38:42] That0neGeye: Copy paste
[2:38:43] cmmeth: 4 days COPIUM
[2:38:44] Koeckie: you do you have 2? don't you need ust one interface, each?
[2:38:45] thePier: get the input side for the liquid xp too, not just the interfaces
[2:39:03] skignas: cant you copy machine settings with something
[2:39:44] BookNerdTim: Did we win?
[2:39:50] wickedmetal: interesting to see that you guys have unlimited resources but still need to setup stuff for the endgame
[2:40:13] Morlega: Aren't you using too many interfaces?
[2:40:29] inforv: Are the Loot Fabs stuck?
[2:40:53] Morlega: A soul binder should only touch one interface. Not sure how AE2 will handle one machine having two interfaces with identic patterns. Might end up queueing uselessly
[2:40:56] IveBeenWandering: what if you setup 1 interface, 16 DML, all exporting to that 1 interface?
[2:40:58] Twin5un: Hello ! I missed last nigh, how's the infinite power ? @Giantwaffle
[2:41:02] noxiiiouse: hows clay looking ?
[2:41:14] Provision_: @wickedmetal well issue is time. they need to scale and speed up a lot to finish in what, 4 days?
[2:41:25] DaddyDiddy: waffle it took me a few min but I built a multiblock loot fabricator that can keep up with the simulation supercomputer @Giantwaffle
[2:41:27] cmmeth: the issue is time
[2:41:38] kbigLiar: i like how we only need half the interfaces here

[2:41:48] DaddyDiddy: yeah i just made it into 1 block
[2:42:00] Morlega: @Giantwaffle you sure you want 4 columns of interfaces instead of 2? I imagine if two interfaces try to use the same machine, it might insert ingredients twice, might deadlock perhaps
[2:42:09] thexvar1able: captured mode on spawner with bottles I think for bat soals
[2:42:16] Koeckie: @Morlega thank you
[2:42:19] IveBeenWandering: @Giantwaffle what if you setup the recipe to 16x, 1 interface and exporting round robin to all?
[2:42:23] DaddyDiddy: like a multiblock that looks exactly like the sim supercomputer, just took me a few min to write the code lmao
[2:42:23] deadgolfer: test it
[2:42:30] JordyOnTheForge: Cant you use the powered spawner with a bat to make more bat soul vials?
[2:42:34] Morlega: I don't think blocking mode works across interfaces
[2:42:36] Twin5un: TBH seeing how far you made it into the pack, i'd stay you are done
[2:42:37] Ras2709: speed upgrades?
[2:42:55] sam1390: being made somewhere else?

[2:43:02] deadgolfer: set input face

[2:43:09] deadgolfer: for xp
[2:43:12] KnightofObv: middle ones are not
[2:43:16] thePier: you are missing liquid XP input face
[2:43:24] deadgolfer: set input face for xp

[2:44:34] Zapper_777: You should be able to make a extra row soul binders on the ME interface to get more out of the setup?
[2:44:37] Moopoop: near main old terminal
[2:44:43] Morlega: Regardless, having one binder touch two interfaces is at best useless, at worst dangerous
[2:45:04] omar_i_: old setup is not set to blocking mode?

[2:50:52] Zornd: Go look at the old chicken machine for fun
[2:50:53] teddiii_: You're in a strange stage when ghast tears is an easier option than leather
[2:50:56] deadgolfer: put it on the list
[2:50:57] JordyOnTheForge: Cant you use a powered bat spawner to fill soul jars?
[2:51:16] fbritoferreira: Sound like you need a new dml room kinda like the v2 of it
[2:51:26] thecodealive_original: you can craft bat souls
[2:51:42] WestsideGecko: In the meantime queue up the 4-5 Tier 10 drones @giantwaffle

[2:56:30] oggec99: does it have a story ?
[2:56:31] Dogd93: I have 600 hours on Factorio. Not one hour on unmodded. lol
[2:56:31] mrkaszkeit: I know, i played a bit of it years ago on cracked version but i like to buy games if i rly like them, its just pisses me off that prize was increased for 'inflation reasons'

[3:05:51] MoshiMoshi0: what does that mode do?
[3:06:14] ExumeTV: literally makes it self torture
[3:06:14] coolcake2: No DML for easy infinite resources Omnicoins can't be spent The Steam Age No Creative Tank; instead... Stabilized Micro Miners for late-game infinite resources Harder recipes for assorted things like Iridium, Graphene, Numismatic Dynamos, and more
[3:06:17] cmmeth: it's called self torture ... so masochists probably like it
[3:06:20] TheCairon: doesnt Self Torture Mode have stabilized microminers tho?
[3:06:23] Jaydepps00: i can only imagine the ME cable highway you'd need to support the late game
[3:06:28] KyleTheRose: What is DML?
[3:06:34] InternetPlumber: constantly having to build / move mining stations
[3:06:47] coolcake2: burh imagine no CREATIVE TANK

[3:32:53] HuntingButcher: Check the orb?
[3:33:05] boogerbomb01: third hatch?
[3:33:09] StingrayNine: COPIUM
[3:33:11] SebastiaanO: try the lasers
[3:33:13] Bernd135: Maybe you need to connect more output from the core into the cables
[3:33:17] TrevorVictrus: the lasers or whatever
[3:33:18] lvyEartman: th output is maybe too little?
[3:33:22] Purecrew: You need power lasers
[3:33:25] Yohan460: You’re limited on your connection back to the org

[3:33:41] Ras2709: use the gregtech inf power siurce on it???
[3:33:41] BookNerdTim: Can you add moar hatches?
[3:33:45] IveBeenWandering: downgrade Sadge
[3:33:46] Yohan460: Multiple connections at the power converter won’t help
[3:33:47] SwiftAffliction: cables are the bottleneck
[3:33:48] Starmetal_: maybe more output connections one the orb
[3:33:51] Askjong: just add more power
[3:33:58] stickman_02: you might need to put more cables extracting from the orb
[3:34:02] Purecrew: Oh outputting from the orb
[3:34:12] Yohan460: You need a higher bandwidth cable
[3:34:17] Bernd135: The output from the ball needs to be bigger
[3:34:17] BookNerdTim: Also noting that, I'm thoroughly enjoying this mod pack
[3:34:18] Moobot: You can find Waffle's Youtube channel here - https://youtube.com/giantwaffle
[3:34:18] officialhunterx: conduit is at its max?
[3:34:20] Yohan460: Or run a second line
[3:34:23] BookNerdTim: Fun to watch
[3:34:28] Purecrew: The output from the orb is to low
[3:34:32] SeanTKE: wireless power transmission from draconic is higher
[3:34:33] sofalord_: what cost another infinite power source?
[3:34:35] Yohan460: You need to run a second line back to the orb then
[3:34:42] boogerbomb01: laser power!
[3:34:47] wagad: Can you put ender and dragon in?
[3:34:48] Yohan460: Laser it up
[3:34:48] SwiftAffliction: 130mil is not enough for all machines on 16amp
[3:34:49] Gh3ttoboy: time to start sticking creatce rf cells on eahc machine
[3:34:50] lvyEartman: the output from the orb is maybe bottleneccked
[3:34:52] SwiftAffliction: not even close
[3:34:53] grid_space: the super conductors can do more right?
[3:34:53] Zapper_777: Make 2 ;D
[3:34:54] EpicTitan232: Still lot slower
[3:34:57] Ras2709: @Giantwaffle how about useing the creative gregtech power source on it?
[3:35:03] stickman_02: can you put a 256 hatch on this??
[3:35:03] wicked_north: what is this? can someone in the chat tell me in few words what am i looking here??
[3:35:07] tony_rex666: dedicated rf gens?
[3:35:09] boogerbomb01: You need enough to switch to using lasers!
[3:35:17] Yohan460: Lasers bro
[3:35:26] tomey36: The more you make the less hearts you will have for the creative chest.
[3:36:06] Wazepas: Yes
[3:36:08] omegaura: yes?
[3:36:09] boogerbomb01: Yes, using lasers
[3:36:09] lvyEartman: kasjdfhksjdfhyes

[3:36:10] Askjong: yes
[3:36:14] AnesthesiaFC: powaaaah
[3:36:15] Purecrew: I promise its your output from the orb thats the problem
[3:36:18] Yogithebaer: just put a creative rf source on it
[3:36:21] Zenimer: What about just making and connecting a creative rf to it
[3:36:27] officialhunterx: void drawer

[3:37:13] Kr0nosTV: you are limited on the connections on the output side of the orb wiith how much power actualy enters your cable system
[3:37:30] kbigLiar: 3k dragon layer data per heart? SeemsGood
[3:37:38] DemonsDawn: too bad there isnt a loot fabricator multiblock
[3:37:50] Ras2709: power is dieing

[3:38:04] TonyWhite4554: hey friends
[3:38:06] Francisco_Scaramanga: susHmm
[3:38:30] CoolReal: RF only
[3:38:34] tswizizles: I think it can
[3:38:35] Morlega: susHmm
[3:38:41] officialhunterx: its rf only
[3:38:49] kennethhh: @giantwaffle Can you always output 130m rf per cable even tho theres is 10 machines on that one cable using 10m each?
[3:38:52] TrevorVictrus: I mean if it can do infinite rf then it'll cover the energy converters
[3:38:55] LastSajin: Could there be a conversion block? or something similar ?
[3:39:06] norocketscience1: use draconic superonductors? the cable thingys from gt

[3:39:41] officialhunterx: hook up to orb
[3:39:51] Morlega: You're way better off using draconic wireless energy crystals
[3:40:08] Morlega: Draconic Evolution's Wireless Energy Crystal system is very high throughput
[3:40:13] Gotizie: time for the book
[3:40:17] daedmissica0: book time
[3:40:17] officialhunterx: draconics wireless energy
[3:40:17] lazyhot: Those crystals are mostly OP wireless power
[3:40:18] ricdesc26: wireless energy
[3:40:21] omar_i_: yeah
[3:40:21] CaptainAlkohol: yes you want those
[3:40:22] boogerbomb01: porbably
[3:40:27] Morlega: It's like the lasers Pati is trying to use, but very very high throughput
[3:40:29] Zucate: "I want this Pati" now waffle is sounding like Ci
[3:40:31] ZyianDev: They have no limit from DE
[3:40:35] Morlega: Hmm billion RF/t? Not sure, but close
[3:40:35] DemonsDawn: it can empty the entire energy ball in a tick (it cant)
[3:40:46] meller127: arent there a cover for energy?
[3:40:47] realtimematrix: check the draconic handbook
[3:40:49] lazyhot: need recievers etc if i'm correct not sure in this pack
[3:40:52] Morlega: I haven't used the Draconic version, but the Wyvern is already very fast
[3:40:59] chaoskub: It's insane
[3:41:00] daedmissica0: get the book
[3:41:01] TheAgentNZ: what does the draconic book say?
[3:41:16] Morlega: I'll quickly look it up, there's a table somewhere
[3:41:21] DemonsDawn: read what i said between the brackets
[3:41:25] SeanTKE: it doesn't transfer power it just instantly provides it its as though you hook right up to the source
[3:41:34] Francisco_Scaramanga: Amogus

[3:41:41] ZyianDev: Unless they forked the mod, the code for those energy crystals, the limit is basically what goes through it. Essentially limitless
[3:41:51] Yogithebaer: nbt issue
[3:41:55] omar_i_: legacy code KEKW
[3:41:56] AlbinoPeanut: wrong terminal it has 10 inputs
[3:42:07] StingrayNine: does the recipe hold enough items? it was 10 items recipe has 9
[3:42:09] Morlega: Draconic I/O crystal can hold 64M which I think limits it to 64M RF/t. You can link multiple wireless ones (also 64M/t per crystal) to the same block though
[3:42:21] xSascha1337: KEKW

[3:43:04] tswizizles: Oh shit ur in the hub?? I go to the hub later tonight
[3:43:20] Morlega: You also need draconic's energy wrench or something, not sure wrenches from other mods work
[3:43:23] Morlega: Crystal Binder it's called
[3:43:25] Dvaina: You need to scale fusion crafting soon
[3:43:33] DemonsDawn: time to double it
[3:43:39] Dvaina: alrigth chief
[3:43:53] omar_i_: you need the dragonic wrench or something to link these lazers
[3:43:59] officialhunterx: the energy laser from aa are insane
[3:44:07] GrumpyEngineer: can you put the soul binder in green machine?
[3:44:19] Morlega: You also need an Energy I/O Crystal as input @Giantwaffle
[3:44:24] LastSajin: This is taking a while lol
[3:44:24] boogerbomb01: These will solvle power transfer issues
[3:44:32] MisterRabbitHead: creative GT energy block could really help in DML multiblock
[3:44:41] Grant64x: hi
[3:44:52] Morlega: You can chop the relays in half, not the wireless version iirc
[3:45:32] jajo85: read about it on book
[3:45:33] sofalord_: they provide creative devices, so you can use it to be creative
[3:45:37] chaoskub: You need more CPUs
[3:45:38] Morlega: And you need a Crystal Binder to actually connect the crystals and set up wireless links LUL
[3:45:54] chaoskub: *larger CPUs
[3:45:55] boogerbomb01: Is that legacy code still?
[3:46:03] MetalBBA: if you had the other ender IO metals you could use stellar conduit which is max 32 transfer speed

[4:11:29] Ardrago: quest 2 is very nice cause you dont need to be connected physically to anything
[4:12:20] Inviiti: @flyer_soul only thing I can recommend for the quest 2 is a nice size portable charger if you plan on playing for longer sessions.
[4:12:31] boogerbomb01: What is that plebian crafting
[4:12:47] SebastiaanO: is there a good way to stack them on top of eachother
[4:13:08] kirk_lazaruss: any tips for important things to do in the first hours of the pack
[4:13:11] DaddyDiddy: @SebastiaanO i just put a block of air in between them but you can stack them if you use the same setup
[4:13:20] mysts_07: set priorities
[4:13:24] DrkAnbs: @Blakiichan Mine mine mine
[4:13:25] Morlega: Can't you have the energy conduits in that air gap?
[4:13:29] SebastiaanO: gotcha
[4:13:55] Morlega: As long as the laser in the middle has higher priority than the rest it's okay
[4:14:06] RexActa: fit 2 sets of laser in 5 blocks
[4:14:16] Jimbobs8: he saying each layer is inverted for space efficiently
[4:14:23] DaddyDiddy: and make sure you have room for an import bus '
[4:14:25] boogerbomb01: Can you put the lasers on the back?
[4:14:29] Morlega: I think you need at least two blocks between each fusion crafter, otherwise it might "steal" injectors from each other iirc
