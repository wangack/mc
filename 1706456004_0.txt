[0:39:39] Rhynn___: a suggestion would be to have your pc use more ram for the pack if you arent familair...default is like...2gb
[0:39:50] Rhynn___: which is silly tbh. shouldnt be static
[0:40:18] FoldedGiraffe: tubbs51 all the trek series have different voices, so you kinda have to take each on its own merit. however ds9 has some amazing character arcs so it's worth giving it a chance

[1:18:08] Ganthor93: @ThePhoenixSol look up when JTV became Twitch, that ads to the "how has time passed so fast" too
[1:18:11] sutibro: with the bread not being eatable, it might be the glitch where you have to hold it longer
[1:18:15] 14neo: after you sort out surviving, i recommend going the other direction (south to JP), 'cuz the biome is closer and more hospitable NODDERS

[1:23:49] Itz_Mango100: You can only phantom while you can sprint but you cant eat
[1:23:52] GildedCalico: I think it's linked to your hunger
[1:23:54] Ganthor93: its.... phantom pain
[1:24:00] 14neo: @GassyMexican if your hunger is too low, you die basically i believe - need enough hunger saturation

[1:25:50] Sekhcellent: hail Barry
[1:25:55] 14neo: it said somewhere in the class description (if i'm not mistaken) that you need enough hunger saturation to be able to sprint to go phantom mode - but i think there's a bug or not enough clarification about eating food (bread in this case) that's causing issues

[4:56:20] Sekhcellent: one of our favorite Mexican food places was having small batch sales of two plates and a liter of margarita
[4:56:33] TylerDrake1790: i think Margaritas are more of a Southern North America invention
[4:56:35] callingcollins_: @sekhcellent NODDERS
[4:56:43] S1syphus: "can I get a liter'o'cola"
[4:57:02] Sekhcellent: they were normally super expensive but since it was small batches they sold them cheaper. they cooked it outside
[4:57:16] Redeyedmonster: id drink a Tom Collins slushie
[4:57:16] Sekhcellent: straight up fiesta
[4:57:21] jsholydiver: Moscow Mules are pretty nice too, but I doubt anything will overtake the love I have for Margaritas lol

[4:59:03] Syndro_Deathblade: Kappa
[4:59:10] ByteHammer: Ranch is not a dip, @GassyMexican. Everything else is merely a vessel by which ranch enters your mouth.
[4:59:11] Sekhcellent: Ryan doesn't like ranch
