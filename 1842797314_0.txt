[1:20:50] Boonie828: havent had any issues yet with my adblock. knock on wood
[1:20:53] brightcandle: It can also be the youtube ad blocker as I found out last month
[1:20:56] StOrMy1100: We are past 2017 no nitro pretty sure
[1:21:00] SeverinMat: I had this issue a while ago, and turning off adblocker worked
[1:21:01] 1StClassAlcoholic: Where is the lemans stream?
[1:21:01] burkydurk: Funny nuff whatever they did it made my adblocker work again

[1:22:03] Allmostdone: buying his username for discord?
[1:22:09] n69ky: also if you don't need the money i'd not go below "to much" like 20k? XD

[1:23:12] Vosy1984: wet*
[1:23:19] DemonicHell3: behind you
[1:23:23] DemonicHell3: that wall shouldn't be there
[1:23:24] burkydurk: go down there was a way by the waypoint
[1:23:34] chaoskub: #2000 on twitch seems to be a generic "Could not load video" usually happens when an ad should play because DNS get's fucked by adblock. That's my experience most often.
[1:23:44] MaIlchad: maybe its an issue with a browser update? somebody try using a stable build? LTS or ESR
[1:23:46] DemonicHell3: last room to the right
[1:23:56] Larklen: YEP
[1:24:00] DemonicHell3: give me a few

[1:26:43] Slymph: Try restarting YEP
[1:26:46] TheMeowstardCat: Go to multistream and watch Waffle that way if you can not watch him just enter his channel name.
[1:26:46] chaoskub: @Bbluess Does it work in incognito (adblock, etc generally doesn't load in incognito)
[1:26:47] DemonicHell3: @BowTieGuy21 it was at the enterence that we made for the stronghold and it was 1 room away. someone blocked it off. that is someone's skill issue.
[1:26:49] TheGrumpieGnome: @Bbluess use firefox :)

[1:29:47] Larklen: KEKW
[1:29:49] Tekbot: I don't know how people *farm* chaos dragon, that fight is ridiculous
[1:29:49] TheGrumpieGnome: @Bbluess i very rarely have issues with adblock on firefox, but those ads are a bitch
[1:29:54] IveBeenWandering: mojang should really improve this fight lul
[1:29:54] MaIlchad: dragon has smite powers aparently

[1:39:06] DaddyDiddy: the one above that
[1:39:17] MaIlchad: Hardcore Ender Expansion Basic??
[1:39:22] DaddyDiddy: that armor is very powerful so you should be good for a while
[1:39:33] DemonicHell3: That's the goated armor
[1:39:35] MaIlchad: bruh

[1:42:15] Tekbot: Oh that'll be sweet
[1:42:30] bugsplatter23: games been out 5 years and has no story
[1:42:36] PaulFlies: satisfactory devs 5Head
[1:42:37] ForceBan: Any minesweeper today? Kappa
[1:42:43] Iksess: early access games Bedge
[1:42:45] Tekbot: It's a factory game, story? lmao

[1:42:46] Shiirouken: OneGuy
[1:42:46] Cass1911: Ark is going unreal 5 hope it's good
[1:42:57] MrPewPewLaser: which engine? ue5?
[1:43:05] DanteFreed: base ark
[1:43:13] TheSparMan: god think of all the bugs they had to fix after the upgrade
[1:43:14] DanteFreed: and theyre reselling the game
[1:43:15] Cass1911: Ark 1 they calling it ascended
[1:43:22] KuramaTheF0X: when UE5.2 tho
[1:43:23] DanteFreed: and calling it acended
[1:43:30] BBQ1: lirikHMM
[1:43:31] maccabeus: you're not crazy
[1:43:32] ForgottenTime: crazy
[1:43:37] bugsplatter23: the funny thing is if they'd just finished the damn game, added the story, and then realized an S2 with the new engine, i'd be happy and paid them for the sequal
[1:43:38] ForgottenTime: KEKW
[1:43:39] MaIlchad: probably Thaum research
[1:43:39] MeezyMurder: There is a mmo survival called Fractured Veil that is rolling into UE5 soon.  it's pretty early/rough but has a ton of potential
[1:43:39] midnight_alison: and have to repurchase it aswell if you want it on UE5
[1:43:45] Ditch_Doctor: Is there any room left in your d4 clan @giantwaffle?
[1:43:48] Trident901: 👍 you're crazy Kappa
[1:43:54] Bergyi: thats why they're doing it KEKW
[1:43:54] Moobot: You can sub to Waffle by clicking this neat link -> twitch.tv/giantwaffle/subscribe SUBprise
[1:44:01] Tekbot: They're taking the Skyrim approach I see
[1:44:17] KiloJoel: @midnight_alison for marketing purposes, they should really call it a new game
[1:44:21] iDiezALot: They gotta pay for Vin Diesel somehow
[1:44:22] KiloJoel: if they're charging
[1:44:25] TheRackster: He said it in chat
[1:44:25] Vosy1984: the storm cell moved to the East and North, so we might have a clean night race @Giantwaffle
[1:44:30] DaddyDiddy: waffle you need to decide where to put the cleanroom but we don't have the power to use the cleanroom @Giantwaffle
[1:44:31] MaIlchad: has waffle used the ender pearl yet?
[1:44:52] Vosy1984: LMP2 drop back, they doing it
[1:44:52] ausHenry: race is about to resume not under sc
[1:44:53] DaddyDiddy: yes we're doing benzene
[1:45:00] DemonicHell3: HV = benzene now
[1:45:03] 2Flip: oil? KKona
[1:45:12] KiloJoel: benzene is excellent
[1:45:12] DaddyDiddy: yeah but we're doing it like 200 blocks away
[1:45:20] DaddyDiddy: so it doesn't lag the base
[1:45:29] MaIlchad: lag
[1:45:35] DrFriendly: Hi Diddy
[1:45:38] DemonicHell3: Orange & Value are doing the benzene stuff
[1:45:45] WetDonutHole: quinBlind
[1:45:51] DaddyDiddy: @DrFriendly hey
[1:45:59] MaIlchad: some lag is visual based, its not as impactful if its server-side simulation only
[1:46:12] FireForEffekt: Waffles and Giantwaffles?
[1:46:23] AleXanDreMau: minesweeper modCheck
[1:46:25] maccabeus: what's with the trench?
[1:46:31] earthtowers: dedicated person for expanding power supply?
[1:46:36] DemonicHell3: It's not built yet
[1:46:37] cheppard: maybe the giant hole?
[1:46:41] DaddyDiddy: well the trench has been dug, but the building needs to go up and then the stuff needs to be built
[1:46:42] ZephMW: If they're using the shadowofx setup, the benzene will last though up through IV without issue
[1:46:44] Tekbot: Is that the Benzene-to-be spot? lol
[1:46:54] Penca53: Maybe they want you to build it
[1:46:56] KiloJoel: i'm so confused, benzene shouldn't cause lag. There's ways of farming wood that doesnt involve growing whole trees
[1:47:04] Tsullly: KEKW
[1:47:08] AleXanDreMau: KEKW
[1:47:08] DaddyDiddy: the pipeline
[1:47:12] DaddyDiddy: to send benzene back to the base
[1:47:17] DrFriendly: Its fps lag im p sure, not server
[1:47:18] maccabeus: KKona hell yeah
[1:47:35] DaddyDiddy: @KiloJoel it's not the tree farm, it's the 100 machines running constantly that will do it
[1:47:36] MaIlchad: @KiloJoel any system with lots of machines and pipes in a small area are laggy, minecraft doesn't really do culling, it renders everything around you
[1:47:44] ZephMW: There's a pipe system that "teleports" the fluid instead of the normal pipes you've been using that will not lag it out
[1:47:57] DaddyDiddy: ender tank is IV
[1:48:00] ZephMW: yes but ender tanks aren't happening for a hot minute
[1:48:02] MaIlchad: its long distance gregtech pipes
[1:48:06] MaIlchad: ender tanks are ages away
[1:48:07] 619srt: why are yall not in a discord call? chatting over twitch chat? j/w
[1:48:07] ZephMW: its the "long distance fluid pipeline"
[1:48:22] EZL1190: Try picking the ender tank i JEI afain
[1:48:25] EZL1190: again
[1:48:32] KuramaTheF0X: old MC doesnt do that well, but there always has been some sort of culling @MaIlchad newer MC versions have more culling
[1:48:33] G_Man9822: G_Man9822 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 105 months, currently on a 105 month streak! hi
[1:48:34] imTymp: cause 9 people in a call would be  chaos
[1:48:38] KuramaTheF0X: esp with mods
[1:48:40] SawyerStreamsStuff: hey yall
[1:48:43] 619srt: distractions here NOOO
[1:48:46] amgolm: Just get a Threadripper for Minecraft, Ez.
[1:48:49] 619srt: pepeLaugh
[1:48:58] PantherPeak: waffle why arent you at the OTK games expo haha
[1:49:01] KiloJoel: @KiloJoel @DaddyDiddy hmm, i believe drawers cause way more lag per block than machines
[1:49:07] Acrin_: Minesweeper wen
[1:49:11] KuramaTheF0X: @PantherPeak HUH
[1:49:16] SimonSez: @amgolm For a 32-bit Java aplication?
[1:49:18] MaIlchad: @KuramaTheF0X yeah I know, its just super limited/primitive. new minecraft I find worse in some ways except the very latest ones
[1:49:19] DaddyDiddy: @KiloJoel @KiloJoel trust me the machines cause the lag, it was the biggest problem with our last server
[1:49:39] KuramaTheF0X: culling of visuals in old MC
[1:49:44] sky_driver6: I left for a bit. Did I miss the dragon battle?
[1:49:49] phoss2k: what about pollution? Wasnt that a thing in gtnh?
[1:49:56] MaIlchad: (taling about minecraft culling optimization)
[1:49:59] DrFriendly: Its disabled
[1:50:15] tinayoufatsloth: Did I miss dragon fight ?
[1:50:31] pixfix2k2: Should use an elevator to get in and out of clean room so it says running fine
[1:50:50] DaddyDiddy: the cleanroom needs an elevator to get in and out of so you need to put it on stilts or below the floor
[1:50:53] MaIlchad: @KiloJoel drawers are mostly idle tile entities, machines have block-block simulation and some are animated with FX and sound and stuffs
[1:51:01] GamingGoggs: Is project ozone 3 a good pack for a semi-beginner?
[1:51:14] SailorWS: ALOO
[1:51:17] pixfix2k2: you cant open the door or it gets infected
[1:51:27] SailorWS: letMeCi
[1:51:30] Robocurious: decorate ;)
[1:51:33] aundros: just ask them
[1:51:35] Dizz1227: @GamingGoggs Meh, not in kappa mode, normal mode might be fine, not sure what changes were made in just the base version
[1:51:46] AleXanDreMau: Minesweeper game time!
[1:51:48] MaIlchad: are they still using the schematic?
[1:51:51] maccabeus: MYAA

[2:28:53] Vosy1984: right before pit lane
[2:28:59] MaIlchad: @Ultranot20000 I feel like Enigmatica 2 is a bit dry, its really simplistic and not balanced at all. Enigmatica 2 Expert though...

[2:29:49] Ultranot20000: @mailchad I agree! I dumped 500ish hours into enigmatica 2 expert
[2:29:54] 747Overcast: Hopefully the nr3 Cadillac can make up some time
[2:29:56] Vosy1984: engine and frame cannot be fixed @Giantwaffle
[2:30:06] Vosy1984: yes
[2:30:11] Nexhunter: and the G56 engine is rated for 30 hours at full rpm KEKW so these yellow flags helping

[2:30:55] Slymph: In the backyard KEKW
[2:31:03] gikei: pretty sure they use simulations...
[2:31:14] ayaya_prime: The engine manufacturer i worked at had dynos set up for specific tracks
[2:31:15] SailorWS: the infamous test tunnel
[2:31:17] TheMeowstardCat: I feel they should have it shift gears and such due to once it reaches x rpm no strain is being placed really on the engine as much as shifting gears. Maybe I'm wrong
[2:31:22] Winstonrocks: wouldnt it be on a engine dyno?
[2:31:26] Nexhunter: they did sims but then they took the engine and just ran it
[2:31:29] P0tat0killer: there are so many variables
[2:31:34] MaIlchad: you never trust the simulations, simulations don't take into account mechancal imperfections
[2:31:39] 619srt: see how fast they changed the ENTIRE front end of that car wow
[2:31:52] TheMeowstardCat: Is that the NASCAR vehicle?
[2:31:54] Kimbothadog: They do it with jet engines at the aerospace company I work at. I hate testing days KEKW
[2:31:55] Nexhunter: fun fact they didn't modify the stock engine they just reduced the max rpm to ensure it would survive the tested hours
[2:31:59] MaIlchad: easy. you make the engine sure to fail after 24 hours and rebuild :)
[2:32:02] SailorWS: @Giantwaffle have you watched the video about the Chip Ganassi tunnel he bought and was testing in it

[2:32:31] TheMeowstardCat: How do I watch this race?
[2:32:34] Enigmaticb: where are you watching it at?
[2:32:39] tristanzer0: yea it would be better and cheaper to just run an engine for 24hrs than getting a highly expensive computer to AI generate a sim for it
[2:32:39] Keoonik: not u 2 error 2k
[2:32:47] DrFriendly: How many drivers do they use for this?

[2:34:13] daemonaedryn: the level of arrogance was insane
[2:34:15] TheRackster: Too much to watch today.. Le mans, CL final and Waffle pepeLaugh
[2:34:16] Pizoi: good ol gregtech punishment. if you need to make 1 of something, you should probably make 20+ instead

[2:34:21] Wetware: Tone deaf
[2:34:25] SwekAap: hope cadillac will move up the order, rooting for the dutch driver
[2:34:25] Nexhunter: https://youtu.be/hXiwsg9ny-8?t=200 @Giantwaffle so if you look at this video from G56 this was one of the engines being tested at Earnhardt Children Racing engine shop
[2:34:28] Vosy1984: @acethekiller22 nah, they do like 2h shifts, depends for each team as there was a driver that changed 30 min into the race
[2:34:51] TheMeowstardCat: What AMA ? Waffle could you link?
[2:34:53] acethekiller22: @acethekiller22 ah gotcha i wasnt too sure lol
[2:34:58] Nexhunter: there was digg
[2:34:58] Obliviron: Look, the guy makes a lot of money. He doesn't care what people who aren't as rich as him think. The AMA is done for PR reasons, he doesn't want to and he won't listen to the users. I can't believe people are delusional enough to stay on the site and pretend like CEOs are supposed to care about the users lol
[2:34:59] Nexhunter: KEKW
[2:35:01] warcake: all moderators should just stop moderating for free and see how quickly it all goes to shit

[2:35:17] Wetware: Digg 2.0 incoming
[2:35:26] TheRackster: @TheRackster No problem man, Nearly forgot it myself
[2:35:27] 747Overcast: When is the CL final starting?
[2:35:29] Bulltank: You can easily clone Reddit. The problem is convincing everyone to leave there together so you can start generating content
[2:35:34] Apakawata: He's a greedy little pg boy who wants to pretend he's not a greedy little pig boy
[2:35:39] TheRackster: @747Overcast Now
[2:35:39] SawyerStreamsStuff: literally now @747Overcast
[2:35:44] Nexhunter: @Obliviron these apps are using a service and making money without paying for that service either they start paying up or service dies KEKW
[2:35:47] Obliviron: @Nexhunter I know, that's like the biggest issue. And if you try to explain it to them on the site they call you defeatist (which is what happened to me) and just downvote you
[2:35:50] TheMeowstardCat: What AMA was waffle talking about?
[2:35:50] Nexhunter: it the engineering work also
[2:36:01] 747Overcast: @therackster Thanks so just in time KEKW
[2:36:01] Nexhunter: you can clone something but the scaling is hella fucking dfficult
[2:36:06] MaIlchad: I could never get used to reddit honestly. It'd be easy to convince anybody like me.
[2:36:07] TheMeowstardCat: Thanks
[2:36:11] Tekbot: It was still up this morning
[2:36:12] TheRackster: @747Overcast ratirlSalute
[2:36:14] MaIlchad: I know so many people who don't actually interact with reddit, they just look
[2:36:16] Tidalllwave: out of touch?
[2:36:24] DrYProtoss: its still up. they only answered 24 questions out of thousands
[2:36:25] Wetware: Once they dump the 'old' prefix I'll probably bail
[2:36:39] Champton2664: What's the Apollo thing again?
[2:36:40] Vosy1984: #923 on the gravel @Giantwaffle
[2:36:44] Tekbot: They also keep giving "We're going to improve it" excuses for like 5 years now
[2:36:47] daemonaedryn: how is it ALL CEO's are so fucking garbage
[2:36:51] Derek_LastName: many people are saying it
[2:36:52] InternetPlumber: the new layout is extreme ass
[2:37:02] Nexhunter: @DaemonSzyman cause he has to keep the company going there isn't unlimited VC money
[2:37:03] WetDonutHole: the "new" reddit just sucks
[2:37:08] Tekbot: I've seen the new layout like 3 times and hated it every time
[2:37:12] Pizoi: watch them come after RES next
[2:37:12] Obliviron: @Nexhunter yeah, although the apps do pay for it and the new price is a bit too high for those apps. But yeah the people at Apollo are so entitled. It does suck that they're pricing them out but that's just how life works : (
[2:37:14] Wetware: Can't handle the 'new' layout, freaking waste of space
[2:37:16] Lost_Leviathan: They're preventing the post from showing anything below 0 upvotes
[2:37:20] MaIlchad: I really hate the new reddit layout, feels close to unusable. mobile has malicious web design
[2:37:28] n69ky: sooo mr waffle, did you get a cs2 invite yesterday? (new invites went out) ... i didn't get in still
[2:37:28] Bbluess: oof lmp2 does not have 4wd lol :D
[2:37:29] roxasivolain90: the new layout is garbage on non mobile
[2:37:34] Champton2664: @DaemonSzyman It's because they're all business people and don't understand their product from a top side down point of view
[2:37:35] Apakawata: All the third party apps have better features and more stability? Let's just shut them down
[2:37:37] Tekbot: EA's comment right?

[3:07:57] JommyBee: there was exploits with the bugged aspects
[3:07:59] BananaEmojis: barb was one shotting world bosses thats why
[3:07:59] tg_linkedtaunt: beserk ripper
[3:08:02] Montop: whos an edge master?
[3:08:06] DanteFreed: edge and ripper
[3:08:14] Nexhunter: more than just gloves
[3:08:17] Manacaym: i love how barb is getting nerfed but rouge is just hitting millions
[3:08:25] Hurtwolf: Edgemaster's Aspect and Of Berserk Ripping yeah
[3:08:29] Manacaym: and they arent touching rouge at all
[3:08:32] DanteFreed: basically we lost 15-20% dmg and some of our bleed dmg
[3:08:34] JommyBee: well barb can do 10 billion bleed
[3:08:36] JommyBee: and 1 shot lilith
[3:08:38] JommyBee: pepeLaugh
[3:08:38] Jodeatre: time to just move on to diablo 5

[3:08:52] Hurtwolf: yeah waiting for Diablo V
[3:08:53] PressureCake: do you have waffle house clan in D4 ?
[3:08:53] KuramaTheF0X: @Manacaym but barb on releae could do hundreds of millions of dps and have billion hits sometimes as a proc
[3:08:57] 2Flip: @JommyBee could have disabled those aspects to work with bleed LUL
[3:09:01] DareDeFlug: If it's bugged of course they gonna disable them
[3:09:04] Champton2664: Was it only the Barb's Aspects for Edgemaster? Since doesn't Druid use it too?
[3:09:04] JommyBee: true OMEGALUL
[3:09:09] Manacaym: @KuramaTheF0X only if u had everything, which alot of people didnt
[3:09:14] Nexhunter: @Champton2664 only barb setup was breaking
[3:09:15] RedDiablos: I was never using edgemaster so I dodged the nerf but am spinning for 100k on my barb
[3:09:26] Jodeatre: @DareDeFlug or they could release an actual finished game when they are charging 70 for it
[3:09:42] Nexhunter: chat balance issues isn't an unfinished game issue
[3:09:48] Nexhunter: you are actually a fucking idiot @Jodeatre
[3:09:59] KICKKJ: can you all make the tools that use energy yet? or is that later?
[3:10:07] Vosy1984: ohh, I forgot, it is close to Summer Solstice, the night at LeMans is really short
[3:10:10] boltzmanC: lol
[3:10:20] KICKKJ: trying to remember from other playthroughs i've seen
[3:10:21] 2Flip: @Nexhunter what about completed dungeons not showing up on the map? or having more than one viable skill per class? Kappa
[3:10:22] Jodeatre: @Nexhunter sure, if it was a balance issue and not something being bugged or broken
[3:10:25] n69ky: @Nexhunter i agree, it's not that easy.
[3:10:26] Vosy1984: YEP

[3:10:52] WetDonutHole: it is, you are right
[3:10:53] Nexhunter: what is unfinished HUH
[3:11:05] Mastertekken200: feels good to me lol

[3:11:06] TogglesLore: D4 was rushed another test  might’ve fixed that thiugh
[3:11:10] TogglesLore: Though*
[3:11:15] amgolm: Probably all locked behind Seasonal content.
[3:11:16] KrunkleDunk: can I have what you are having?
[3:11:17] Nexhunter: another round of testing wouldn't catch it
[3:11:18] Arcunas: what they're missing is a proper necromancer build that doesn't use bone spear
[3:11:21] TheSparMan: it feels like they finished 60% of the game and got told to rush the rest
[3:11:22] JommyBee: yes thats the point
[3:11:27] TasteMaShu: TasteMaShu subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 37 months, currently on a 31 month streak! 
[3:11:37] WetDonutHole: it's blizzard, deal with it, it won't change
[3:11:41] Nexhunter: they don't do 60$ expansions for diablo
[3:11:42] InternetPlumber: they sold you a $50 game for $100
[3:11:46] Nexhunter: HUH this isn't WoW
[3:11:46] n69ky: 60.- DLCs? sure?
[3:11:50] LegacyOfPain: story was mid
[3:11:54] 2Flip: LUL
[3:11:54] Champton2664: 60$ Expansions is nuts...
[3:11:56] daemonaedryn: If you fucking neutar a game to sell DLC's, you can get fucked
[3:12:04] KrunkleDunk: not even expansions, just like 60$ dlc packs that are prob 100Mb big
[3:12:04] maccabeus: will you buy them though?
[3:12:08] JommyBee: $20 for necro dlc in D3
[3:12:09] Nexhunter: yes but it isn't KEKW

[3:12:20] Nexhunter: diablo is treated very differently than WoW on expac costs
[3:12:21] FireForEffekt: where can i hire?
[3:12:27] Grimstar_: I mean you did say 1 hr/$1 value
[3:12:27] nick43087: YEP
[3:12:28] PressureCake: I miss a few weeks of your stream bacause of work, did you finish Graveyard keeper.
[3:12:29] 514484: he buys it so we don't have to EZ
[3:12:36] Piper_Primed: I think you are spoiled by POE's always and forever upgrading their game. However, D4 is expensive
[3:12:38] Speedglass: i was hoping for 20 classes
[3:12:43] kool_aid_man20: Have you played old school runescape?
[3:12:44] xxLatte: need a rec for an office chair, fine w paying a decent amount for it if needed
[3:12:45] Mastertekken200: we gona buy it anyways lol
[3:12:47] 2Flip: waffleH
[3:12:49] NapsAreAwesomeSometimes: you got a d4 code, right?
[3:12:52] JommyBee: and tbh diablo story isnt the main focus
[3:12:53] DareDeFlug: Crusader
[3:12:54] TheRackster: @Piper_Primed Wouldnt call it upgrading anymore KEKW
[3:12:54] Nexhunter: hmmm depends

[3:13:02] Warkless: Crusader Prayge
[3:13:03] JommyBee: farming Sigils and killing echo lilith
[3:13:03] emnitthy: That game is missing a soul
[3:13:04] xevos221: @xxLatte Steelcase Leap v2
[3:13:04] lvyEartman: why is everyone in pink LUL
[3:13:05] TogglesLore: I miss my demon hunter Sadge

[3:13:13] 2Flip: 100%
[3:13:13] Iksess: there is no crafting
[3:13:15] Nexhunter: OMEGALUL fuck that method
[3:13:19] Bergyi: its diablo, its about DROPS KEKW
[3:13:19] Moobot: You can find Waffle's Youtube channel here - https://youtube.com/giantwaffle
[3:13:19] InternetPlumber: poe2 when :)
[3:13:20] KadMan04: crafting there is 0 crafting
[3:13:25] Vosy1984: there's craft in D4? WoW Vanilla has more crafting than D4 KEKW
[3:13:27] F6MaxDamage: why add multyple classes if you can skam more cash if you do 1 clash every exspantion
[3:13:28] 2Flip: my god nex :(
[3:13:32] JommyBee: u can enchant it
[3:13:32] Nexhunter: Diablo 2 was about drops POE changed that formula
[3:13:34] JommyBee: reroll
[3:13:42] Stragmol: just farminig of aspects
[3:13:44] Grimstar_: I give them 6/10. d3 allowed you to upgrade your blacksmiths and jewelers
[3:13:45] JommyBee: thats how D3 was
[3:13:51] JommyBee: so its normal if u played D3
[3:13:52] 2Flip: poe not about drops LUL
[3:13:53] KadMan04: end game items in d4 is 500x easier then poe
[3:14:00] imTymp: i have over 1k veiled just salvage a ton
[3:14:01] Jodeatre: at least they didn't put the real money AH in this time
[3:14:02] Speedglass: imagine yakuza characters in d4
[3:14:02] KrunkleDunk: its how they keep you logged in
[3:14:18] Speedglass: no guns at all
[3:14:19] nAZAr1uS: the items descriptions are dogshit. I have to mouseover each to figure out which is good.
[3:14:19] Mastertekken200: nah
[3:14:20] JommyBee: yeh i have endgame setup for my druid
[3:14:27] Speedglass: even torchlight has a mechanic class
[3:14:30] JommyBee: but it wasnt perfect for him
[3:14:33] nAZAr1uS: No item search, nothing
[3:14:44] Nexhunter: well his is def not built up perfectly
[3:14:45] Stragmol: maybe thats why they're disabling and rebalancing stuff
[3:14:49] jeppyy: he is soon lvl 100 with the rouge 2
[3:14:49] Nexhunter: but he can push tier 100 then
[3:14:56] TheRackster: Mirror tier item in 5 days Kappa
[3:15:04] JommyBee: raxx also is a diablo vetern
[3:15:14] Piper_Primed: Most people dont have the time to grind POE style
[3:15:33] kbeezy710: 5 days for him is like 1-2 months for me
[3:15:33] Rajin_Cajun: I just  feel like Diablo was never meant to be a mmo
[3:15:34] Mastertekken200: yea we arnt getting perfect gear like him we cant play lol
[3:15:34] JommyBee: raxx17
[3:15:36] Iksess: he didnt get rank1 in race tho 😏
[3:15:43] Nexhunter: the top end is def not realistic KEKW for sure
[3:15:50] JommyBee: killing echo of lilith and Sigil 100s
[3:15:52] JommyBee: are the goal
[3:16:07] TheRackster: D4 is forever just gonna be a extremely casual game
[3:16:14] 514484: late game diablo has never been particularly interesting imo
[3:16:16] JommyBee: but D3 had GR150
[3:16:17] JommyBee: and nothing
[3:16:21] TogglesLore: Those goals are lackluster
[3:16:26] Nexhunter: stoopz thought he was gonna be able to tackle lilith once he hit 100 but he died non stop cause he didn't grind out good gear KEKW
[3:16:26] CoJackjr: CoJackjr subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 76 months! 
[3:16:27] n69ky: was he the guywho had full access since beta? so speedrun stratting the whole game beforehand?
[3:16:31] amgolm: You can just spin and one shot Lilith.
[3:16:32] JommyBee: yep
[3:16:37] Piper_Primed: D3 was easy
[3:16:39] DareDeFlug: Seasons will give so MUCH more content
[3:16:41] DiamondDestructe: just toe add, some games should't be 100+ hours per run to fishis
[3:16:41] Qbertman: d3 had no endgame at launch
[3:16:43] Nexhunter: ehhhh
[3:16:44] Stragmol: its not about getting 100% perfect setup, its about trying to get 100% perfect setup
[3:16:45] Iksess: it took weeks before kripp beated inferno diablo
[3:16:46] JommyBee: RoS made D3 much b etter
[3:16:48] HoloJr: They had to overhaul the entire game with reaper of souls because it was that bad

[4:07:56] goldenwerewolf: Clap
[4:07:59] Nexhunter: also G56 is 42nd overall as of now
[4:08:05] TheTodd138: The two most famous patterns are 1-2-1 and 1-2-2-1. You should memorise these immediately. The 1-2-1 pattern has one solution. The 1-2-2-1 pattern has one solution.
[4:08:12] Vosy1984: Iron Dames leading with a 21.5 second lead
[4:08:15] boogerbomb01: How is that 2 a 1?
[4:08:29] Variandra: @boogerbomb01 bc it had a bomb above it
[4:08:31] MetalBBA: @boogerbomb01 subtract the flag above it
[4:08:32] goldenwerewolf: Because we already know a bomb is elsewhere, demoting it to a 1
[4:08:32] Rampage_eM: Because it has 1 bomb connected
[4:08:33] Syrenthra: you can solve the 4 I think
[4:08:35] Wazix11: solve the 4, it is free
[4:08:36] F6MaxDamage: clear the solved 1 before mistakes

[4:12:55] RexActa: patis right
[4:12:56] UnCrazed: its 1-1-x above the x is always safe if the 1 is against a wall

[4:14:23] kozgrove: Haven’t been here in a few days. Work out of D4 already?
[4:14:24] RexActa: right of the 4 is a bomb
[4:14:46] The_Flembo: 4-3-2-3 | right of top 3 is safe
[4:14:48] HeyAFrozenZebra: The vertical 3-2-3
[4:14:51] Foooks: I feel that Waffle has check out with Minesweeper  ;)
[4:14:54] n69ky: the 4 left of the ?? are solvable
[4:14:59] The_Flembo: Bomb, sorry
[4:15:01] n69ky: oh no.
[4:15:03] 404Furphy: @Giantwaffle  box next to the 4 is safe
[4:15:10] F6MaxDamage: def a bom
[4:15:13] BallForceOne: That is a bomb
[4:15:13] prikmori7: No its a bomb

[4:15:26] prikmori7: Yes
[4:15:29] prikmori7: The 2
[4:15:30] goldenwerewolf: 3 has 2 flags, going up removes 2 guaranteed, then it goes UP to a 2, so it adds a bomb
[4:15:31] HeyAFrozenZebra: Solve the 3
[4:15:34] FireForEffekt: we just know
[4:15:35] enki1337: wall - 1 - 2
[4:15:47] deathlover22: the 3 says there's 1 left there so the 2 touching those spaces makes that space a bomb
[4:15:48] RexActa: there can only be one bomb in the range of the bottom 3, so you cant solve the 2 without that one being a bomb
[4:15:48] HeyAFrozenZebra: Of yeah that top left 2 is solved
[4:15:51] LurkerNr5: only one bomb above the two ones, so you know the others for the 3
[4:15:53] F6MaxDamage: for 2 in the midle you need that to be a bom els the 3 under the 2 should be a 4
