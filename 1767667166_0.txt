[2:27:33] Blood_Thursty: If I pick up 1 apple do I really have 2 apples?!
[2:27:38] georgehehheh: It's only a value of ONE when the amount of ONE has been satisfied
[2:27:44] Blindfishideas: What about birthdays? the first year of your life you are not called 1 year old. Humans do zero counting
[2:27:46] shadycat_lady: oh lord - i come back to the children fighting

[2:28:04] 3v1lc0w: you do if you found one of the apples on the ground
[2:28:06] jooseman_: Add a mezzanine level just to make it more annoying
[2:28:08] darth_baggins: Preach, Rythian!
[2:28:08] socalzig: Btw, if the UK doesn't use the number 13 as a floor, then a 13 story building has a top floor of 11?
[2:28:08] ohadamm: what about basements and attics?
[2:28:11] lesand_bard: PIERRE üçé
[2:28:17] Limewood_: Why don't we compromise and say ground floor - second floor - third floor?
[2:28:17] anantiapple: Would the ground apple, be the tree?
[2:28:18] ohadamm: what floor is the basement?
[2:28:18] georgehehheh: 1st century SHOULD regardless of the status quo, should be 100 years after whatever
[2:28:21] Coconut6161: Should count the ceilings not the floors
[2:28:21] PaulSeventiesChild03: in hotels and shopping centres etc are always listing lobby etc as ground level and the floor above as first floor

[2:29:14] Hodgelett: so it goes -1 and 1 there's no 0?
[2:29:16] PuNutSial: not all elevators has ground floor though
[2:29:17] Leuty_P: its ground or lobby
[2:29:18] silentp13426: no, basement is -1 or BS
[2:29:19] kacs_ky: I wonder if the UK only does it this way
[2:29:20] Generolas121: when you enter the building you are already on the floor thus 1st floor

[2:29:25] HadeNewell: the fuck

[2:29:58] joll05: I was with you on the floor thing, but 0 is definitely a number rythian
[2:29:59] Mowmowwarrior12: It's no zero floor though

[2:30:02] SirJohnOfPancake: what is the second number of the number 10?
[2:30:07] moltown: B is basement, G is ground and 2 is the floor above ground hryLeddit
[2:30:08] silentp13426: counting and numbers are separate
[2:30:09] makeshiftowl: saying zero isn't a number is like saying p isn't a letter

[2:30:11] 9dragons1apple: Lmao now they're both incorrect LUL

[2:30:56] Kiranna_NS: Briony, Get Katdoesmaths on the phone.
[2:30:57] Asenta_: zero is a number that represents and absence its still a number even if it has no value
[2:30:57] jelly_deals: Don't think of it as 1st/2nd floor etc. Think of it as "Ground level +1"/"Ground level +2"

[2:31:12] Stubbs__: what about patient 0??
[2:31:13] Coconut6161: @Rythian when you were born were you already age 1?
[2:31:20] Hodgelett: "Using 0 as ground floor is European" so Sweden is odd in Europe?
[2:31:22] Woshmistro: what about buildings with basements?
[2:31:22] AgronoxDT: How can a floor be nothing
[2:31:24] Z0eff: LUL
[2:31:28] lesand_bard: KEKW
[2:31:28] Poldon: Kirsty, if you're outside you're on the ground, right? If you go inside a building, that building has a floor. The floor is on top of the ground. That's ground/first floor. Then you build another floor on top of that. It's the second floor you build, so it's the second floor.
[2:31:31] 3v1lc0w: brionyGiggle
[2:31:31] TilliKara: Rythian believes in a first floor earth
[2:31:36] Shasskor: Riddle me this: How come that it's only called the ground floor in brittain?
[2:31:39] Generolas121: you levitate on the ground floor thus 0 LUL
[2:31:44] SirJohnOfPancake: Kirstys logic is undeliable
[2:31:45] Dakftw: basements are less than the first floor
[2:31:49] joll05: im getting confused
[2:31:50] 1Wessel: So when you're just born how many days have you been around?
[2:31:52] ohadamm: how come its only called the ground floor in the UK?
[2:31:53] Jetmanbanshee: What about the first item in an array, what number is that?
[2:31:55] HadeNewell: Okay Rythian, if the ground floor is actually floor 1, then whats the basement level directly below? floor 0?
[2:31:57] voltsurfer037: But regardless what floor you are on, you are on floor
[2:31:59] HauntingBird: Unless you're from Korea. Their age is considered as 1 from birth
[2:32:02] l4wy3r1987: Stop arguing dude your not gonna win just give up
[2:32:03] 9dragons1apple: No, it's not less than the 1st floor, it is the 1st floor
[2:32:03] duncanttv__: on an elevator, it goes G= 0 then 1 then 2 then so on
[2:32:07] lesand_bard: wait, now i understand that Kirsty is in fact wrong
[2:32:07] Hodgelett: @ohadamm most of Europe apparently
[2:32:07] Z0eff: @HauntingBird wait really?
[2:32:08] Poldon: @HadeNewell B1
[2:32:10] silentp13426: building elevations treat the ground as 0

[2:32:31] Kiranna_NS: a billizion years? is that a number?
[2:32:31] JPGHdesign: Do buildings in the UK just have dirt on the lowest floor?
[2:32:32] BlackSteelKita: shes been digginf for ground years
[2:32:32] Poldon: Basement floors are B1, B2 and so on as you go down.
[2:32:38] lesand_bard: stairs to the 2nd floor
[2:32:39] darth_baggins: The treasure is on the 1st floor, obviously! LUL
[2:32:39] smoopmeister_: Korea are changing that soon/already done

[2:32:40] Asenta_: americans also use Fahrenheit  why should we listen to them about conventions?
[2:32:41] Maxwell_Bloodfencer: @GoldenPwnyBoy you answered your own question: they are absement
[2:32:43] Shasskor: What about buildings on a slope where ground enterances can be on different floors?
[2:32:46] jooseman_: Actually 999,999 years when you take into account the ground year
[2:32:53] Blindfishideas: If you give the pigmen some of your gold they will give you gifts
[2:32:54] ohadamm: @Hodgelett they'll call a basement a basement, but not the ground floor
[2:33:00] joll05: I think they've forgotten about you
[2:33:01] PaulSeventiesChild03: @brionykay you are working on the Mezzanine so not a floor
[2:33:05] HauntingBird: @Z0eff Yeah, as far as I am aware. They also are considered 1 year older from New Years rather than birthday. So if a korean person says they are 20, we would consider them 18 or 19, depending on their birth date
[2:33:08] Poldon: No cycle in the Nether.
[2:33:08] Z0eff: What? Separate cycle? wtf?
[2:33:09] Notaro_: block them
[2:33:12] Poldon: The End.
[2:33:12] 9dragons1apple: Maybe you should've bern digging on the 1st floor instead of ground floor, Kirsty?
[2:33:14] daveyh_: The End?
[2:33:15] voltsurfer037: Only the end
[2:33:15] georgehehheh: They reset aggression
