[1:11:59] gaymersalsa: !copiously
[1:11:59] Nightbot: https://clips.twitch.tv/HandsomeCrepuscularGorillaPMSTwin-UxsrcmPX1CQ2YSAd
[1:12:05] notTheRealHelmis: for the herald tool?
[1:12:07] tangerinedoro: HAHAHAHAH
[1:12:15] angrrrrydad: you only need soulbound for if you die in a vault. Eiskall never dies in a vault right!
[1:12:18] tangerinedoro: unfortunately we can't get zoomerskall
[1:12:24] gaymersalsa: no zoomerskall hryBebe
[1:12:26] lauraannierose: @mahik750 yeah that‚Äôs what I thought. seems a bit of a weird situation
[1:12:28] excaliburhero19: you should start crafting your 9 omega pogs actually
[1:12:37] bunta_1: Any time on the update
[1:12:39] KmaLAce: new vodskall video out
[1:12:39] excaliburhero19: it's a journey and you probably wanna get started on it
[1:12:41] gaymersalsa: yes 100%
[1:12:45] illycat_: are u gonna make a prismatic tool?
[1:12:46] tangerinedoro: it goes from zskall to medievalskall
[1:12:48] peppa_j: yes
[1:12:53] breezygolf41980: Do hydrovoid hammering sickle so you don't have to block lava
[1:12:54] Niko_993: no. they are great
[1:13:03] fultiaan: no i added 20k to my prismatic
[1:13:03] Danymaddox: yep
[1:13:04] tangerinedoro: yeah i agree
[1:13:05] daniel_yt_33: hello iskall!
[1:13:05] Knew_It_Owl: @illycat_ probably not, they are VERY expensive
[1:13:06] rocketjohn: for sure.
[1:13:06] dcptcncrescendo: It annoys me to add dura
[1:13:09] peppa_j: durability womp womp
[1:13:19] k1_setae: But why put durability on a tool when you can get 100% dmg reduction with talents and skills?
[1:13:24] dcptcncrescendo: Like, I understand the benefits, but I don't like it
[1:13:28] tangerinedoro: i try to only go for legendary dura to save space
[1:13:28] LaboePlay: my echoing shatterer +7 hammer got 15.4k dura
[1:13:33] avian946: yeah but my tools are here for a good time not a long time
[1:13:34] ramnite_tv: add unbreaking levels on top of that and all dura is worth more
[1:13:42] gaymersalsa: NOOOO hes sneaking more maths in!!! ReallyMad
[1:13:43] plantcraftie: you also break more chest the higher level
[1:13:46] zeus_o9o2: durability * (repair + 1)
[1:13:53] dcptcncrescendo: @avian946 lol!!!
[1:13:56] Danymaddox: @k1_setae because i can use those points in other things hahaa
[1:14:02] artemisfowl31: level 99 yey
[1:14:04] breezygolf41980: Hammering hydrovoid sikle for ignoring lava
[1:14:04] MiIchMix: would [repair capacity +1] be a good modifier on jewels?
[1:14:07] excaliburhero19: you probably have alot of the materials
[1:14:12] zeus_o9o2: @iskall85 have you checked joe's build ?
[1:14:12] cozmo42: I like the higher level tools tools because there‚Äôs mushroom for jewels
[1:14:13] basman333: just saw the stream. what did i miss
[1:14:15] RobUrHood: 720
[1:14:17] Vintage_Thief: how many days are left?
[1:14:21] notTheRealHelmis: durability is like exercise, really good for you but kinda boring and doesn‚Äôt feel great
[1:14:22] excaliburhero19: 720
[1:14:28] tangerinedoro: it's 720 sir
[1:14:29] asimithehero: Durability is kind of easy to overlook because its worthless on low tier tools so you don't learn to value it
[1:14:34] pst0808: 728
[1:14:44] aeonep_: Would it be possible to show the capacity of the different tools in the station, regardless of your level, so it's easier to know how much extra capacity you'll get at the next unlock?
[1:14:44] Zelante: 189
[1:14:48] basman333: is anyone at 100 yet?
[1:14:58] sp0rsk: he's using chain poison and i basically wiped a western room in a few seconds, it was ridiculous
[1:15:05] LaplaceDemon2k: @basman333 iskall will be in a few more vaults :P
[1:15:06] Hallideadly: it is hard for copious to maultiply when there is not mushroom
[1:15:08] zeus_o9o2: he has gone deep in ap build and got like glass canon but it looks op i think @iskall85
[1:15:09] RobUrHood: he also has wrath totem
[1:15:10] gaymersalsa: !armory

[2:23:34] Lakosius2: @Lakosius2 what i want to say is that it would still make sense since both are currency
[2:23:35] vaaaarna: log in out?
[2:23:37] thatmfdes: @fenixcrafter05 guess I‚Äôm redoing my backpacks when I‚Äôm home

[2:23:38] codei007: @fenixcrafter05 oh I know, for some reason it‚Äôs in my head. Don‚Äôt mind me in the corner
[2:23:38] Bobbingtonn: That'd make sense

[2:24:29] aeonep_: Everything in the universe is connected, man
[2:24:34] mommyfinn: just leave the vault
[2:24:34] protoproot: Any lore reason for the Death's Door unlocking for 189 gold?
[2:24:35] mihea13: Or the debug thing you do when you complete party vaults
[2:24:42] gamingwithtoimen: salsa can i have a bingo update for the past hour that i was gone
[2:24:43] Attackeight: @protoproot ABE
[2:24:44] heighleybaily: Afternoon iskall and chat
[2:24:46] Lakosius2: @protoproot Abe

[2:24:52] LaplaceDemon2k: @protoproot Abe in season 3, look it up
[2:24:55] ruby_realist: @protoproot ABE
[2:25:01] fenixcrafter05: @thatmfdes havent tried it on coins yet cause i didnt see the need but yeah
[2:25:02] NelisCornelis: Maybe there is trapped on your paradox modifiers, and that affects trapped now? @iskall85
[2:25:08] omkaarr: @shook_2190 no its hardcoded
[2:25:11] karthavya: sir if dieing will help then dieing in overworld works too
[2:25:13] heighleybaily: iskHeart iskHeart
[2:25:16] Gorbyas: so‚Ä¶ die?
[2:25:17] gaymersalsa: @toimenlol random omega room

[2:25:49] SirBobtheCasual: Your abilities are unplugged lol
[2:25:54] sharkyteeth101: Go into build realm?
[2:25:54] Lakosius2: a more funny bug would be if you open chests in the Overworld and they are somehow trapped :p
[2:26:03] joeri_van: but wouldn't you then also have the other modifiers now?
[2:26:09] GhoulHunter811: YAY bug stuff lovely!
[2:26:09] ddaffy_: Wbat about unaliving in over world?
[2:26:17] thatmfdes: @lakosius2 pacific dwellers has a ring to it
[2:26:32] NelisCornelis: I actually really like devstreams StoryTimeWithDylan
[2:26:40] Baab83: So then you should have all the modifiers of the paradox vault?
[2:26:51] merlijnchkia: i mean if a vault is a class why woudnt you do the tp in the constructor, so you know if you dont get teleported the vault wasnt created
[2:26:51] fenixcrafter05: @NelisCornelis InternDylan
[2:27:05] BaristaSimmer: It's fun to see Zombies dressed in different clothes
[2:27:08] heighleybaily: Makes sense that they are connected
[2:27:10] gaymersalsa: also BING for looting 250+ chests earlier
[2:27:10] Codeman750: Peeper got this! We believe in you!
[2:27:18] joeri_van: @NelisCornelis  PETTHEDYLAN
[2:27:19] kyoffa: I just love the game dev aspect of the talk
[2:27:23] gaymersalsa: and BING for forgetting to bring a backpack into a vault
[2:27:23] mihea13: And that is why you didn't have regen on the overworld
[2:27:23] pranav1326: lol blaming divine paradox without context makes it seem like blaming god
[2:27:29] thatmfdes: what are all the bingos so far?
[2:27:30] Gorbyas: solved the theory of everything
[2:27:54] corneelis0: Half time. How many catalyst frags do you already have?
[2:27:58] Baab83: I think the answer of all these questions is 42
[2:28:02] Lakosius2: oh the no regen in the OW is maybe because the game thinks you are still inside of a Vault
[2:28:05] strandberggg: unalive you mean
[2:28:16] Giel2002: Although you're still getting more traps than you should even with 2x clumsy right?
[2:28:20] Lakosius2: That HAS happened before once or twice as well
[2:28:29] br1ckst0n: shouldnt you be able to see the current trap disarm values including possible clumsies in the stat screen?
[2:28:44] zeus_o9o2: more fun is when they unalive you while they never spawned too Keepo Keepo
[2:28:51] gaymersalsa:  BINGO update: random omega room, forgets to flask/bring sth into vault, open treasure door, loots 250+ chests, i made a new emote lol valkyrie

[2:29:10] gaymersalsa: he mightve mined an echo ore too
[2:29:10] RaithamX: didnt the crash from the start happen before divine paradox? or are they unrelated?
[2:29:15] joeri_van: and that is why the new potion did work, as that potion did not enter the divine paradox

[2:30:17] zeus_o9o2: but you died already in no mob vault wont that solve it ?

[2:30:57] fenixcrafter05: @gaymersalsa haha
[2:31:02] mirohtomysoul: And potion bugg was only noticed after divine, if I recall correctly
[2:31:02] ePacee: are you hoping to release update 13 this week? me and my friends are planning to start our first world when its out
[2:31:06] thebeaz2: do you have automated regression tests set up?
[2:31:15] karthavya: @iskall85 unaliving in the overworld will also prompt the end screen of divine paradox for you
[2:31:15] zeus_o9o2: i just wanted to be specific to avoid misunderstanding nothing else <3
[2:31:17] Giel2002: The dying in the no mob vault is probably the key to all of this
[2:31:22] cozmo42: lol @thebeaz2
[2:31:23] notTheRealHelmis: do we say respec or respecc?

[2:32:14] mirohtomysoul: Pepa is too good
[2:32:22] DiraculaMC: Shouldn't the opposite happen? Like lock all other potions but one potion should never end up in 2 vaults at once?
[2:32:30] Darkwytchcraft: it was a greedtastropy
[2:32:37] joeri_van: so the broken potion from yesterday should now work, as you 'left' the paradox from yesterday
[2:32:37] ePacee: @Therank2100 ah ok
[2:32:43] Gorbyas: best addition to VH 3rd edition? Peppa
[2:32:48] Ganunbrar: But you also always say Greed is good
[2:32:48] senselesscape7: Greedskal struck again
[2:32:49] StandaSK: no, you always say greed is good
[2:32:49] mommyfinn: did you guys know iskal died in a no mob vault?
[2:32:49] silvain_shadows: number one most dangerous thing for iskalls: the timer
[2:32:50] jeeukko_: maybe add message "yo dont cheese potions" so its obvious
[2:32:50] gaymersalsa: yeah and you should rewatch the part of vod on 0.5 speed just to reminisce a bit!
[2:32:54] victor_2504: but greed is good
[2:32:55] shook_2190: Iskalls greed is the biggest danger
[2:32:57] EnslavedMoist: or impossible illager dungeons are also quite dangerous
[2:32:59] mahik750: The no mob vault death was the perfect example of the "false sense of security"
[2:33:02] zeus_o9o2: itss fineee everythingss fineee we just trolling anyone would die in a no mob vault .... maybe
[2:33:04] Grim_Stoner: Greed is.... danger?
[2:33:06] mirohtomysoul: Maybe test if dying in overworld would also prompt endscreen?
[2:33:11] 19Null7: well.... to me the biggest danger is my lagging notebook LUL

[2:34:47] aeonep_: IskallMAN, the Ultimate Conspiracy Theorist and Private Detective

[2:40:46] loathriel: Don't know how that's all coded, but maybe you have modifiers from paradox that affect the player directly. Cascades must be tied to vault, but clumsy and maybe quant, rarity, etc are pasted to players in the vault. Just an expanded thought on what can be happening

[2:58:17] Phoenix_025: Do you think that at level 99+ that legendary modifer should have like a base of +10% chance. without modifiers..so98 would be 0% but 99 give you a 10% chance of it being legendary without modifiers.. (10% might be too high just giving a random number)

[2:59:14] strandberggg: +10??
[2:59:15] LillyDaemon: "Hope for the best but plan for the worst"
[2:59:16] KJAERB0: Omgea hits
[2:59:16] lazypandaman: but you will curse the vault and that is bad enough
[2:59:17] zeus_o9o2: thanos alter here cool
[2:59:19] vishwa74: Uber pylon
[2:59:21] slimboyrobin: +10 strength üëÄ
[2:59:23] the_oscar_cat: +30 damage, nice
[2:59:24] Ganunbrar: 4 minutes till curse
[2:59:26] mahik750: Mindset is important, sure, but sometimes no matter how positive you are, things will be bad. When you start to feel like that you being not positive enough was the cause for things taking a wrong turn, is when it becomes a problem in my experience.
[2:59:26] notTheRealHelmis: oml the god challenge
[2:59:32] doylehead: curse incoming
[2:59:36] Tjidobo: The negative outlook false portays has made me stop watching her, tbh. It got me down :(
[2:59:45] victor_2504: what is hunter spect into?
[2:59:58] johneaplseed: hey chat - What is PUI?
[3:00:02] gaymersalsa: !poi
[3:00:02] Nightbot: PoI are points of interest. Places where you can get loot and fight mobs.
[3:00:03] redstonedad: For pessimist it's easier to expect the worst because they don't like disappointment
[3:00:14] shivcake_: can you not be a realist?
[3:00:14] zeus_o9o2: @johneaplseed poi point of interest
[3:00:18] gaymersalsa: WHAT unicorns arent real? D:
[3:00:18] Artorias921: Yesterday I had an issue with the vault curse, I got fading and my health bar had instantly drained to a half a heart after I fell from a little cliff and received some little damage. I don't know if it's a common bug so I decided to tell you @iskall85 <3
[3:00:19] leo2369q: why is there not an option for realist
[3:00:20] lazypandaman: iskall don't say that, thats my dream
[3:00:25] k1_setae: WHAT? its not?! i know theres unicorns
[3:00:25] johneaplseed: thanks!
[3:00:27] aishikrana125: Actually you thinking positive or negative doesn't effect anything happening in your life. you just tend to notice positive or negative events more based on your thinking.
[3:00:31] kibaz_x: ITS NOT??
[3:00:31] runtels: Optimistic Realism
[3:00:32] Speederxxl: box of chocolates
[3:00:33] gaymersalsa: @leo2369q so choose the 3rd option idk man
[3:00:34] BONNe1704: Where is the option to be realist?
[3:00:36] plantcraftie: if something nice happens, I just remind myself to reaaally enjoy it
[3:00:47] gaymersalsa: omg ...... no poll for u guys i get it Smadge
[3:00:48] Vossela: Its important to enjoy the wonder of the world and not get drowned in difficulties
[3:00:51] Danymaddox: with that mindset you are blaming all depressed people because 'they do not try enough' or because 'they have not the right mindset'
[3:00:54] Loclogic: Frame everything as a learning experience
[3:00:54] Danymaddox: and thats fkuedup
[3:00:56] Knew_It_Owl: It's important to stay positive, but it's not a bad thing to be negative every once in a while
[3:00:59] tangerinedoro: personally i've done volunteering all my life and i am a firm believer that humanity is good and we should love each other more
[3:01:01] pavan089: did you unlock god armour?
[3:01:03] ViciTheTenorOon: I was always told to expect the best and prepare for the worst
[3:01:05] LowKeyChemist: being open to opportunities is so important for emotional health
[3:01:06] Fiona_Fancypants: or some years
[3:01:06] BONNe1704: @gaymersalsa Whos fault is that poll is wrong?
[3:01:12] tangerinedoro: @Danymaddox i'm depressed and i disagree
[3:01:12] lazypandaman: oh i want snow here
[3:01:13] gaymersalsa: @pavan089 he will get it at level 100
[3:01:14] DrafonFly2278: Snow!?
[3:01:16] angelwitch25: Life does not owe you happiness
[3:01:17] gaymersalsa: @gaymersalsa yours :3
[3:01:17] rickyboi10101: ornate
[3:01:18] HazzaBazza9: a horse with a horn isn‚Äôt real, yet we have giraffes which are way weirder
[3:01:21] zeus_o9o2: we arent uploading the treasure chest vid one in which ..........
[3:01:23] SilentWife: if you will tell yourself everyday that everything is against you it will be against you in your minda
[3:01:23] Baab83: WHy live in sweden when you dont like snow
[3:01:27] 0mango1: rng snow
[3:01:28] SebastiaanO: i strive to be a positive realist
[3:01:34] BONNe1704: @gaymersalsa you would wish :D
[3:01:35] Fiona_Fancypants: yea. but complaining about the weather is just silly
[3:01:40] Lakosius2: the chances that it will snow in sweden are more than 0% NOTED
[3:01:40] siri_mor: my teachers used to say I'd hate snow later but I still love it years later
[3:01:40] Speederxxl: sweden is beautifull this time a year @iskall85
[3:01:40] mahik750: On that note, we need a rare mob in the vault who is helping you! So that not the whole vault is agains you iskHeart
[3:01:40] xverion_: Check dm's when you got a sec
[3:01:44] victor_2504: Hey iskall, do you mean like manifesting good things? Like if you try and manifest a good time, then you will notice the good times more and then it feels like you have manifested it
[3:01:45] notTheRealHelmis: sometimes people complain because they're sharing their feelings
[3:01:48] gaymersalsa: @xverion_ omg spill
[3:01:52] mukul_25: But if you think bad is going to happen and if it does you don't get sad and if good happen you will be much happier
[3:01:53] youngtubbie: social media also gives a bad example of how life 'should' be. Kids look up to that way to much, instead of living their own they admire the vloggers etc.
[3:01:54] LobsterCanary: I once heard a woman commenting "Typical!" to her daughter when it started raining ‚Ä¶
[3:01:55] KJAERB0: A guy with a red beard and a skateboard
[3:01:55] Danymaddox: i am severely depreseed and hearing that its my fault becuse i do not have the right mindset when i constantly try to bring happiness but always seems like its not enught just huts
[3:01:55] thatmfdes: in my work the entire philosophy is hope for the best, prepare for the worst
[3:01:57] willsly123: What if you have a friend with a snow machine Iskall
[3:01:58] mirohtomysoul: Optimism isn't really being naive, though. Naivety is running into things blindly and not being aware about the risks/denying the existence of risks. Optimism is knowing the risks, acknowledging them and still going in hoping for a positive outcome
[3:01:59] queenchazzy_: wait there isnt??
[3:02:01] Knew_It_Owl: In the Netherlands.. complaining about the weather is a ingrained part of our culture lol
[3:02:04] henks50: snow is so rng, they should remove it in the next uipdate
[3:02:06] the_whtvr: we live in a simulation, don't worry
[3:02:08] jamesmccann1245: nice save
[3:02:13] maloki: I'm an eternal optimist.
[3:02:14] plantcraftie: @Danymaddox It's different, you're sick
[3:02:17] domina_fox: I love the snow. Even when I have to give myself an extra 45 min to get to work
[3:02:18] Danymaddox: hurts to try with all you have and then failing always. And hurts even more hearing that its your fault
[3:02:19] Onne: @Knew_It_Owl Truee, it's never good enough
[3:02:19] maloki: And it's very frustrating sometimes :D
[3:02:21] ilikecheesecusitsgood: what if everything is a simulation and the simulation is designed to be against you
[3:02:26] k1_setae: Soo i feel like fading in 1min?
[3:02:27] Speederxxl: @Knew_It_Owl if we dont complain we arent dutch right? :P
[3:02:28] bikerboyGR: even the weather nowadays is RNG iskall LUL
[3:02:30] siri_mor: @Knew_It_Owl but at the same time go everywhere by bike regardless of weather
[3:02:30] faefair: weather goblin cackling to himself as he pushes the snowstorm lever
[3:02:34] gaymersalsa: irrelevancy Chatting
[3:02:34] Jarethkor: if you increase XP from mob kills, onslaught is gonna be LIT!  Can't wait....
[3:02:34] the_tim7: the world is about eating eggs
[3:02:34] staniobro: @knew_it_owl haahahah vandaag is het best prima weer hoor
[3:02:38] tangerinedoro: optimism is good and sometimes you need to be naive if you want to survive in this hellscape
[3:02:39] EndangeredTac0: 1 minute until fading...
[3:02:41] Therank2100: I live in Australia. If you dont want the snow pass it down my way please
[3:02:42] notTheRealHelmis: soulless
[3:02:42] lazypandaman: in a few years we get an evaluation if we did well, or we go to heaven or in total blackness
[3:02:42] zeus_o9o2: guess the curse dylan
[3:02:44] gaymersalsa: MAHIK
[3:02:44] Onne: @Speederxxl LUL
[3:02:56] Knew_It_Owl: @staniobro geen idee, ik heb de gordijnen nog niet open gedaan xD
[3:02:57] Mynestyne: You can laugh or cry. Might as well laugh.
[3:03:03] LunaaaaXO: hiii Iskall <3

[3:03:24] VogelVrouw: If only it was that easy, even cognitive behaviour therapy was basically useless for me
[3:03:25] ddaffy_: If you believe you're going to have a good day chances are you'll have a good day
[3:03:25] plantcraftie: @Knew_It_Owl ofc, because the Dutch keep their curtains open
[3:03:26] ThingamabobMC: basically if you‚Äôre still breathing and alive‚Ä¶. it‚Äôs a good day
[3:03:26] heighleybaily: I enjoy the challenge of life
[3:03:26] GhoulHunter811: i feel whatever i think the complete opposite happens, i think positive then negative happens or vice versa
[3:03:30] illycat_: psychskall
[3:03:34] pursued__toast: therapy-skall!
[3:03:35] pootch_1: God curse time
[3:03:36] Vossela: Also if you really struggle with feeling like everything is against you start writing things down all the little things that felt nice or just okay and then at the end of the day look at it
[3:03:36] cl4sh3r_69: WiseSkall
[3:03:37] tangerinedoro: thank you!! it's so good to have emotions!!

[3:03:56] omkaarr: door
[3:03:57] supermarcus11: Door?
[3:03:58] AcePetrichor: I believe that if you look for positives with will find more, same with negatives. The more you look for the more you find
[3:03:59] lazypandaman: @gaymersalsa thats the purpose of Dylans, be not helpfull so Iskall can be humble and good

[3:04:14] notTheRealHelmis: chromatic iron spawn rates YEP
[3:04:15] WisePanther: i try to always be an optimist but some cases require me to be a realist. i think there is a choice that has to be made on how you look at things depending on the situation

[3:04:36] TobyButt89: How does lethal interact with crit hit resistance?
[3:04:37] beefy_booty: My husband and I say 5 good things that happened to us at the end of the day. Ends the day on a positive note. Some days we have bad days and the things we're thankful for are like, having food, having a warm bed. But it's always helpful
[3:04:41] Mynestyne: noice
[3:04:43] SMO_SG: Would it be fun if there was a food that when you eat it you get 20 minutes but you get down to 0,5 hearts..... montan53Uwu montan53Uwu

[3:05:26] Enirom__: it should be a chance to lose one
[3:05:26] bas3j: Could you go negative?
[3:05:26] k_62256: then it feels too scary to try
[3:05:26] kat999xx: would sicourage peole from attempting them not?
[3:05:26] StandaSK: nah, failing to pray doesn't seem like a thing that happens
[3:05:26] itzliam_222: YES
[3:05:26] Vossela: for us strugglers that can be a BIG detriment
[3:05:26] DraamaQ: what happens with paradox rooms then?
[3:05:27] auszgrill: i would never have any points
[3:05:27] Hymdallr: no god pls noo
[3:05:27] Carbon031: maybe a chance
[3:05:27] unknownrek: Its a disrespect to the god that you didn't try hard enough
[3:05:27] Thomlennix: People do not like to click them because they are to hard already. So will be even less used if penalty is bigger
[3:05:28] seanlego23: Because emotions
[3:05:28] ono95: noooooo
[3:05:28] nerdoidaao: only if you get a reputation guareteed
[3:05:29] omkaarr: loosing would be harsh
[3:05:29] DasRosi: you could make it a chance
[3:05:29] daydaily123: it‚Äôs a feel bad
[3:05:29] beefy_booty: I feel like there should be a chance
[3:05:29] Jarethkor: So if you fail a vault you should lose XP too, right?
[3:05:30] Mudblood_king_7: IT makes perfect sense
[3:05:30] gaymersalsa: everybody is thinking EMOTIONALLY rn hryLaf
[3:05:30] Mynestyne: Yes but.....I no want
[3:05:30] CyberGeiger: Because you only get a *chance* to get one in the first place
[3:05:30] augustasman: nononono irs so hard to get them
[3:05:30] mrjackal85: Three strikes and minus one
[3:05:30] shaydeejay: actually true tbh
[3:05:30] sparkkd: horrible idea
[3:05:30] gcox2012: At the very least have a percentage chance of losing a point
[3:05:30] forzawin: gaining rep is random chance so losing rep shouldn't be guaranteed
[3:05:31] spurlucke: It should have been like that
[3:05:31] the_whtvr: either a chance to lose or if it's always lose then make it 100% to get one when completing
[3:05:31] iljalz: i mean, it does make sence
[3:05:31] Tinokk85: Logically, but it is REALLY punishing and "feels bad"
[3:05:31] kagtobio: i was actually thinking that earlier today
[3:05:32] faefair: feel like the gain would have to be more likely
[3:05:33] Xaeilla: Because the gods appreciate you trying
[3:05:33] swordo3612: Makes sense
[3:05:33] thatmfdes: no
[3:05:34] Oo_rjit: chance
[3:05:34] f4ty7th3e: make it a chance of losing reputation maybe
[3:05:35] Raynj12: You lose rep for trying?
[3:05:35] redstonedad: Iskall flaring up the player base
[3:05:35] Wyharn_Guardian: Because you aren't guarenteed a point at success either
[3:05:35] gamingwithtoimen: only if you have them ofcourse but would be a good idea
[3:05:36] captiandinos75: it should be a chance
[3:05:36] cl4sh3r_69: on hard mode only?
[3:05:36] SeriousLove: too much bad emotions for a pleb like me
[3:05:36] Ruemis: because gods are supposed to be genourous
[3:05:36] bln_emo: i hope ur just making a point
[3:05:36] ramnite_tv: At least make it based on 100-%affinity instead of 100% KEKW
[3:05:37] Wizard_Chach: Maybe after 3 in a row
[3:05:37] supermonkeyfart: If so, show what the challenge is before you pick it up
[3:05:37] ominouselemental: Some you just cant complete because of constraints in specific dungeon
[3:05:37] MaraudingBacon: that would make the goes not worth it. coz im not amazing at the game i NEVER get to do paradox
[3:05:37] Tazzad: "logically" dude you're talking about gods. theres n othing logic about them
[3:05:37] Loclogic: Make it the same chance as getting a point
[3:05:38] lorcan_oilcan: make it a percentage chance not a definete thing
[3:05:38] iansi: I just got here
[3:05:38] EnslavedMoist: because you rarely get one for completion but lose one every time
[3:05:39] ShapNine: They are merciful gods
[3:05:39] witje321: yes, but on the same chanche to keep it  as wether you would gain a favor
[3:05:39] xProxari: make it a chance like getting one?
[3:05:40] Retromom702: Zoom goes chat
[3:05:40] nasrou85: No
[3:05:41] Steinsoldat: becouse i will breake my keyboard
[3:05:41] trashgamer300: I get the reason but it would be kinda annoying
[3:05:42] TheNewDingo: because you already get a debuff. now you are saying 2 debuffs?
[3:05:42] lazypandaman: but if you have difficult challenges, it is the same you would lose a stack on ascending crystal
[3:05:42] DragolicSoul: their should be a chance like 2%
[3:05:42] illycat_: your affinity with that god should asoo be your chance to lose a point
[3:05:42] Gorbyas: already hard as is
[3:05:42] silvain_shadows: they're hard enough to get already. it'd be fine if they're a lot easier
[3:05:42] Danymaddox: @baboochka_ thanks <3
[3:05:43] WynterGStorm: should have a chance to fail equal to the percentage you don‚Äôt get the reputation
[3:05:43] the_flerken: yes, but depending on affinity maybe?
[3:05:43] Foxee1013: but the gods are merciful, right???  right???
[3:05:44] SilentWife: because you will be more hesitate to take in the first place
[3:05:44] gimmy_o4: Has the paradox Vault already happend or is he Waiting for lvl 100?
[3:05:44] xsmilesx: it should be equal to the chance to get a favor
[3:05:44] shad_is_sleepy: I think ther3 should be a chance to lose. Adds risk factor
[3:05:44] myster_ious_iroh: what about paradox?
[3:05:44] iansi: What is happening??
[3:05:44] DanMetroArnold: !bingo
[3:05:45] Nightbot: Get your HCVH BING card here! Note: there are more squares than you might generate SeemsGood https://bingobaker.com/#65a259586e396f25
[3:05:47] sh4dow_d3mon: Cu it feels bad kekw
[3:05:47] zeus_o9o2: this man
[3:05:47] chypher18: man got the choke point for the reputation points
[3:05:47] winricheichinger: it‚Äôs a double feel bad
[3:05:48] fin03103: it should depend on how close you werre to completing the challenge. if you completely fail you should loose rep, but if you were very close, the chance to loose rep should scale
[3:05:49] gaymersalsa: dylan stop being EMOTINAL Ledditing
[3:05:49] FrostiTosti: does make sense but maybe make it a chance like gaining one
[3:05:50] Sea_Jay27: More risk the better the reward
[3:05:50] ThEUNKnoWN0208: ADDS More negatives to the thing than negative
[3:05:51] moriahberry14: lore-wise that makes sense I think
[3:05:51] GhoulHunter811: cause it isnt confirmed to get one everytime we do @iskall85 !!!! but -1 when we dont?
[3:05:51] runtels: Shouldn't gods show forgiveness?
[3:05:52] doylehead: shoild be (100-favor chance)% chance
[3:05:52] Kveeez: it will be 0 reputation with all
[3:05:52] shamandude1: dont
[3:05:52] enyo81: why every time u fail you dont get one every time thats a bot unfair
[3:05:52] YukioRX: The chance of losing 1 rep point should be the same as gaining one rep point
[3:05:53] shook_2190: IT MAKES SENSE, I THOUGHT IT ALREADY WORKS THAT WAY
[3:05:53] profesorpineaple: Challenges too hard, most players could never build enough points.
[3:05:53] auszgrill: chance to loose maybe
[3:05:55] mrkangabeaver: like half the time or something like that
[3:05:55] an_addled_mind: double punishment?
[3:05:56] aeonep_: I think it should have a chance of losing reputation, at the inverse chance of your affinity
[3:05:58] vimick: Now he gets ornates lol
[3:06:00] maulderman: I got the bingo from ask chat for game design thingy
[3:06:00] forzawin: shouldn't completing it guarantee a point though?
[3:06:00] Artemiz_Prime: On hard, have it be a chance.
[3:06:01] MunchNL: but then you should be able to complete them after the timer without any bonus
[3:06:01] strainjp: chance to lose one is good, but not 100% of the time
[3:06:01] sabrina1202r: they are difficult enough
[3:06:02] ramnite_tv: 100-%affinity chance to lose reputation?
[3:06:02] PsychicArcher: I feel if you fail like 2 or 3 times then you loose a reputation
[3:06:02] angelwitch25: i work hard for those
[3:06:02] pootch_1: How did I lose rep then
[3:06:02] n0bodyrl: its like a god giving a present, people don't take presents back
[3:06:05] angrrrrydad: ok its gonna feel bad as its forcing the player to focus on the quest @iskall85
[3:06:05] Darkwytchcraft: because for some of us Gods are like parents and you'd like to think that because you did something wrong or made a mistake they won't hold it against you
[3:06:05] captiandinos75: like the chance of getting the reputation point
[3:06:06] Vintage_Thief: very harsh
[3:06:07] bestbla: @iskall85 because if u complete one  u are not garanteed to get one so losing one if u don't complete sound kinda of unfair
[3:06:07] MikeyPi_: Maybe only for hard difficulty
[3:06:07] toomuchinertia: make it RNG like the reputation
[3:06:07] merlijnchkia: @iskall85 them if you have lets say 15 reputation why would you ever click an alter again\
[3:06:08] defucsia: You are already punished with the curse, are you not?
[3:06:08] EnslavedMoist: the higher the affinity the higher the change to lose a reputation point
[3:06:08] ViciTheTenorOon: I would argue the gods don't hate you just cause you failed?
[3:06:11] faefair: inverse chance of your affinity
[3:06:12] MaraudingBacon: so basically you are saying you have to be good at the game to be able to do paradox vaults?
[3:06:13] LillyDaemon: Oh, that's mean but it would definitely give people mere incentive to finish them
[3:06:14] the_whtvr: maybe the higher the affinity the bigger the chance to lose reputation?
[3:06:14] DragolicSoul: like 10% of afinity
[3:06:14] EnteQuackQuack02: you get punished in vault already, no need to take old achievements away
[3:06:14] stefono4: Make it equal, the same chance as getting a point
[3:06:14] TobyButt89: The more affinity you have the more forgiving the god is
[3:06:14] locar_io: maybe when there is a clue of the objective
[3:06:15] MuumiJumala: i complain about double reward!
[3:06:15] reverendheart44: That make sense, I like it. Makes them more relevant over the course of the entire play through rather than just a vault which you can bail on
[3:06:16] iljalz: HEH
[3:06:16] SomeeOne123: Not getting a reputation point every time you win a challenge, but losing a reputation every time you lose a challenge is not really balanced is it?
[3:06:16] rain_9991: True that
[3:06:16] karthavya: sir there is already a bad thing when not completing a god altar
[3:06:17] gaymersalsa: @gimmy_o4 not yet, it was bugged again earlier
[3:06:17] Alflington: loose 2 in a row and loose 1
[3:06:17] zeus_o9o2: i mean ......
[3:06:17] DraamaQ: what if it has like 50% chance of removing one?
[3:06:17] awkwardbugger: When I first did them, that's what I thought would happen. But I think it would be too difficult
[3:06:18] Retromom702: You get a curse.  That is the negative of not completing
[3:06:18] nerdoidaao: I think it's a great idea, but then the chance to win a point would need to be higher. what happens if you don't have any point?
[3:06:18] mihea13: You don't get one 100% when you complete a good challenge
[3:06:19] mirohtomysoul: I would not say immediate loss, because that is not in line with how you get god challenges and reputation. Maybe implement a chance of losing one, just like completing a god altar gives a chance of getting a reputation?
[3:06:19] sparkkd: if you're going to lose a point then increase the chance of getting one
[3:06:19] LunaaaaXO: !commands
[3:06:20] mahik750: it could be a low chance of that happening
[3:06:20] AcePetrichor: You should fail a few in a row, because reputation is not guaranteed
[3:06:22] Ivica_INT: xd
[3:06:23] buzzi1919: Fun you get ornate right after god favor
[3:06:24] SuiSyth: SuiSyth subscribed at Tier 2. They've subscribed for 25 months! the chance of either a negative effect or losing a rep point?
[3:06:24] gaymersalsa: !commands
[3:06:25] Nightbot: @gaymersalsa -> The bot commands for this channel are available at https://nightbot.tv/t/iskall85/commands
[3:06:25] the_flerken: higher affinity = less chance of reputation loss
[3:06:25] chrisw333: You don't always get reputation
[3:06:28] juxtaposed39: if you have 66% affinity the chance of losing a point should be 34%
[3:06:29] Lamoan_: it bad because you both getting cursed in vault and lose the reputation point, its better to have single negative
[3:06:29] kibaz_x: The more affinity, the less chance to lose reputation because the god can "forgive" you
[3:06:29] Dewonos: not straight up lose point, perhaps debuff that lowers chance to gain reputation for next few altars
[3:06:30] QKhanh2308: you seem to lose more rep than gaining rep if that's the way it work
[3:06:30] strandberggg: u missed 2 chests
[3:06:31] buuch4k: what happens with the divine paradox‚Ä¶?
[3:06:32] Vossela: well if you make that happen it WILL mean that i will no longer be doing the altars since im not that good and then ill just ignore everything god related
[3:06:33] williampayne23: if god challenges are balanced to have a 50% win rate then people can‚Äôt accrue reputation
[3:06:33] pursued__toast: take the inverse of the affinity for a chance or loosing reputation.
[3:06:34] muttpacket: i think actually getting it at this point is too hard. I would go into the negatives..
[3:06:35] cozmo42: I‚Äôm complaining about double reward, happy now?
[3:06:35] victor_2504: Yes I think its logical, but its a feel bad moment
[3:06:35] ChaoticTom31: go back to the old school chance to anger the vault gods. small chance to anger and loose one
[3:06:36] SilentWife: maybe if you will know what is the challenge, then you could decide, like know when you have a ridiculous amount of ornate chest and you will not hunt them
[3:06:37] eijun2: Hello
[3:06:37] AeIaen: god is disappointed that you failed  and based on affinity there is a chance that you loose  reputation point  @iskall85
[3:06:37] ThatHairyGuyOG: Reputation is SO RARE
[3:06:37] jochpi: Yes but a % change just as high as gaining one. so you are focussed on completing but not get bad luck every time. The more point in a god you've got the higher teh change to lose a reputation. IMO
[3:06:38] MarkDatter: Yeet the favors and curses then.
[3:06:38] GhoulHunter811: maybe at high affinityyy yess buttt not when u have 10%
[3:06:38] sanikdusst: they are difficult and makes you sad enough when u lose it already making player sadder doesnt makes you happier iskall..
[3:06:38] firemind0: Only after 2 fails, after the first fail the god altar gets harder because the god is angry at you.
[3:06:39] gunhippy: God alters give you a chance of a double rewards. So surely make it a chance of double punishment?
[3:06:41] kstack_1020: so make it to where you get one or the other not both
[3:06:41] LowKeyChemist: My main objection is that we don't know what they are going to be before hand. I get that they are going to be tough, but sometimes I'm specced out for treasure hunting but not mob killing and that would affect whether I choose to attempt a god challenge.
[3:06:42] illycat_: if you are putting more affinity into a god the god will be more disappointed if you fail
[3:06:43] Retromom702: But it is a chance for double reward.
[3:06:43] lazypandaman: we are human, double reward is good, but double negative is not motivating
[3:06:43] gaymersalsa: i liek that
[3:06:44] zeus_o9o2: god loves us iskHeart iskHeart
[3:06:44] sboggsie02: the same chance you have to get a rep point you also have to lose if you fail
[3:06:44] silvain_shadows: sir this is a deeply toxic idea please dont
[3:06:45] gimmy_o4: @gaymersalsa aah oke thanks ‚ù§
[3:06:45] CaptainGoldSkull: lower affinity u have, the more likely it is for u to lose a reputation point, as you are "representing the god" less and so theyre less likely to forgive you for not completingg
[3:06:45] k_62256: then it feels like the vault has to be purpose prepared for doing god altars not a challenge within a vault
[3:06:45] catatonic51: You don't always get rep point so can't always take one away
[3:06:48] Garnail20: 100% - affinity chance to lose a point
[3:06:48] gmark5: Reputation points aren‚Äôt guaranteed can you do an alter so losing them when you don‚Äôt know
[3:06:48] unknownrek: YEP
[3:06:49] aeonep_: If you have lots of affinity (eg by modifying a vault with charms), it shouldn't punish you - in that instance, 100% affinity means 0% chance of losing a rep
[3:06:50] Noni_230: lose a rep but if u go back to altar i get in back
[3:06:50] k1_setae: Is it intentional that if you have done all favors you still need to redo them multiple times to max out paradx?
[3:06:50] Garnail20: yes
[3:06:51] doylehead: yes
[3:06:51] Gorbyas: so maybe a chance of 100-affinity % to lose a point
[3:06:51] GhoulHunter811: YESS
[3:06:53] PyreoftheLiving: Losing something you work towards is never a good feeling if its just random
[3:06:53] DraamaQ: and only a chance of it losing on
[3:06:53] williampayne23: you‚Äôd have to balance for >50% win rate
[3:06:53] juxtaposed39: yes
[3:06:53] jallyhoo: Yes, you have failed to prove your dedication, but it should be a chance.
[3:06:53] DrafonFly2278: Negative reputation?
[3:06:54] bikerboyGR: it's way easier to lose a rep than gain one
[3:06:54] leo2369q: missed a chest
[3:06:54] WynterGStorm: yes
[3:06:55] witje321: yes
[3:06:55] EnteQuackQuack02: yes
[3:06:55] shurtugal84x: Fail 5 and loose a point
[3:06:57] illycat_: it should be 80%
[3:06:57] Loclogic: Ja
[3:06:57] ThatHairyGuyOG: I NEVER get the reputation BRUH
[3:06:58] TobyButt89: The higher the affinity the more forgiving the god
[3:06:58] LowKeyChemist: that makes sense
[3:06:58] jazjez: You missed atleast 2 chests sadge
[3:06:59] ViciTheTenorOon: That'd make sense
[3:06:59] suvichan2005: yes
[3:06:59] mukul_25: Or vice versa
[3:06:59] tangerinedoro: yesssss
[3:06:59] ddaffy_: Maybe it should be if you get favor no bonus
[3:07:00] strainjp: Yeah shouldnt be 100%
[3:07:00] the_whtvr: I'd make it the other way around
[3:07:00] aeonep_: Yes, exactly like that
[3:07:01] borkbork_bork_: I can vibe with that
[3:07:03] faefair: that seems fair
[3:07:03] razlack1: I hate getting rewarded... iskHeart
[3:07:03] Oo_rjit: just like a gaining has a chance same with  losing Favour
[3:07:04] mrkangabeaver: Yes
[3:07:04] Gorbyas: thats acceptable
[3:07:05] z_e_ns: same concept there is for fortune and ores
[3:07:06] the_flerken: yes
[3:07:06] gaymersalsa: buff for charms is also good
[3:07:06] lynx235: if you make it a percentage chance like getting the reputation
[3:07:06] TheReaperOf1985: Same prosent to lose as to gain is ok
[3:07:06] caligbolt: yes
[3:07:07] beefy_booty: Yes
[3:07:09] EndangeredTac0: I like that
[3:07:10] lady_vorbarra: Yes
[3:07:10] winricheichinger: From a gamedesing perspective it would be better. However, the emotions say, i lost the challenge and now i should be punished as well. I tried my best‚Ä¶
[3:07:10] e88mars: Would the fact you tried to show devotion and failed be taken into account?
[3:07:12] sh4dow_d3mon: I wouldn't lose points under 5 maybe?
[3:07:13] moriahberry14: how would that affect divine paradox?
[3:07:13] lorcan_oilcan: yeah then tears could act like trapdisarm
[3:07:14] augustasman: Im lvl 86 nd I got only one reputation point, they are hard enouth now.
[3:07:14] plantcraftie: ask Stress
[3:07:16] bibabuzzelman: or having the charm on can prevent it for that god
[3:07:17] TheTechnoWaffle: Could be really interesting at higher vault difficulties IMO, but maybe not for all the casual players on normal and below
[3:07:17] AlliBlueS: then i am not doing god favours, it will be too punishing
[3:07:18] helenananaishere: could depend on the god - a vengeful god might punish failure, whereas a benevolent god wouldn‚Äôt
[3:07:18] Codeman750: That is totally balanced ide!
[3:07:19] proshooter27_: what about 0 rep points?
[3:07:20] thatmfdes: item is only if you go back that‚Äôs an opt in
[3:07:22] Raynj12: It would hurt the beginning game
[3:07:22] Retromom702: If it is % of chance then it makes sense.
[3:07:22] jeeukko_: that could work
[3:07:23] Lyteat: what if you had to go back and pay respect or lose a reputation point within a time limit?
[3:07:24] an_addled_mind: but reputation isn't guaranteed
[3:07:25] markbudjames: maybe if you go back for the tear at the altar you dont lose the point
[3:07:25] proshooter27_: u go negative?
[3:07:26] stefono4: That sounds good off the top like that
[3:07:32] OneTrueSpry: I mean as long as the chance to earn reputation is higher I would definitely see it being good
[3:07:33] DragolicSoul: think inverse if you have 10 % afinity then 90% loss chance??????
[3:07:36] Thomlennix: Buff reward and penalty?
[3:07:36] f4ty7th3e: would hurt beginners tho
[3:07:40] AlliBlueS: its too punishing
[3:07:40] nerdoidaao: totally
[3:07:41] notTheRealHelmis: Ok - you have a chance of losing a faour instead of getting a curse. More likely to get a curse the more reputation with them you have
[3:07:42] Vintage_Thief: the difficulty is quite high. there shouldnt be a harsh punishment for failure. you could have a chance to lose the reputation
[3:07:44] chypher18: what if I have 0 reputation point on velara , then I fail like 3/4 challenges in a row ? will the accumulate as - points?
[3:07:44] CyberGeiger: Getting punished for being bad at the game is not a good mechanic imo. Trying should not be punished
[3:07:46] unknownrek: But also. skill issue
[3:07:46] mirohtomysoul: It shouldn't be 100% loss of reputation, bc it's also not a 100% chance of gaining it when completing it.
[3:07:47] chad_masters: What about percentage of the quest completed reducing likelihood
[3:07:48] gaymersalsa: bumble stress hryAdmire
[3:07:50] muttpacket: i think its allready difficult to gain one
[3:07:51] TheArcangel2362: What does accustomed do again
[3:07:51] ThatHairyGuyOG: That would kill the game for me
[3:07:51] basman333: does accustomed only apply after you take it. or for the whole vault
[3:07:52] MaraudingBacon: I would be ok with that if you didnt NEED the points for paradox vaults. BUT you could get stuck never gain points to do paradox
[3:07:54] angelwitch25: I do any god altar I see, I just love the challenge
[3:07:54] buuch4k: which room will be remove from the divine paradox‚Ä¶?
[3:07:54] kibaz_x: i'm waiting for good charms to focus on god challenges
[3:07:55] ddaffy_: Childish
[3:07:56] SMO_SG: I love it
[3:07:56] ViciTheTenorOon: I think it makes sense
[3:07:56] the_whtvr: shouldn't the god be more angry if you have high affinity? so failing with high affinity = losing reputation
[3:07:58] Jackkabuki: That sword looks amazing
[3:08:00] Darkwytchcraft: depends on what your gods personalities are
[3:08:00] rain_9991: Man if one's afraid of losing.. why playing in the first place? Losing is half the fun
[3:08:02] illycat_: stress is pro
[3:08:02] chrisw333: It's already difficult to even get a point
[3:08:02] myster_ious_iroh: paradox?
[3:08:02] Raynj12: But you start at zero percent reputation so you'd lose more than not in the early game
[3:08:02] DragolicSoul: stress giving stress
[3:08:03] strainjp: I think it helps extend the end game too
[3:08:03] Vossela: its fine if you want to do that but i wont do any god things anymore if thats the case
[3:08:04] KJAERB0: If getting points was easier for people they would porbably take the trade off
[3:08:05] winricheichinger: It is a great idea, but it will feel bad at times
[3:08:06] thatmfdes: could be game rule to opt in to favour loss?
[3:08:06] swordo3612: Iskall could you also nerf divine paradox because it completely break the game.
[3:08:08] mrkangabeaver: smartskall
[3:08:08] dcptcncrescendo: Maybe logical, but not fun
[3:08:09] bunta_1: Sounds OK as long as ya can prevent it
[3:08:09] Oo_rjit: makes sense ig
[3:08:10] LaboePlay: i think favors at lv100 is too hard already
[3:08:10] TheRedBrain: higher affinity -> higher chance to lose reputation, because the god is more disappointed @iskall85
[3:08:11] mudpiemaniac: maybe a chance to see what the challenge is before clicking on the altar? allows you to think more before committing to gaining/losing rep
[3:08:12] Shantt_o7: it would make getting to max for the armor that more rewarding
[3:08:12] shook_2190: THAT'll actually motivate you to do it more if you are working toward getting 25 reputation points.
[3:08:13] Spika55: Now what is the emotion people are going to feel towards that when it happens?
[3:08:15] gaymersalsa: would make paradox harder which is probalby a good thing?
[3:08:16] CyberGeiger: Imo trying to achieve something should not be punished
[3:08:17] lazypandaman: but i think it is the same reason why you don't lose a stack if you fail an ascending, you just reset
[3:08:18] bunta_1: Play on easy üòé
[3:08:19] TobyButt89: Losing hard earned reputation is good game design, but a game is meant to be fun, and loss isn't fun
[3:08:19] SilentWife: it will also make sense to gain the reputation point in one specific god
[3:08:19] pwn3dzilla: lol. i'm lvl100 and i fail them all the time
[3:08:23] mirohtomysoul: What would happen if you lose a rep point when you have none?
[3:08:24] Baab83: Do you also loose a room in the paradox vault?
[3:08:24] Sea_Jay27: What would happen when you stack multiple god tears, does that have an inverse effect with the other gods
[3:08:25] nerdoidaao: what happens if you have no points and lost?
[3:08:26] muttpacket: lvl 87 2nd playthrough ;)
[3:08:27] ViciTheTenorOon: Also you can play w/o reputation so it's not barring anyone from a key part of the game
[3:08:27] strandberggg: You can tell that minecrafters are not used to playing hard games
[3:08:28] Wyharn_Guardian: I've done 2 altars and gotten no affinity, if I always lose 1 for fail...
[3:08:28] CyberGeiger: Why don't you lose vault levels when you fail a vault?
[3:08:29] ThatHairyGuyOG: Iskall you're talking from your behind
[3:08:32] Xaeilla: I think that balance is good with affinity taken into account.
[3:08:32] plantcraftie: what if you get the champions quest over and over?
[3:08:33] Jarethkor: I don't think it is logical / illogical.  Some metrics are forward only -- you don't remove levels / XP when a player fails.  Is the favor a reputation where it goes up / down or is it like a level?
[3:08:34] Thirdeyechakra69: I thought that was how it was going to be from the beginning, but maybe it should be a hard mode thing
[3:08:34] jochpi: Its a great idea but i would say the % of losing depends on yer total reputation for that god. higher favour bigger chance to lose if you fail
[3:08:38] siri_mor: but then could you get negative reputation? :P no I think it makes sense
[3:08:40] LowKeyChemist: it definitely makes sense, but I'd like it more if I could see what the challenges are before accepting them
[3:08:43] renz32: I think its fine as long as its also a chance and not guaranteed
[3:08:44] thetiger711: please do another alter
[3:08:45] moriahberry14: after restarting and having the god quest come later I have to say I feel a lot better about the god favour system
[3:08:46] minipax84: Not going to lie, thought that was how it worked
[3:08:50] MottlyMC: surely that‚Äôs just a way of making it more of a time sink, already use time to gather the rep/fail occasionally/ vault looting time etc.
[3:08:50] gaymersalsa: lol
[3:08:51] hiphopmypotamus: #blameStress
[3:08:52] AlliBlueS: so you can go into negatives then??
[3:08:52] augustasman: Im lvl 86 and I got only one reputation point, they are hard enough now.
[3:08:55] Tazzad: also called bullshit
[3:08:55] DragolicSoul: lol
[3:08:57] gaymersalsa: OMEGALOOL
[3:08:57] sabrina1202r: lol
[3:08:57] JimmTim_: iskall ignore that guy you're spittin fax
[3:08:58] tamedbyfire: 100% chance of favour vs 100% chance of curse.. affinity based chance of rep gain, affinity based chance of rep loss. makes sense
[3:08:59] Jackkabuki: That dungeon is huge
[3:08:59] ms_crafty_: lol
[3:08:59] Tinokk85: Maybe increase the chance of losing a reputation point the more you fail. And that gets refreshed when you complete one.
[3:08:59] spurlucke: Talking s hit
[3:09:00] ViciTheTenorOon: Whoa what a special skill
[3:09:00] KJAERB0: LUL
[3:09:02] zeus_o9o2: what if one forgets to unspec hunter and then lose
[3:09:02] locar_io: lol
[3:09:02] Nightbot: www.youtube.com/iskall85 | www.twitter.com/iskall85 | https://youtube.com/@vodskall85
[3:09:03] toomuchinertia: calling you butthead
[3:09:04] Waliyounas: Lol
[3:09:04] 0mango1: LUL
[3:09:06] Ganunbrar: Yeah, you should turn around so we can hear you better
[3:09:06] muttpacket: the u13 changes finally made getting reputation obtainable.. ;)
[3:09:06] beefy_booty: KEKW People be angry
[3:09:07] SimekOne: behalf prob
[3:09:07] Ganunbrar: huehuehue
[3:09:07] sparkkd: no it really isn't
[3:09:07] HoboWith2Shotguns: same
[3:09:09] Ruemis: yeah
[3:09:11] Tjidobo: Je praat poep
[3:09:12] gaymersalsa: hryLaf
[3:09:13] Mynestyne: same. I lost one. why?
[3:09:13] robor_1: has anyone considered if the game is too easy then it wont be as fun?
[3:09:13] reverendheart44: I like the idea of 20% example you had, but if you want people to run it just as much then maybe higher loot is a possibility. Bring a gamble into it a little
[3:09:14] bljat99: Lmaoooo yes you talk from your buttox
[3:09:15] CyberGeiger: Don't remove a player's progress. It's like deleting items
[3:09:17] MarkDatter: People are just gonna almost never try the altar challenges unless they can get like 80% or more affinity, and its already not fun to do that
[3:09:17] MunchNL: in some vaults certain mobs spawn less and that makes some god quests very difficult
[3:09:18] mrkangabeaver: it makes sense
[3:09:19] SilentWife: skill issue
[3:09:20] oigy: I think it should be implemented, but i think it should be optional, personally i would not put it on atm but when im playing through Vh Again at a harder difficulty i would
[3:09:20] kibaz_x: skill issue lol
[3:09:22] TheRedBrain: @tamedbyfire yes
[3:09:22] WynterGStorm: I think you should make the chance to lose a reputation equal to the chance to gain one, otherwise lower tier players will basically never be able to gain points @iskall85
[3:09:22] mukul_25: Behalf I think they mean
[3:09:23] unknownrek: people talking about skill issue lmao
[3:09:27] GhostlyMarrow49: skill issue then
[3:09:27] Triphoon45: skillissue then
[3:09:27] FrostiTosti: tough luck then
[3:09:28] TGR33WUP: hallooo will this be on vodskall later today joined 3hrs late.
[3:09:29] maulderman: what did we tell you about using logic
[3:09:30] the_whtvr: it's logical if you lose reputation if affinity is high, because god would be more angry
[3:09:30] Artorias921: It can make things much more difficult considering random tasks and probability to lose the objective of the vault, but this idea is logical @iskall85
[3:09:32] StandaSK: can you go into negative then?
[3:09:33] Fiona_Fancypants: might be logical lorewise, but i feel they are already so hard.  I might just be bad at the game, but the people I am playing with are having trouble too. and I really want to try the paradox :(
[3:09:35] TobyButt89: @strandberggg ye and that's the point, if this wasn't a Minecraft mod then there'd be no issue but it's meant to be fun for people
[3:09:36] basman333: what happens in the herald
[3:09:39] AlliBlueS: how much into the negatives could you get then?
[3:09:39] Fiona_Fancypants: but i get the logic
[3:09:40] DanMetroArnold: Here's the compromise: make the chance of losing a reputation point depend on the number of times you've failed the God Altar... do it once, shame on you but do it consistantly and lose the point :P
[3:09:40] winricheichinger: be better at the game: if you forgot to unspec
[3:09:41] redstonedad: Git gud lol
[3:09:43] moriahberry14: @CyberGeiger that happens tho - you die in the vault you lose items
[3:09:45] supermarcus11: What if you flew into the floor?
[3:09:46] avian946: what If you forget your backpack lol
[3:09:47] lazypandaman: we need to praise our gods, they punish us as enough if we fail
[3:09:48] pootch_1: I thought that's what happened to me
[3:09:49] Nauhar: wait. what ? losing rep ? what did I miss ???
[3:09:49] nerdoidaao: thanks, that was my question
[3:09:49] HarryC621: From an "I LIKE TO PLAY OP" perspective I say no, but logically It actually makes a lot of sense
[3:09:49] gaymersalsa: @TGR33WUP today or tomorrow on the hcvh playlist
[3:09:50] grafpa1: Would it cause you to lose rooms in the paradox?
[3:09:51] MuumiJumala: if you could go to negative it would actually be a fun change
[3:09:51] jazjez: The higher the affinity with the god the more chance to lose a reputation point? As you are a more trusted agent, they trust you to finish it @iskall85
[3:09:51] FreudPlays: Champion altar challenge is painge
[3:09:51] Vossela: i will gladly admit im not good but so far i will accept the debuffs and take the chance at reputation but then i just wont since its not worth for me
[3:09:51] OneTrueSpry: Are you gonna make it to where you spend reputation points yo unlock the rooms?
[3:09:52] mirohtomysoul: Would this be something you would link to difficulty?
[3:09:52] Nightbot: Vault Hunters Reddit for you to check out! https://www.reddit.com/r/VaultHuntersMinecraft/
[3:09:52] bobbis80000: I belive that it would be a good idea however it its a garantee loss it would probebliy would not be that good
[3:09:54] LunaaaaXO: who made this mod pack? :o
[3:09:57] angrrrrydad: what if you have a difficult scav and have to focus on chests you dont need
[3:09:57] cozmo42: what if I lose track of time and die even when there are no mobs?
[3:09:57] shivcake_: what about the divine paradox then?
[3:09:58] supermonkeyfart: I think that would be ok, if you could see what the challenge is beforehand, so you can make a calculated decision
[3:09:59] zeus_o9o2: it was for you
[3:09:59] victor_2504: Maybe if the challange is already visible, people can choose if they want to try it or not. Then its not double RnG
[3:10:00] Felver08: @Iskall85 How would that work with architect vaults?
[3:10:03] sunnyr0ad: Iskall would you lose the rooms in your divine paradox?
[3:10:03] gaymersalsa: @HarryC621 SeemsGood i agree
[3:10:06] cl4sh3r_69: hard mode only?
[3:10:07] renz32: What would happen tho if for example you have a 4 reputation room opened and then lose reputation?
[3:10:09] basman333: what is the herald????
[3:10:10] strainjp: Good game design
[3:10:11] Cloudetix: I think the problem is that, even though the reward is great. The rewards reflects the time invested. If you are going to potentially add (let's say a third) more time to it, the rewards would have to reflect that to "feel" worth it
[3:10:11] MuumiJumala: add some unique debuffs for negative reputation and you have whole new aspect of replayability
[3:10:11] cl4sh3r_69: or optional?
[3:10:12] locar_io: monkaHmm
[3:10:12] VogelVrouw: I struggle with the mechanic but game design wise it is a good idea
[3:10:12] Therank2100: I mean its just like any other objective then right? Risk versus Reward and then choosing when to gamba and when not to becomes more meaningful
[3:10:14] Lush30: what would happen if you already "bought" a room in the divine paradox with the reputation and you lost it??
[3:10:16] woolfie0120: would you lose access to rooms that you‚Äôve already purchased if you lose reputation with that god?
[3:10:17] aishikrana125: what happens to the room we unlocked?
[3:10:17] mukul_25: Maybe increase the chances to find one
[3:10:19] maxmuster12321: What if you loose a point and then have too many paradox rooms
[3:10:19] ThatHairyGuyOG: Iskall: "I find it easy as the creator, so everyone who finds is hard lacks skill and is dumb"
[3:10:19] KJAERB0: Skill BIAS is the problem there
[3:10:19] gaymersalsa: butt
[3:10:19] angelwitch25: Then maybe give a better chance of getting a favour if you have no favour at all?
[3:10:22] myster_ious_iroh: how will it affect paradox vault? will it delete a room???
[3:10:22] strandberggg: Nothing is fun after a while if you always win @TobyButt89
[3:10:23] Jackkabuki: whats the maximum reputation you can have all together?
[3:10:25] Nightbot: For everything Vault Hunters, check out the website! https://vaulthunters.gg/
[3:10:25] chilibeeeee: What would happen to a crystal that was built after you lose a point?
[3:10:28] notTheRealHelmis: what you do is pretend you're gonna implement something more egregious to distract the ledditors
[3:10:29] merlijnchkia: i think that actively discourages taking alters for witch you dont have the charm
[3:10:29] moriahberry14: lore definitely makes sense
[3:10:33] TGR33WUP: @gaymersalsa thanks.
[3:10:35] kibaz_x: i like the idea that the gods can "forgive" you as well, like if you have very high affinity you could dodge the rep loss or even the curse
[3:10:36] MaraudingBacon: i just dont like the idea that you can lose all of your paradox vault progress
[3:10:36] zeus_o9o2: only 2 effects ??
[3:10:37] gaymersalsa: hryLaf
[3:10:41] az1mmer328: what if this only changes like hard difficulty so the casual players don‚Äôt feel it
[3:10:42] dcptcncrescendo: Maybe have casual mode not lose reputation?
[3:10:44] OneTrueSpry: If you make it consume the rep points to unlock rooms it would make sense maybe 1-3 rep for each room.
[3:10:44] Vintage_Thief: if you are not confident you can complete the altar challenge... dont accept the challenge?
[3:10:45] SomeeOne123: Would you lose reputation points at the same rate that you gain them? Or you lose them everytime you fail.
[3:10:47] faefair: the idea of a potion casting mega jump is so funny
[3:10:47] gaymersalsa: BROKE
[3:10:48] Alflington: How about if you don't complete an alter then R&G for curse or point loss
[3:10:48] ThisReallyIsMe: So what Iskall is saying is.... get gud....
[3:10:48] oigy: make it optional ?
[3:10:49] swordo3612: I agree with wutax
[3:10:49] mukul_25: hryLaf
[3:10:51] beefy_booty: I'm bad at the game, but I really like the balancing idea
[3:10:51] bibabuzzelman: the charm could prevent the loss for the specific god
[3:10:52] StylishM0nkey: @iskall85  did you respond to the reddit suggestions yet?
[3:10:53] TomAlJar: could have it as a game rule?
[3:10:55] corneelis0: What would happen to arcitect vaults if you have less than when you made it
[3:10:56] sparkkd: Wait until people get used to the new god altar system with the tears and then decide if you want to implement the removing of points
[3:10:56] sunnyr0ad: I think it‚Äôs logical, just wondering what happens to rooms you‚Äôve already bought in divine paradox, @iskall?
[3:10:56] Lashings: What about being able to anoint the altars before you click them to double the reward and challenge but double the loss if you fail.
[3:10:59] EricMTGCast: definitely should difficult scale.
[3:10:59] the_whtvr: then he should add separate difficulty for stuff :D
[3:11:00] hinsher116: maybe make it a gamerule?
[3:11:00] silvain_shadows: it makes SENSE but it would need a lot of adjustment to balancing, the majority of the playerbase aren't using altars already because of the difficulty
[3:11:04] mahik750: I think the chance to lose a reputation point should be equal to the chance of gaining one. If you have 100% of getting a reputation, you have 100% of a chance to lose one if you fail.
[3:11:12] Saranas: as a person with several disabilities and playing solo it is  very hard to understand and see what mobs, crates etc that have "my drops" that i need. The extremely small icons doesnt  helt
[3:11:15] Cooklet2000: Maybe the reputation points could be xp based so when you pass a task you get the amount of xp to "level up"(gain a point) but depending on the task you lose some xp which isn't a full level but it's like loosing progress with that god
[3:11:16] joeri_van: pick a goal and stick to it
[3:11:16] Krankmoar: Krankmoar subscribed with Prime. 
[3:11:17] brentos777: Maybe the reputation difficulty can be tied in with scaling objective difficulty on a different gamerule?
[3:11:20] LillyDaemon: Just have it scale with the difficulty level
[3:11:22] CyberGeiger: Why should I be punished for trying? Why not remove a vault level every time I fail a vault?
[3:11:25] LowKeyChemist: The more I think about it, the more I like it. But, I feel it would be better if the altars had the quest hovering over them.
[3:11:26] strainjp: Yeah good for end game
[3:11:27] swordo3612: True
[3:11:30] Pared_down: So you can be atheist in VH?
[3:11:30] muttpacket: but it is though.
[3:11:31] Ganunbrar: What if Wutax is just a figment of Iskall's mind? He seems to be able to read his mind already.
[3:11:34] notTheRealHelmis: "egregious" is like "insulting/bad"
[3:11:34] victor_2504: 5 min check
[3:11:36] moriahberry14: yeah god stuff is a side quest
[3:11:36] Vossela: so "ignore gods if youre bad"?
[3:11:36] zeus_o9o2: wutax said his point without saying anything and also convinved iskall
[3:11:37] SilentWife: no "get good" just learn to loose, not everything has to be OP to be enjoyable
[3:11:39] theycallmecap96: @iskall85 How would that system affect your divine paradox? Like, if you had 9 idona reputation points and have already used all 9 of those for rooms in your divine paradox. But then you fail a challenge and lose a point. Do you lose a room? Or is it still a permanent unlock?
[3:11:40] chilibeeeee: Would losing a point affect a pre-made crystal?
[3:11:40] Cathr7x: you could split difficulty into mob difficulty and game difficulty (Objective scaling, vault altars etc)
[3:11:43] ddaffy_: Side quest
[3:11:44] ranger1332: Gotta go, see you later Dylans
[3:11:45] thatmfdes: the idea and lore are excellent, for majority of players the way it‚Äôs added is what will matter
[3:11:46] gaymersalsa: @Ganunbrar now THERE is a conspiracy theory hryLaf
[3:11:46] mirohtomysoul: I like the idea, the probably of losing a rep point is similar to the probability of gaining one? Or reverse like you already said
[3:11:53] seanlego23: which rooms would you lose in the paradox vault if you lose a reputation?
[3:11:55] plantcraftie: i see the paradox as the end of the game, the actual end is optional
[3:11:56] Retromom702: Still need 7 more sir with 5 minutes
[3:11:59] an_addled_mind: it does make sense for lore reasons, but a guaranteed punishment would feel unbalanced with no guaranteed  reputation
[3:11:59] cl4sh3r_69: it‚Äôs a boost for players with skill which is good
[3:12:02] Lush30: @iskall85 what would happen if you already "bought" a room in the divine paradox with the reputation and you lost it??
[3:12:02] DORITOBUCKET: !13
[3:12:02] toomuchinertia: what happens when you loose a reputation but still have the room unlock in paradox
[3:12:06] the_flerken: you can add a gamerule for reputation point losing - just an idea in case a player explicitly wants to remove this challenge and have losing enabled by defauly
[3:12:07] autumspog: it‚Äôs the RNG that run a the alters, getting kill 8 tank mobs,
[3:12:08] gaymersalsa: üèÄ
[3:12:08] redstonedad: When Iskall says people aren't good enough at playing or haven't played enough wether he realizes it or not he's saying git gud
[3:12:10] Triphoon45: do the League of Legends shadow nerfs where you say you are going to nerf it but you really dont lol
[3:12:10] DORITOBUCKET: !update
[3:12:15] notTheRealHelmis: i like it
[3:12:21] zeus_o9o2: iskalls got a bit of balls no worries Kappa Kappa
[3:12:23] autumspog: and then running 4 rooms not getting a tank spawn on
[3:12:26] gaymersalsa: 7 braziers to go lol
[3:12:31] jackattack_657: @iskall85 is it just me or n archives i cant see the item its for
[3:12:33] gaymersalsa: !release @DORITOBUCKET
[3:12:33] Nightbot: Vault Hunters update 13 is live on the Hermitcraft Vault Hunters server for testing! Public release SOON, crucial bugs are being fixed. Check out vodskall85 for videos on update discussions!
[3:12:33] Vossela: heres a different suggestion: challenge tiers on god altars with higher chances but chances for loosing favor
[3:12:35] TomAlJar: can you get time modifiers from braisers
[3:12:35] GhoulHunter811: champions are nice with accoustomed aint it?
[3:12:36] dcptcncrescendo: It makes sense, but I don't like it anyway lol
[3:12:37] sh4dow_d3mon: At least U don't lose vault levels when you die lol
[3:12:38] TobyButt89: Honestly there should be only 2 difficulties to this game, fun and gamer. And gamer is every single idea everyone ever had to make the gamer harder, and fun is the actually fun version LUL LUL
[3:12:38] Jackkabuki: Maybe have the reputation limit at which you start losing with the others be Depending on Difficulty. So like easy is 50 medium 40 and hard 25
[3:12:43] 999nightmare999: Paradox is like the most exciting vault for me I was so hyped when u first announced it and still chase altars
[3:12:45] MuumiJumala: just look at vanilla minecraft, the updates were WAY better back when the devs were making it harder not easier
[3:12:54] StylishM0nkey: @gaymersalsa did he talk about the reddit suggestions post?
[3:12:54] vimick: 4 mins left
[3:12:55] sky_blast_: Add a new difficulty "story mode"  were the chicken could enjoy the game without any "negatives" :))
[3:12:56] LunaaaaXO: @iskall85 who do you think is the most creative hermit for building?
[3:12:57] mwooldridge: 4 1/2 mins left
[3:12:58] dswa_earl: What if you could see the task before you select it
[3:13:01] mahik750: Dare to upset the dylans
[3:13:02] winricheichinger: maybe add a cancel option in that case as well
[3:13:03] Retromom702: You are human sir.
[3:13:05] strainjp: More voices are good == you are listening :)
[3:13:05] gaymersalsa: @StylishM0nkey hmm dont think so, whisper me a link?
[3:13:06] maxmuster12321: @iskall85 What happens to the divine paradox if you have less points than when you built it?
[3:13:09] kinghingle: ee oo dares rodders britskall
[3:13:13] UTxMelina: :)
[3:13:14] Cloudetix: How are the god challenges chosen? Is ithere a set of different ones and it picks one at random? Or do they scale with level?
[3:13:20] strandberggg: no LOL
[3:13:20] Danymaddox: @maxmuster12321 nothing,  stays the same
[3:13:22] redstonedad: @jackattack_657 it's under the modifier but hard to see
[3:13:25] Lakosius2: Are the Voices with us right now in this room ?
[3:13:27] strandberggg: "I cant do it im gonna cancel it"
[3:13:28] Therank2100: Nah that makes it too easy
[3:13:29] gaymersalsa: @Lakosius2 kekw
[3:13:30] sunnyr0ad: Iskall would you lose rooms you‚Äôve already built in the divine paradox?
[3:13:32] trophy_bi: no you shouldn‚Äôt be able to cancel
[3:13:35] Lush30: what would happen if you already "bought" a room in the divine paradox with the reputation and you lost it??
[3:13:36] EricMTGCast: I was looking forward to Devine paradox but this will make it impossible for me. admittedly I am low skill.
[3:13:36] the_whtvr: would be cool if god altars gave you a menu like the archives in dungeons - 3 different quests to choose from
[3:13:37] DaNielJunek17: iskall maybe you should talk about this to grian one time you could maybe get some ideas from the wynncraft server which he has a role in since some things would be nice mainly how they handle deads and level scaling
[3:13:37] cozmo42: or show challenge before choosing it
[3:13:40] trophy_bi: that‚Äôs totally game breaking
[3:13:40] itsnotneon: noo thats stupid
[3:13:41] gaymersalsa: whats generous? Hmm
[3:13:42] thespectrescall: That would take away the risk factor
[3:13:43] joeri_van: make a offer to cancel haha
[3:13:44] MunchNL: or maybe be able to complete after timer without a loss
[3:13:44] Ganunbrar: Probably make it a player setting to be able to lose the rep or not.
[3:13:45] Tjidobo: All in baby!
[3:13:48] z_e_ns: maybe return to the altar to cancel?
[3:13:51] EnteQuackQuack02: maybe with an expensive consumable to cancel?
[3:13:52] SilentWife: preview of the challenge make more sense than cancel
[3:13:52] angelwitch25: Only cancel within the first 10 sec
[3:13:52] the_flerken: you can add cancel option and lose a reputation point without getting cursed
[3:13:52] Vintage_Thief: reputation loss if you fail, some other punishment to cancel
[3:13:54] CooldAtTV: What about a preview so you can "accept it"?
[3:13:55] omkaarr: only for a certain period like 5 seconds
[3:13:55] toomuchinertia: it should be only cancelation if near the altar
[3:13:55] Yesat: If you could "Cancel" within the first 10s maybe
[3:13:56] tangerinedoro: @DaNielJunek17 no i don't think so
[3:13:57] ChaoticTom31: oh now AT the alter, getting to choose the task like a modifier work bench would be AWESOME
[3:13:57] zeus_o9o2: wait why was there 2 options at archive table ?
[3:13:58] Jarethkor: Or how about show what the quest is ahead of time, like the braziers
[3:13:58] gunhippy: You'd surely want to penalise the cancel - like you'd lose uses on your charm
[3:13:59] impossible_321: Make a Command to disable it fore the Nopeers
[3:14:00] vimick: Cancel the quest but get double negative modifier
[3:14:00] Pipeeb_: make it a gamerule???
[3:14:02] redstonedad: Everyone would cancel at the end of the challenge
[3:14:03] leo2369q: can you beg for the gods forgiveness
[3:14:04] thatmfdes: cheese
[3:14:07] Lizerdman87: is it possible to make altar objectives scale with how much reputation you have?
[3:14:07] mrkangabeaver: mAkes PErfEct SensE
[3:14:08] Jackkabuki: Just have a cap that is displayed of total rep before you start losing that can be displayed next to the reputation points
[3:14:08] chypher18: it should show what requirements it needs to complete?
[3:14:13] Jarethkor: have it show "kill tank mobs", maybe not the amount
[3:14:14] mahik750: You can't just say "sorry changed my mind" to a god
[3:14:14] kinghingle: maybe more
[3:14:14] advcky: let us see the challenge before hand
[3:14:14] lorcan_oilcan: it could be a retuirn to the alter to cancel and it would give you the negative modifer but no rep loss
[3:14:17] gaymersalsa: if you cancel, you cant do another altar?
[3:14:18] trophy_bi: they will cancel as soon as they see it
[3:14:18] cl4sh3r_69: maybe a rare item that allows you to ‚Äòplease‚Äô the gods and be able to cancel them
[3:14:18] joeri_van: offering loot to an alter could be fun haha
[3:14:19] KJAERB0: Offering of something at the alter to do it might work
[3:14:20] EricMTGCast: canceling stores not make sense
[3:14:21] mmattzo: mke it expensive
[3:14:21] jackattack_657: @iskall85 when i  a archive i cant see the item its for
[3:14:21] mukul_25: Preview option??????
[3:14:23] victor_2504: Maybe make it so that you can see the challange (or half of it) so its like a choice
[3:14:25] Kveeez: —Åancel = -10 min
[3:14:26] arcaneauto055: are you still running for dungeons?
[3:14:26] VogelVrouw: Yeah that'd be so dumb
[3:14:27] gaymersalsa: OMEGALOOL
[3:14:29] LowKeyChemist: Could the challenges be readable before hitting the god altar? Like how the braziers are. Then you choose to go into the challenge?
[3:14:30] Vintage_Thief: cancel adds a negative modifier to the vault
[3:14:32] ChaoticTom31: ok. iskall costume check
[3:14:32] leo2369q: What if you can beg for the gods forgiveness
[3:14:32] Flick1104: maybe if you leave from the portal only to cancel?
[3:14:33] Retromom702: I think the question of what happens to your paradox vault if you lose points?
[3:14:34] gaymersalsa: Hmm
[3:14:37] Lakosius2: wait , i need to find my Wizards hat for that first
[3:14:37] zeus_o9o2: mine is playing dead
[3:14:38] rickyboi10101: cancel for -1 minute at the alter?
[3:14:38] ItzElixsis: When did Iskall ever care about lore? Lol
[3:14:38] SebastiaanO: cancel and guarantee a lost reputation point
[3:14:39] gaymersalsa: Hmm Nerd
[3:14:39] kriptou21: the thinker pose
[3:14:40] ThisReallyIsMe: If you cancelled something, the gods would be passed at you
[3:14:44] Fiona_Fancypants: i mean, if you add reputation loss then most people will make the altar their main goal of that vault... it feels almost mandatory to complete it. i feel that the curse is already a good punishment
[3:14:44] thatmfdes: go to a god irl offer them a favour and then go actually nah‚Ä¶ they will smite you ü§£
[3:14:49] ThisReallyIsMe: Pissed*
[3:14:54] Ganunbrar: Could make it you need at least 50% of the quest and then you won't lose a rep.
[3:14:58] ViciTheTenorOon: Lose two reputation if you cancel it
[3:14:58] gunhippy: Frodo be like, naah, cba to return the ring to the fire
[3:14:59] Ganunbrar: Or some other percentage
[3:15:01] VIrosueS: it is logical to have such thing cause if u can gain it even with so many chance guarantees it should have some backlash on you too
[3:15:02] chilibeeeee: You can cancel a vault by leaving it
[3:15:03] Kasszi_: tngoACKCHYUALLY
[3:15:05] maxmuster12321: @iskall85 What will happen to the divine paradox if you have less points than when you built it man?
[3:15:05] Therank2100: OR - Have a cancel button that counts as a loss anyway so you lose the rep, but doesnt add a curse. Still seems to easy, but its a viable solution
[3:15:08] looking4art: it seems like a lot of gamers can‚Äôt deal with losing anything lol even god favors LUL iskHeart
[3:15:11] Chandler86_: LUL
[3:15:11] strainjp: @iskall85 Could have a losing faith mechanism so it decreases your chance of losing reputation
[3:15:13] gaymersalsa: AKSHUALLY
[3:15:14] iljalz: heh
[3:15:14] zeus_o9o2: velara ? does he mean valkarie ?
[3:15:15] HarryC621: @iskall85 Maybe if people want to cancel, they have to submit a favour of their type?
[3:15:15] mirohtomysoul: Or returning to the alter after failing the quest, kind of as a way to "repent" yourself to the gods/apologise? Maybe you'd have to hand in the tokens like the flower you got when you won a rep point?
[3:15:16] DaNielJunek17: @tangerinedoro ofc a big part is not possible but people stay complaining about problems about it's to hard and stuff and wynncraft is kinda the same in that sense in the way you chose your own hardness but as far as I know way less people think it is to hard or something
[3:15:17] Vossela: challenging and impossible altars with higher chance but a chance at lost rep
[3:15:17] gaymersalsa: KEKW
[3:15:17] plantcraftie: then you won't ever get cursed
[3:15:18] fanf112: hey yooo
[3:15:19] 999nightmare999: LUL
[3:15:21] joeri_van: cancelling with offering loot would fit lore
[3:15:21] kat999xx: LUL
[3:15:23] theycallmecap96: @iskall85 maybe you replace the mystic expertise with one that gives you a lesser chance to lose a reputation point?
[3:15:25] Mynestyne: Yeah....Nah
[3:15:27] chrisw333: Why couldn't we see the challenge before clicking?
[3:15:27] gkizzle88: omg lol
[3:15:28] Lakosius2: cancelling can also come with another debuff instead
[3:15:32] LupiCanis: leaving vault is fail
[3:15:33] dcptcncrescendo: But that fails you
[3:15:34] nerdoidaao: it's a fail
[3:15:34] Therank2100: Yes
[3:15:36] cozmo42: no,not failure
[3:15:36] TheTechnoWaffle: What if you make the quests visible before you pick it, kinda like the braziers?
[3:15:37] nerdoidaao: yes
[3:15:42] moriahberry14: what if the chance of losing had to do with percentage of challenge done?
[3:15:42] MuumiJumala: you should make it cancelable but 50% chance of the god getting angry and instakilling you Kappa
[3:15:42] xverion_: Found the issue with the paradox, it's in dms and dev discord
[3:15:43] ddaffy_: What if you unalive your teammate in a coop to cancel jkjk
[3:15:44] VogelVrouw: What if you die?
[3:15:44] sabrina1202r: yes
[3:15:45] gaymersalsa: Akshually
[3:15:45] z_e_ns: yes yes
[3:15:46] ChaoticTom31: oh, expertise called Gods Forgiveness to drop the reputation loss chance
[3:15:46] Wyharn_Guardian: Should dying also cost you reputation, despite putting in the effort
[3:15:47] mahik750: I am not very good with god altars yet, so I usually take altars with less time left in the vault than to get cursed xD
[3:15:48] f4ty7th3e: @iskall85 what if you could overide your current one with another of the same god or double down with the same god????
[3:15:51] SeriousLove: is god alters opt-in?
[3:15:52] arjun1511: wrong way
[3:15:52] minipax84: Maybe you can cancel for a negative rep but no negative modifiee
[3:15:53] MaraudingBacon: @TheTechnoWaffle this is the same as the cancel. people can skip the bad oines
[3:15:53] maxmuster12321: Divine paradox.  And less points??
[3:15:57] Gorbyas: you go back to the altar to say ‚Äúayo sorry sir I fcked up‚Äù
[3:15:57] SilentWife: Akshually
[3:16:01] RavenclawNatsfan: if you lose a point but have none would you go into negatives?
[3:16:01] bibabuzzelman: maybe charm essence can be used to gain a 100% safe aura from losing rep for the god for which you have the charm equiped?
[3:16:03] gaymersalsa: you can.
[3:16:04] vimick: Should curse your next vault if you leave with an altar challenge running
[3:16:05] gaymersalsa: only you can.
[3:16:07] gaymersalsa: silly.
[3:16:10] robor_1: Its an opt in challenge, meaning you dont have to lose the points
[3:16:10] Kasszi_: only you can
[3:16:10] GhoulHunter811: @xverion_  ello!!! :D
[3:16:10] alexepul: What about a difficulty indicator before clicking the altar like dungeons? So if you fail the challenge is totally on you
[3:16:11] Kasszi_: sir
[3:16:12] KumaraMoon: .......
[3:16:13] Lakosius2: Iskschually ‚òù
[3:16:14] notTheRealHelmis: based xverion
[3:16:14] FreudPlays: Kekw
[3:16:15] MunchNL: but can you finish it after timer to not lose the point
[3:16:17] winricheichinger: Loosing reputation when you tried seems weird lorewise
[3:16:18] bmemike: bmemike subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 38 months, currently on a 36 month streak! I heard a rumor that Iskall just doesn't like fun. Hmm...
[3:16:19] LillyDaemon: Add a cancel but make them automatically lose a reputation point as punishment
[3:16:19] FreudPlays: Iskall doesn't know twitch
[3:16:21] cozmo42: xverion, you are now a VIP
[3:16:21] sparkkd: When you go to a competition and don't win it, is something taken from you or you just lose the competition?
[3:16:21] Danymaddox: the legend xverion!!!
[3:16:21] bestbla: classic iskall streamer moment
[3:16:22] joeri_van: to prevent the 'punishment' of the gods you could offer loot to them at an alter
[3:16:22] bikerboyGR: but but iskall i was fighting mobs and accidentally clicked on the god altar Kappa ..... LUL
[3:16:22] floppypidgen: nah failing after leaving is funny af.
[3:16:23] gaymersalsa: based xverion indeed
[3:16:25] the_flerken: idea: "cancellation" at the altar may 100% (not affected by affinity) remove the reputation point but without cursing the vault  might be useful if you take a challenge at the beginning and don't want to leave the vault
[3:16:26] FreudPlays: @xverion_ go back to bedge
[3:16:26] omkaarr: or you cant activate another challenge if you cancel
[3:16:30] CedH1: Xverion_ mvp
[3:16:34] nerdoidaao: I like the idea of it being challenging, since it's like a side thing, you don't need to do it, I think it should be very challenging
[3:16:36] PyreoftheLiving: What happens to rooms you bought if you go below the cost?
[3:16:37] notTheRealHelmis: lmao the emote was already there
[3:16:37] Danymaddox: love the xverion 7tv emote hahahaha
[3:16:39] Waliyounas: Why not make a YouTube series with doing unpopular reddit builds
[3:16:46] Therank2100: Speaking of time...
[3:16:46] bestbla: xverion
[3:16:50] myster_ious_iroh: @iskall85 how will losing reputation affect paradox?
[3:16:50] jazjez: You should be more likely to lose a reputation point the more affinity or whatever you have with the god, as you are such a great and trusted warrior failing when you've been trusted is badge
[3:16:51] notTheRealHelmis: btw salsa, speaking of emotes
[3:16:52] xverion_: i've not fixed it just tried finding it so its easy for wu to fix :D
[3:16:55] midouzs: Time iskall
[3:16:55] schm0li: How about a hunter spec for ores?
[3:16:56] RandomTheWolf: But maybe you get like 50% of the time
[3:16:57] Lakosius2: xverion
[3:16:58] chrisw333: I would be more likely to try the challenge of I knew what it was before clicking, just like braziers
[3:16:58] ddaffy_: I hate the cancel idea but what if there was a sacrifice to the altar like a pog or stack of gold
[3:17:00] Gorbyas: maybe half the time for bonus
[3:17:02] csheff56: you could replace the original with a harder second with a new timer?
[3:17:02] ramnite_tv: You could apply the curse on cancel, but spare the reputation? Double reward (favour reputation), double punishment (curse, reputation) with leniency on cancel (just curse)?
[3:17:04] mrkangabeaver: You add another.. "HOT POCKETS"
[3:17:07] thatmfdes: if people want a cancel feature‚Ä¶ drop the perks of paradox until the ease is balanced in rewards‚Ä¶ then drink their tears when they cry about it
[3:17:08] ono95: check your TIME!
[3:17:11] MottlyMC: bailed vaults = also lose rep? that would make a lot of people not bother with rep
[3:17:13] Ganunbrar: Ganunbrar subscribed with Prime. 
[3:17:21] gaymersalsa: xverion says the issue is in dev discord yet when i go to devscord there is nothing, scammed and feeling sad because my nosiness didnt pay off Ledditing
[3:17:24] OneTrueSpry: Could you make rooms a fixed amount of points and cost 1-3
[3:17:24] valkojam: wasn't it like that in the first version of "gods"?
[3:17:25] Lakosius2: @schm0li there is one , its the one that you use when you dont see chests , means its an Ore room
[3:17:28] daqmiel: a "this or that" option would be cool too, to give a little option
[3:17:36] spurlucke: He ded again
[3:17:37] gaymersalsa: Hmm
[3:17:38] jemasuo: separete time maybe
[3:17:39] mirohtomysoul: Maybe losing a rep point could also take into account how much of the challenge you completed? More completed = lower chance of losing?
[3:17:41] silvain_shadows: idk how anyone can unlock transmogs with that idea. like i don't even care about the paradox, i just want my idona armor, but you won;t listen to anyone saying they're too hard for most people.
[3:17:41] gaymersalsa: TRUE......
[3:17:43] bikerboyGR: would be nice if it was a team thing
[3:17:47] plantcraftie: that's better
[3:17:47] Therank2100: I did mention that actually...sort of
[3:17:47] DaNielJunek17: Iskall85 maybe you should talk about this with Grian one time you could maybe get some ideas from the wynncraft server which he has a role in it since some things would be nice mainly how they handle deads and level scaling but ofc it is still 2 different games
[3:17:49] gaymersalsa: BUT FADING IS FUNNY LOL
[3:17:51] KJAERB0: Good point
[3:17:53] victor_2504: Or remove curses intirely
[3:17:53] daqmiel: or give it a 50% chance with each hit or something
[3:17:54] Kasszi_: i would take that trade off 100%
[3:17:56] Chandler86_: Yeah I think it's a good change
[3:17:57] TheReaperOf1985: I mean if u have a 15% chance to gain rep, u should have 15% chanse to lose a point. That makes sense to me iskHeart iskHeart iskBro
[3:18:02] sh4dow_d3mon: I like the idea of the curae
[3:18:03] merlijnchkia: or make the buffs stack could be a posivbility too
[3:18:03] tangerinedoro: @DaNielJunek17 stop spamming this man
[3:18:03] iljalz: ooooh getting closer!
[3:18:03] sparkkd: You already have a punishment of not finishing the altar, why add another one?
[3:18:03] hinsher116: Every single time its fading
[3:18:04] Jarethkor: I like the curses, some are crazy harsh some are "oooh flavor"
[3:18:06] Ktolos: What about having an indicator above the god altars, suggesting what type of quest the god wants you to do, that way before you risk reputation you can think whether you can complete the task, wouldn't that be fairer?
[3:18:07] gaymersalsa: @iskall85 how many altars completed
[3:18:10] gaymersalsa: for gamba
[3:18:12] fin03103: what if your chance to loose reputation scaled with respect to how close you came to completing the challenge? e.g you looted 20/25 ornate chests, and so you would have a 20% chance to loose rep
[3:18:12] tangerinedoro: 0
[3:18:13] karthavya: sir mana leak is also bad same as fading
[3:18:14] GhoulHunter811: @gaymersalsa 0 ig
[3:18:16] staniobro: can you run a scavvvv
[3:18:19] ramnite_tv: Curse only affects a single vault, loss of reputation affects way more time, so Id rather take 2 curses KEKW
[3:18:20] mmattzo: is there any way to make vault hunters, cus rn yes you can run vaults together but ur not really running them together. everyone is just runing for themselves but in the same vault.
[3:18:20] thatmfdes: 0
[3:18:21] Therank2100: @gaymersalsa 0
[3:18:21] the_whtvr: I'd scale the curse and losing reputation with affinity - but the other way around - so more affinity - worse curse/more chance of losing rep
[3:18:22] gaymersalsa: are we sure it was 0 altars
[3:18:22] lynnie_thelurker: 0
[3:18:23] DaNielJunek17: @tangerinedoro twice is not spamming....
[3:18:23] beefy_booty: KEKW
[3:18:25] bikerboyGR: probably it would have to scale on what it asks depending on the players in the vault
[3:18:26] gaymersalsa: ok were sure
[3:18:26] Naraka00: lol
[3:18:27] f4ty7th3e: curses seem pretty balanced already tho and you can always leave to cancel them
[3:18:27] hambade: No opt out. Gods are fickle. Bring it on. If you think this is turf, try playing battle toads on Nintendo
[3:18:28] notTheRealHelmis: @gaymersalsa yep
[3:18:28] sunnyr0ad: Iskall if you lose a reputation what would happen to rooms inside divine paradox?
[3:18:29] Lakosius2: Nice Compter Decoration you have there
[3:18:29] ChaoticTom31: A surprise stress has appeared
[3:18:30] dcptcncrescendo: I love team things. I only play co-op, so now team stuff would be awesome
[3:18:32] kibaz_x: it's her computer now
[3:18:32] Khalin1212: I got max divine expertise at 40, almost 60 now and I have like 3 total reputation points. Losing reputation on a fail would just gate me out of divine paradox entirely
[3:18:34] aeonep_: Can we watch Stress open her dolls?
[3:18:35] spurlucke: Hi Stress ‚ô•Ô∏è
[3:18:35] shook_2190: Thats a nice welcome

[3:18:40] TessaDraws: She's ready to vault!
[3:18:41] LunaaaaXO: Stress <3
[3:18:43] MuumiJumala: you can't let afking on your computer go unpunished
[3:18:46] six_o_nine: @iskall85 you could also add that instead of losing a point, that God will add a random curse to your vaults till you complete one LUL
[3:18:47] costalboy: ! Stress
[3:18:48] nucnec: !stress
[3:18:49] zeus_o9o2: sitting in front of  the pc is very bad thats why we stand on it
[3:18:58] Lakosius2: Stress Cats sits on Computers , checks out
[3:19:00] ggamito: makes you wanna leave LUL
[3:19:04] costalboy: !stress
[3:19:10] mondgesicht98: @six_o_nine I think this is fun!
[3:19:10] RaithamX: could say that about fading tho. Start with more hearts to an extenet
[3:19:12] mirohtomysoul: That's like a cat, sitting on the computer
[3:19:12] pootch_1: Use mana steal or potion or Ur done for
[3:19:15] kimiko2547: so you have to respec in the vault?
[3:19:16] RandomTheWolf: Fading is just a frick you
[3:19:17] mrkangabeaver: !stress
[3:19:17] VIrosueS: @iskall85 i think curses work quite well imo but it can has curse and - rep point but curses in that can be less damaging in the contrast to no rep point loss but getting a curse
[3:19:18] Jackkabuki: You only lose Reputation after a certain amount of rep has been earned? If yes then the Cap should be displayed where the reputation is shown or in the quest book
[3:19:18] RaithamX: kek extenent
[3:19:20] notTheRealHelmis: OOOOOO i have an idea, I'm gonna have to write it up as a leddit tho
[3:19:25] ThEUNKnoWN0208: ABSORBTION sorry caps
[3:19:26] Tjidobo: More health
[3:19:26] awkwardbugger: I counter fading with absorption hearts
[3:19:28] No_xor: mana shiels?
[3:19:30] LowKeyChemist: what timing
[3:19:33] forzawin: hearty apples worked well in the race to herald
[3:19:35] sh4dow_d3mon: The curses make the challenge stressful in a fun way. I wouldn't want to lessen them
[3:19:36] gkizzle88: i dont like ethereal dont like mobs unkillable nothing a player can do besides run away
[3:19:37] karthavya: fading has absorption hearts on potions and hearty apple
[3:19:41] chad_masters: Absorption  hearts
[3:19:41] jackattack_657: @iskall85 how do you make the ar archives tell you what the modifier goes on??
[3:19:42] plantcraftie: leech?
[3:19:42] TobyButt89: Doesn't absorption hearts block fading?
[3:19:44] gaymersalsa: hearty apples vouch
[3:19:44] DaNielJunek17: resistance is also a counter to fading
[3:19:48] gaymersalsa: i love hearty apples
[3:19:49] Tjidobo: Having more health helps
[3:19:51] Lakosius2: making mobs more deadly then , can always give them more damage and speed
[3:19:52] Khalin1212: Reputation is already really hard to get. Do not add reputation loss in any way. It's completely "feel bad" and complicates paradox vaults
[3:19:52] RandomTheWolf: Nope
[3:19:53] RandomTheWolf: xD
[3:19:55] TobyButt89: Ye leave fading in
[3:19:56] StylishM0nkey: please no
[3:19:56] Atomxs77: absorbtion pylons dont work
[3:19:57] AlliBlueS: why dont you save the epic gear?
[3:19:57] Poe_thirteen: Absorption potion
[3:20:01] notTheRealHelmis: the immortality potion hbomb beat a guardians vault solo
[3:20:01] daqmiel: pop golden apples constantly you'll be fiiine LUL
[3:20:02] trophy_bi: yeah fading is fine imo
[3:20:02] robor_1: have you thought about putting more chase items in the treasure chest?
[3:20:02] Iron_the_Beast: damn whats with the big boi sword iskSkull85
[3:20:03] nucnec: omg please no
[3:20:04] Kasszi_: Madge
[3:20:06] schm0li: +health armor
[3:20:08] GhoulHunter811: nooo those hearts are more expensive than mana if we comparing
[3:20:08] Jarethkor: yes, fading is super harsh but is a neat top end for the big bad
[3:20:11] ChaoticTom31: @Poe_thirteen whats up homie!!!
[3:20:14] pincheman: Do God alters favour objectives?
[3:20:17] aeonep_: If you were to remove Fading as a consequence, I would still have it as a high risk open if you were to merge 2 challenges together
[3:20:19] dswa_earl: But mana leak you can still get mana back, fading is just death
[3:20:20] RavenclawNatsfan: I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever used a hearty apple before lol
[3:20:20] merlijnchkia: @iskall85 id say leave the curses but make the buffs stack
[3:20:21] Lakosius2: Void time on Hit is my favorite punishment
[3:20:25] nerdoidaao: percentages
[3:20:26] notTheRealHelmis: @gaymersalsa forbidden emote in whisper
[3:20:28] kopaka9726: could do something like a version of the curse like "velara's disapproval" where you lose a favor and can't do any more velara in this vault
[3:20:30] Cloudetix: How does fading interact with fruits and the vault timer?
[3:20:43] nick98taylor: @iskall85 when will you try palworld? its a very good game dont you think?
[3:20:46] ono95: !! - Don't forget your other (pink) backpack!!
[3:20:47] awkwardbugger: I prefer fading over mana leak lol
[3:20:52] AeIaen: what about reputation loss instead of curse, with chance to  get 1 of them when failed
[3:20:54] Tjidobo: True, but health is still mitigating
[3:20:57] kinghingle: to me the outlier curse is souless
[3:20:58] mukul_25: 1heart per hit makes healing much better
[3:20:58] badatmath69: im so used to watching this on youtube i tried skipping forward
[3:21:02] MunchNL: barren
[3:21:02] bas3j: Soulles
[3:21:03] imagevarsa: what does fading do?
[3:21:03] ramnite_tv: Barren, soulless, draining?
[3:21:04] GhoulHunter811: soulless lol
[3:21:04] mirohtomysoul: soul shards?
[3:21:04] zeus_o9o2: the best soulsless
[3:21:04] kimiko2547: negs should be halved for coop players, I didn't ask for the risk and wouldn;t get the benefit.
[3:21:05] karthavya: there was a legendary rare in 5th line of the backpack
[3:21:05] chlory99: Lethal
[3:21:07] gkizzle88: etheareal
[3:21:09] Grim_Stoner: Mana leak
[3:21:11] TheJollyPainter: TheJollyPainter subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 9 months! 
[3:21:13] henks50: if you have like+10% mana regen and get -100% mana regen modifier do you have 10% mana regen then?
[3:21:13] silvain_shadows: I think the concept of losing reputation makes sense, but it needs to be balanced by making the actual altar quests EASIER because the majority of players fail more altars than they complete.
[3:21:15] hinsher116: fading, fading, also fading and fading
[3:21:18] kibaz_x: barren makes me tear up
[3:21:18] jemasuo: iskall here is a question why we cant use silver or gold on artisan station like 1 silver instead of 9 bronze
[3:21:20] masterslayer7777: masterslayer7777 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 7 months! Hey iskall, thought on making heros landing ad based since there aren't many ad based abilities. #never ever leaving
[3:21:21] HC_Shako: Avadakavra!
[3:21:22] Retromom702: How about losing a favor and your paradox vault?
[3:21:23] imagevarsa: what does fading do again?
[3:21:24] mondgesicht98: just a feel bad
[3:21:25] famousp: with fading you need to leave the vault with mana leak you can stay in
[3:21:28] daqmiel: it's also mis-spelled
[3:21:29] Lakosius2: Bring exploding Chests back as a punishment then as well :)
[3:21:30] GhoulHunter811: yes baren is actually boring
[3:21:33] ViciTheTenorOon: Add a New curse just inverts your mouse
[3:21:33] daqmiel: Baren -> Barren
[3:21:34] arcaneauto055: fading is the only reason I cared about gaining much health on my armor
[3:21:34] kibaz_x: i just leave the vault lol
[3:21:35] ddaffy_: Gotta go into work enjoy Dylans!
[3:21:38] nerdoidaao: baren does what?
[3:21:40] zeus_o9o2: rigged LUL LUL
[3:21:40] joeri_van: are focusses being used?
[3:21:42] impossible_321: soulless drains archon smite like wtf
[3:21:47] RedTheMiner: RedTheMiner subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 14 months! 
[3:21:47] LupiCanis: soulless make it so that the slauterpotion dont recharge
[3:21:49] TobyButt89: Curses are fine, the reputation loss makes sense, but if you're going to implement it, it should be difficulty hard and higher
[3:21:49] bibabuzzelman: the essence you get from recycling charms could be used to enchant your active charm and giving you a aura of imunity for a 1 time fail. this aura could get used when you fail
[3:21:50] kinghingle: its just sadness, lmao
[3:21:51] GhoulHunter811: @nerdoidaao 50 percent less item quant
[3:21:52] OneTrueSpry: You could add a curse that turns all water in vault to void liquid
[3:21:57] plantcraftie: you can do another altar then still
[3:22:00] midouzs: How about making the altar show the penalty before you click it .. so it's up to you whether you wanna risk it and try or not
[3:22:00] gkizzle88: you need feel bads aas much as you need feel goods
[3:22:03] GhoulHunter811: @GhoulHunter811 if i am not wrong tho
[3:22:04] csheff56: as long as you stick with the same god, you could double down "Cancel" your first task and get a more difficult task with a reset timer. more reward, more risk.
[3:22:05] autumspog: but you get gassing you are forced to leave
[3:22:08] autumspog: fading*
[3:22:09] Tassji_S: tassjiWave hallo Iskall can't stay as it's past midnight but good luck in today's vaults
[3:22:09] cozmo42: what‚Äôs on your computer?
[3:22:12] lava24k: Yoo
[3:22:13] mirohtomysoul: @OneTrueSpry Ohh that is cool
[3:22:13] Jackkabuki: How about a curse that increases fall damage? or negates enchantments on your gear
[3:22:15] YukioRX: Pink bag. Take it now to be sure :D
[3:22:16] ono95: Pink backpack
[3:22:16] zeus_o9o2: yeah barren is feel bad
[3:22:17] Atomxs77: does absoprion pylons work
[3:22:18] mondgesicht98: like it
[3:22:22] pincheman: Opinion on the youtuber/twitch streamer iskall85?
[3:22:24] six_o_nine: @iskall85 what if instead of losing a point, the God curses your vaults till you complete one vault?
[3:22:26] gaymersalsa: @Tassji_S allo tassji hryAdmire how are ya
[3:22:27] alerdikie: nah curses are should be punishment
[3:22:29] Lakosius2: Soulless is whatever since you still get like 5 to 7k shards per run anyways
[3:22:35] pokemonplayer09: !stress
[3:22:35] notTheRealHelmis: Ok I have it figured out: the altars should give you a curse, and you have to complete the challenge with that curse to prove yourself to the god
[3:22:36] Nightbot: Stress has been hugged 18022 times! Gotta luv ‚Äòer!, ya monsta!
[3:22:36] Atomxs77: my absorption hearts dont appear
[3:22:38] omkaarr: thats a good suggession
[3:22:42] triple_bypass_: triple_bypass_ subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 33 months! stuck home with covid.
[3:22:55] statsnerd1550: what about -50-150% of your item quantity or rarity  as a punishment
[3:22:55] zeus_o9o2: ask her to kill 52 tanks first LUL
[3:22:55] Pared_down: Or you'd see the basic challenge - mobs, chests without numbers
[3:22:58] Therank2100: Smittenskall
[3:22:59] theonecalledrolo: Don't forget to unspec hunter iskall
[3:23:03] Linkazzatore: showing altar challenge and curse like the new objective?
[3:23:03] floppypidgen: Would have people just avoiding alters with fading
[3:23:05] Ito_Kyoshiro: Altar should be infor ed opt in (as happens with Dungeons)
[3:23:06] jemasuo: iskall i want to ask why we cant use silver or gold on artisan station like 1 silver instead of 9 bronze
[3:23:08] spurlucke: Show 2-3 possible curses instead
[3:23:08] nerdoidaao: the curse and the bless, right
[3:23:13] redstonedad: !stress
[3:23:14] TakeMyBigbysHand: Wow over 18,000 stress hugs
[3:23:15] elio_saratsis: Did you restart the server?
[3:23:15] plantcraftie: then you  would just skip the worst curses
[3:23:16] dswa_earl: I have lost points on current patch, is that a bug?
[3:23:16] the_flerken: barren is feel-bad, but when you get it instead of fading, it's kinda feel-good
[3:23:16] daqmiel: Shruge
[3:23:17] gaymersalsa: un Dedge
[3:23:23] jofusaurus: Yippee
[3:23:24] MarkDatter: unlockable i think
[3:23:28] coolkami: Can somebody tell me who dylan is?
[3:23:32] gaymersalsa: !dylan
[3:23:32] Nightbot: Who's Dylan you ask.  WE ARE ALL DYLAN!
[3:23:39] zeus_o9o2: ask her what lvl she has
[3:23:39] jametrics: Showing the curse is interesting
[3:23:42] winricheichinger: seeing the challenge is basically the same as canceling every good altar without downside
[3:23:45] Tinokk85: What about if you have received a curse, you can do another alter of the same god to remove that curse/gain a blessing.
[3:23:46] kyoffa: Are the stacks upgrades in the gear bagpack usefull ?
[3:23:50] akii2390: what happened to omega sward
[3:23:53] redstonedad: @dswa_earl yes look in known issue in VH discord for the fix
[3:23:54] notTheRealHelmis: !discord
[3:23:54] gaymersalsa: 5 gold in the bag KEKW

[3:24:01] OneTrueSpry: Tbh I think curses would be the least of my worries though I would be more worried about loosing rep then getting cursed especially if rooms cost 5 or 6 points.
[3:24:02] gkizzle88: @kyoffa yes
[3:24:04] coolkami: So a dylan is like a stan
[3:24:04] PyreoftheLiving: Hw about a talent to see the curse?
[3:24:06] ChaoticTom31: you can balance with an expertise that is Gods Forgiveness that allows reduced chance of loosing favor. Also have a GUI that allows you to choose your god favor task similar to the modifier tables. haha or choose your punishments. :D
[3:24:07] jemasuo: iskall why we cant use silver or gold on artisan station like 1 silver instead of 9 bronze
[3:24:10] LowKeyChemist: I kinda like seeing the curse...hmm...
[3:24:12] zoelife1991: <3
[3:24:12] Tassji_S: @gaymersalsa I've been alright. tassjiDraw
[3:24:14] zeus_o9o2: greed is bad
[3:24:15] AceK1n9: what‚Äôs the website to see peoples levels?
[3:24:17] gaymersalsa: @coolkami no... just anybody who types here in chat :D
[3:24:18] daqmiel: she playin blackjack
[3:24:19] floppypidgen: Showing curse is boring solution. People will just not pick the alters with cursed they don't like.
[3:24:21] Novet: 50 or nothing
[3:24:23] daqmiel: "hit me"
[3:24:29] gaymersalsa: @Tassji_S gaymer68Flower

[3:24:46] Jackkabuki: The woman wants 50
[3:24:49] zeus_o9o2: and thats why gambling is bad guys
[3:24:53] SputTop: Nice looking thing
[3:24:54] bunta_1: Another trinket for gods and stuff
[3:24:54] gaymersalsa: WhenTheRNG
[3:24:55] e88mars: Maybe you can give another offering to the God if it looks like a fair like gold or an item?
[3:24:58] Vossela: i think having altar challenge tiers that show, normal challenging etc. would be good and then having lost rep on higher fails
[3:25:08] gaymersalsa: ooooo
[3:25:13] Ruemis: yesterday hypno got 99 of undead
[3:25:19] GhoulHunter811: the nether damage dang

[3:25:23] coolkami: @gaymersalsa did Iskall come up with Dylan?
[3:25:26] RachelElizabeth92: That's what I use
[3:25:26] zeus_o9o2: yea joe found yesterday on stream
[3:25:37] daqmiel: I had a legendary chaining 8 with my old frost build
[3:25:37] Captain_Black649: Nice
[3:25:40] daqmiel: nothing moved LUL
[3:25:54] gaymersalsa: @coolkami somebody donated in VH s1 under the name Dylan, and iskall asked who in chat was the Dylan. and everybody said they were dylan :p
[3:25:54] redstonedad: I got poison 4 on a omega sword yesterday
[3:25:58] mukul_25: Roll your omega sword??
[3:26:00] midouzs: Thank you sir
[3:26:04] Lakosius2: the name is now " Isk-Allium-bur-Blade "
[3:26:07] trophy_bi: it gives the player some sense of control
[3:26:07] joeri_van: yeah but the challenges are not god specific so also not lore
[3:26:08] TheJollyPainter: I started my toxic reaction build yesterday. Looking forward to it
[3:26:17] shortcaked48: why is chaining better than attack damage?
[3:26:19] pereiraahd: turn pick up on your backpack again
[3:26:27] Therank2100: This could be the one
[3:26:28] sebastian_17171: Do you know when the 3.13 realese is?
[3:26:31] OrdoSolarus: OrdoSolarus subscribed with Prime. 
[3:26:32] TessaDraws: Oh you got your tresure scroll!
[3:26:35] gaymersalsa: BING buys from balck market
[3:26:38] Grimm8_: Show the positive and negative so they know what they are getting for succeeding but also know what they get if they fail. It enhances the choice factor
[3:26:38] bunta_1: How bout a trinket for each God that helps with them
[3:26:38] Gorbyas: do living?
[3:26:39] Artemiz_Prime: Perhaps its reputation required, like 5 (just a random number) to see the curse of the corresponding god challenge
[3:26:42] sp0rsk: make it so you actually spend your reputation at the paradox (so you end up having to get more reputation overall)
[3:26:44] LowKeyChemist: ah...I'm coming around on the not knowing anything. If the point is that it is an omega challenge, then so be it
[3:26:47] karthavya: lore wise the God informs the challenge acceptor the punishment too
[3:26:47] pincheman: Key anvil?
[3:26:49] redstonedad: Keyskall
[3:26:49] gaymersalsa: @iskall85 vip xverion
[3:26:53] Ganunbrar: Is the middle slot better in the market?
[3:26:58] omkaarr: wooden?
[3:27:01] trophy_bi: you‚Äôve said it yourself people hate RNG so showing the consequences gives the illusion of control
[3:27:02] Gorbyas: oh F
[3:27:03] notTheRealHelmis: xverion
[3:27:05] gkizzle88: choas cat

[3:27:18] notTheRealHelmis: it feels weird that xverion
[3:27:19] kibaz_x: it's not that much exp tbh
[3:27:19] jemasuo: hey iskall why we cant use silver or gold on artisan station like 5 silver instead of 45 bronze
[3:27:20] morror1690: is etho lvl100 yet ??
[3:27:21] Jackkabuki: Maybe a gilded run? for more cata

[3:27:45] daqmiel: I knew this was jar-jar's fault somehow
[3:27:46] robor_1: What 2was the cause of yesterdays issues?
[3:27:49] gaymersalsa: @jaanonimpl you cant do that inside the vault
[3:27:50] the_flerken: idea: always remove a reputation point if challenge is failed, but let a player come back to the god altar to "ask for mercy" and not lose the point (maybe affilnity-affected) note - in this case leaving the vault should cancel, not fail the challenge
[3:27:50] angelwitch25: backup before update pls
[3:27:53] gaymersalsa: only vanilla leaves
[3:27:53] owucie: hallo
[3:27:53] FreudPlays: Iskall ignoring us again sadge
[3:27:54] angrrrrydad: its sad you have lost 1200+ gold in the last 2 paradox vaults

[3:28:04] Gorbyas: 1 month until restart
[3:28:04] gkizzle88: only green
[3:28:09] floppypidgen: showing curses feels like a bad solution. People will just avoid the curses that they don't like, and never get fading. It's equivalent to seeing the quest.
[3:28:16] phil85yt: I think if you made the showing curse an unlockable ability. It would work better.
[3:28:18] daqmiel: rip cows
[3:28:19] fenixcrafter05: @gaymersalsa yes very sadgeman
[3:28:22] gaymersalsa: VIP xverioin

[3:31:58] AlliBlueS: the champion one is really hard to complete
[3:32:01] gaymersalsa: WOOOOOOOW
[3:32:03] pootch_1: We don't wanna  play easy
[3:32:04] basman333: @gaymersalsa is it a boos or a type of vault

[3:32:23] sp0rsk: let us kiwi the timer
[3:32:23] gaymersalsa: HE HAS ANOTHER CHAT HES PAYING ATTENTION TO
[3:32:24] basman333: @gaymersalsa thanks
[3:32:26] silvain_shadows: i play on piece of cake, and if we lose rep on exit, i would never build up rep
[3:32:28] basman333: ok thanks
[3:32:29] Kasszi_: thats fair he says
[3:32:31] kabali_24: SUSSY BAKA
[3:32:31] gaymersalsa: A SIDE CHAT D:
[3:32:32] MarkDatter: There's *way* too much stuff tied to the same difficulty slider
[3:32:33] FreudPlays: HE'S CHEATING OM US
[3:32:33] maetti1286: @gaymersalsa LOL
[3:32:39] oigy: yes
[3:32:39] magdaluo66: hello

[3:32:43] slashyamael: what are we ? plebs ?

[3:32:45] pincheman: Man the iskall85 guy is kinda annoying
[3:32:45] TessaDraws: @gaymersalsa  Awkward
[3:32:45] gkizzle88: dude
[3:32:45] AlliBlueS: playing vh
[3:32:46] gharmonica: I think you should make the alter objectives harder and lose more reputation, I don't play the modpack, and just like to inconvenience others
[3:32:46] dswa_earl: Dungeon mobs and champions feel way more RNG dependent than the others
[3:32:47] gaymersalsa: nerd
[3:32:48] SilentWife: @gaymersalsa with his own game, how dare he
[3:32:50] JarnoZZTV: mee 2
[3:32:51] Cosmovoli: Yoooo nice !!!
[3:32:52] GhostlyMarrow49: @MarkDatter every game has that if that is your problem dont play games
[3:32:53] rocketjohn: some people put a lot of their self worth into not playing easy it seems, which is sad
[3:32:53] mukul_25: @gaymersalsa lol u like a clingy wife lol
[3:32:54] Fiona_Fancypants: easy doesn't only change altars :P
[3:32:57] Kastumoem: I will say that even at level 100 cake some of the challenges came down to literally the amount of mobs you could get to spawn
[3:32:57] Captain_Black649: ?
[3:32:58] kabali_24: that‚Äôs true
[3:32:58] Chandler86_: LUL
[3:33:00] eonzcarr: waoLaugh
[3:33:01] izeplaysGames: im too bad for the game, devs pls fix Kappa
[3:33:01] VogelVrouw: Lol
[3:33:04] joeri_van: but that is treu though
[3:33:04] Oh_No_Its_Kat: LUL LUL LUL
[3:33:04] Cosmovoli: oh wait it's sarcasm unpag
[3:33:04] cozmo42: Also post on Reddit
[3:33:05] airetwo: is it done ?
[3:33:05] crazumi_: play on easy for the crystal then on hard for the vault lol
[3:33:06] awkwardbugger: brutal
[3:33:07] DORITOBUCKET: do it
[3:33:08] tumbleina: LUL
[3:33:08] slashyamael: you are describing the battl;enet forum  my dude
[3:33:09] kabali_24: :0
[3:33:11] SwimStyle: i think the point they are trying to make is that the difficulty isnt as granular as they want
[3:33:11] DORITOBUCKET: it will be amazing
[3:33:12] Kinteshi: dying in d4 OMEGALUL
[3:33:12] SebastiaanO: fair
[3:33:14] bljat99: well they might not be able to do the god altars but still have fun fighting strong mobs aso
[3:33:16] trophy_bi: why does it feel like we‚Äôre in trouble when you call us chat rather than Dylan? :p #nevereverleaving
[3:33:16] StylishM0nkey: StylishM0nkey subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 11 months! just a friendly nudge to read the reddit suggestion post! thanks for the amazing modpack
[3:33:20] jametrics: Listen, it's simple. Make the game easy but call it hard so I feel powerful
[3:33:22] Gorbyas: maybe youll get compensated
[3:33:22] Jolanor: can you add gamerules for altars
[3:33:23] VogelVrouw: No shame in playing a lower difficulty yall!!
[3:33:23] gaymersalsa: @trophy_bi lol TRUE
[3:33:23] csheff56: you could make the change based on difficulty i.e potential to lose favor at normal and above. so easy players remains "easy"
[3:33:26] AceK1n9: obviously not skilled
[3:33:26] Garnail20: iskTroll
[3:33:29] kabali_24: LMAO
[3:33:30] AceK1n9: get good
[3:33:31] freddyb8: Email isn't good enough sir. These dylans have easy access to complain to you. You need a inside man sir!!
[3:33:31] blackjacksepp: Iskall, you should rename Easy to Hard, Normal to Harder and Hard to Extreme, so nobody has to play on Easy Kappa
[3:33:39] notTheRealHelmis: [Reposting] Altars should give you a curse for the 10mins you have the challenge. By completing it with the curse, you prove prove yourself to the god.
[3:33:42] gkizzle88: its already easy
[3:33:44] jemasuo: iskall sir why we cant 5 silver instead of 45 bronze  on artisan station? its harder to give more bronze when its wants more
[3:33:45] megatherium42: #make hard the new easy so we feel better
[3:33:48] TessaDraws: Easy is lovely for me when I want a more casual run
[3:33:51] leo2369q: the problem is altars arent fun
[3:33:51] Captain_Black649: @blackjacksepp yes
[3:33:55] melonhunt: but it should be a player choice tbh
[3:33:57] VogelVrouw: As someone with chronic skill issues, I play on easy as heck
[3:33:57] Kholto: It is a problem if you need to fully understand a game before you start playing
[3:33:58] Nightbot: Twitch Tiers 2 & 3 subs & Patreons Diamond level & above can now sign up to play on the Vault Hunters servers. Join iskall's Discord at  discord.gg/iskall85 & sign up https://vaulthunters.gg/server-status Patreon https://www.patreon.com/iskall85
[3:34:00] joeri_van: just a big json preset
[3:34:03] sp0rsk: just...let me kiwi the altar quest
[3:34:06] Cosmovoli: altar are fun T.T
[3:34:07] Lakosius2: uber lilith can eat a bag of toenails , making every attack an insta kill is garbage game desing
[3:34:08] Kholto: So complicated difficulty settings is an issue
[3:34:10] dswa_earl: Then dont do them lol
[3:34:11] avian946: they are fun!
[3:34:12] DORITOBUCKET: game rules though make it better for people who are worse at the game tho KEKW
[3:34:15] EricMTGCast: I play on normal but reputation had convinced me move to easy.
[3:34:15] sylbel_w: Ledditors wishing for a new game mode just for them called "really hard" but is intact easy mode
[3:34:17] LocutusOfNord: Altars feel like a total crapshoot
[3:34:20] tumbleina: i like sidequersts
[3:34:21] mukul_25: Open your bounty crates for xp
[3:34:21] saxymatt: GOTTEM
[3:34:22] bljat99: you adjust the snaking together at the beginning of your playthrough
[3:34:22] gkizzle88: opinions arent facts people
[3:34:23] gaymersalsa: ok but what about giving VIP to xverion.
[3:34:24] tumbleina: quests lol
[3:34:24] leo2369q: it feels very static
[3:34:26] jametrics: I disagree. I think the Alters are very fun. And I actually failed them a lot
[3:34:26] hinsher116: true KEKW
[3:34:29] CyberGeiger: So you're saying "skill issue"?
[3:34:32] GhoulHunter811: VIP x iskall!!!
[3:34:35] EricMTGCast: Yes they do.
[3:34:36] LowKeyChemist: you can always skip the parts that are too hard
[3:34:40] pincheman: Toxicskall
[3:34:43] basman333: is there gonna be vh after this server ends?
[3:34:43] AceK1n9: play time helps people get good
[3:34:43] milanvdzanden: I feel like they are quite bland and static
[3:34:44] lynnie_thelurker: If Iskall named Chat Dylan, does that make him our papa? Pap
[3:34:45] silvain_shadows: i play on piece of cake!! i probably could play on normal but i like oneshotting things! but if we lose rep on failure INCLUDING EXIT it would be bad balancing!
[3:34:45] VogelVrouw: The gamerules that already exist are great to alter the experience
[3:34:45] Ganunbrar: If the altars is going to take away my rep.. It's going to disappointing when it happens. Unless there is like a lower limit that would prevent me from losing the rep.
[3:34:46] pwn3dzilla: they are fun, but random chance for rep v. losing rep every time you fail? it's an impossible task.
[3:34:48] karthavya: gamerule to set only god altar to set to a certain difficulty
[3:34:49] thatmfdes: ShowLove100 lore wise and logically it makes a lot of sense to lose a rep for failing but many players aren‚Äôt ‚Äúgood‚Äù so for a lot of players the issue will be how it is implemented, equal chance for gaining favour and losing favour makes it the most simple in my opinion. you have higher chance of getting a favour and losing and you control your odds
[3:34:49] faqterson: I am currently 78 and don't do much altars. Maybe the new affinity added to crystal might change my mine
[3:34:49] kibaz_x: saw a video yesterday of a guy saying that scavs aren't fun because the don't know if they'll be able to complete lol
[3:34:50] nerdoidaao: if you sluck at the game, get better, lol
[3:34:50] Oh_No_Its_Kat: The better I get the more fun it is. That's just normal
[3:34:51] DORITOBUCKET: 100% yeah, I don‚Äôt have the time to grind so I love the 3x xp ngl
[3:34:51] Captain_Black649: Yes it does
[3:34:52] 999nightmare999: I can't complete many altars cuz I forget about them lol idm them too much tbh but I'm super unlucky so it gets a little frustrating
[3:34:52] sunnyr0ad: I like the altar system, just waiting for update 13 so I can get reputation faster
[3:34:57] freddyb8: You only get better by actually playing the game. Look at iskall he still fumbles sometimes. No one is perfect
[3:34:58] gaymersalsa: YEP
[3:34:59] shaydeejay: 100%
[3:34:59] Cosmovoli: you don't have to doooooo averything I'm not good at playing with a sword so I'm doing AP builds
[3:35:00] swordo3612: I think altars are okay, just need to be a little more challenging.
[3:35:00] mondgesicht98: dylan stop altar mimimi
[3:35:04] Mynestyne: yes
[3:35:05] gkizzle88: probably the most inclusive game ive ever played
[3:35:05] Chandler86_: Agreed
[3:35:07] izeplaysGames: @CyberGeiger most definitely, and hes right
[3:35:07] howdy_neighbor412: I play more casually, and god altars and scavs suffer the same problem. Yes, it's a skill issue, but they don't scale for more casual players (and I've reached level 80)
[3:35:08] jemasuo: iskall sir why we cant use like 5 silver instead of 45 bronze  on artisan station? its harder to give more bronze when its wants more
[3:35:08] mambearz: Chat needs to chill
[3:35:08] gaymersalsa: thats a bit toxic hryLaf
[3:35:09] kibaz_x: yupyup

[3:35:10] csheff56: get em iskall
[3:35:10] Skylion62: agreed
[3:35:12] lemurmeister: ya
[3:35:13] TheJollyPainter: Altars are opt-in. They are a fun system you can try if you want to
[3:35:13] RedTheMiner: lol
[3:35:13] maloki: LUL
[3:35:14] avian946: haha!
[3:35:14] thatfunnyyt: I don't think kiwing altar would work, it is literally a challenge by the gods so extending should not be in our power
[3:35:15] runtels: toxic :D
[3:35:15] gifted0h: toxic ahahahah
[3:35:15] falsesymmetry: says the guy that calls me toxic...
[3:35:17] jwantschalk: i dont think ive failed an altar, they feel like a chore tho so i dont do them often
[3:35:19] falsesymmetry: falseLurk
[3:35:19] gharmonica: Now that's toxic
[3:35:19] itzliam_222: all of the people complaining are just terrible at the game ngl they need to realise u dont NEED all the extra studff to finish the game just get better bro
[3:35:19] bljat99: toxicskall
[3:35:20] Enirom__: yeah agree
[3:35:21] saxymatt: toxiskall /s
[3:35:22] Ganunbrar: Calling someone toxic is toxic
[3:35:23] bu1dak: truing Chatting
[3:35:24] DORITOBUCKET: the proper term would be incorrect instead of toxic KEKW
[3:35:25] Ganunbrar: huehue
[3:35:26] owlll20: +2
[3:35:27] Garnail20: get him False!!!
[3:35:27] rocketjohn: yeah but whose fault is that...
[3:35:28] TessaDraws: KEKW False
[3:35:28] VogelVrouw: Pretty toxic to call someone toxic for disagreeing
[3:35:28] StylishM0nkey: FALSE KEKW
[3:35:31] Gorbyas: false xd
[3:35:32] gaymersalsa: @falsesymmetry you and iskall are the toxic troupe Chadge
[3:35:33] lynnie_thelurker: Father Iskall, be nice to Dylan
[3:35:34] fenixcrafter05: well toxikskall thats a bit toxic ti say
[3:35:35] shaydeejay: yuppers
[3:35:35] mondgesicht98: @falsesymmetry fittig for you :D ?
[3:35:36] lemurmeister: it‚Äôs misused
[3:35:37] Fiona_Fancypants: it is thrown around a lot yeah
[3:35:39] ozraxer: so calling someone an idiot is not toxic?
[3:35:39] ihcmoonie: It causes a toxic reaction
[3:35:40] TheImmortaldonut: Lmao false
[3:35:41] gaymersalsa: RIGHT OMEGALOOL
[3:35:42] minipax84: It feels fun in the 80s+ but I found it way too punishing before that
[3:35:45] howdy_neighbor412: Mob health isn't the only issue with difficulty for casual players. Item counts and rarity are a big issue
[3:35:45] slashyamael: same as calling everyone a nzi for practily no reason
[3:35:46] MrHaloBoy: Instead of game rules, maybe a settings menu so that every one can find all the settings.
[3:35:47] Mynestyne: @falsesymmetry LUL
[3:35:49] soalsoll: Toxic
[3:35:50] Therank2100: 'You cant have an opinion thats different from mine - Thats toxic'
[3:35:52] ThingamabobMC: I‚Äôm terrible at the game but want you to know I love playing it.
[3:35:52] redstonedad: Disagreeing isn't toxic being mean or extremely negative is toxic
[3:35:55] midouzs: Someone said that if you show the penalties players would just skip the harder ones as fading .. i think that overcoming this can be done by increasing the chance of a reputation point if the penalty is a harder one
[3:35:56] SMO_SG: @gaymersalsa milkymilkyLove milkymilkyLove
[3:35:56] Ganunbrar: Is being toxic always a bad thing though?
[3:35:56] 999nightmare999: This a soft generation mane
[3:35:57] Pipeeb_: bros speaking facts imh
[3:35:58] ViciTheTenorOon: Nah I play games on hard mode and die constantly until I get good- if you play hard mode you should expect ti lose until you're better at it
[3:35:58] notTheRealHelmis: i don't agree wit that behaviour either - it is toxic hryLaf
[3:36:03] cozmo42: are we cancelling toxic?
[3:36:03] Ito_Kyoshiro: what if you reduce the impact of curses? that would be more interesting if now is 2-3 Altars per run instead of insta-bailing upon failure
[3:36:04] gaymersalsa: not giving xv VIP is toxic just sayin
[3:36:05] MunchNL: I would love to be able to complete the god altar after the timer to negate the losing of the point. this way you still have the negative modifier but not losing the point
[3:36:06] mahik750: You know whats toxic sir? Carbon monoxide.
[3:36:11] maulderman: everyone knows if you want to win an argument you just need to scream like a goat
[3:36:12] pootch_1: You say paradox is opt in but also say everyone doesn't have a choice but to go to the meta, which would be paradox
[3:36:13] Therank2100: @gaymersalsa TRUTH
[3:36:16] heighleybaily: The Internet is weird
[3:36:17] notTheRealHelmis: bip xverion_ hryUnless ?
[3:36:21] gaymersalsa: @mahik750 then why does it make my brain smarter? checkmate.
[3:36:21] cozmo42: arsenic is toxic
[3:36:25] Nauhar: focus iskall ! don‚Äôt bork the server

[3:36:27] Poe_thirteen: That sounds like a pretty toxic take on the word iskClown
[3:36:28] fenixcrafter05: @mahik750 NEED MORE CARBON
[3:36:28] mambearz: @mahik750 true
[3:36:31] gkizzle88: i love that iskall is growing a backbone
[3:36:32] gaymersalsa: @transic__ no ETA
[3:36:34] strainjp: Instead of saying toxic, just say "Going Britney"
[3:36:38] cassemess: Hey iskall what's your opinion on sand duping?

[3:36:45] notTheRealHelmis: @strainjp based
[3:36:45] LocutusOfNord: I think their point is that its very frustrating to try and share your experience with the game and just be told "git gud lul"
[3:36:45] mommyfinn: hmmmm
[3:36:46] sanikdusst: some shrooms have so mush toxicity sir
[3:36:47] itzliam_222: iskall you should use the skill issue arguement more all of the complainers are just a bit b ad ngl
[3:36:49] RealmProbablyKnew: Finally caught a stream, this series has been a fantastic time üòÆ‚Äçüí®
[3:36:54] gaymersalsa: @RealmProbablyKnew welcome in!!
[3:36:55] kibaz_x: @strainjp was just about to say that
[3:37:00] heighleybaily: @izeplaysgames yup xD
[3:37:00] Mynestyne: I love weird
[3:37:02] thatmfdes: @strainjp think too much of the fan base is too young to get that
[3:37:04] notTheRealHelmis: @RealmProbablyKnew welcome!
[3:37:12] Stagrenn: I love the internet, doesn't mean it's not weird
[3:37:12] cozmo42: that‚Äôs just what a hater would say
[3:37:16] slashyamael: haters/nazi/Bigot are almost placeholder at this point
[3:37:17] fenixcrafter05: everyone is a hater
[3:37:18] strainjp: haha
[3:37:20] Darkwytchcraft: so is "get gud"
[3:37:23] gkizzle88: its a cop out
[3:37:26] gaymersalsa: haters gonna hate - taylor swift Chadding
[3:37:26] CharredGibson: Everybody I dont like is a nazi
[3:37:30] thatfunnyyt: are you not playing anymore
[3:37:31] GhoulHunter811: who thinks of shake it off after hearing the work hater...
[3:37:34] bas3j: Remember in season 8 when you and mumbo did a hmmmmmm walk around the server?
[3:37:36] gaymersalsa: @thatfunnyyt server updating
[3:37:37] silvain_shadows: man just doesn't want altars to be useable by anyone, it's fine lol.
[3:37:38] KumaraMoon: .........
[3:37:39] pincheman: Iskall is NOT very humble
[3:37:42] StylishM0nkey: do based for that
[3:37:43] spacefalcon15: @CharredGibson ?!
[3:37:46] cozmo42: I disagree
[3:37:51] izeplaysGames: people love putting others in categories, its necessary but faulty
[3:37:53] victor_2504: But saying "toxic" is so fun! Just as long as it is done in good faith i believe
[3:37:55] joeri_van: @pincheman do people have to be humble
[3:37:58] gkizzle88: @pincheman wrong hes extremely humble
[3:38:00] gaymersalsa: but iskall is VERY BUMBLE !
[3:38:00] kibaz_x: toxic and haters, britney spears ft taylor swift
[3:38:01] Garnail20: I love this loading screen splash!
[3:38:02] FrostiTosti: that crossed a line
[3:38:04] Meena4578: morning guys (morning for me lol)
[3:38:05] itzliam_222: ?????
[3:38:06] bmemike: The humblest
[3:38:07] Cosmovoli: @gaymersalsa touch√©
[3:38:07] TessaDraws: It's fair to disagree, but its all about how you deliver it
[3:38:08] gharmonica: More people should try to play Aladdin, or worst Lion king to learn what a hard game actually means
[3:38:09] strainjp: He is a whole humble pie
[3:38:13] pootch_1: Iskall is REALLY humble
[3:38:13] SebastiaanO: not as humble as me
[3:38:15] CharredGibson: @spacefalcon15 sarcasm lol
[3:38:15] badatmath69: kendrick lammar referenc?
[3:38:16] bu1dak: iskall has made some children very angry this day KEKW
[3:38:17] lizerich: some might say he is the humblest of all
[3:38:17] FrostiTosti: humbleskall
[3:38:18] ViciTheTenorOon: Humbleskall
[3:38:18] maulderman: Iskall doesn‚Äôt sugar coat it
[3:38:19] Ganunbrar: I think Iskall has a nice balance between humble and competitiveness.
[3:38:20] gkizzle88: lol
[3:38:21] DORITOBUCKET: so humble
[3:38:21] pd1maahee: there isnt msuhroom for toxic
[3:38:23] hufppuf: lol
[3:38:25] heighleybaily: gtwsLol
[3:38:25] Knew_It_Owl: I like the internet, but sometimes the amount of opinions that are thrown around is a bit overwhelming and makes me long for a time without internet (born in 96, so never knew a time without it)
[3:38:26] TheJollyPainter: Iskall is humble, iskall is direct
[3:38:26] Gorbyas: having an opinion and being toxic/harsh are totally different things sir
[3:38:28] Zelante: what does this have to do with being humble?
[3:38:28] vimick: People are confusing your insightfulness as boastfulness
[3:38:31] 999nightmare999: We love our IskallMAN
[3:38:32] gaymersalsa: @pd1maahee nooo
[3:38:34] Lakosius2: While you talk in publich everyone HAS to agree with you otherwise they are just Toxic haters by default , NOT , but this is what the idiots think it is
[3:38:36] enkay_arts: Did the 100 days end yet?
[3:38:38] TessaDraws: @pd1maahee We have to put a cap on it
[3:38:39] Ellie_Bellie137: The difference is there is a constructive way to discuss things and a toxic way. People seem to prefer toxicity sometimes
[3:38:39] gaymersalsa: !end
[3:38:39] Nightbot: 8 DAYS until the 100 days Vault Hunters challenge is over and the Hermits need to have the artifact puzzle completed to fight the Herald! Iskall‚Äôs last episode of the series will be out on February 1st!
[3:38:40] OneTrueSpry: I think most of these people are forgetting how much easier version 3 is compared to past and that the game is supposed to be a challenge
[3:38:41] cozmo42: hatefully disagree sir
[3:38:41] omkaarr: lool it felt like my game started
[3:38:42] Speederxxl: !end
[3:38:43] thatfunnyyt: I think people confuse Iskall being totally upfront about what he thinks to him being toxic
[3:38:46] sparkkd: I agree with your opinion on the toxic word being over and misused but continiously telling your player base to "git gud" what else do you expect?
[3:38:48] Khalin1212: You can disagree in a constructive way or in a toxic way
[3:38:49] Oo_rjit: i think telling once idea is not toxic but forcing others to agree is toxic
[3:38:49] phoenixdrakenfire: Iskall is a fungi, there isn't mushroom for haters here
[3:38:50] GhoulHunter811: VIP Xverion @iskall85 LUL  poor salsa
[3:38:52] GhostlyMarrow49: good make children angry is a good thing
[3:38:55] sanikdusst: thats mush debatable sir..
[3:38:56] jametrics: Yeah I would add to that, that's it is also how you receive not just how you deliver
[3:38:57] Nightbot: www.youtube.com/iskall85 | www.twitter.com/iskall85 | https://youtube.com/@vodskall85
[3:38:57] angrrrrydad: hey i'm the only angry
[3:38:57] gkizzle88: nope
[3:39:01] silvain_shadows: sir i would like you to actually count how many altars you fail vs complete
[3:39:02] jemasuo: iskall i want to ask something  why we cant use like 30 silver instead of 270 bronze on artisan station? its harder to give more bronze when its wants more,
[3:39:02] Darkwytchcraft: let's just say that the two words Get GUD are also overused, whenever anyone who is maybe physically or otherwise unable to get any better than where they may be at this moment in time.
[3:39:03] Ganunbrar: You called someone an idiot, which is being perceived as toxic
[3:39:04] Gorbyas: False xd
[3:39:04] DORITOBUCKET: the ledditors
[3:39:06] bmemike: You called the guy that called you an idiot - which is fair
[3:39:07] pereiraahd: false
[3:39:08] cozmo42: you said Falses doll was toxic
[3:39:09] bu1dak: the ones attacking your personality because you made your game "hard" seem angry to me LUL
[3:39:10] JarnoZZTV: you called false toxic
[3:39:13] dswa_earl: Im not against any choice you guys make in game, just curious what purpose losing reputation has if you already get cursed
[3:39:13] dawn11672: The world has forgotten that you can disagree with someone without being a jerk about it.
[3:39:15] hompat: you call toxic mr.anyone
[3:39:17] pereiraahd: xD , but she can be at times
[3:39:18] kimiko2547: person =/= behaviour
[3:39:20] CharredGibson: I like the old Britney spears song tho tbh
[3:39:26] Cosmovoli: could there be a statistic of altar completion ?
[3:39:27] pincheman: I am very angry with iskall that's why I watch his streams
[3:39:29] pixelcrack_: disagreeing = toxic NOTED
[3:39:34] TheImmortaldonut: Unless their opinion is actually toxic
[3:39:35] Lakosius2: Ohh can we have Altars as a Statistic ?
[3:39:35] saxymatt: But you are supposed to fail altars, its not fun if you win every time
[3:39:37] Knew_It_Owl: No what you said was: "If you call someone toxic because they disagree with you, you're a idiot"
[3:39:38] rocketjohn: also worth noting that altars are completely optional
[3:39:39] gaymersalsa: iskall when will u VIP xv soulless
[3:39:39] saxymatt: there's no challenge
[3:39:39] maloki: failing builds character!
[3:39:43] izeplaysGames: failers gonna fail Kappa
[3:39:45] pwn3dzilla: so how does punishing failure more improve that?
[3:39:47] Nightbot: Vault Hunters Reddit for you to check out! https://www.reddit.com/r/VaultHuntersMinecraft/
[3:39:47] FrostiTosti: mad cuz bad is what they are
[3:39:48] nerdoidaao: failing is part of playing
[3:39:49] gunhippy: Is it possible to state all the completion and fails of alters and vaults on the player screen?
[3:39:49] 20egemen04: Iskall is never vip-ing Xv is he?
[3:39:51] leo2369q: but you dont lose anything with objectives
[3:39:52] InsaneDevil10: I think when you are passionate about something and there is a disagreement regarding the same, it's easy to get carried away and sound toxic when in actuality it's just the passion that's overwhelming the debate
[3:39:53] rain_9991: Ah .. like blaming anything but themselves lol
[3:39:56] lizerich: i mean failing in life then failing in game lols
[3:39:56] maulderman: Iskall sounds like the one friend who doesn‚Äôt like the rest of the groups trash talk and is trying to calmly get them to stop but mostly failing
[3:39:56] Stagrenn: Refusing disagreements to your opinion is like saying it does not stand up to scrutiny
[3:39:57] silvain_shadows: bc you're ALSO failing more than you complete, which would lock you out of any reputation benefits if you lose reputation when failing
[3:39:58] gaymersalsa: @20egemen04 nope.
[3:39:59] Poe_thirteen: I'm used to failing. My parents expect it now, kekw
[3:39:59] fenixcrafter05: not VIPing x is toxic
[3:39:59] gcox2012: Could you have a stat for overall completion kinda like a K/D stat
[3:40:00] runtels: The game isn't bad, they just need to get good
[3:40:01] Ganunbrar: How would it work with the paradox btw, if you lose rep with a god, do you lose a random room?
[3:40:03] 999nightmare999: In the words of one great Giannis: there is no failure there's steps to success
[3:40:04] henks50: does the daily vault work now
[3:40:04] gaymersalsa: yes....................
[3:40:05] csheff56: i fail at life daily, but here I am still playing XD
[3:40:05] sunnyr0ad: I think the gain for altars is so great that a failing condition is necessary
[3:40:07] verqix: I would like my toxicity as a stat
[3:40:08] soupisthegood: TransgenderPride
[3:40:08] 20egemen04: Yay
[3:40:08] renz32: Everytine i fail a vault, i just think im bad lol
[3:40:09] gharmonica: If I wanna fail I'd just live my real life
[3:40:12] vaaaarna: Moore STATS! yeyy
[3:40:12] tumbleina: we grew up thinking failure is a very bad thing, its not always bad
[3:40:13] mejeree: It's fine to fail altars now, the question becomes how many people actually complete 50% + of their altars. If you lose rep, and don't complete 50%+ of your altars, you are just gated out of paradox vault
[3:40:13] dswa_earl: If already cursed why also lose a point? Not against it just curious
[3:40:14] gaymersalsa: wait did he say altar is never VIP ing OMEGALOOL
[3:40:16] leo2369q: you dont lose anything with objectives
[3:40:17] zinou2019: yes i dont fail i just win
[3:40:18] s1m0n251: I think altars are rng based and thats the problem
[3:40:21] Lakosius2: We also have already Treasure rooms as a Statistic , so it makes sense
[3:40:21] sanikdusst: (secretly trying to trigger iskalls mushroom jokes) mushy vaults iskall..
[3:40:24] gkizzle88: this is the diff between new games theses days and the games that were made back in the day
[3:40:25] TheImmortaldonut: People are fragile and don't like to hear that they're not good at aomething
[3:40:27] mirohtomysoul: @gaymersalsa KEKW
[3:40:29] gaymersalsa: everybody fails all the time
[3:40:30] RobUrHood: What's that sword transmog?
[3:40:32] robor_1: has the vault end screen bug with teams been fixed?
[3:40:34] SwimStyle: i dont know about that, i think it may be a negative confirmation bias when they get rng'd out of completion, ie; no champions spawn, no dungeons appear, as much as they run they dont find enough chests of the appropriate type, etc
[3:40:34] Speederxxl: i win in failing
[3:40:35] Ito_Kyoshiro: reduce curses so Altar  become 2-3 per run instead of a one time instance (like Dungeons)
[3:40:40] Xer0ed: failure is a learning opportunity
[3:40:40] gaymersalsa: @RobUrHood from the 189+ gold revive
[3:40:43] LocutusOfNord: I'm ok with failing. Makes me want to do better. But when the altar feels like RNG whether it's even completable? And I fail because of RNG? THAT, I don't like.
[3:40:45] arnston: I dont mind fail altars or pbj. but being double punished with negatives in addition of not getting the reward is a bad feeling
[3:40:47] SalikBashir: what are we doing today
[3:40:48] dawn11672: Participation awards did that
[3:40:48] fenixcrafter05: yeah but in schools they punish u for failing
[3:40:49] Ganunbrar: Failure might not always be bad, but it does feel bad.
[3:40:49] floppypidgen: what if you make the chance of failing the alter be 1-affinity? Would make people who fail alters have a way of reducing impact of failure!
[3:40:49] Thirdeyechakra69: iskall it‚Äôs very important
[3:40:51] bu1dak: I've never failed Chadding
[3:40:51] gkizzle88: @Xer0ed agree
[3:40:52] vimick: Failure is a learning oppt
[3:40:53] Knew_It_Owl: Then I will be one hell of a human being with the amount of failures
[3:40:53] redstonedad: I blame participation trophies
[3:40:57] pd1maahee: Failure is the best lesson
[3:40:58] pixelcrack_: i fail in COVID test now i am Sadge Kappa
[3:40:59] Gorbyas: philosophySkall
[3:40:59] thunderbird6784: then there are those parents of autistic children trying to explain that other opinions besides their own are not toxic.  smh ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
[3:41:00] strainjp: Call of Duty gamer mentallity I used to get so mad playing that game but failing has become part of the fun
[3:41:00] silvain_shadows: lol iskall does not get my point but it's ok, i trust the dev team to point out the balance issue
[3:41:01] grafpa1: Take chances, get messy, make mistakes
[3:41:02] Therank2100: Failure is the best way to learn as long as you use the information and knowledge correctly
[3:41:05] slashv2: I failed a LOT.. Imma be rich!
[3:41:05] jametrics: Failure is how science functions. All science is built on failures of those who come before
[3:41:05] Lakosius2: but nobody is Admiting their Failures anymore honestly
[3:41:06] angelwitch25: insymNod jip i fail to not eat donuts all the time lol
[3:41:07] gaymersalsa: not me hryYimmy
[3:41:07] marebear_87: failing used to be part of the gaming process. I'd play the same level in donkey kong country over and over because I'd fail, but I'd keep playing until I got better.
[3:41:07] TigerFly86: to me failure is a very good thing it pushes me to be better
[3:41:08] kimiko2547: challenge acceoted
[3:41:08] Darkwytchcraft: don't blame participation trophies eesh
[3:41:09] Endermands: its not failing its learning
[3:41:09] mirohtomysoul: True, without failure you wouldn't have this dope sword transmog!
[3:41:11] RobUrHood: @gaymersalsa Oh, but I don't die =\
[3:41:15] swordo3612: i think the problem is 3rd edition introduced a lot of "Casual" player
[3:41:16] dor_ben_shmuel_: wisskull
[3:41:16] JarnoZZTV: What class are you playing this weekend in diablo?
[3:41:17] gaymersalsa: i have never failed anything im a perfect human being hryYimmy
[3:41:18] lizerich: everyone hates rng, but then reality slaps you that all your subatomic particles also obeys probabilistic theory
[3:41:19] Retromom702: Let's get to 100
[3:41:19] Saranas: Failing is a very learning gain, unless you are stubborn to not want to rethink and analyse why it failed. We learn more on fails than successes
[3:41:20] sanikdusst: mushed vaults sir
[3:41:21] ZombZombKatie: if you‚Äôre not failing you‚Äôre not trying xp
[3:41:23] itzliam_222: i dont fail im the goat Chatting Chatting

[3:41:28] 999nightmare999: Unrelated note this sword takes so much of the screen
[3:41:30] winricheichinger: I gave your suggestion another thought and I do like it (from a gaming perspective I liked it anyway^^). I was simply imagining nice gods and not ancient gods.
[3:41:32] grafpa1: @dawn11672 hell yeah
[3:41:33] tumbleina: of course failure feels bad, thats what you were taught, i was taught the same thing
[3:41:34] pincheman: Some people just take games too seriously
[3:41:36] RobUrHood: Jocko Willink - Good
[3:41:36] vaaaarna: the sword is bigger than the shield
[3:41:36] gaymersalsa: @Gorbyas maybe one day
[3:41:36] Xer0ed: failing fast before you're pot committed is important.
[3:41:36] robeeeeto: I would like to play that pack but my pc isn't too good to be able to play it

[3:41:43] jemasuo: iskall i want to ask why we cant use like 30 silver instead of 270 bronze on artisan station? its harder to give more bronze when its wants more, is it hard to implement
[3:41:46] fin03103: gotta work on improving my RNG manipulation skills XD
[3:41:50] Ganunbrar: Gods are generally not very nice :P
[3:41:52] Artorias921: Maybe it would be more logical to add something like god's anger . For example - if you lose the god challenge you get this god's anger and if you lose the challenge again then you lose 1 reputation point and if you win the challenge after losing then you get rid of god's anger. Is that a good idea? @iskall85 <3
[3:41:53] transic__: which transmog is that sword?
[3:41:54] Iron_the_Beast: what are you drinking sir
[3:41:55] freddyb8: Look at false message in game

[3:46:11] jarivd03: imo mana and heal are too strong to run cleane
[3:46:13] Vlazmanian_Devil: Having poison avoidance on gear makes it hard to justify.

[3:49:48] Xer0ed: did etho hit 100?
[3:49:55] Nightbot: Watch iskall85‚Äôs VOD‚Äôs at https://youtube.com/@vodskall85

[3:50:06] Nightbot: Check out what level the Hermitcraft members are on their Vault Hunters server: https://vaulthunters.gg/armory/browse
[3:50:12] 999nightmare999: It's too niche imo
[3:50:12] Ganunbrar: Cleanse requires you to either have lifesteal or the healing totem though.
[3:50:13] gaymersalsa: very true, love my speed 4 NODDERS
[3:50:15] Nightbot: Support the devs & the pack.  https://www.patreon.com/VaultHunters
[3:50:20] redstonedad: Being a newer player the modifier icons are hard to understand
[3:50:21] Smarba86: Hello iskall sir
[3:50:24] dswa_earl: If my speed goes over 3 I get dizzy LUL
[3:50:25] Jarethkor: Speed -- if you ain't first your last.
[3:50:27] gaymersalsa: if he completes a 2nd bounty this vault, thatll be a BING
[3:50:27] RobUrHood: man a poison nova on those guys down there would be so juicy
[3:50:29] LennyPlay: LennyPlay subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 13 months! <3

[3:50:40] JahinDraws: dang those are some dangerous turtle and shrooms
[3:50:46] maxmuster12321: @iskall85 hey man What happens to the divine paradox if you have less points than when you built it?
[3:50:52] Artemiz_Prime: Perhaps its reputation required like 5 (just a random number) to see the curse of the corresponding god challenge
[3:50:56] the_whtvr: if you show curse it will confuse players
[3:50:57] Therank2100: You were right when you said it makes no sense lore-wise
[3:50:58] gaymersalsa: @maxmuster12321 i dont think anything happens
[3:51:02] rocketjohn: that's sounds quite god-like
[3:51:06] dswa_earl: What is the purpose of losing a point if you already get cursed for failing?
[3:51:07] TheJollyPainter: Maybe that could be an expertise?
[3:51:07] cozmo42: lore wise it doesn‚Äôt work
[3:51:08] mirohtomysoul: Is it though? That's what a lot of gods do in religious scriptures though
[3:51:10] pootch_1: That's what curses mean anyways
[3:51:11] jasethupol: specific gods have specific curses
[3:51:11] AllieRise: i think showing the curse on the altar just means that some altars will always be auto skipped for example if it has fading
[3:51:12] spurlucke: Make it 2-3 possible curses, no one's gonna pick fading
[3:51:12] redstonedad: @maxmuster12321 good question
[3:51:16] saxymatt: Have you thought about being able to start a new altar challenge before you complete the first one? Immediately curses it, maybe adds another negative?
[3:51:17] shubhu321mj: what is his sword. looks cool
[3:51:21] 999nightmare999: More like Do this at your own risk
[3:51:22] BlueBKDD: @jarethkor that‚Äôs nonsense you could be 2nd or third .. lol Ricky Bobby!
[3:51:22] swordo3612: @maxmuster12321 doesn't matter
[3:51:23] the_flerken: you can show the curse after taking the challenge maybe?
[3:51:26] bibabuzzelman: lorewise you could use charm essence to prefent a loss  kinda thing
[3:51:29] gaymersalsa: @shubhu321mj transmog from the 189+ gold revive
[3:51:30] Grimm8_: Show both, encourage the positive while showing what they get for failing
[3:51:33] DORITOBUCKET: honestly I love pylons ngl
[3:51:35] Jarethkor: @BlueBKDD ;)
[3:51:40] shubhu321mj: @gaymersalsa thx
[3:51:41] totallynotbia: why does the vault hunters armory website say you've only did 13 vaults lol?
[3:51:42] karthavya: Iskall lore wise the GOD also informs about the consequences of not completing the challenge
[3:51:50] midouzs: Also how about increasing the chance of getting a reputation point if the shown curse is harder?
[3:51:54] Gorbyas: do we count bounty xp towards GAMBA ?
[3:51:55] dswa_earl: But what is the purpose?
[3:51:57] Gsitb: aye! lvl 99
[3:51:59] gaymersalsa: @totallynotbia that part of player data got wiped yesterday, will be fixed later today in a couple hours
[3:52:03] gaymersalsa: @Gorbyas NOPERS
[3:52:05] izeplaysGames: he'S a gambaMAN
[3:52:09] fenixcrafter05: can u gamba in the uk?
[3:52:13] gaymersalsa: !nopredict
[3:52:14] Nightbot: Viewers in Denmark, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Philippines, Poland, Quebec, Singapore, Sweden, Korea, and Turkey are now able to do spectator predictions.  Meaning you can predict without using channel points.  No points are earned.
[3:52:14] jametrics: Don't show the curses please it messes with the lore
[3:52:14] dswa_earl: No the purpose of reputation loss
[3:52:19] HeyimJrules: everytime i click the god altar all i get is cursed with fading so no more for me
[3:52:19] e88mars: Could you choose between a curse and loss of reputation point?
[3:52:20] Gorbyas: @gaymersalsa sadge
[3:52:22] dswa_earl: Not against it just curious
[3:52:30] denisthemenace1203: sir cant you hit 100 if you open bounty crates?
[3:52:31] redstonedad: Playing solo transmogs are blah
[3:52:32] JahinDraws: My computer is busted at the moment, grabbing the modpack as soon as it gets fixed.
[3:52:36] Smarba86: What if instead of a curse, it gives a random negative modifier that stacks continuesly
[3:52:40] jasethupol: treasure
[3:52:41] totallynotbia: @gaymersalsa seems fine on etho- were there only some wiped?
[3:52:43] mirohtomysoul: Still think that the likelihood of losing a rep point should also depend on how far you got into the challenge
[3:52:51] Ganunbrar: If you lose rep, then those rooms aren't permanent right?
[3:52:52] Oo_rjit: 88 days
[3:52:53] gaymersalsa: @gaymersalsa yeah, those who were online at the time i think
[3:52:56] akii2390: find living sir
[3:53:01] DeadPine: Goodmorning!
[3:53:02] gaymersalsa: dressing up nicely for mr Herald Gayge

[3:53:07] Knew_It_Owl: You have bomignite
[3:53:09] freddyb8: Does anyone know if Etho is lvl 100?
[3:53:10] fovvox_: my friend clicks god altars every time and spams the vault with curses
[3:53:16] DeadPine: gaymersalsa pineWave
[3:53:19] gaymersalsa: @freddyb8 no, hes 98
[3:53:23] slimboyrobin: Can you continue playing normal vaults after reaching lvl 100 or do you have to defeat Herald before continuing??
[3:53:24] midouzs: how about increasing the chance of getting a reputation point if the shown curse is harder? .. like if your curse is going to be fading you get 30% more chance to get a reputation point if you complete the altar
[3:53:24] gaymersalsa: !armory
[3:53:24] Nightbot: Check out what level the Hermitcraft members are on their Vault Hunters server: https://vaulthunters.gg/armory/browse

[3:53:57] freddyb8: @deadpine hello sir
[3:53:59] the_flerken: btw, unrelated idea for god altars ‚Äî maybe god tears can be crafted into smth that acts as "god altar fruits" to increase the time for the challenge?
[3:53:59] weis_12: iskPIRATE
[3:54:05] DeadPine: Really good! Just enjoying my day off! Hope you are well good sir!
[3:54:07] Knew_It_Owl: @iskall85 Two rooms back is a bomognite door and if I saw correctly, you have the correct key
[3:54:08] ghost27488: Iskall what gives more xp? Braisers or elixir rush?
[3:54:08] ramnite_tv: Sounds like a very long day KEKW
[3:54:10] MaraudingBacon: @fovvox_ there are many places to find server to play with people. including iskal VH discord
[3:54:13] e88mars: Could one or the curses be loss of reputation point?
[3:54:15] dswa_earl: What is the reasoning behind losing reputation if there is already cursed for failing?
[3:54:22] akii2390: not any treasure?
[3:54:24] DeadPine: ChaoticTom31 freddyb8 pineWave
[3:54:24] BlueLineLaila: is there a list somewhere for iskalls keybindings?

[3:54:39] asch_win: @iskall85 god says what happens if you fail his challenge in religions and books(like bible kuran)
[3:54:45] ChaoticTom31: @DeadPine hope you and lady deadpine are Well today :D
[3:54:48] Ganunbrar: Wouldn't be surprised if Etho is taking it a bit easy right now. He's been spamming this game a lot :P

[3:55:03] Poe_thirteen: I miss all of my god transmogs from before my server reset
[3:55:04] AlliBlueS: has iskall run his daily divine paradox vault?
[3:55:05] jocgame2012: Maybe the lore for seing the curse is basically: Can you do this for me? You think you can, but if you fail...
[3:55:05] LowKeyChemist: I did like the idea that someone mentioned earlier of making the reputation loss one of the "curses"
[3:55:10] bogdanel1993: Potion fixed?
[3:55:10] dragonslayerx453: Are there acostomeed catalyst ?

[3:56:10] DORITOBUCKET: you passed a VenDoor Sadge
[3:56:15] midouzs: Can you make it that if the shown penalty is harder you get more chance to get a reputation point if you complete the altar?
[3:56:17] Knew_It_Owl: @turtle__booty  STOMPA
[3:56:17] RobUrHood: little xp balls is what they are
[3:56:20] ChaoticTom31: slimes are friends, not pistons. lol
[3:56:29] GingerHagrid: GingerHagrid subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months! hi!!

[3:56:36] Ganunbrar: Is it even possible to remove vanilla xp?
[3:56:39] cozmo42: so you would lose a reputation here
[3:56:41] leo2369q: f
[3:56:44] DORITOBUCKET: we need a petition to make all slimes friendly, they are besties not enemies
[3:56:55] DeadPine: Nah not too many @Smarba86 the new recoil makes things feel different for sure though!

[3:57:32] Khalin1212: You don't need to be ashamed of performance issues. It's more common than you'd think
[3:57:35] AlliBlueS: and you would lose one velara reputation too
[3:57:37] dragonslayerx453: Hunter?? Speck

[3:57:48] TheImmortaldonut: I kinda miss that sound in her cosy vault videos lol
[3:57:51] saxymatt: You should put a dispenser with the hunter flasks that shoots one out whenever you activate a portal

[5:08:05] queenofdarkness93: Had to drive to work and thought I'd miss him hitting 100 so glad I didn't
[5:08:06] Ganunbrar: Is there a wooden omega room?
[5:08:09] Kriskiki89: its almost as if someone told you chaos weights were not right lol

[5:08:23] Lakosius2: Queue the Digsite
[5:08:25] sam201a: what vault is this
[5:08:26] mahik750: @da1dman easiest to tell apart would be (aside from the looks of the rooms), that the painting room doesn't have mob spawns, while the factory room does, as that is a challenge room.
[5:08:26] wes76544: what theme is this?
[5:08:27] ambernichole2: Finally catching a stream !! Love your content Iskall !!

[5:08:55] aegavor: @grafpa1 cant yet. only allowed hunter at the 10 mins left mark
[5:09:05] leroyjaymin: @Ganunbrar technically no, but the "equivalent" would probably be the digsite room, in which you can get a lot of catalyst fragments, which is the "main draw" of wooden chests

[5:09:34] Ganunbrar: I wouldn't mind a wooden omega room where you find a large wooden chest filled with wooden chests :P
[5:09:42] mahik750: This is interesting, that usually wooden is the "easy" part of the scavs
[5:09:45] MasterTRED: are there any catalysts on the crystal or just the chaos theme?
[5:09:45] izeplaysGames: why not just go for woooden now, lootskall? Kappa
[5:09:50] da1dman: @baernon There's a new mechicanic where you can anvil on to the crystal I believe

[5:12:59] Spiderwolf27: If the scav is calculated, is it always finishable? What I mean is: 30 ripped pages, so there would be enough wooden chests? Or is it possible that there are only 20 wooden chests, so that you can't complete it? Just wondering.
