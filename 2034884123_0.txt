[1:55:45] fezzaf40: no mario party then Sadage
[1:55:47] Go_Wish: It looks like the deployers did not fully extend
[1:55:48] shooouk: use a pulse repeater and do like 10 seconds

[1:56:38] theracing_gamer: @jessaa121 I guess the steaks be high Kappa
[1:56:46] scarletsounds: It may not be the delay, the deployed might need powered for longer
[1:56:50] LogicPW: why don't u use a repeater from create? u can manipulate the delay

[1:57:35] jrb4562: add a timed delay here
[1:57:38] eklironman0924: Maybe slow the speed down?

[1:57:40] fezzaf40: @theracing_gamer idk if this is weird but i dont really like eating steak for dinner, i mostly eat steaks for lunch
[1:57:41] blackhandsring: maybe its a gear ratio problem
[1:57:42] Go_Wish: If it places twice every once in a while. That is a better problem than not placing every once in a while.
[1:57:48] fezzaf40: poor x33n Sadage

[1:58:30] jessaa121: @fezzaf40 i could eat steak anytime
[1:58:55] Go_Wish: Does the sequenced gearshift only go while redstone is applied? If so, the pulse might not be lasting long enough.
