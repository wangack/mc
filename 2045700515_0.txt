[2:00:59] DeadRote: @BTMC They have been pushing a lot of ads recently (it was 1 ad per 20 videos, now around 1 ad per 8 videos), so they pushed CPM as well. But CPM works per region. So it's $2-3 CPM for the views only from NA, for other regions views you will get lower CPM, which will make your average go lower. Youtube Shorts meanwhile operates based on category and content creator region

[2:07:21] Krydar: @BTMC I actually have a take on this. Originally Sound Voltex was supposed to be futuristic shit plastered all over, very hi-tech, very cluttered. That was the intent. After Konami realized anime girls sold more, they started plastering anime girls on it everywhere and now it's kind of its biggest appeal. It's Japan's culture and market. It's what sells, it's what people pay attention to.

[2:43:44] Enyoti: i'm saying how many maps on average in the current day reach such a status where they would deserve the status of loved as it was imagined in the beginning
[2:43:46] freddiiieeee: yeah, their rate of nominations is only as strong as their motivation for the position
[2:43:47] Arrzed: forum's score on this is crazy
[2:43:47] uwuKia: i prefer cookiezi 2016 skin
[2:43:53] Singularid4d: @UserSeif this sentence would be weird without the osu context
[2:43:57] Enyoti: how many maps become legitimately notable that aren't ranked
[2:44:01] Enzo_SuperCraftZ: @UserSeif you made it weird
[2:44:01] freddiiieeee: 1100 for SS? That's abysmally low :(
[2:44:09] Singularid4d: @UserSeif i know i did SmileW
[2:44:11] Kanae_CS: monkoedit best skin
[2:44:19] MrChompysaur: @freddiiieeee each bn only has a 3-4 nomination average per month quota to reach

[2:44:55] Singularid4d: yeah not possible
[2:44:58] DeadRote: The ranking process is overcomplicated for the sake of being overcomplicated with a bunch of elitist people deciding if the map is good based on subjective point of view. If it's timed correctly to the song, not breaking gameplay mechanics and systems - it should be ranked, period

[2:46:13] Enyoti: i feel like the social aspect of mapping is cringe but otherwise idgaf
[2:46:16] DerpyFoxPlayz: quailty of a beatmap can be pretty subjective
