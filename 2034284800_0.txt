[2:13:21] Ztephenn: i thought it was a fish that liked the taste of piss so it would just bite the peen
[2:13:26] somelucky_: Candirú is a tiny Amazonian parasitic catfish reported to swim into urethral and other body openings of unprotected bathers. It is also known as canero, carnero, and urethra fish, and is a member of the genus Vandellia.
[2:13:27] YourNotScaryy: @JonBams While browsing the Internet, you may have read strange tales of a fish that’s known for swimming up the male urethra, becoming painfully lodged there. This fish is called the candiru and is a member of the genus Vandellia.
[2:13:27] wheaties2k2: @JonBams WIKI: "In the 21st episode of the 3rd season of Grey's Anatomy, a man is admitted to a hospital with a candiru fish in his urethra."
[2:13:28] UmmnLala: JB about to go ask jeeves
[2:13:34] Hamparty: do you eat the fish after you get it out like those fancy coffee beans taken from poop
[2:13:37] Tera: @SlothLivesMatter "The candiru feeds on blood and is commonly found in the gill cavities of other fishes. It sometimes also parasitizes man and has been known to enter the urethras of bathers and swimming animals."

[2:14:16] ApexBureaucrat: These smaller species are known for an alleged tendency to invade and parasitise the human urethra; however, despite ethnological reports dating back to the late 19th century,[5] the first documented case of the removal of a candiru from a human urethra did not occur until 1997, and even that incident has remained a matter of controversy.

I have to resort to the cannon mounted at the top of the stairs loaded with grape shot, “Tally ho lads”. The grape shot shreds two men in the blast, the sound and extra shrapnel set off car alarms.

[3:44:06] ktorn_: thanks!
[3:44:07] brawlin_mando: Realistically a lot of these projects take longer than a month and the lack of content can't be good for the channel. If you could make a video once a week of just the things you vomit out of your mouth for entertainment and then do the large video when it is ready would seem like it would be better for the channel.
[3:44:13] cyphurduran: Everyone unsub then?

[3:45:34] DeePick: what's the plan once you get to the 3 month projects?
[3:45:38] mytainttwitchy: twitch chat complains about some guy complaining, toxic!!!
[3:45:42] brawlin_mando: A weekly short funny Jon Nams vomit video would help keep the existing YouTube people happy
[3:45:49] TheMulkeyway: 1 a month? that would be he cant stall anymore KEKW
[3:45:50] isaiahisswaggyboss: Hi there
[3:45:58] naughty_eyebrow: you can leak a nude video of yours and then drop youtube video

[3:46:03] klorkenixoriginal: will there be videos for madpack 5?
[3:46:13] JayoRed: Are you telling me this streamer actually has a brain and stopped what he was doing and thought about it with his brain
[3:46:18] DeePick: fine line between "oh shit another bams video i bet it's good" and "who was this bams guy that just popped up?"
[3:46:25] CedKilleur: in 2023 we uploaded a video/day and lost around 3000 subscribers total if you wanna know chat

[3:47:32] aceamanda: Ced is bams conscious
[3:47:38] juh4ni_gg: !vod-directory still a thing?

[3:47:41] brawlin_mando: I think a lot of the YouTube homies don't know about the vods

[3:48:19] juh4ni_gg: @4tw0ne bamYes
[3:48:27] naughty_eyebrow: since you build something all the time, how about a weekly video with the recap?
[3:48:55] Xray1281: I think the problem is some of the YouTube homies don’t know the vods are here on twitter
[3:48:59] Cybernetic_Overlord: Amanda spending the GDP of a small country at target KEKW
[3:49:01] RollyPinder: why can’t ced upload to yt him reacting to your stream
[3:49:03] Xray1281: Twitch
