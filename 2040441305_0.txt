[1:26:05] vixi_victrix: Yeah bow drills are neat
[1:26:08] BertPotato: That's because you're hungry

[1:27:03] vixi_victrix: It basically just lights the fire using friction, the "bow" makes it possible to spin the stick faster than you could by hand (causing the friction, causing the fire)
[1:27:26] BertPotato: It'll say "make a pickaxe to mine the stone" - then you pick it up from a box

[3:12:16] saksham_2525: yeah thats bs
[3:12:20] lynnie_thelurker: Is that why people got 0's?
[3:12:20] Monday_from_M: That was even before points..
[3:12:24] rere8585: he blocked those players from joining that round maybe
[3:12:33] Arjan308: yeah it was at the end aswell
[3:12:43] tortillacorpse: Cuz then they couldn't practice.
[3:12:46] saksham_2525: @rere8585 ohhh yeah maybe
[3:12:49] vadskamanta: One of the person he blocked in came up to him afterwards and complaining about it, and he didn't even realise they were actually mad about it
[3:12:51] jxstGavin: I feel like it isn't actually a punishment but a reward ☠️
[3:13:02] actual_supernova: tbf it might be a small hinderance to newer players, but still kinda severe for such a minor thing
[3:13:18] lynnie_thelurker: 1 warning, 2nd penalty
[3:13:25] actual_supernova: but the death match? they just screwed up the rest of the poor peeps in there
[3:13:40] saksham_2525: maybe he shouldnt have called the mfs mfs

[3:15:47] Giafone: well it was last 20 seconds of practice
[3:16:02] saksham_2525: chat were they supposed to walk to the next area after training or were they teleported, because if they had to walk then fruit actually screwed them
[3:16:04] Giafone: but i think the 20 other people should complain haha
[3:16:13] vadskamanta: Teleported
[3:16:27] actual_supernova: hanging tree vibes

[3:17:50] lynnie_thelurker: So, 21st place is now safe
[3:17:51] rere8585: maybe because money is involved they are stricter
[3:18:03] actual_supernova: vads we gotta watch newest movie soon
[3:18:08] vadskamanta: @suurklemm If you mean right now? This is for everyone because of lag issues
[3:18:15] actual_supernova: where did maddy go
[3:18:19] vadskamanta: We do Nova
[3:18:23] BertPotato: They're still talking about the weaponry, I'm guessing they're filling time while something gets fixed
[3:18:47] vadskamanta: We get to play the game Drake
[3:18:48] lynnie_thelurker: New player getting one shotted, traumatic.
[3:19:18] vadskamanta: Also no sound from shooting=

[3:20:41] Tntaap1: that is creepy
[3:20:42] vadskamanta: The gameplay is sooooo smoooooth
[3:20:43] lynnie_thelurker: Looks like they lowered effects to accommodate lag, but resulted in accuracy issues
[3:20:50] suurklemm: if this would be in fps games
[3:20:54] jackxlwashere: this is.....interesting
[3:21:01] idlo09: rip foosh
[3:21:02] StrawberryMilkShakies: Very scuffed
[3:21:27] vadskamanta: Isn't this also a big part of the game the other three days?
[3:21:41] actual_supernova: punching might just be better LMAOO
[3:21:54] vadskamanta: You have bandaids

[3:23:39] bsbcosplay: rivals fix your game mod
[3:23:44] BertPotato: Well if 20 people get eliminated in the death match, it'll at least have fewer players
[3:23:55] jxstGavin: Also dealt a hitmarker on a player 3 seconds after the kill lol
[3:24:01] vadskamanta: ngl I don't think 20 people will do that much of a difference here
[3:24:03] Phoenix_tan: @vadskamanta reasons why i stopped playing NODDERS
[3:24:03] vixi_victrix: Someone from behind got you
[3:24:06] samwich1991: HUH
