[3:14:59] Dolphinlord44: @skyskooo you could totally be right about the market stuff for  the current state of the game for all i know, however, just looking at the dates of the last few updates, its not like they have abandoned the game at all it will just take time to polish. I am also not saying whether or not it was a good idea to completely deprecate csgo before cs2 was fully ready, I just think that valve will eventually get there.
