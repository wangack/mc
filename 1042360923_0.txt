[1:00:49] Pokesaurus_rex: WAFW No one will use this
[1:00:49] Economip: doing graduate economics atm and data science is leaking in here too. it's taking over.
[1:00:50] Nexhunter: so F1 is going to use this stuff KEKW
[1:00:51] omar_i_: yeah they would, where i work at we use similar super machines for pentesting purposes for cracking passwords
[1:00:55] CocoScruff: wait - these can do face overlays??? i'm in
[1:00:55] masternaranja: so this DGX can run simulations of materials/componentes and renders or is it too overkill?
[1:00:55] premalonetv: All I hear is "we're enabeling skynet"

[1:02:02] Crizzle777: marshallx I work in fintech too, I'm a software engineer
[1:02:06] shengdeluo: could you actually use one of these for gaming?
[1:02:11] 0sem0: waffleHeart
[1:02:12] masternaranja: @Nexhunter lets say a load applied on a component designes in solid works, se the deformation, stress points, etc
[1:02:13] Nexhunter: @joaofcmb when quadros came onto the market
[1:02:14] MrPooter: @mattdanielj He like half blinks monkaS
[1:02:15] Durunirid: No GPUs anymore KEKW
[1:02:16] premalonetv: Wait the skynet is in the pizza too now?!

[1:02:32] Durunirid: They lost from AMD so they need something else

[1:02:33] Nexhunter: these suck at gaming
[1:02:36] AlphaSchnauzer: the term gpu seems incorrect now
[1:02:42] Crazyfox55: yea no gaming
[1:02:42] Invalidm_: what the fuck did I come back to
[1:02:42] M1k3D3l7a: nop, not gaming at all. just calculating still
[1:02:44] DaGMC: the question is how many PetaHashes per second it can produce Kappa
[1:02:45] Ramnog: @premalone001 un the soap todo KEKW
[1:02:46] MikeTheTechLead: Training DLSS
[1:02:49] silv: they probably don't have the standard PCI'e protocol
[1:02:52] Nexhunter: but they are god tier at float point math unlike your geforce drivers
[1:02:54] mechoriet: probably alot of tensor cores
[1:02:54] MrPooter: @orillion Needs more learning LUL
[1:02:55] M1k3D3l7a: Invalidm_ second part of the keynote
[1:03:04] joaofcmb: Might aswell call them VPUs
[1:03:05] shengdeluo: makes sense
[1:03:06] mechoriet: and CUDA
[1:03:11] Crazyfox55: CUDA
[1:03:11] gingerrsss: YEP FLOP
[1:03:14] Docgalaad: Actually, an ELO system for a game could use these. Not a game directly. Just an example.
[1:03:24] MrPooter: @DaneBoiMike actually? or meme?
[1:03:26] 0sem0: Yes for parallelized computing yes.
[1:03:29] Nexhunter: ehhh
[1:03:30] premalonetv: @Ramnog Im so sure, this man is a generated AI telling us this is "safe" and is the future.. YEP
[1:03:36] TheTrueGaysian: @Giantwaffle This is perfect for ai protein folding. CU Boulder is gobbling these up for labs
[1:03:36] thethurst_: @Giantwaffle this is like what I currently use at my job for heavy data processing (Data Scientist)
[1:03:39] tinspin: Anyone here has a Jetson Nano?
[1:03:51] Yemtron: what do you think the implications of AI advancement to the gaming industry will be?
[1:03:57] BroCreed1: Good for crypto you think?
[1:03:59] marshallx: The point here is GPUs are beginning to be used for more than graphics rendering too. Note "Compute" & Graphics, not just graphics. It's huge for compute.
[1:04:00] Slasher0915: you dont train dlss anymore
[1:04:04] marshallx: Datalake stuff.
[1:04:05] jimmy_gibbs_jr: man hasnt blinked fully once. impostor
[1:04:06] gingerrsss: Im gonna buy an HGX100 for my home server
[1:04:06] tinspin: dlss and raytracing does not affect gameplay..
[1:04:09] Siyrax: MONKERS
[1:04:10] tinspin: meaningless
[1:04:12] MikeTheTechLead: @MrPooter actually. DLSS is Machine Learned upscaling. so NVIDIA must likely use those servers to generate DLSS models
[1:04:17] premalonetv: MONKERS
[1:04:17] Denethor: MONKERS
[1:04:20] ZephMW: His eyes look like he's seen some shit

[1:04:34] Durunirid: Why doesn’t he blink, is he smokin something lol
[1:04:36] Allmostdone: Why would you have an AI folding proteins. You should fold your own clothes
[1:04:40] Nexhunter: @masternaranja yea like F1 does air flow simulations up the ass when designing cars and they use servers like these things to accelerate the time a run takes, and or like weather prediction modeling
[1:04:41] MrPooter: @DaneBoiMike That's actually so dope, holy
[1:04:44] Tabakhase: are those spf+ ports? LULW

[1:10:42] DaGMC: @Nexhunter yeah unfortunately
[1:10:43] Ruan_A: Ruan_A subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 16 months! Oh, Hey
[1:10:44] premalonetv: YEP
[1:10:44] Thurlas: yeah
[1:10:46] Docgalaad: AZ not working efficiently enough
[1:10:47] Nexhunter: it is the delivery mechanism they use @Giantwaffle
[1:10:49] guerilla3: YEP
[1:10:50] davethulhu: it was like 6 cases total
[1:10:51] gingerrsss: Yes, but actually no
[1:10:52] lange__: They found a link
[1:10:52] Hobolito90: pfizer moderna shadow arts
[1:10:52] Crizzle777: it was 2 in 4 million in women over 40 so yea
[1:10:54] Xindii: 1 in millions yep
[1:10:56] Aayush1512: yeh
[1:10:57] KnickKen: every C-drug has those cases, but media only hit on AZ
[1:10:59] Nexhunter: @Giantwaffle the delivery mechanism has increased blood clot risk rates
[1:11:03] MrPooter: same and Canada

[1:11:21] tinspin: ok, enough bullshit... Nintendo drives this bus...
[1:11:21] DaGMC: the EU claims refunding for Astra, because the jabs where contaminated
[1:11:24] TheTrueGaysian: @Giantwaffle There was a link, so unlike the palsy seen in the UK, the clotting did have a true correlation, but the risk is absolutely insignificant
[1:11:27] 0omkins: MEDIA overblowing an issue so they can sell copies/clicks...NO WAY
[1:11:34] premalonetv: So when are they gonna show how the Gooey and more AI is gonna make me a functional human being?
[1:11:37] Nexhunter: it isn't blown out of proportions cause the virus cells they use folks have natural immunities and that immunity causes blood clotting in cases @Giantwaffle
[1:11:40] Ultranot20000: I had a family friend that got blood clots in her brain and she was like the 15th person for it to happen to
[1:11:59] Nexhunter: it also a delivery mechanism not used in common vaccines so was first general pop vaccine usage of that mechanism
[1:12:08] Tasar_: Believe your doctor
[1:12:10] Docgalaad: not really journalism either
[1:12:11] MrPooter: yep, pretty much
[1:12:13] KnickKen: as usual the media just throws wood into the fire for ppl to rage about
[1:12:14] Tabakhase: well they paused to figure out is it IS "insignificant" - or not...
[1:12:15] DaGMC: the first case with bird flu in china today
[1:12:19] Yemtron: delicious wafers :)

[1:27:57] ChilledNightmare: nah its not a param issue
[1:28:00] Diploidal: wait for jetbrains to update the support
[1:28:03] Nexhunter: it just intellisense has no fucking idea what you're doing
[1:28:07] Crizzle777: your ide is not setup properly
[1:28:13] omar_i_: wait for the IDE to update
[1:28:17] TasteMaShu: Material Design UI plugin is now paid in Jetbranis Sadge
[1:28:17] Slasher0915: just use vscode
[1:28:19] even__odds: I think the problem is that you might never reach your return statement inside your case
[1:28:20] Stoods_: The interpreter could just nit be updated yet
[1:28:29] Chronoes: you should do match (value, roll) and pattern match it on the tuple, not a single value
[1:28:33] Crizzle777: yea man use vs code
[1:28:33] aur1so: maybe there should be a default case?
[1:28:39] ChilledNightmare: is match == switch ?

[1:28:47] omar_i_: PogChamp
[1:28:49] Tabakhase: if its supported yet
[1:28:50] Nexhunter: there is the issue tracker for pycharm
[1:28:50] produkteriswf: nope
[1:28:52] natsu130: tabs is not
[1:28:55] Akiron_rafa: why use two ides FailFish
[1:28:56] Stoods_: If its correct, then it should still run even if the ide says its wrong
[1:29:01] D_Roxxxx: Oh boy! Waffle going down the developer hole Kappa
[1:29:03] Crizzle777: it shouldn't matter if it's in beta, if your ide doesn't support beta than your ide is terrible
[1:29:14] TasteMaShu: vscode so much better
[1:29:20] pengeg: try it out in a command prompt
[1:29:26] Crizzle777: yea man everyone uses vscode
[1:29:27] Nexhunter: nothing supports these peps fully yet
[1:29:29] piincakes: how did you change the window frame color?
[1:29:29] Stoods_: You should use vscode 100%
[1:29:29] HPA97: True programmers use Notepad Kappa

[1:30:35] WebDeveloperGuy: pycharm has great jira integration
[1:30:36] Stoods_: Vi > vim
[1:30:36] MrPooter: @Giantwaffle Do you code as a hobby?
[1:30:39] RamseyRinehaus: you better know VIM if you want be a dev, even if you rarely use it
[1:30:39] Chronoes: you should do match (value, roll) and pattern match it on the tuple, not a single value
[1:30:44] Apparentthreat: you realize VIM is a necessity where remote editing isn't allowed?
[1:30:47] Nexhunter: @Giantwaffle https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/PY-47446 this is the issue tracker for support in pycharm of pattern matching
[1:30:52] Stoods_: Gir is soooooo useful
[1:30:52] silv: i launched vim back in 2016 and i still haven't been able to close it PepeHands

[1:30:55] Opsidill: There is no linter for the new python yet maybe
[1:30:56] Hazno: might be a plugin that supports match?
[1:31:04] HackCD: @Giantwaffle just joined, what are you doing?
[1:31:05] Apparentthreat: bully
[1:31:12] Nexhunter: there isn't
[1:31:13] SpartRyan: when the Waffle is sus

[1:31:22] Red_Mercury8: Switch Pro news?
[1:31:28] Nexhunter: toonyREE I posted the issue linker
[1:31:34] LinearLayer: @Giantwaffle I will say though that the ability for VS Code to use ssh to be an IDE for remote systems/files is super nice
[1:31:35] Bj4rk3: <3
[1:31:40] ko_kachoff: Soon tm
[1:31:42] Hazno: check if there's a plugin for it @Giantwaffle
[1:31:43] silv: who does news on a thursday DansGame
[1:31:47] Mike190Twitch: Cant wait for Switch Pro Paper Launch
[1:31:54] Stoods_: Yeah just wait for the new linter
[1:32:00] infinityfog1: Imagine not watching Rolland Garros lul
[1:32:03] tino_55: @Giantwaffle what is that desktop background and where do i get a copy?
[1:32:04] DaGMC: thursday is wipe in EFT Kappa
[1:32:06] TasteMaShu: @LinearLayer Yes, specially when on Jetbrains, in order to use SSH you need the paid version
[1:32:08] Mike190Twitch: Switch Lite was non-dockable
[1:32:13] silv: new super nintendo switch pro DS
[1:32:20] Mike190Twitch: FeelsBadMan I got day 1 switch
[1:32:28] Nexhunter: yea different node process for the newer Tegras
[1:32:29] natsu130: but the old switch can be hacked Kreygasm
[1:32:29] LordDusk: That's not true.
[1:32:32] omar_i_: chat any recommended movies?
[1:32:35] Mujona: My Switch I bought 6 months ago loads twice as fast as my roomates launch version.
[1:32:35] Stoods_: I think jet brains stuff is kinda overrated, vscode is just easier
[1:32:40] ko_kachoff: switch Dlss edition
[1:32:42] LordDusk: They swapped the Tegra with a safer one. To stop modding.
[1:32:42] Tabakhase: @LinearLayer sshfs
[1:32:44] LinearLayer: @TasteMaShu Oh dang I didnt know that, thats mega lame
[1:32:51] MaverickSpore: waffle look down at the taskbar for the seconds... when it hits 7 it has to load KEKW
[1:33:10] TasteMaShu: @LinearLayer thats why at work we use vscode for the SSH

[1:33:27] SpartRyan: but you can't easily homebrew the new consoles
[1:33:37] HackCD: amd keynote yesterday was crazy
[1:33:40] Nexhunter: Tesla is getting AMD APUs, and they are using TSMC 3d stacking to stack more SRAM
[1:33:41] moustwanted: do it PogChamp
[1:33:42] TheRunner4: are you excited for GTA 5 EXPANDED AND ENHANCED ? @Giantwaffle
[1:33:45] GTLugo: amd keynote was pretty good

[1:33:50] silv: fidelyti FX to work on 1000 series nvidia cards
[1:33:53] Ricz1337: 4min video
[1:33:54] K4shira: they announced FSR
[1:33:55] LordeVastos: fidelity super resolution is cool
[1:34:04] Nexhunter: that just FidelityFX though
[1:34:05] Kuroiorb: hey bud, chill with caps @TheRunner4 :)
[1:34:06] Nexhunter: not the whole thing
[1:34:09] Valentin_PV: when do you think the new bf will take place?
[1:34:10] K4shira: and some chip stacking or something i don't really understand but is apparently very cool
[1:34:11] Ricz1337: no fidelity fx
[1:34:12] Nexhunter: yes
[1:34:14] Hazno: yes
[1:34:17] Ricz1337: yeah they will kill it
[1:34:17] Nexhunter: it like DLSS 1.0
[1:34:43] Flobu_: its nothing like DLSS from a technichal perspective
[1:34:50] Deepcast: that TAN
[1:34:55] Kuroiorb: the saturation boost on the video D:
[1:35:01] mechoriet: the tan line tho KEKW
[1:35:04] Nexhunter: @Flobu_ from a consumer endpoint it is the same but yes pipeline wise it is way diff
[1:35:05] exo_pho3nix: FidelityFX on gtx 1060 for yall
[1:35:06] PanKalmarek: ALLL

[1:36:38] Kuroiorb: oh KEKW misunderstood their command @Nexhunter
[1:36:40] WebDeveloperGuy: is this where they announced the gpus for the tesla x/s?
[1:36:44] SeeAGamer: Some days I miss working at AMD. Was so fun.
[1:36:49] Vizion_TV: Vizion_TV subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 39 months! 
[1:36:51] MervyTube: is that for all games or it has to be coded individually?
[1:36:56] Bulva: Clap

[1:37:02] Nexhunter: @SeeAGamer my neighbor used to work for Radeon in the day and fucking started hating life when AMD bought them

[1:37:27] Driitzz: AMD numba 1
[1:37:28] LinearLayer: 1060 :) indeed
[1:37:32] MrSmokey013: KEKW
[1:37:36] Nexhunter: some people KEKW
[1:37:36] EvergreenMoth8: amd
[1:37:37] Hyduss_: NOthing changed, they just added a line Kappa
[1:37:38] EvergreenMoth8: thats who
[1:37:39] LinearLayer: console gamers
[1:37:41] Nexhunter: also that quality mode
[1:37:48] FairePlaie: but can it run twitch hot tub ?
[1:37:52] Nexhunter: so like what only a quarter bump down
[1:37:53] SnoLys: it also makes it blurrier
[1:37:57] HackCD: still a good increase in performance
[1:37:58] stefbuwalda: Does that mean they won't limit it to AMD GPU's? 🤔
[1:38:08] SeeAGamer: @Nexhunter I was well after that. Around the time ARM was the AMD thing. I was also in a very small org within AMD - team was awesome.
[1:38:08] Nexhunter: @stefbuwalda yea it a different pipeline modification
[1:38:17] Opsidill: This is big
[1:38:19] HackCD: @stefbuwalda yea it suppots 1000,2000,3000 series nvidia cards
[1:38:25] Bulva: Clap
[1:38:26] Handzso69: @stefbuwalda most likely
[1:38:27] Ricz1337: yeah but , more developers will use it when there iss more ppl they use it
[1:38:30] Allmostdone: Another words no GPU’s for you
[1:38:30] Driitzz: stefbuwalda are you not paying attention ? he she showed it on a gtx 1060 so yes
[1:38:30] Moobot: You can find Waffle's Youtube channel here - https://youtube.com/giantwaffle
[1:38:31] Nexhunter: @SeeAGamer yea the radeon folks got treated like hot garbage and eventually he just left the group
[1:38:33] Kuroiorb: !command
[1:38:33] Moobot: A list of commands for Waffle's channel: !3dprinter - !bttv - !digdeep - !followage - !latency - !modpack - !schedule - !sign - !specs - !uptime - !vinyl - !wallpaper
[1:38:47] BennyF_Jr: !3dprinter
[1:38:47] Moobot: Waffle bought himself a "Prusa i3 MK3S" 3D-Printer. You can find it here: https://shop.prusa3d.com/en/3d-printers/180-original-prusa-i3-mk3s-kit.html#
[1:38:58] EvergreenMoth8: !specs
[1:38:59] Moobot: Waffle's PC and Streaming setup link: https://goo.gl/zzxwef
[1:38:59] Nexhunter: it is software
[1:39:01] stefbuwalda: @Driitzz Yeah but how would they make money on this? Wouldn't sway people towards one or the other
[1:39:12] fafuja: software yeah
[1:39:13] Flobu_: its just a shader and a header
[1:39:16] stefbuwalda: That's hype though
[1:39:18] K4shira: so? more complex isn't more better
[1:39:21] DaGMC: FidelyFX isnt that just dynamic resolution scaling based on workload
[1:39:25] ActForImpact: so the sfx is like rtx or smth?
[1:39:27] SeeAGamer: @Nexhunter North offices I assume? Don't want to give specific locations ;)
[1:39:29] Ricz1337: ue5 iss the future lol
[1:39:32] Zodber: graphics does not matter anymore
[1:39:33] Nexhunter: but other AMD announcements is Tesla cars will be using APUs, and they will be using TSMC 3D stacking to shove more SRAM onto their high end CPUs @Giantwaffle
[1:39:33] EvergreenMoth8: i mean the brain is a few nanoseconds behind so yes it literally is the future
[1:39:33] TheRunner4: allowing competitors is nice actually
[1:39:35] Nexhunter: @SeeAGamer yea
[1:39:39] fafuja: I mean people are using dlss
[1:39:39] Driitzz: dlss = super computer running algorythm and then caching the result for the end user to use that cache created by the super computer , thats why a limited game supported
[1:39:40] fafuja: so
[1:39:40] shankupotamus: It's a product of Moore's law slowing down
[1:39:46] fafuja: maybe yeah Its is
[1:39:46] Mujona: Man, Stardew Valley gonna look so good
[1:39:53] SeeAGamer: @Nexhunter Waves from similar location to you then.
[1:39:54] TheRunner4: cloud maybe ?
[1:39:55] Zodber: like in the movies
[1:39:59] whittlz: maybe as VR gets better
[1:40:00] Ricz1337: some stuff like nanite in ue5 iss the future i think
[1:40:00] MANOo_o: probably until hardware catches up with resolutions
[1:40:02] stefbuwalda: From a business POV, how would this generate revenue?
[1:40:05] JeanBaldeux: i'm not intelligent enough to know if its the future
[1:40:06] LinearLayer: I mean there running up against the smallest size transistors possible and a silicon shortage, so increasing performance in other ways is a smart move
[1:40:09] EvergreenMoth8: @Giantwaffle cant wait to watch someone buy this then just play old school runescape
[1:40:11] EvergreenMoth8: xD
[1:40:12] 40meterp: i think trying to reduce unnecessary computation is always a good solution
[1:40:14] fafuja: if u had the option to use it, u wouldnt? I would
[1:40:14] MasterKraft: I hope scalable bitmaps are the future, no more need for multiple resolutions would be nice
[1:40:16] fafuja: 100%
[1:40:25] HackCD: they are trying to out compete nvidia DLSS by having it support so much hardware while also being easily to implement right?
[1:40:27] Nexhunter: it is the same as on the CPU side with AMD 3D vcache stuff they announced
[1:40:29] CallofDuty_Monster: waffle imagine fsr but with streaming that way we can watch in 1440p with 720p bandwidth. maybe one day
[1:40:35] ShinyBadger: i think the tech it provides is instrimenal to a bigger tech of remot play with less latincy , so we can have upscale on user end with virtual pc's
[1:40:37] Kobyplays97: Yeah I think cloud gaming will be the future.. no more pcs, just streaming for everything with monthly subscriptions
[1:40:38] Nexhunter: you have to cheat ways into getting more performance
[1:40:38] TheRunner4: more of a software oriented than hardware
[1:40:47] ShinyBadger: dont think its close but its a step
[1:40:47] count3rnova: even now people are buying expensive as fk hardwear to run games you could on 5 year old hardwear on ultra
[1:40:49] Hengo: You need to remember that the majory of gamers have low end PCs
[1:40:57] Nexhunter: ehhh
[1:41:06] Ricz1337: its just cool for older hardware so u can use it 2-3 years longer
[1:41:20] Nexhunter: yes for more performance
[1:41:22] LinearLayer: Im so curious about the size of DL model used for DLSS
[1:41:29] fafuja: I mean this is only the beginning... improvements will come along the way
[1:41:33] Captain_Rax: the VAST majority of gamers have low end specs, it makes 100% sense they focus on this
[1:41:33] Driitzz: DLSS is bullshit trashy tech making it only for one product and only a selected games , hard to implement
[1:41:35] Docgalaad: i'll stick to native resolutions
[1:41:38] Driitzz: this is much better
[1:41:43] SnoLys: the image they shared makes it look kinda bad tho
[1:41:48] Kobyplays97: I ll try it with my gtx 1060 when it comes out
[1:41:52] sogerr: waffle sitting on a 3090 and thinking why would people want better perfomance KEKW
[1:41:54] HackCD: I think so, I used DLSS when I was playing cyberpunk and it was nice. I wish it was on more games.
[1:42:07] stefbuwalda: That's what I'm wondering PogChamp
[1:42:13] Nexhunter: well Nvidia takes those costs
[1:42:18] TheRunner4: will hardware improvements ever get overwhelming ?
[1:42:26] Azazu02: laptop sales?
[1:42:33] Nexhunter: AMD solution is the we did an open source version of the DLSS so pls love us
[1:42:35] LinearLayer: AMD just curb stomping Intel even harder?
[1:42:40] Nexhunter: @LinearLayer nope
[1:42:43] Ricz1337: yeah but, fidelity will work on consoles so more developers will use it so more games will support fidelity
[1:42:44] Driitzz: fidelity fx is not about making money LUL
[1:42:44] Docgalaad: @TheRunner4 i felt that 15 years ago
[1:42:47] DaGMC: they could sell you GPUs without the horse power just utilizing DLSS under the hood
[1:42:50] Hengo: Nvidia does not make money, they pay the def that dlss is implemented
[1:42:50] Wige66: DLSS adds way too much motion blur for my taste
[1:42:57] Driitzz: no
[1:42:58] Duckaerobics: Yeah FSR is supposedly open source so I don't think they are selling it.
[1:43:05] ElGreko17: xbox was bleeding for sure, it was close for it to go away
[1:43:18] Nexhunter: so AMD support of GPUOpen is on linux side of things
[1:43:21] Duckaerobics: Maybe it's a goodwill/publicity thing?
[1:43:24] Driitzz: it's to grow the support of that technology , to improve performance globally , if it was about making money , they wouldnt support the competition
[1:43:25] HackCD: @Giantwaffle You should check out 3D Cache Stacking technology that they introduced
[1:43:25] Xiocata: sometimes you just want good rep
[1:43:27] CD579: probably to make the consoles have better fidelity
[1:43:37] COLDFiR3: DLSS now can be implemented by a plugin on Unreal, no special training necessary for DLSS 2.0 (the current version)
[1:43:43] fafuja: coz of this now I could buy a cheaper video card instead of saving money to buy a 3070 or something simillar?
[1:43:49] Docgalaad: motion blur is the first feature you disable, and you get excited about blurry upscaling ? Kappa
[1:43:50] calel13: Brand loyalty? Maybe
[1:43:52] ChilledNightmare: yeah it seems like its geared more towards people that have older gpu's no?
[1:43:53] shankupotamus: who is living in that bubble?
[1:43:57] aundros: But dropped rep for a company could mean stocks go down, no?
[1:43:58] LinearLayer: Improved performance on AMD consoles?
[1:44:00] Nexhunter: @Giantwaffle it is a good will through GPU Open to ensure they have their place within the linux ecosystems
[1:44:00] Dethan: I'm a share holder, and I want it :)
[1:44:03] aur1so: Sadge
[1:44:05] beachedwhale92: every company is profit first. end of story
[1:44:05] ElGreko17: does the xbox adaptive controller make money? i doubt, that's totally for the good will
[1:44:08] mostlylaughing: Man, if managers want it - it will happen. Shareholders may even not know
[1:44:10] TheRunner4: selling software could help
[1:44:10] Hengo: @Giantwaffle how the game dev market works, is that the game developer get payed to use the effects (like RT, or GI, ez) from Nvidia / AMD. Thats how sponsored titles work
[1:44:23] xfrozev2: is there gonna be mc today chat ?
[1:44:42] Nexhunter: it is feature parity matching in the simplest ideas
[1:44:50] M1k3D3l7a: xfrozev2 yes, after this
[1:44:51] DaGMC: you need a gpu to drive those technologies
[1:44:55] sogerr: fidelityFX is a huge deal, not everyone has a DLSS enabled card
[1:44:57] xfrozev2: nice
[1:45:00] Mujona: You can put a monetary value on good will.
[1:45:02] Duckaerobics: They could be trying to undercut DLSS and push it out of the market. That would help them by hurting NVIDIA.
[1:45:04] Kobyplays97: It’s just crazy that everything is still sold out..
[1:45:07] fafuja: @sogerr exactly.
[1:45:07] Yemtron: there is no doubt some plan behind this to bring in revenue in the end
[1:45:12] Wige66: It's bad for AMD if Nvidia's propietary tech becomes standard
[1:45:12] Kobyplays97: Or 3x the price
[1:45:16] Dethan: AMD is matching their competitors service offering. makes total sense
[1:45:17] TheRunner4: gimmick is the word
[1:45:19] omar_i_: pepeSmoke
[1:45:25] Zeroren: @Giantwaffle The fsr software makes it easier to design which mean more companies buying their tech and since it has good gains I'm sure then was made more in line with consoles so it might be more likely that Next-Gen consoles might once again be AMD since then software is more console friendly and PC programmers get easier workloads to design games.
[1:45:29] SeeAGamer: He opened with Laptop GFX, I suspect if people want it, they will buy laptops with that option, and since it's probably GPU/CPU bundled overall more sales.
[1:45:35] Driitzz: Nvidia DLSS is dead cause its too limited and not easy to implement , its not even open source , Fidelity fx supports a wide game easy to implement and its open source , hello ?
[1:45:36] Dethan: very similar
[1:45:37] Nexhunter: it is OSS
[1:45:45] Nexhunter: because they want to entrench their gains in the linux market
[1:45:47] Chronoes: I mean, why did Nvidia support FreeSync? They have their expensive-ass Gsync
[1:45:51] Nexhunter: but it is simply feature parity
[1:45:53] Asphoron: They probably aren't considering money invested here as sales, but more as speculative market research
[1:45:57] dexdiman: Maybe fsr works way better on AMD stuff (boosting their hype/sales) and letting it work on nvidia is just to boost stock.
[1:46:00] HackCD: I think FFX is a big deal because DLSS only supports Nvidia GPUs, while FFX supports old and new gens GPUs and iCpus as well
[1:46:05] Opsidill: Now NVidia has spent a bunch on DLSS with little to no benifits. A wasted investment
[1:46:08] Nexhunter: @dexdiman nope
[1:46:08] COLDFiR3: And the current gen console are running all AMD
[1:46:23] Nexhunter: DLSS 2.1 is fucking brilliant
[1:46:23] xaytana: does FSR or DLSS have any benefits within the effects and film industry? that's probably where the profit is
[1:46:38] Nexhunter: same with FSR once the tech ages it will be brilliant also
[1:46:38] Moobot: You can sub to Waffle by clicking this neat link -> twitch.tv/giantwaffle/subscribe
[1:46:40] Opsidill: But Fidelity is a direct competitor to DLSS right?
[1:46:45] Nexhunter: @Opsidill no
[1:46:46] philipkatis: They had been working on RTX for years.
[1:47:00] Chronoes: @peaches_xan not really, effects and film industry do pre-rendering, not real-time rendering
[1:47:04] Nexhunter: FidelityFX is a feature set, FSR is the competitor to DLSS
[1:47:06] M1k3D3l7a: BFV I think
[1:47:11] sh00t21: minecrcaft was the first
[1:47:11] HolySheepSheet: Late stage capitalism. amiloDumb
[1:47:11] cosmicblip: dlss doesn't need to be trained anymore so it's much easier to implement
[1:47:14] MrPooter: way worse..
[1:47:17] Opsidill: I see @Nexhunter thx
[1:47:24] Nexhunter: but for AMD they have the linux ecosystem they are trying to maintain their edge in
[1:47:36] JeanBaldeux: hmmh *waffle voice
[1:47:36] j__e__r: It could have also resulted from research on how to get there cards to do 8k at decent frame rates and they found  out it also helped older cards gain a bit of  perf.
[1:47:42] Driitzz: why do you think Nvidia banned some youtuber that didnt say good things about DLSS ? cause they know their product is not good and the competition have something more tangible, it's to cover their asses and they F'd up
[1:47:54] Zeroren: @Giantwaffle Fsr I think is a good business decision in the long run since DLSS is only on Nvidia but FSR is on both AMD and Nvidia
[1:48:02] MrPooter: Bro, resellers ruining everything. Shoes, gpus....
[1:48:03] Nexhunter: we already are there
[1:48:22] TheRunner4: do you know whats the main reason of the shortage ?@
[1:48:37] DaGMC: we need more competition in the GPU space and maybe a open source GPU
[1:48:37] Nexhunter: AMD CPU announcements is using TSMC 3D stacking to add more SRAM
[1:48:39] dav3yb: dav3yb subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 97 months, currently on a 97 month streak! Just move everything to ARM Kappa
[1:48:42] fluffycow003: jovian2
[1:48:44] Captain_Rax: whats the difference for us if the improvement is hardware or software? if the net gain is more fps, who cares
[1:48:53] HackCD: What about the multi-chip modules that will be implemented in 7000 series amd gpus?
[1:48:59] Nexhunter: @DaGMC that what AMD is vying for by supporting GPU Open
[1:49:05] potetopotato: Stadia Kappa
[1:49:16] Crossed_legion: nvidia only releases every 2 years
[1:49:17] Kuroiorb: i made you one! @Giantwaffle
[1:49:18] COLDFiR3: Honestly, a better driver can be a big seller for GPU, a great gpu with shitty driver is worth nothing
[1:49:19] MrArrig: I play games for gameplay not eye candy. I don't really mind
[1:49:24] dabeda1: Stadia KEKW
[1:49:26] Nexhunter: Stadia is another dead google project sadKEK
[1:49:35] Docgalaad: The shortage is mainly caused by massively new EV lines in Asia from 2020.
[1:49:45] Nexhunter: dude it gets better
[1:49:46] DaGMC: @Nexhunter I've to look into it. I'm interested in such a things.
[1:49:52] Nexhunter: https://fortune.com/2021/05/31/amd-tesla-contract-chips-infotainment-system-lisa-su/ @Giantwaffle welcome more shortages for AMD
[1:49:56] rarelybegaming: everyone wants monthly payments and i hate it
[1:49:58] TheRunner4: as long as connection is stable
[1:49:59] n8level: wait, is that where all the new cards went, into the cloud?
[1:50:11] Nexhunter: yes but not for consumers
[1:50:12] Captain_Rax: you sound like a doomer but for gpu's lol
[1:50:12] DaGMC: bad for us
[1:50:16] Nexhunter: cause Tesla will have priority for chips
[1:50:23] Driitzz: TheRunner4 it's a sum of different thing , covid = less employee reduced manufacturing, more people are home , turning towards gaming , bigger demand + less supply , increase in crypto mining = higher demand less supply , console launch again higher demand less supply
[1:50:32] DaGMC: enterprise and crypto > us
[1:50:40] Crack9860: sup waffle
[1:50:40] HyperKitty_: NotLikeThis muh silicon
[1:50:45] BrokenBlade15: I mean card availability might be low for a year or three but that doesn’t mean they won’t be improving the cards or even working towards the next generation, r&d will go on even in production for consumers is low
[1:50:52] Nexhunter: there is no point tbh to have a regular AMD APU in a car KEKW
[1:50:52] CocoScruff: that makes sense since monthly charges are more cost effective for companies... it's sad reallly. I think every home should have a super powerful server and just stream to PC screens around house instead of streaming from companies
[1:50:56] TheRunner4: @Driitzz so nice of you replying dude thank you
[1:51:00] DaGMC: the sahara will run out of sand
[1:51:06] Nexhunter: like at least for Nvidia their integrated chips for cars focus on AI inferences
[1:51:07] MrPooter: I wish we could mine astroids already FeelsBadMan
[1:51:08] n8level: same approach to dating fwiw
[1:51:21] Hazno: what would you recommend for using same mouse/keyboard for multiple computers @Giantwaffle ?

[1:51:57] daemonaedryn: Waffle has been corrupted pepeHands
[1:52:00] Hazno: alright, thanks!
[1:52:01] Nexhunter: @Giantwaffle at least GPU architectural changes can drive large gains for CPUs the biggest driver in gains now is node changes or bolting more SRAM for larger l3 caches KEKW
[1:52:15] Driitzz: waffle are you getting a 3080 Ti ? PogChamp
[1:52:28] Nexhunter: Lakefield yooooo

[1:52:54] Switcharoo: Mobile gaming is going VR direction i feel
[1:53:05] brsmith2358: Do an external GPU
[1:53:08] Nexhunter: and also Alder Lake will be the same shared architecture for Desktop and Mobile
[1:53:09] DaGMC: card board vr?
[1:53:12] brsmith2358: with PCIE 4.0

[1:53:33] Goodboy34: Chat is there alittle bit of hissing coming from stream?
[1:53:35] b0ltz12: I bought a gaming laptop for the reason of attending university away from home, and then being able to bring my main gaming machine home during school breaks
[1:53:45] Nexhunter: so he would need a tiger lake u based laptop for that if wanting a modern cpu core laptop @brsmith2358
[1:53:46] brsmith2358: @Nexhunter I meant instead of a heavy gaming laptop.
[1:53:50] Hazno: have you ever dabbled into DJing with a DJ controller, such as the DDJ-400/800/1000?
[1:54:00] Docgalaad: correct me if i'm wrong, but all laptops i got in the past ended up getting slower overtime. While my desktop PCs never did that.
[1:54:01] CommanderUrsus: the crackle of the fire in the background

[1:55:14] liophire: Clap
[1:55:15] brsmith2358: @Nexhunter Yea. I have a Lenovo with PCIE 4.0 and an external 3080. Works GREAT for work and its performance with the eGPU is fantastic.

[1:55:26] JustPepeDontBeMad: @Giantwaffle do you hear your own voice? i find it super awkward and sometimes stop talking because i feel like im talking over myself
[1:55:29] Slasher0915: final year?

[1:56:02] DaGMC: @Nexhunter thats bad

[1:56:22] Nexhunter: @DaGMC yea it sucks they didn't aim for eGPU support on their thunderbolt controller implementation
[1:56:29] liophire: I use in-ear headphones for the same reason

[2:01:42] Ghost0447: tbh its like the most packs are way to slow at the start, mid game is most of the time fine and the endgame is always slow
[2:01:42] M1k3D3l7a: I dont want to sound rude. But I am mainly here for the talking part (makes me feel less lonely and your topics are interesting=

[2:25:00] McFatbutt: YEP Josh
[2:25:05] Ycrems: why sell? get a home equity line buy a cheaper place and rent that one.
[2:25:06] RyanIsSalty: why do prices of houses increase so much every year
[2:25:30] NewFutureTech: cashing out before the bubble is smart
[2:25:31] mrbuk: Hold
[2:25:32] Pewpewpal: @Ycrems if you expect it to crash you'd want to sell

[2:25:44] exo_pho3nix: you will still have a good damn house tho
[2:25:46] Gelil: Due to the cost of building atm
[2:25:56] orillion: pepeLaugh price still goes up for 20 years
[2:25:56] Pewpewpal: @Giantwaffle dude other than just recently when has that ever happened? LUL
[2:25:57] CommanderUrsus: it seems like they're lots of real estate investment trusts buying up everything to rent
[2:26:02] Crizzle777: it can't keep going up like this though
[2:26:06] Kuroiorb: lease it to me
[2:26:06] Crizzle777: it's unsustainable
[2:26:09] Nifusion: Yeah, but the gains in the last year alone dwarf the previous 4 years before that
[2:26:16] M1k3D3l7a: I really dont want a second 2008... especially since I'll probably get into the housing market as well this year
[2:26:17] MDSZilla: You sell it yes you flipped it at the profit, however renting it keeps a source of income coming in.
[2:26:21] Samelie: have you made a driller yet @Giantwaffle it was on your to do list like 3 days ago, and seems better suited for the whole digging you are doing
[2:26:27] Invalidm_: lease it to the mods Kappa

[2:26:50] Tabakhase: 08
[2:26:50] thulle: ofc it's possible
[2:26:51] Crizzle777: yea but if you own the house for 20 years it doesn't matter
[2:26:51] M1k3D3l7a: Invalidm_ that is going to be one crowded place monkaS
[2:26:52] Yemtron: i think the housing market is due for a crash, the gains this year are not sustainable
[2:26:52] MDSZilla: You use the rent to pay it off?
[2:26:54] TheRunner4: but we'll never know the future man what if it crashes or something
[2:26:54] PureSpider: of course it's possible lol
[2:27:00] TheRunner4: yeah thats right
[2:27:02] DiRtYsGaming: yes thats what caused the 2007 crisis

[2:27:21] Gelil: Rental house can be claimed at a loss over the life of the mortagae, as long as it is rented more than 6 months out of the year
[2:27:24] Pewpewpal: Keep in mind the rent would have to cover the cost of your 2nd home loan mortgage to make money
[2:27:27] M1k3D3l7a: Pewpewpal I mean, if I can build a cheaper house, nice, but not when building expensive and once I am done it crashes
[2:27:28] dasmako: then you gotta find a new house which costs just as much KEKW
[2:27:29] Invalidm_: all active mods @M1k3D3l7a YEP

[2:27:52] StOrMy1100: but if you are going to live there for like 10 years. The burst of the bubble doesn't really matter
[2:27:53] mgaSA: so, why wait for the market to crash? even with 15% cg tax, its not worth?
[2:27:53] Ycrems: housing market crash same like crypto. it goes down but then it'll go back up Kappa
[2:27:54] maimvice13: i want to buy a house but we need to put in 15% of the loan by ourself and that is not including the extra cost (if i want to buy a house for 185K i need to lay out of my pocket 66K)
