[0:26:10] SMO_SG: hii @gaymersalsa
[0:26:11] Muskogee76: Etho did "Hobocraft" last season. He started late and made a starter base in Bdubs basement. It was great content, without being two point of views of the same show

[0:27:18] pyrodivine_: wait...wts this??
[0:27:25] Sootydog47: The number of times I've gotten SO CLOSE to finishing a Scav but running out of time makes them better than succeeding every time or failing completely
[0:27:25] SuddenlyMia: i'm unable to play it because the modpack is to hard to run
[0:27:27] robor_1: People don't like to loose, but if you lose it makes winning feel better

[0:28:10] Kasszi_: scav crates are also insane and worth it
[0:28:11] gaymersalsa: FORCED hryLeddit
[0:28:12] saleo37: @gaymersalsa how do I get there? The link just brings me to a site where I can make my own. Do I have to enter a specific word?
[0:28:13] timmolaa: I find trickets come in groups. I find like 3 or 4 in as many vaults then I dont get anymore in like 20-30 vaults
[0:28:14] sh4dow_d3mon: I think Etho gets his trinkets from dungeons rite
[0:28:15] henryt__: I  only finish every third scav but I always try it because they are very thrilling and you are so happy when you clutch it Cheer500
[0:28:17] xsmilesx: I purposely scav sea every vault
[0:28:17] FatalHaste: Like not doing blacksmith when you have no ornate items LUL
[0:28:45] silver_kitsune9: You don't get the same adrenalin if you win enough every time. That filling will disappear and just be num to it
[0:28:46] renoir_1: a skilled player would not be ooting ornate when he doesnt have ornate items

[0:28:57] gaymersalsa: @saleo37 hmm it should bring a yellow note that says to generate your unique card? try a different browser maybe? Hmm
[0:28:58] JustusIsOnline: yeah i complete every scav i get... i have lost all joy in my life

[0:29:38] soufflesims: i had the same reaction to jewel cutting costing 1 gold as i did to the difficulty of scavs because i actually had to start focusing on looting coins every vault and i wasn't used to it, just like i had to adjust to actually trying to loot specific pois to complete a scav. i just needed to look at it from a different angle tbh. difficulty isn't a bad thing

[0:29:51] silvain_shadows: i love scavs bc i have to actually pay attention to how i play. the rng can be rough sometimes- not finding coin POIs has been a problem in the past- but every other objective i can run while basically playing on autopilot
[0:29:55] RariiCat: aaaah I wanna know about relics

[0:34:10] queenferret11: See…me and my husband have been playing this together and we compete to see who can get the most in vaults lol
[0:34:13] K00lKnigh7: @iskall85  I have struggled to set up me Scavenger bag.  Not sure why is hasn't saved what items I put in there and it turns into rotten .  I save before I leave the vault.
[0:34:16] SuddenlyMia: U got this
[0:34:22] muttpacket: lobster and I discussed how vh is so diverse that it has made a lot of other games quite boring because they are repetative.
[0:34:26] Ler3ysss: If ppl were competitive in real life as in games we would all be rich
[0:34:29] EVO_Gaming6000: I didn't expect u to be live now
[0:34:38] tangerinedoro: @joeri_van vh makes money from the patreon, the donations, and once upon a time from merch. the rest comes from iskall's pockets lol

[0:34:43] gaymersalsa: @K00lKnigh7 whats the problem? scav items turn rotten once you leave a scav vault
[0:34:52] goopulio321: dont forget to use you living hunter ability
[0:34:52] FreudPlays: What turned me off briefly from vh is the lack of bugs being fixed and issues - but now we have xverion the legend

[0:35:10] MGCypes: What do you think about improving/helping players sort their jewels better? Like displaying an affect:size ratio when holding shift, or having size/effect rolls more "tiered" instead of a full interval?
[0:35:13] basman333: iskHeart iskHeart iskHeart
[0:35:17] itsaspacestation: @k00lknigh7 should be fine. you can always add memory from JEI
[0:35:21] SuddenlyMia: imagen not playing scavs ... skill issue
[0:35:22] TheKyoon: lower your expectations, run your own race
[0:35:22] mahik750: We are playing with my husband and running scavs together is loads of fun.
[0:35:22] jack_o_nightwolf: I waiting for the VH vanilla version
[0:35:28] pootch_1: I think Scavs require you to FIlter and ignore things and thats Hard to learn
[0:35:28] soufflesims: losing at a scav as we speak so paggers
[0:35:30] Niko_993: i am a proud easy difficulty andy, i dont care what others think about it
[0:35:31] sh4dow_d3mon: Can objectives scale with difficulty settings? That Mite help
[0:35:36] LamePuf: i dont like the loot part of the scafs if it auto submited the objectives it will perfect for mr
[0:35:40] FreudPlays: Also early game is so much better now
[0:35:40] mawnusaurus: oh stop it
[0:35:40] percival97_: as impulse and skizz say, comparison is the thief of joy
[0:35:41] jane_co11: If you never lose, you don't learn to lose
[0:35:43] LamePuf: xverion
[0:35:43] codtronx: May i be special, i dont want to be dylan i want to be bob
[0:35:43] ThatHairyGuyOG: Seeing some hermits being 'normal players' is great for healthy comparisons :)
[0:35:45] bunta_1: I play on normal casual coz I'm bad but it's great fun
[0:35:46] Kasszi_: sometimes you're a little stubborn but then you listen KEKW
[0:35:50] armazone: competition is also basicly a fundamental element of our excistence
[0:35:50] silver_kitsune9: Make a baby version we're they are, op, but can't complete the final vault
[0:35:51] ihcmoonie: I used to hate scavs. Than I got faster and more mobile. And started being able to complete and carry them
[0:35:53] goopulio321: iskDoom iskDoom iskDoom iskDoom iskDoom
[0:35:55] mahik750: Yay, we feels important
[0:35:56] baka_raion_hato_31: xverion
[0:35:57] thatmfdes: guardians are harder than scav imo and I never see anyone complain over guardians
[0:35:59] Nicklii: reminds me of the old raiders vs casuals in early WoW
[0:36:00] BraveSoulCSB: i like scav even tho i haven't finished any xd
[0:36:01] itzliam_222: itzliam_222 subscribed at Tier 2. They've subscribed for 27 months, currently on a 15 month streak! im very excited for the new patch its got me hyped to play again  time for my 3 month obsession
[0:36:10] K00lKnigh7: @gaymersalsa  it doesn't save the items as None rotten. So when I run a new one they will not go into the scavenger bag at all. Just into the backpack.
[0:36:13] sakal_01: Hey Iskall where do you get the permision to be such an amazing content creator Thanks for the gtreat time and content  i Love what you have done with Vaulthunters
[0:36:21] Kelzky: In game dev you will never please everyone
[0:36:22] LazyJay5769: ohhhh, my first time catching Iskallman live and it’s right as I’m heading to bed. Good luck on the level grind!
[0:36:25] Kasszi_: You better play with us longer than 3 months Liam.....
[0:36:27] codtronx: ofc
[0:36:28] k1_setae: To be fair, SCAV is balanced for 80% pro completion and 20% completion for casual gamers. But taking in to account the task itself, there is no way to balance it otherwise.
[0:36:31] FreudPlays: I hate it
[0:36:32] sabrina1202r: YEAH
[0:36:33] mrkangabeaver: Yes
[0:36:34] StrangePanthers: Yeah
[0:36:34] Animorf_: Animorf_ subscribed at Tier 2. They've subscribed for 30 months! 
[0:36:34] codtronx: i love it
[0:36:35] LamePuf: yeap, dont read youtube comments
[0:36:36] gaymersalsa: @K00lKnigh7 have you set up your pickup notifier correctly so it picks up matched items, aka the backpack icon?
[0:36:36] ladylauz: Yup!
[0:36:37] saleo37: Comparing doesnt make sense because everyone has a unique set of skills. But we humans like to make it complicated for ourselves
[0:36:42] nathor092: yup!
[0:36:43] dawwsoon: yes
[0:36:44] LamePuf: i dont read*
[0:36:44] itzliam_222: @Kasszi_ yes i will dw
[0:36:47] cl4sh3r_69: is there a command for the patch updates?
[0:36:47] mrkangabeaver: I like it
[0:36:51] gaymersalsa: @LazyJay5769 glad you popped by!! gngn hryAdmire
[0:36:56] Ler3ysss: Yeah the latest asc conclusion destroyed them for me
[0:36:57] fluxrabbit: The conclusion was good. I like it
[0:36:59] gaymersalsa: HUH
[0:37:00] basman333: iskall what happens when the hermitcraft vault hunters ends
[0:37:07] the_void7: I think Scavs are a lot more fun with other people. I used to avoid them but now that I have my own server and play VH with my friends they’re so much more fun. that mad dash to the first room where we’re all exchanging scavenger hunt items is great
[0:37:15] queenferret11: queenferret11 subscribed at Tier 1. 
[0:37:17] gamingwithtoimen: that is what most people do they compare to the maker or content creators just becuase we want to compare eachother and if you do the same as what you are doing then ofcourse we are worse because you made the game iskall
[0:37:19] gaymersalsa: no game is gonna be perfect for a single person lol
[0:37:24] eternity609: I will probably  never play this game as i would get confused to much im a simple game person but I do enjoy watching others playing  it
[0:37:24] Ler3ysss: @the_void7 What server is it? Is it free to join?
[0:37:25] Jackefree: yea but i think it still sounded good especialy if you think about the fact that greed vaults has the possibility of having scaling difficulty/reward
[0:37:26] zdralek11: zdralek11 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 14 months, currently on a 14 month streak! hello sir
[0:37:29] K00lKnigh7: @gaymersalsa  I thought so. I will have to mess with it again.  I just got frustrated and stopped trying to mess with it.
[0:37:31] soufflesims: i mean im bummed that it doesn't scale in loot bc as someone who plays completely solo the plaques are more or less useless/not interesting to me. but hey im not mad about it🤷🏼‍♀️
[0:37:32] gaymersalsa: @the_void7 scav is THE coop objective for sure!

[0:37:59] gaymersalsa: @K00lKnigh7 understandable. hryAdmire there should be a guide on the vh discord to help you visually the next time you mess with it!

[0:38:58] tangerinedoro: the thing about vh for me is that i don't care about how much i fail personally.   it's just gratifying to play a game knowing the dev team cares about the player base and various playstyles instead of one meta for Just pro players
[0:38:59] FreudPlays: Have they forgotten about cake.
[0:39:00] Kelzky: Attention farmer - ignore em
[0:39:05] goopulio321: Lightly LoLLLLLL

[0:39:35] gaymersalsa: @gaymersalsa I DIDNT *MAKE* IT
[0:39:36] Wizard_Chach: When I saw cakes and ascension being the same thing, I had a feeling you'd change it
[0:39:42] Triphoon45: but we are forgetting about the most important change, the most exciting change, the Cake! woohoo

[0:41:03] LunaticGoneMad: in your videos i have seen clumsy appear as a negative modifier isnt flat out 50% from 1 stack of that modifier a little to much  like ye you should build more trap disarm but incase you get 2x clumsy which is highly possible in heavy modifier vaults its straight up -100% and only near end game players with 200% trap disarm on their tools can avoid it just a suggestion maybe it should be like 20 to 25% per stack so you atleast have to get 4 to 5 stacks of it to loss 100% trap disarm

[0:45:15] Monatae: Cheer500 I'm honestly relieved with your decision about soul flames.  I die... a lot in vaults, even on Easy, and it was kind of a feels bad looking at all that loot and knowing I didn't have the skill to get it. iskHeart
[0:45:18] Jaja123happy_face: I love the new soul flame stuff, I loved the soul flames b4 the newest newest version I think it would be an interesting play through where it’s like the sky vaults but maybe like a world type for just soul flame that increases as u play hahaha
[0:45:21] lynx6008: Pets poop gives the player extra loot and the when the poop gets bigger xp gets added in the loot

[0:45:48] alexnmt: yeah agree
[0:45:50] joeri_van: findable but maybe in more places
[0:45:50] TheOneFallen: Iskall you ttalked about Titles. will they only be prefixes or can there also be suffixes like [playername]man
[0:45:53] mahik750: I love the idea of hidden cakes in random vaults that drop a seal.
[0:45:54] umbral_sage: yeah, it'd be best for cakes to be only findable
[0:45:55] goldfish_paradise: Id agree with that
[0:45:57] honeybun5765: yes i think they should be findable like chaos
[0:45:58] dawwsoon: run a cake
[0:45:58] the_oscar_cat: yeah, they should be reasonably common, but not craftable
[0:46:01] PhoenicisEstuans: I think the arguement against that is that you get roughly the same chest count in cake vaults
[0:46:01] itzliam_222: makes it a reward to doing normal vaults is finding a bteer vault "cake"
[0:46:01] jessmay121_: I think they should be only findable like you say
[0:46:02] Andyghandi97: Yeah only findable
[0:46:03] RariiCat: I’m fine with that
[0:46:03] baboobraz: yeah its too strong to craft a cake seal now
[0:46:04] xpcju: they shouldn't be craftable
[0:46:06] FatalHaste: I think the best part of playing VH multi-player is seeing what everyone likes to do, build wise and vault wise, because it's always different. I think that speaks to how balanced the diversity of the game is.
[0:46:08] pootch_1: @TheOneFallen thats a good idea
[0:46:09] tangerinedoro: i love the idea of charm cosmetics matching omega sets lol
[0:46:10] Jackefree: i think that sounds realy good or if not that then make it a lot more expensive if its craftable
[0:46:11] Danymaddox: javelin transmog????
[0:46:13] DanMetroArnold: I would like the ability to craft them, since I have to go out and find the blank seals in the Vaults
[0:46:14] Blackm1996: Give one in quest book
[0:46:18] Vulcan2405: I think only findable would help make them balanced. they seem very stronk
[0:46:19] bunta_1: If you make it findable you should buff it more so it's crazy good
[0:46:21] goopulio321: whats left for the scav
[0:46:21] Niko_993: i get one from every other black market
[0:46:22] honeybun5765: cake vaults are too op to just craft
[0:46:22] SuddenlyMia: can u add that on your bday the first vault u run is a cake vault
[0:46:23] baboobraz: maybe around as common as chaos catalysts or a bit more common
[0:46:26] ihcmoonie: I like the craft able seals. Yes they are strong but once you get to the op looting the mods are scarry
[0:46:27] zerogiven: It is like every other major change, people will form strong opinions based solely on words and no play experience then quiet down once they play the update.
[0:46:28] joeri_van: just like void with echo maybe more chance of cake in the 'sweet' theme?
[0:46:31] xtremelego321: 3:30 left iskar
[0:46:34] Pineapple0nPizza: I agree with making cake seals findable only, keep them kinda OP so it's an exciting thing to find
[0:46:37] floppypidgen: How op are cake vaults?
[0:46:37] That_Dude_Bacon: I did 🥹😅
[0:46:38] Natsu_Dragnwolf: question is the challenger seal coming back at any point ?
[0:46:40] evesteroo: I never buy them from black market, but I would if they weren’t craftable
[0:46:43] Princess_Arya: cakes seals as findable only would be sad
[0:46:45] TobyButt89: I like the idea of them only being findable, but also I just wanna try new cake vaults! Can the update include giving players 2 free ones? Like as a quest reward?
[0:46:45] Grim_Stoner: Cake vaults seal should be around the same rarity as chaos catalyst
[0:46:51] gaymersalsa: CAKE
[0:46:54] Jaja123happy_face: ya I think you should need to find a cake in normal vault to get the cake seal
[0:46:55] Andyghandi97: Add them to vendor rooms to make them even more exciting, as a rare purchase
[0:46:55] PerchyDNB: @Pineapple0nPizza Yeah I think that would be a cool change
[0:46:57] goopulio321: cake vaults to be found would be sick its like a huge game pirze like chaos vaults
[0:46:57] basman333: CAKE
[0:46:57] OctaviasTooGayFYS: Maybe take vault seals can be duplicatable like armor trims in vanilla.
[0:46:58] That_Dude_Bacon: said I agreed with you they could be to over powered if they are craft able
[0:47:02] angrrrrydad: you need ores for shards sir
[0:47:08] YawNeon: Is it bad if soulflame vaults had a higher chance of gaining reputation?  Because it's more of a late game thing
[0:47:08] OctaviasTooGayFYS: *cake
[0:47:11] pcmode2: Cake

[0:47:36] tangerinedoro: good morning secci!
[0:47:37] k1_setae: Iskall im wondering, how many chests are you able to get in cake if you loot almost every room as you would normally. since the ammount of chests increase further you go.
[0:47:41] That_Dude_Bacon: also said you should make a freebie in the quest line so that players know what they are and know how good they are then get exited the next time they get one
[0:47:44] Pineapple0nPizza: My lizard brain gets way more excited by extra chests I can see them percentage increases I can't
[0:47:44] Wizard_Chach: cakes are essentially what Ascension was gonna be anyways, so we didn't lose much I feel
[0:47:46] joeri_van: Higher chance of cake seals in sweet theme?
[0:47:46] SuddenlyMia: i hope wutax becomes beteter

[0:49:40] tangerinedoro: yo mods, what's the process of applying to become a mod? i would love to become an unpaid intern and help with the workload if you ever needed more hands on deck
[0:49:41] Jackefree: @iskall85 i just want to say this to you and your team but dont burn yourself out just to push an uppdate. i get worried if i have expectations on me when i am recovering and i dont want you or any of the devs to overwork yourself becuse of others expectations. <3
[0:49:41] Benayman: guess its run - kiwi - greed again

[0:49:47] k1_setae: Also, libruary needs a rework for cascading chests. its highly lacking when using catas for gilded.
[0:49:54] nightmare_xz: I stopped playing vh since u12 because of military service, but before that, i reached level 100, and i have unlocked every research. Honestly, the game pace and the difficulty of the vaults are really cool especially scav
[0:49:58] LunaticGoneMad: can you also make it so the price text is red or green based on if you can afford it or not, just so you know if you can afford or not to decide rather then having to calculate what you have first
[0:50:00] damnsecci: @tangerinedoro unfortunately wait until iskall notices u lol
[0:50:01] Rauhaa: is there anything special with the flesh pit theme?
[0:50:07] ihcmoonie: Chat how can you tell an ore room from the entry door?

[0:50:39] tangerinedoro: @damnsecci that makes sense lol guess i'll have to pay my way through becoming an unpaid intern
[0:50:40] TakeMyBigbysHand: Please wait to leave until under 10 seconds for my bingo sheet lol
[0:50:43] joeri_van: if sweet theme is more difficult, a higher cake seal chance in sweet theme would be cool
[0:50:49] basman333: is this a normal scav?
[0:50:51] TaliaTwist: @ihcmoonie ore rooms are more claustrophobic feeling, not all open
[0:50:51] gaymersalsa: @ihcmoonie theres like two or three room layout variants, just memorising
[0:50:55] damnsecci: KEK when u put it like that @tangerinedoro

[0:51:24] LunaticGoneMad: in vendoor can you also make it so the price text is red or green based on if you can afford it or not, just so you know if you can afford or not to decide rather then having to calculate what you have first
[0:51:24] pootch_1: False is doing all the puzzles damn

[1:14:33] noahmeredith321: hi
[1:14:36] alexnmt: thanks iskall and xverion <3
[1:14:39] floppypidgen: Why does the trash have 10ish slots but deletes the items immediately? What if they had a terraria style buffer where you can get the item deleted when the next item gets added. Means you can save items
[1:14:47] OvidiuA: True tho :)))
[1:14:56] muttpacket: i wish we could make the gamerule separate xp gain from loot gain

[1:15:11] Kelzky: Is there any known way to individually set casual mode on a server with commands?  So beginner's grace no matter what level?
[1:15:15] kinghingle: yea i think it remaining like a high score trophy is where it wants to be and gettinga  reward when it fails is just a nice thing to get
[1:15:16] k1_setae: It was 100% meta, changes were exactly on point.
[1:15:17] chadro83: I would rather it be the new way you said than it to be a super try hard version
[1:15:18] ViciTheTenorOon: It was very op
[1:15:21] jk_sajoko: I felt excited but also like that cuz I'm not that good

[1:15:38] FlynnThe1st: Shouldn't you use a Wardrobe for your Stompa build Chest
[1:15:38] killblade999: @iskall85 are you ready for hermitcraft season 10 next week

[1:16:05] sylbel_w: Soon we will have a computer that is capable of minecraft and vault hunters
[1:16:15] JOHN611: Iskall please show us your base

[1:31:16] the_oatmeal_raisin_cookie: What would relics be used for if they were removed?
[1:31:23] the_whtvr: I wish relics would stay simply because in Singleplayer you only can eat 10 fruit, while with other people you can get more extra time, and I'm constantly out of time with scavs :/
[1:31:37] bestdolos: @the_oatmeal_raisin_cookie could still burn them down to lemons?

[1:32:24] mahik750: Yeah, there wasn't mushroom in the starting room though
[1:32:26] RobUrHood: Maybe each relic needs charges and gets recharged with more pieces. Maybe then they would each give 30 seconds if you use a crystal on it and it uses a charge?

[2:48:46] aeonep_: It is WAY more chests, but also WAY more risk. As a rare item (a vault type you might do every 15-20 vaults) I think the extra loot is a great insentive to run different types of vaults from time to to time. Balanced, so long as the risk is real.

[3:22:18] Nolevos: I am so frustrated now, and I haven't even read about it. Just that 100% no longer means 100% is just WRONG
[3:22:23] stany_d: @Nolevos percentages don't necessarily mean a proportion of some total. In general, it just means a number. 50% means 0.5, 100% means 1, 150% means 1.5, and sometimes you need numbers bigger than 1

[3:23:44] MarkDatter: might look good if you put all of the non affinity stuff first
[3:23:44] ryuzzei: coin?

[3:23:48] gaymersalsa: BUMBLE BONNE

[3:24:23] VogelVrouw: @notTheRealHelmis just hang up, thats def the best
[3:24:26] Nolevos: So more than 100% is an ability does not make sense. 100% means perfection. More than 100% should be a waste
[3:24:29] Tjidobo: Axing is needed as well, right?
[3:24:32] notTheRealHelmis: @vogelvrouw ty ty

[3:24:47] TEONYco: whats the differenec
[3:24:48] the_whtvr: sickle is good
[3:24:49] forzawin: any reason not to put wooden on this?
[3:24:50] lukkepuffen_: you have coin right? you had one with orante and coin on one
[3:24:51] gaymersalsa: hammer chest looter riott
[3:24:53] Zinoba: go sicklo mode
[3:24:54] GhoulHunter811: coin and trap?
[3:24:54] maikgl: Hey iskall, loving your vids! Love the game looks allot of fun. Too bad my laptop is to slow.
[3:24:59] dia__hi: Swick mode
[3:25:01] pwn3dzilla: i love my hammers
[3:25:05] Oh_No_Its_Kat: byeee E

[3:25:21] gaymersalsa: hryLaf
[3:25:23] bunLunaa: @forzawin separate wooden tool bc wooden needs tons of mining speed and nothing else
[3:25:23] TEONYco: biased
[3:25:25] zinou2019: i would love to see you use a hammer
[3:25:26] gaymersalsa: gloating yep

[3:26:18] gaymersalsa: considerate chest
[3:26:26] kelsers82: still need coin sir
[3:26:30] Fur1OO1: english is a hard language

[3:26:42] CedH1: Time for an omeja gilded vault
[3:26:43] TheHolyCrack: Wooden?
[3:26:47] gaymersalsa: gloat /glōt/ intransitive verb To feel or express great, often malicious, pleasure or self-satisfaction.
[3:26:47] Paudot: mega gilded ?
[3:26:50] zichor: trap reach
[3:26:50] G8L6: "dwelling on one's own success or another's misfortune with smugness or malignant pleasure" eww
[3:26:55] No_xor: did you consider keeping both clumsy and trapped? If clumsy is only extra 2.5% trap, it doesnt seem good to add trap disarm at all
[3:26:58] nomulous: maybe mixed up boast and gloat and turned into bloat?
[3:27:09] gaymersalsa: iskall is bloating after eating raw onion hryLaf
[3:27:11] jaegerdreadful: @G8L6 Nerd
[3:27:16] gamingwithtoimen: 15 percent
[3:27:21] k1_setae: why not add wooden on it since you are putting miningspeed on it anyhow?
[3:27:31] codtronx: if i have poison cloud on my sword and wand does it double the chance of the cloud spawning?
[3:27:39] Kasszi_: eww
[3:27:39] LalaDiable: English likes to claim words from anywhere, tbf
[3:27:41] VogelVrouw: @gaymersalsa someone stop him! hes not stopping! hes getting bigger and bigger !
[3:27:42] gamingwithtoimen: its fine in the newupdate
[3:27:48] jaegerdreadful: Idk how the new trap disarm works tbh
[3:27:49] Skywalker8510: wooden would be good with mine if speed for strongboxes
[3:27:50] Zinoba: @k1_setae wooden needs much more mining speed
[3:27:54] gaymersalsa: @gaymersalsa UHMMM theres an audience for this somewhere
[3:27:54] VogelVrouw: i like it tbh
[3:28:01] sunnyr0ad: sunnyr0ad subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 14 months! Every time you say IskallMAN my brain sings the song now
[3:28:06] HFBalanann: What are we doing with trap disarm? need to be over 100% now?
[3:28:08] gaymersalsa: iskallMAN
[3:28:11] Niko_993: what is this luck
[3:28:15] jaegerdreadful: @gaymersalsa Ah yes, the iskall mukbang audience
[3:28:19] bestdolos: 1x clumsy = -50% is hard tho :P
[3:28:34] gaymersalsa: @bestdolos i agree, it should be a bit less lolol
[3:28:36] Zinoba: @gaymersalsa ?
[3:28:59] nomulous: @HFBalanann trap chance now subtracts from your trap disarm so you want more than 100
[3:29:01] counter_intuitive2: hi iskall I can’t stick around for long but I saw your stream in my recommended so I stopped by and just wanted to tell you you’re a wonderful person and thank you for all of the fun memories
[3:29:15] thiccmilkguy: uyauam
[3:29:17] kelsers82: you still need to put the affinity for coins sir
[3:29:28] LalaDiable: @sunnyr0ad is that bad?
[3:29:29] gdalez: isn’t clumsy just a nerf to trap disarm though? if you don’t have trap disarm what does it do to you?
[3:29:32] Attackeight: !cookies @counter_intuitive2
[3:29:32] Nightbot: Here, counter_intuitive2 have some cookies!
[3:29:37] MunchNL: and mining speed
[3:29:38] thiccmilkguy: sick-le
[3:30:02] jaegerdreadful: @iskall85 Can you explain how the trap disarm works, because I still have no idea how high to go to get no traps
[3:30:03] bestdolos: I was expecting something like 10% or 20% per clumsy stack tbh. mega catas will have like up to 10x clumsy... nobody's gonna have 600% trap disarm for that :P
[3:30:06] Benayman: clumy still at -100% ? I suggest nerfing that to -50%
[3:30:19] Benayman: or -25
[3:30:26] LucarioX: @iskall85 i think it would be a nice QoL change if jewels showed how often they were cut already, just as an idea
[3:30:29] thiccmilkguy: cant you sort through size? something like "< 20"
[3:30:32] Glacial__7: would it be possible to have a system made where you can kinda build your own jewel?
[3:30:39] thatmfdes: @jaegerdreadful lowers the chance of getting traps, 100% for no trapped chests
[3:30:41] nikishady_: Hey iskal did you get something good from the challenge with eto
[3:30:51] bestdolos: they had 2x clumsy = -100% trap disarm earlier. so it's 50% per stack, right?
[3:30:52] Ghost_Formen: Ghost_Formen subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 7 months, currently on a 1 month streak! thx for all the good content
[3:30:53] jaegerdreadful: @thatmfdes Thats the old one, not the new one KEKW

[3:31:07] illycat_: I really like reach on my tools
[3:31:13] Attackeight: @thiccmilkguy that’s a question for BONNe I think
[3:31:13] Benayman: @bestdolos wasn't it 2 times -100%, right?
[3:31:18] ramnite_tv: @bestdolos We'll see if mega catas survive the rework or if there will be a small amount of slots available per crystal hryUhm
[3:31:19] Niko_993: do you also soulbound the higher tier tools?
[3:31:21] gamingwithtoimen: @Benayman yes
[3:31:30] Benayman: so -200%
[3:31:38] potatowaffle_: potatowaffle_ subscribed with Prime. 
[3:31:39] thiccmilkguy: @Attackeight how do we get it to BONNe?
[3:31:40] laxxbe: Hello iskHeart  I'm working so it's the vod for me later. Good grind
[3:31:41] gamingwithtoimen: @Benayman no what u saw was total
[3:31:46] Benayman: ah okay
[3:31:54] Zinoba: @jaegerdreadful 100%. but the new clumsy modifier takes away from that. so if clumsy takes -50% and you had 100% now you got 50%. but if you overstacked to 160% now you got 110% and no traps
[3:32:00] gaymersalsa: @thiccmilkguy it sorts from type (flawless -> chipped), and from size
[3:32:03] Benayman: still too much to overcome when causally playing around lvl 70
[3:32:11] Attackeight: @thiccmilkguy ask in discord maybe?
[3:32:13] GhoulHunter811: but doesnt the coin and rarity look same tho? yellow?
[3:32:21] asimithehero: Colors are wrong? Unplayable :(
[3:32:23] bestdolos: @Benayman tooltip said 2x clumsy = -100%. tooltip should have shown the total not per stack, so -50% per stack
[3:32:24] gaymersalsa: u need more mining speed
[3:32:25] Niko_993: you need coin affinity
[3:32:27] gaymersalsa: think about the levitation bug
[3:32:40] Attackeight: coin affinity ser
[3:32:42] GhoulHunter811: @gaymersalsa why tho?
[3:32:45] Waliyounas: Minning speed is low
[3:32:46] TheImmortaldonut: Tool building is pretty tricky
[3:32:47] jaegerdreadful: @Zinoba So it takes 50% flat? And not 50% of your total? So 160% would take 80% I mean
[3:32:54] gdalez: if item quant was mathematically better than trap disarm before, surely it’s much better now? does clumsy affect you if you don’t use trap disarm on your tools?
[3:32:54] ramnite_tv: @gaymersalsa elevation hryLafExceptInPain  dont levitate while mining its unhealthy
[3:32:55] aeonep_: Over-leveling Trap Disarm doesn't seem like it's worth the 80 capacity
[3:32:56] thiccmilkguy: @gaymersalsa something like "< 20" would be fun but maybe its a pain to code?
[3:33:01] SYM_uk: Speed  as well
[3:33:02] Masuary: Can you search in the AE2 system for multiple jewels attributes as well ?
[3:33:04] Zinoba: @jaegerdreadful flat yes

[3:33:14] zinou2019: the tram dissarm took some space
[3:33:14] gaymersalsa: @gaymersalsa the levitation bug is annoying LOL it stopts u from mining fast when ur stepping down a slab
[3:33:20] gaymersalsa: @gaymersalsa LOL close enough hryLaf
[3:33:20] MunchNL: Why would you want copiously?
[3:33:26] gaymersalsa: true.
[3:33:28] mimilayaa: im a little new to VH, what is he trying to do?
[3:33:33] k1_setae: Quantity is capped too easily, rarity > quant
[3:33:36] pwn3dzilla: mathers have it at like 30:1 or smthg
[3:33:40] gaymersalsa: @mimilayaa making a new tool! cutting jewels to fit as many as he can on it
[3:33:46] illycat_: it would be cool to have a jewel cutter that users platinum and does larger cuts
[3:33:48] batt3ryac1d: @mimilayaa making a chest slicer
[3:33:52] Attackeight: @mimilayaa he is making a new chest breaking tool
[3:33:52] percival97_: i think you can do with less trap disarm
[3:33:54] Benayman: why the cope on there?
[3:33:56] MunchNL: why would you want copiously on this?

[3:34:07] just__corn: Mining speed also?
[3:34:08] jallyhoo: less trap
[3:34:11] silvain_shadows: 179 disarm might be overkill
[3:34:13] Butzehier: isnt more than 100% trap disarm, a waste?
[3:34:16] gaymersalsa: @aeonep_ this i think
[3:34:23] gaymersalsa: @Butzehier not in update13
[3:34:28] NathnS18: might want to cut in the disarm

[3:34:38] zichor: and 80% trap
[3:34:44] debzz: maybe go for 150% trap?
[3:34:46] lukkepuffen_: iskGarbage
[3:34:47] the_oscar_cat: go for 150% trap disarm
[3:34:53] Benayman: 179 + gear means you can out-gun 2* clumsy generally
[3:34:57] Benayman: and that you can get quickly
[3:35:00] thiccmilkguy: oh yeah trap disarm acts weird now
[3:35:02] gaymersalsa: dont do it
[3:35:07] da_hyun0615: Craft jewels
[3:35:08] Lt_Einstein: what item is floating in front of the tool station
[3:35:10] gamingwithtoimen: @Butzehier they are playing the new update so no in the new update clumsy removes 50% trapdissarm so if you get 3 times clumsy and you only got 100 you will get + 50 change of getting trapped
[3:35:10] rytional: mining speed is still good for the y level bug
[3:35:12] jaegerdreadful: You want machate for the trapdoors iskall
[3:35:15] omkaarr: Should you make 1 tool for wooden and all chest?
[3:35:16] lukkepuffen_: iskNERD
[3:35:16] cineeleo: maybe gamba remove axing from jewel?

[3:36:03] tonTeufel: do not put hydrovoid on a chest miner, it's awful
[3:36:03] CaptainGoldSkull: does hydro work on void liquid?
[3:36:05] am_andrew: halloo
[3:36:07] gaymersalsa: @CaptainGoldSkull yes
[3:36:09] thiccmilkguy: if it can mine void liquid, it would be nice

[3:36:10] G8L6: Yeah I have hydrovoid on mine, it is amazing in void
[3:36:11] siriusmarks: Axing for the trap doors pois sir

[3:36:19] Attackeight: it can mine voice liquid
[3:36:20] Therank2100: You rang?
[3:36:20] EnslavedMoist: don't put hydrovoid on, it's so annoying on a sickle
[3:36:21] Benayman: cant drop into void liquid if you hydrovoided it
[3:36:30] k1_setae: hydrovoid is required for hammer, hammer bugs when veinmining near water, and destroys your tool if you do not have the hydrovoid
[3:36:31] godson522: You have put together such an amazing game.
[3:36:37] tonTeufel: there's too many chests in water, hydrovoid prevents you mining those
[3:36:40] am_andrew: dylan what are we doin rn ?
[3:36:41] Zinoba: we really need that fan made mod with the jewel purposer to sort these lol
[3:36:48] Meena4578: why do you keep size 30 jewels?
[3:36:50] CaptainGoldSkull: @gaymersalsa that sounds pretty good to take into a void vault to be honest, not on a chest breaker tho but i would definately put it on atleast one thing i take in
[3:36:51] Ferdster02: you could use your sickle to vein mine lava or void liquid with hydrovoid
[3:36:52] bestdolos: yeah hydro on breaker is actually bad. you will mine one block of water and then have infinite source refill it instantly before you can break what's underneath, at worst
[3:36:59] Lt_Einstein: @am_andrew making tools
[3:37:02] TheExiled616: Hi Iskal How do i add shaders to VH i have been trying but i cant get them to work?

[3:37:07] gaymersalsa: @gaymersalsa its great on hammers!
[3:37:10] excaliburhero19: DO IT
[3:37:10] mrp1na7a: i made a prismatic Machete with hydrovoid and it was not worth it, it’s really annoying to get the poi’s that are in the water

[3:52:33] lukkepuffen_: go chech ethos base for good coin affinity
[3:52:42] Lashings: I think there is something to be said about size increasing the potential range of stats so you could randomly get a GG size 30 jewel
[3:52:45] az1mmer328: it would be nice to be able to cut jewels past size ten not to make it smaller but to randomly remove modifiers
