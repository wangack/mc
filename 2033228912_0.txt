[0:20:29] Sirromap: I have a million YouTube videos to watch. 8 days is a long time without internet.
[0:20:36] WhoIsEpikus: @zeusz_fr shh. It's a fun idea
[0:20:37] zeusz_fr: itll go horribly.
[0:20:37] preparedman: Warden wrangling with Pearlo
[0:20:43] Glitchd_Demigod: Then it'll aggro on that instead of you
[0:20:44] zeusz_fr: @WhoIsEpikus she gon die fr
[0:20:48] TheOGSpaceDingo: You need to keep the warden away from anything, including sniff range and hearing range.
[0:20:49] kazriel_: any progress on s10 base plan? or is it still iffy if its too similar to the other persons?
[0:20:52] Yuzz_underscore: warden would be more noisy than a noise machine
[0:20:54] lilydeboef: almost like thats the point, a noise machine to make noise
[0:20:55] chinook_a: @Sirromap ohh you have some homework pearlieLOL

[0:21:28] aquardraws: warden in a psych ward TT^TT
[0:21:30] shanesunil: So... just a machine?
[0:21:31] zeusz_fr: you gotta keep it at a distance of 40 blocks. also warden can sniff thru wool
[0:21:35] girlscout224: Hear me out, what if you made like a local Dwarf and dig a hole and put an observation deck above him lol
[0:21:36] Glitchd_Demigod: Do warden dectect minecarts
[0:21:36] 19_meg_91: Wouldn't be a noise machine then LUL
[0:21:40] lemonjuice_yu: the Violence Man will be put the in the Silence Room to atone for his sins

[0:22:15] serialscatterbrain: lol. putting him in solitary confinement.
[0:22:18] sapphicwhimsy: a watertower?
[0:22:22] Glitchd_Demigod: If wardens dectect minecarts you could make a noise machine with a minecart and just mute minecart noises
[0:22:23] zeusz_fr: @TheOGSpaceDingo wait they nerfed the warden?? when
[0:22:31] lilydeboef: a massive warden structure for the warden

[0:23:06] TheOGSpaceDingo: @zeusz_fr not that i can remember and not as it stands today
[0:23:06] Glitchd_Demigod: If wardens dectect minecarts you could make a noise machine with a minecart and just mute minecart noises
[0:23:13] girlscout224: Build a custom cave where the Wardens live? You can build a viewing platform
[0:23:13] jibbybonk: can you silence wardens?
[0:23:17] kazriel_: but is that too risky?
[0:23:25] chinook_a: hes gonna be a loud boy LUL pearlieHeart

[0:24:26] dashmax1214: How hungry is the warden?
[0:24:28] secret_agent4706: I don't think sniffing actually does anything, it doesn't aggro him
[0:24:34] Exirel: Oh hi here!
[0:24:34] acorn_forever: Sniff sniff
[0:24:35] datguccipoochie: he smells something funny
[0:24:37] girlscout224: Does the wool work for sound if you cover it up with a block? Think like insulation in a house, but it's wool sound proofing
[0:24:37] pt0lem: pt0lem subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months! 
[0:24:45] shanesunil: Is it just me or is it taking way too long for Warden to aggro on you?
[0:24:46] zeusz_fr: use shampoo and he wont attack u
[0:24:46] bookworm2692: but even if he sonic blasts you every now and then, it wont kill you straight away so you can just fly away
[0:24:51] dashmax1214: Hmm
[0:25:00] secret_agent4706: Oh nvm

[0:25:27] shanesunil: That took really long time
[0:25:29] zeusz_fr: are u on hard mode rn?
[0:25:32] Glitchd_Demigod: Were not gonna be able to see him if he's in a wool prison tho
[0:25:33] zeusz_fr: or normal
[0:25:35] TheOGSpaceDingo: that would be cool
[0:25:38] lemonjuice_yu: splash potion of soap
[0:25:39] Yuzz_underscore: just a regular battle of water?
[0:25:40] 19_meg_91: An etho washed up potion?

[0:25:50] camilla_rep: the heartbeat makes me so uncomfortable
[0:25:51] TheOGSpaceDingo: @zeusz_fr difficulty doesnt affect warden mechanics

[0:26:12] shanesunil: @chinook_a Mojang, take notes
[0:26:13] antalia_lotus: pearl i would put him far awy from the spots you are at often
[0:26:16] datguccipoochie: @sadkitty15 wardens are blind
[0:26:16] TheOGSpaceDingo: @zeusz_fr what aspect changes with difficulty?
[0:26:21] GaspsHiChat: yeah bc wardens can't see at all
[0:26:27] Glitchd_Demigod: Mabey have a wool path were the window is
[0:26:29] Bloopino: as long as the floor around the warden is wool it's fine to have glass windows?
[0:26:30] Kanavitas: if it's like a castle in the sky- yea that
[0:26:31] patro42: baby monitor
[0:26:32] JigRabble: would carpeting the surrounding area help?
[0:26:37] ciciplayingmc: have carpet around him as the path
[0:26:37] gamingnscience: if you have a wool path around him, he won’t hear you walking on it either.
[0:26:38] jibbybonk: just dangle him from a rope in the sky
[0:26:40] Bloopino: cause walking on wool doesn't aggro
[0:26:41] preparedman: Texture pack with transparent wool? pearlieThink
[0:26:43] acorn_forever: Warden castle!
[0:26:43] daimmessi007: Glow effect

[0:26:58] TheOGSpaceDingo: Not really, no xd
[0:26:58] jibbybonk: bouncy warden boi dangling in the sky
[0:27:04] girlscout224: Giant cave entrance, the Wardens can live on an upper platform where you can seen them from the ground?
[0:27:08] bookworm2692: if you walk on wool near him does that stop him hearing you?
[0:27:12] RyanAprentice: Noise machine to keep them distracted?
[0:27:15] 19_meg_91: Wool on the ground leading to the warden
[0:27:23] Bloopino: make sure it's deep enough, sound only travels so far xD
[0:27:25] damorpeko: Make him a beutiful castle so big that he cant sense you
[0:27:28] datguccipoochie: solitary confinement
[0:27:30] Exirel: Isn't there a distance limit for sound travel?
[0:27:32] chinook_a: Mojang: warden should be feared. Pearl: my pet pearlieWoo
[0:27:34] gamingnscience: @bookworm2692 it does.

[0:27:39] ywain_: Texture pack? A rarely used wool color maybe
[0:27:43] TheOGSpaceDingo: @Exirel ye like 16-20 blocks or something
[0:27:50] jibbybonk: heal?
[0:28:00] alexyap0223: alexyap0223 is gifting 1 Tier 1 Subs to PearlescentMoon's community! They've gifted a total of 14 in the channel! 
[0:28:00] alexyap0223: alexyap0223 gifted a Tier 1 sub to BeeDyan! 
[0:28:02] sapphicwhimsy: it would be painful with all the mobs in the base
[0:28:05] TheOGSpaceDingo: @jibbybonk test it doesnt matter if she dies or not
[0:28:07] Glitchd_Demigod: Like a wool path in the citys next to the box so you can look through the window without him hearing you coming
[0:28:19] acorn_forever: Ababababab
[0:28:20] gamingnscience: try a window but walk yourself on wool
[0:28:20] alexyap0223: pearlieHeart pearlieHeart
[0:28:27] bookworm2692: yeah windows but wool path
[0:28:35] serialscatterbrain: i think his blast only goes 15 blocks if that helps.
[0:28:37] acorn_forever: Its like ring around the rosie!
[0:28:45] TheOGSpaceDingo: @serialscatterbrain 20 on the dot radially

[0:28:53] Bloopino: wiki says they only hear within 16 blocks
[0:29:00] jibbybonk: can wardens sniff you when youre in water?
[0:29:02] ywain_: A wool-floored viewing platform sounds good i guess
[0:29:07] serialscatterbrain: @TheOGSpaceDingo thank you. wasn't actually sure.
[0:29:13] puppy555jjj33: @Bloopino they cant hear anything behidn wool

[0:29:22] Zenologia: what’s the tradition exactly where I gift stupid amounts of subs when my birthday comes around this week? pearlieHype
[0:29:22] Beeish0Fries: warden is just upset he can’t see
[0:29:33] Bloopino: @puppy555jjj33 if you want an open window, make it 16 blocks away xD
[0:29:39] gamingnscience: the most important part is that the warden doesn’t kill all your other mobs
[0:29:41] bookworm2692: or have windows on all sides since this is taking too long to kill you so youll be fine
[0:29:41] Nightbot:  Reminder to be kind in chat!

[0:30:36] zeusz_fr: ull be fine
[0:30:41] 19_meg_91: Try glass and wool underneath where u walk next for testing
[0:30:46] zeusz_fr: but the darkness effect is gonna be annoying

[0:31:08] blueguineapig78: Darkness effect could be useful for a spooky build.
[0:31:09] Beeish0Fries: the warden sounds like a cranky toddler
[0:31:14] joytobake: Don't you want to eat?
[0:31:23] jibbybonk: would pressure plates in the prison work to distract them?
[0:31:27] shanesunil: Nugget doesn't realize that this is not Decked Out, remember how Nugget used to interrupt Pearl while playing Decked Out?
[0:31:29] antalia_lotus: pearlieNugget

[0:31:32] queentali1994: Hey Pearly Pop. I did a beautiful area, to honour Jellie
[0:31:35] sadkitty15: Wouldn't the Worden aggro on the nosie around and try attack
[0:31:37] TheOGSpaceDingo: @jibbybonk self-triggered pressure plates dont agro waren
[0:31:38] zeusz_fr: u wont be at risk of death, but darkness will be annoying
[0:31:40] aplx23: Hello how are you
[0:31:43] Bloopino: can put the warden in a glass box - as long as the floor you walk near it is made of wool it won't hear you :V
[0:31:47] fermentedstew: Hi Pearl! pearlieHeart
[0:31:51] daimmessi007: You can try the glow command with cona
[0:31:56] TheOGSpaceDingo: pressure plates are tied to the mob which triggers it so pressure plates are useless
[0:31:58] serialscatterbrain: so wait why are we doing warden stuff? i think i asked before but don't remember.
[0:31:58] chinook_a: @Bloopino this!
[0:32:00] Kanavitas: .... dang this is taking a while
[0:32:02] datguccipoochie: warden smells stink
[0:32:10] joytobake: Is this your hard-core world?
[0:32:12] zeusz_fr: and then whats the point of a warden
[0:32:20] zeusz_fr: if not to flex
[0:32:25] kazriel_: @joytobake nah test world
[0:32:26] snowystar122: hello hello! i missed out on the notification for some reason xd
[0:32:26] 19_meg_91: Test walking on wool next with glass
[0:32:27] joytobake: Oh, ok
[0:32:33] jibbybonk: i think a splash potion of water should wash away all your stink
[0:32:35] BaldBover: Oooh.  How about a slime farm with a warden in it?  That way you'd get the noises when in range with little danger.
[0:32:37] Piplup_Vulpix: breed a bunch of wolfs they could umm… distract him while you are down there
[0:32:38] thataussiewillow: gonna pop out for a bit to try and sleep. may come back later so for now; night Pearl and chat!
[0:32:43] preparedman: It would be fun to have like a maze with the warden in the middle
[0:32:51] joytobake: @kazriel_ thanks,  now this makes sense
[0:33:01] chinook_a: @preparedman im stealing that idea
[0:33:03] Beeish0Fries: test a sheep
[0:33:03] shanesunil: How about changing the wool to any other block for faster aggro?
[0:33:05] kazriel_: havings slimes could risk sonic blast
[0:33:06] magicclemons: hello peoples, i’m late but i understand chemistry now lol
[0:33:07] Stormi_Stik: Stormi_Stik subscribed at Tier 1. 
[0:33:08] aplx23: What are we doing here
[0:33:11] TheOGSpaceDingo: warden prioritises noise over sniff so in a slime farm it wouldn't ever sniff
[0:33:21] Glitchd_Demigod: That sounds like decked out @preparedman
[0:33:40] girlscout224: Other animal mobs wouldn't deter them, would they? If it smells other passive mobs you could give him some sheep friends and double it as a wool farm? Lol it would be on theme, and useful, you might need a sheep breeding factory next door though 😂
[0:33:41] Stormi_Stik: :D
[0:33:45] alexyap0223: pearlieLOL
[0:33:58] Bloopino: slime farm with warden? super danger edition xD what a flex that'd be
[0:34:10] TheOGSpaceDingo: wait community games? wait did i miss something?
[0:34:19] preparedman: @glitcheddemigod1 I was thinking like with the minotaur but it would be very much like decked out
[0:34:20] zeusz_fr: aight just use pressure plates
[0:34:21] Wallubo: b
[0:34:21] Stormi_Stik: dang twitch emotes sucking the emotional life force out of the typical text faces >:[
[0:34:28] zeusz_fr: a noteblock would be good too

[0:35:01] magicclemons: ooooo i did not realise how close the warden is getting
[0:35:02] Glitchd_Demigod: @preparedman ya that's what I thought of as well but not everyone are mythology nerds

[0:36:09] WhoIsEpikus: Also in hardcore you have full netherite (minus chest) to help you
[0:36:22] damorpeko: and now for the wardens to decide that they want to be much smarter in your hardcore world
[0:36:27] shanesunil: Oh yes, listened to Double Life song at least 4 or 5 times already
[0:36:27] gamingnscience: @whoisepikus warden sonic blast ignores armor
[0:36:30] alexyap0223: Cheer100

[0:38:15] 19_meg_91: LUL
[0:38:19] gamingnscience: absolute safety range is 20 blocks?
[0:38:21] Bloopino: oop soz keyboard freaked out xD
[0:38:22] TwinkleTues: put the warden in the tallest tower

[0:38:56] Kanavitas: :O
[0:38:56] girlscout224: I don't know if it will help the smell, but I do quite like a wool farm/Warden sanctuary combination lol. The sheep and Wardens can be friends, and you can farm wool for more Warden shenanigans
[0:38:58] damorpeko: he beats the sniffers at their own sniffin

[0:39:25] alexyap0223: pearlieLOL
[0:39:26] girlscout224: Oop I guess that is a bad idea hahaha. Why can't other mobs be near the warden, can anyone explain to me?
[0:39:29] datguccipoochie: maybe i'm something of a warden myself
[0:39:30] Nightbot: Remember to check out the Frequently Asked Questions (#faq) channel on discord!

[0:39:36] 19_meg_91: You can make an empty garden all around him
[0:39:47] ando_226: sounds great, the warden as a guardian of the temple

[0:40:04] antalia_lotus: yes
[0:40:09] antalia_lotus: pearlieYes
[0:40:09] girlscout224: Oh hahaha eep. Live Warden feeding and sheep breeding? Grim 😂
[0:40:10] 19_meg_91: Nice
[0:40:10] bariumdisodium: @girlscout224 the warden detects other mobs and will sonic boom them if they are within 20 blocks
[0:40:11] alexyap0223: pearlieYes
[0:40:12] blueguineapig78: How tall is that vertically?
[0:40:12] vicentmf95: pearlieYes pearlieYes pearlieYes

[0:40:52] datguccipoochie: i would like if my sick brain would not keep interpreting words in a sus way
[0:40:53] Voydir: the obvious answer here is to let the wardens run rampant around your base
[0:40:58] Esstyy: You've rotated entire builds before. :p
[0:41:00] blueguineapig78: Rebuild it? :D
[0:41:04] WhoIsEpikus: Turn the temple
[0:41:06] ekkelos: you can just rotate it :P
[0:41:07] stellaris_lex: yeah just rotate the temple
[0:41:11] blueguineapig78: You've done that sort of thing before...
[0:41:17] thataussiewillow: just rotate it!
[0:41:17] chinook_a: like season 8 - rotate a building LUL
[0:41:18] AuroraRpg: o/ pearl
[0:41:20] migfx: we have seen you rebuild your base to turn it haha
[0:41:22] gamingnscience: lol… like Pearl never rotated a build before
[0:41:29] WhoIsEpikus: @esstyy season 6 sewer cats stole parts of an entire build
[0:41:33] datguccipoochie: the warden would have a field day with all those wolves
[0:41:34] preparedman: "Transform"
[0:41:39] blueguineapig78: rotation is a transformation (mathematically)
[0:41:53] Nicklii: yes, the haunted desert temple
[0:41:53] TheOGSpaceDingo: @Yuzz_underscore O M G that was a golden edit
[0:41:56] padawandom: Transform as in make it twice as big

[0:42:03] antalia_lotus: "transform" with who impuls ? pearlieLOL
[0:42:05] shanesunil: @gamingnscience nah she definitely has not done that before...
[0:42:07] girlscout224: @bariumdisodium I might just attempt this if I ever get a new computer 😂 auto Sheep breeder, wool farm, and warden sanctuary. If the sheep dropped mutton it could be a mutton farm too 😂 kind of morbid lmao but I think it sounds fun...in a poor sheep kind of way
[0:42:07] alex_the_gaymer16: hello pearl
[0:42:11] meowmmin: what are u building HELP
[0:42:14] secret_agent4706: Warden detects entities within 49×51×49 box and sonic boom rang is 16 or 20 blocks so should be fine
[0:42:17] serialscatterbrain: i need to head to bed cause i still have work before my weekend.
[0:42:25] secret_agent4706: *Range

[0:42:46] TheOGSpaceDingo: @secret_agent4706 so sphere radius 25 from the head?
[0:42:49] datguccipoochie: a sculk infection
[0:42:59] girlscout224: A new alien landscape (diff from what you've done in hcs9) being corrupted?

[0:44:23] girlscout224: @zeusz_fr have a good day/night
[0:44:23] gamingnscience: curse of the gooey mummy style
[0:44:25] sadkitty15: Caution type around the worden
[0:44:25] lily_moon33: I need to get some sleep night pearl
[0:44:27] kazriel_: could be a very run down and abandoned version of the town aesthetic + skulk corruption
[0:44:37] thataussiewillow: @lily_moon33 gn!
[0:44:37] Nightbot:  Reminder to be kind in chat!
[0:44:47] Zehss: Rendog has a good community server
[0:45:03] Piplup_Vulpix: it feels like a city you would visit in the Star Wars world lol
[0:45:10] jasminebea1: there’s always the future
[0:45:28] sapphicwhimsy: running a server is a lot of work, especially with moderation
[0:45:29] datguccipoochie: the spawn building :pensive:
[0:45:30] alexyap0223: pearlieLOL pearlieLOL pearlieLOL
[0:45:34] Glitchd_Demigod: So if we want one it would be an unofficial fan one
[0:45:35] blueguineapig78: There's always drama. Doesn't matter how small or big or how good the people are.
[0:45:38] girlscout224: With community always comes drama, even with best intentions coming from everyone
[0:45:39] BertPotato: Griefing is often a problem
[0:45:43] jasminebea1: that’s understandable
[0:45:45] chinook_a: rather keep it safe pearlieHeart
[0:45:48] greenthunder27: Understandable
[0:45:56] itzcookie1234567: Ello 🍪
[0:45:59] Wallubo: is there a fan discord?
[0:46:10] antalia_lotus: awww no pearliePepe
[0:46:10] thataussiewillow: dam that sucks
[0:46:11] kazriel_: aww dude that sucks
[0:46:13] greenthunder27: Saw your tweet on it
[0:46:13] girlscout224: That's horrible Pearl 🥺 I'm sorry
[0:46:14] alexdagratez: blud is playing minecraft
[0:46:15] preparedman: That's so mean
[0:46:16] joytobake: Ouch
[0:46:23] shanesunil: Curse that person
[0:46:23] TheOGSpaceDingo: that sounds like a whitelist thing...
[0:46:28] datguccipoochie: yea that definitely puts a bad taste in your mouth
[0:46:30] meowmmin: oh
[0:46:30] chinook_a: thats totally understandable
[0:46:33] alexyap0223: pearlieGG
[0:46:33] sapphicwhimsy: its not silly, its completely understandable
[0:46:34] zombietheg: What did I stumble on to btw hope you ok
[0:46:37] paperbird76: Cant blame you..
[0:46:38] WhoIsEpikus: Makes sense Pearl
[0:46:38] ciciplayingmc: its not silly
[0:46:39] padawandom: @preparedman it is mean
[0:46:39] bly1896_2: they are to be shamed very much
[0:46:41] jasminebea1: people like that are not nice at all, they always do ruin it for the wonderful people
[0:46:43] vicentmf95: Understandable
[0:46:59] Esstyy: It's a lot of work, with risk, get it completely. I'd say I'd help out but from your perspective I'm also just a rando. Understandable to not have the capacity to do it on top of everything else.
[0:47:02] blueguineapig78: That is awful. For anyone else considering server ownership, WorldGuard and Coreprotect are great.
[0:47:13] girlscout224: Martyn finding a random group's server from the old Empire's IP as an example
[0:47:20] meowmmin: ooof
[0:47:22] Glitchd_Demigod: Is the discord a sub only one
[0:47:27] chinook_a: @blueguineapig78 World Guard is great! very versatile too
[0:47:35] bly1896_2: true
[0:47:36] BertPotato: Same reason people bully
[0:47:37] RCMNexus: morning or good evening all how we all doing I’ve just woke up what happened? Unless it’s something private
[0:47:50] datguccipoochie: i can't understand griefing tbh, its why i don't get places like 2b2t
[0:47:54] joytobake: So pointless
[0:47:54] paperbird76: Its always a few messing it up for the many
[0:47:55] chinook_a: you can reset a server back some time, but its a hassle
[0:47:56] BertPotato: people like to lower others to their level so they can make themselves feel better (somehow)
[0:47:58] Zenologia: don’t try to understand griefers. you’ll give yourself a headache
[0:48:02] Glitchd_Demigod: @girlscout224 ahh yes the one he dubbed squatters smp
[0:48:11] d1n0ni: That is soul crushing
[0:48:12] secret_agent4706: Yeah there are anarchy servers for that purpose but some people still choose other servers and destroy builds
[0:48:15] SweetSunnyDream1: I had a server on hypixel once... and my friends just speed run, fought the dragon and left again... sooo i understand you 100%
[0:48:16] alexyap0223: Is fine
[0:48:17] GaspsHiChat: does anyone else remember that one youtuber who would go meds with little kids' servers? it was a long time ago, probably 2016-ish
[0:48:21] Rum_Chaser: i've found that they do it for attention or they are bored and think it's funny. Griefers never work alone
[0:48:23] GaspsHiChat: mess* not meds
[0:48:29] bly1896_2: i would hate that someone ould ruin a build that i putmy heart and soul in
[0:48:31] Zenologia: I admin a server and dealing with it is a pain. you need a good mod team behind you
[0:48:33] jc_crafty00: 3 years ago on tangos we had a massive griefer…. we still talk a out it to this day
[0:48:33] girlscout224: @glitcheddemigod1 I would love to see him make a series about squatting on that server, they seemed open to letting him play lol
[0:48:35] sapphicwhimsy: theres a lot of people who just like to be mean and its sad
[0:48:44] bookworm2692: oh yeah martyn accidentally joining a random private server last year...
[0:48:44] RCMNexus: Sadly some people just find ruining other peoples builds are more or less for their own enjoyment it’s a harsh reality
[0:48:46] Nightbot:  Be respectful - No spamming - No advertising - English only
[0:48:49] zsigmons1: Same people who destroy kids sandcastles on the beach
[0:48:49] WhoIsEpikus: Same as discord raiders. What's the point. Why do they do it for fun. I had some friends, over the silliest predicament they decided to raid my discord, one claimed he was paying people to
[0:49:00] cata352: ppl can be so sad
[0:49:10] Rum_Chaser: @zsigmons1 or adults sand castles :(
[0:49:15] Stormi_Stik: i understand that it would be a lot of work but have you considered maybe making a unique game night server with sorta like a unique murder mystery or tnt run etc? i only propose because you expressed problems with the amount of people and parties but then again i have no idea the amount of effort that goes in to making servers so this suggestion is probably not the best idea lol just a thought
[0:49:34] chinook_a: oooooh oasis would be lovely
[0:49:39] m0nsterr94: my d key sounds weird
[0:49:59] bangers0212: is there a video on how to set up decked out? im a computer noob xD
[0:50:02] Glitchd_Demigod: The server was using the same IP that empires 1 used and Martyn was going to look at the old empires sever and ended up on what he dubbed squatters smp
[0:50:03] SweetSunnyDream1: 2b2t can actually be a lot of fun, someone found my hidden base, left me some tools, helped with my farm, left a lovely sign and left again pearlieHeart
[0:50:10] datguccipoochie: hypickle
[0:50:14] Piplup_Vulpix: I play Minecraft on the switch and it’s so limited, what pc would you recommend???
[0:50:21] bangers0212: thank you
[0:50:28] tkdscout: Hi Pearl! Hi Chat!
[0:50:31] bookworm2692: no the martyn thing was because he had scotts profile thing which had an old hermitcraft IP attached? and he was curious but it was no longer the hermitcraft IP and was instead an IP for a random person...
[0:50:31] zombietheg: Wait how long you have had your hardcore world cause some people have had their s for 4 or 5 years or more
[0:50:36] LilyMaiDarling: Happy Monday all
[0:50:37] kazriel_: god does anyone remember party zone murder mystery
[0:50:39] blueguineapig78: I have a small server that we set up periodically for different things. Bingo is very fun.
[0:50:40] datguccipoochie: build your own pc definitely
[0:50:43] Zenologia: @sweetsunnydream1 rare W moment for 2b lol
[0:50:50] Glitchd_Demigod: If You think the switch is limited try playing on legacy edition
[0:50:53] aquacat8: @sweetsunnydream1 Wow you're lucky
[0:51:02] Stormi_Stik: possibly you could hold community competitions to design the game maps or the occasional custom minigame idk it was a thought that wouldnt leave my head lol
[0:51:04] TwinkleTues: Well, now there's different models of consoles to complicate that too
[0:51:18] datguccipoochie: building a pc is just like... building with very expensive legos
[0:51:19] preparedman: We never got to see the group photo from the last community game night
[0:51:26] lunarcloak: Hi Pearl!!! Hi Chat!!! I'm just home from class- nice to see I caught stream :D
[0:51:30] chinook_a: @preparedman its in the discord!
[0:51:37] Glitchd_Demigod: @bookworm2692 marytn said that it was the old empires smp IP
[0:51:48] thataussiewillow: @lunarcloak Hiiiii!
[0:51:51] Piplup_Vulpix: I’m not smart enough to build a pc lol 😆
[0:51:57] serialscatterbrain: i have to duck out sadly. love watching you and the others. keep up the good work and stay crafty all.
[0:51:58] wazza_itwasntme: minimum is a I7 8700 with 16 Gb of ram
[0:52:00] bookworm2692: @GlitchedDemigod1 that makes more sense! i couldnt remember all the details haha
[0:52:06] Glitchd_Demigod: See ya serial
[0:52:10] cremation2204: I would not trust myself to build a pc
[0:52:12] preparedman: Oh I just missed it woops
[0:52:14] TheOGSpaceDingo: Checked wiki, warden's player detection box is indeed the 49x51x49, in effect a 49 block cube centred on the warden, but slightly elongated of the warden's 3-tall hitbox. its ability to hear is limited to 16 blocks, can only sniff players within 6 horizontal radially, 20 vertically (forming cylinder dia 12 43 tall(?) centred on warden) and has a sonic blast range of 20 radially (slightly elongated sphere of dia 40, technically this is slightly off but the ''safe'' option)
[0:52:15] blueguineapig78: The building isn't the hard part imo. Selecting the parts....
[0:52:20] azrafdaguy: Minimum requirements for Minecraft is still ridiculously low. Even the lowest gen stuff from the past 5 years should be able to run at 60fps 1080p
[0:52:25] TheOGSpaceDingo: and sonic blast occurs after 5s of inability to deal melee dmg
[0:52:26] BertPotato: Generally, you need a decent (not the highest possible) CPU, and a reasonably graphics card (again doesn't need to be a top of the range model).  I'd normally recommend at least 16GB RAM for the system
[0:52:30] WhoIsEpikus: Someone in my class was building a PC and somehow it apparently exploded
[0:52:37] jasminebea1: wait how does community game night work?
[0:52:39] kamitsu_jaffa: @wazza_itwasntme surely not as high as an i7
[0:52:39] BertPotato: you'll need RAM for the server processes itself and RAM for the game
[0:52:41] RCMNexus: I tried to build my pc and ruined my graphics card sadly I just can’t trust my self
[0:52:43] dizzl_inc: the first years of minecraft don't require a beast pc. just upgrade as your map grows over the years
[0:52:47] migfx: for vanilla id say 16GB yeah and if you get into modded might be even more
[0:52:48] wazza_itwasntme: If you go modded that its16 depending on the type of mods
[0:52:53] Nicklii: you need 16gb? man i bought 32gb /S
[0:52:54] jc_crafty00: i mean for just monecraft an hp laptop will do just fine
[0:52:56] SweetSunnyDream1: @zenologia i know 😊 as soon as you are away from spawn its really not that hard, i just wander around mostly with no problems (if the queue is letting me in that is)
[0:52:58] chinook_a: minecraft doesnt need anything fancy, unless youre doing big stuff with it
[0:53:07] shuntmod: I run on 8GB fine but 16 is recomended
[0:53:13] girlscout224: @piplup_vulpix if you want something that you don't want to build a PC, I loved my Asus Republic of Gamers laptop. It was very expensive though. I didn't know/still don't know anything about building PCs and I lived in 2 locations at the time so I needed to be mobile with it. I was able to raid on WoW and play modded Minecraft public servers on it. I bought it literally 10 years ago. Still works, but I rarely use it
[0:53:21] Grue_bait: Static electricity
[0:53:23] Zehss: i have 16gb of ram its okay but when traveling into new chunks fast with elytra its struggling
[0:53:25] Stormi_Stik: Is it generally cheaper or more expensive to custom build one? like on average because im still making up my mind
[0:53:31] BertPotato: you *can* bend the pins back, but you need to be especially careful
[0:53:36] seibaby: Hellooo! pearlieHeart
[0:53:40] Zenologia: @sweetsunnydream1 yea I used to pay for prio when I was in the mood for it
[0:53:42] azrafdaguy: What are you guys doing in vanilla to need 16gb WutFace
[0:53:45] datguccipoochie: pc parts are like lego parts, except when you step on a pc part you cry because of the money you wasted and not because it hurts!
[0:53:52] Nicklii: well static can damage electronic components but it wont show up for some years
[0:53:53] RCMNexus: I don’t know how it just wasn’t functional when I put it into a brand new pc
[0:54:04] Exirel: And if you have long hair like me: tie up your hair so nothing hang or fall in the wrong place!
[0:54:07] Glitchd_Demigod: @datguccipoochie it still hurts tho
[0:54:12] Kawaiitron_: Timezone! pearlieWave
[0:54:12] noelle_brooke: i have a really old laptop that has 8 gb of ram and installed sodium and lithium mods and the hermitcraft world download has been working pretty well for me
[0:54:17] Headset_Hobo: I'm trained in PC building and  I still get someone else to make them for me
[0:54:23] bigal1978: I struggled with 16GB ram when using playing modded  ‘cause windows 10 and other programs dont leave enough for game to be stable.
[0:54:35] girlscout224: Think of building a PC like an advanced Lego or K'Nex set lol
[0:54:38] chinook_a: @Kawaiitron_ pearlieWave
[0:54:40] wazza_itwasntme: Minecraft is mostly CPU bound but and more ram is recomended if you go modded and GPU you need atleast a GTX 1070 or better
[0:54:43] Piplup_Vulpix: I wouldn’t even know where to start
[0:54:44] Nicklii: low-end computers are cheaper to build yourself, premades tend to put an overkill CPU and then some lowend GPU
[0:54:48] Kawaiitron_: @chinook_a pearlieWave pearlieHeart
[0:55:00] gamingnscience: is HC10 a blind seed again or do you know it already?
[0:55:02] TheOGSpaceDingo: in australia (mainly vic and wa), PLE is a good company that you can order a custom built computer, but they actually do the 'building' themself so you can still choose all your individual settings but dont have to worry about breaking it yourself during construction.
[0:55:03] daimmessi007: I guess watch LTT on how to build a pc
[0:55:05] SweetSunnyDream1: Gotta go back to lurkylurking, work is very worky today pearlieSad have fun you all pearlieHeart
[0:55:08] DiscoBear_PS: or overclocking it
[0:55:18] datguccipoochie: azy?
[0:55:23] datguccipoochie: lazy?*
[0:55:26] girlscout224: @noelle_brooke 8G is good amount of RAM for Minecraft, but I would highly suggest 16gb if you want to go on public servers
[0:55:28] Nicklii: i'd recommend to have a ESD armband when building a computer, cheap insurance
[0:55:33] WhoIsEpikus: About the breaking thing. I'm the only person in the world who can destroy a Nokia 3000
[0:55:39] buzzie107: I built my computer and still have no idea how exactly it works😂😂😂
[0:55:41] datguccipoochie: ah yes good old linus
[0:55:42] alexyap0223: pearlieLOL pearlieLOL pearlieLOL
[0:55:45] haggleslag: getting to 8 million soon bekyaGrab bekyaGrab lets go chatters josoDINKDONK
[0:55:50] Kawaiitron_: I think Licorice is jealous of Parrot and is refusing to get on the bed out of spite. pearlieLOL
[0:55:52] TheOGSpaceDingo: @WhoIsEpikus are you also able to crack bricks by any chance? /lh
[0:55:56] Glitchd_Demigod: Just because someone it trained to do something doesn't mean they trust themselves to do it
[0:55:57] Headset_Hobo: I don't have a lot of disposable income, so on the rare chance  I do break something, I can't afford to replace it. Paying a little extra to have someone else make it covers me for that
[0:55:58] migfx: @girlscout224 8GB is kinda low nowadays with browsers and such taking up so much
[0:56:05] WhoIsEpikus: I have. Sadly
[0:56:15] seibaby: @WhoIsEpikus Not true, the hydraulic press guy also did it LUL
[0:56:20] cardmoney734349: Cheer10 Apologies for the late joke, got held up at the tennis. Now for the joke. Why did the girl throw butter out the window? Because she wanted to see butterfly pearlieLOL
[0:56:21] lunarcloak: for some reason i have such a TERRIBLE record with electronics it's horrific, it's gotten to the point where it's so bad it's funny
[0:56:26] antalia_lotus: i have my gradma to pearlieLOL
[0:56:27] noelle_brooke: @girlscout224 yea i didnt want to get a new laptop/ pc so i am trying to make this on last as long as possible lol
[0:56:30] haggleslag: 8 million SourPls
[0:56:31] Neamow: 8 million points get!
[0:56:34] WhoIsEpikus: @seibaby with a HYDRAULIC PRESS
[0:56:38] thespectrescall: 8gb has always been fine for vanilla for me. I'm upgrading to 16gb for Vault Hunters though.
[0:56:40] BertPotato: I used know someone who could break computers by sitting at them.  I'm convinced he must've emitted some sort of EM interference
[0:56:43] TheOGSpaceDingo: @seibaby *the hydraulic press, commanded by the guy. the guy was still not able to break it so he had to enlist a press.
[0:56:49] garnettgemm: 8 millon!
[0:56:51] secret_agent4706: @cardmoney734349 LUL
[0:56:53] YourieMeow: What is your project
[0:56:55] Stormi_Stik: my cat is mauling my arm lol help
[0:56:57] lags611: I’m actually looking into getting a pc but I’m too scared to build it myself because I don’t know enough about computers🫣
[0:57:04] girlscout224: @migfx true. I haven't gamed on PC very much in the last decade lol my first computer was 8GB and it was able to run WoW and I was on a weekly raid team
[0:57:06] stany_d: @empiricalstorm yeah I can't play vault hunters because of the memory requirement
[0:57:07] Stormi_Stik: im typing with one hand
[0:57:14] WhoIsEpikus: @seibaby bare hands and on accident
[0:57:14] Kawaiitron_: @bertpotato I can hear it now… “EMF 5!”
[0:57:16] faithisonfire1: My uncle offered to help me build my first custom PC, I just gotta save up for the parts lol
[0:57:18] TheOGSpaceDingo: lol
[0:57:24] migfx: @girlscout224 yeah nowadays 8GB is pretty low haha
[0:57:26] tranquil_demon: I just upgraded my motherboard, got to learn the difference between BIOS and UEFI when migrating my drives
[0:57:30] seibaby: couples who game together, stay together
[0:57:37] WhoIsEpikus: @theogspacedingo I did it by hand on accident 😢
[0:57:55] revrich36: It is hard to believe just a couple years ago it was significantly cheaper to buy prebuilt.  Pandemic was horrible on PC parts
[0:58:03] girlscout224: @migfx lol I remember my friends being so jealous over my 16GB of RAM when I bought my Asus ROG 😂 I guess that's probably standard now
[0:58:22] seibaby: never cheap out on power supplies
[0:58:24] sadkitty15: How bad is your sleep schedule
[0:58:24] BertPotato: Reduce -> reuse -> recycle that's the way it should be
[0:58:48] revrich36: comparable or close
[0:58:55] WhoIsEpikus: It's 2300 and I gotta workout
[0:58:59] migfx: @girlscout224 Yeah absolutely 16GB is standard and im even thinking of upgrading to maybe 32 or even 64 to never get bottlenecked again.
[0:59:01] Stormi_Stik: now my cat is sleeping in my armpit
[0:59:06] Nightbot:  Follow Pearl in all the places: https://www.youtube.com/pearlescentmoon  https://twitter.com/PearlescentMoon https://www.instagram.com/pearlescentmoo/
[0:59:07] datguccipoochie: one of these days when i'm not in school and broke i'll be able to build my own computer
[0:59:11] WhoIsEpikus: Imma watch and workout
[0:59:13] chaotic_sage: chaotic_sage subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 20 months! Hello! Happy new year!
[0:59:24] WhoIsEpikus: @stormi_stik I have to see that lmao
[0:59:27] azrafdaguy: Does anyone remember how many channel points naming an animal used to be? I want to save for when it comes back
[0:59:29] revrich36: It was hard to get parts as individuals.  Companies who build them had a better time getting them
[0:59:34] Stormi_Stik: @datguccipoochie same lol
[0:59:37] wazza_itwasntme: thay mostly skimp out on the RAM and PSU with pre build
[0:59:37] Nightbot:  Join the discord: https://discord.gg/pearlescentmoon
[0:59:38] Kawaiitron_: @stormi_stik My kitten is comfy under my blanket. Licorice was under it earlier, but right now he’s sulking on the floor, cleaning himself. pearlieLOL
[0:59:39] BertPotato: beware though, some pre-builds are less extensible than you might want
[0:59:42] sapphicwhimsy: me getting a prebuilt computer and not realizing it has 500gb of storage
[0:59:43] Exirel: I didn't follow: what's that path for?
[0:59:46] Piplup_Vulpix: omg I just looked outside there is snow on the ground lol guess I’m staying home lol ❄️
[0:59:48] visionszd: yeah like lower speed memory is common on prebuilts, because people mostly look for memory size only
[0:59:50] datguccipoochie: @Kawaiitron_ KITTY
[0:59:54] seibaby: @wazza_itwasntme two of the most important parts
[1:00:01] Nightbot:  Don't become a french fry, be a good potato, remember to follow the stream!
[1:00:18] girlscout224: @bertpotato doesn't work well with PC parts though. Wear and tear and outdated components
[1:00:19] BertPotato: Some companies use proprietary power supplies/cases so you need to be aware of it
[1:00:21] sapphicwhimsy: yeah i got a harddrive for it lol
[1:00:23] Stormi_Stik: @kawaiitron_ cats sure love to sulk
[1:00:25] Nightbot:  Don't be a dry potato, remember to stay hydrated!
[1:00:27] seibaby: Not if you only play 20 year old games or indie darlings ;P
[1:00:37] YourieMeow: Hii pearlescentMoon
[1:00:40] Zigordion: Got a prebuilt pc without any fans in it. It was unusable playing harder games in the summer
[1:00:43] DraconicDetective: omg i got a pc to play sea of thieves specifically and i planned my purchase around the games requirements and i swear to goodness it hates it … im too scared to build and know nothing about parts OTL
[1:00:52] TheOGSpaceDingo: SSDs are great but are more expensive.
[1:00:53] castlebeki: hi pearlieHeart
[1:01:01] Exirel: NVME M2 are cheaper now.
[1:01:02] TwinkleTues: SSDs for quality storage and HDDs for bulk storage
[1:01:03] datguccipoochie: SSDs are pretty much better in every way if you can pay for them
[1:01:09] WhoIsEpikus: "if you're a gamer you'll..." If you're me you'll overload it instantaneously with stuff you know you'll never use or look at
[1:01:10] BertPotato: @girlscout224 It does, but it depends on the original quality of the parts.  I'm using my old gaming machine as a development machine.  and the second hand parts market is thriving
[1:01:12] terkk18: the less moving parts the better ssd for the win
[1:01:13] migfx: @TheOGSpaceDingo prices are becoming pretty acessible pretty fast tbh
[1:01:23] Headset_Hobo: I have a 1tb M.2 for my OS and Games, a 2tb SSD for secondary storage, then a 4tb HDD for archived storage
[1:01:32] alexyap0223: pearlieHype
[1:01:37] MaraudingBacon: MaraudingBacon subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 29 months! Hello. No time to watch today but I have to say hi and feed the warden tax.
[1:01:40] kamitsu_jaffa: SSDs are starting to get cheaper, recommend M.2 drives
[1:01:41] wazza_itwasntme: SSD's work for quick storrage but costs more that a HDD with alot more space
[1:01:41] azrafdaguy: @theogspacedingo SSD prices have dropped a lot over the past few years, lower end ones are comparable in price to HDDs I think
[1:01:44] TheOGSpaceDingo: the difference between HDDs and SSDs is that HDDs still use moving parts and a literal disc as opposed to SSDs which are completely digital which is great for maintenence.
[1:01:46] Sparcles5: Hi everyone pearlieHeart
[1:01:53] Kawaiitron_: @sparcles5 pearlieWave pearlieHeart
[1:01:56] zsigmons1: Also make sure you get a quality SSD, lot less likely to break and leave you without your data
[1:01:56] BertPotato: memory prices seem reasonable atm
[1:02:04] preparedman: @sparcles5 o/
[1:02:05] thespectrescall: My 256gb storage laptop was a significant downgrade to my previous 1tb one. It is an SSD though, and the old one was a HDD. Still struggling for storage though.
[1:02:06] Sparcles5: @Kawaiitron_ Hi Kawaiitron!! pearlieWave pearlieHeart pearlieHeart
[1:02:06] Piplup_Vulpix: what is Australia Day? just saw it on my calendar lol
[1:02:15] Stormi_Stik: i cant send a pic of my kitty bc its pitch black in here
[1:02:16] seibaby: I will never go back to spinning discs
[1:02:17] JammerZella: ssds & nvme's are going up in price recently
[1:02:21] Sparcles5: @preparedman hi preparedman!! o/ pearlieHeart
[1:02:24] BertPotato: Are you talking about M.2. SSDs?
[1:02:28] doxisontwitchnow: I'm looking into gaming laptops bc space is premium in my tiny apt. Doing lots of research first though
[1:02:29] datguccipoochie: i would rather have a stroke than replace one of those
[1:02:30] TheOGSpaceDingo: @migfx @azrafdaguy okie cool i havent looked into pcs since getting my now 2yo rig (still great) so i wasn't aware
[1:02:30] girlscout224: @bertpotato example, I would have kept my Google Pixel 4 that I spent far too much money buying for longer if a repair shop didn't break the microphone, rendering it useless as a phone lol. So I gave it to my kids to play some games on. I have my ancient iPhones and sometimes power them up for my old old old music playlists lol before music streaming.
[1:02:32] BertPotato: you get SATA SSDs also
[1:02:32] Headset_Hobo: DDR4 has gone down a lot as DDR5 becomes more common, but unless you are doing top end processing DDR5 is a waste of money
[1:02:50] Exirel: If you have HDD for archive, consider specific brands and range for that usage.
[1:02:50] DolphinJersey: Recently got the ssd in my latop upgraded by a local tech shop, was very comparable in price to doing it myself and a long time since I've done something like that. Was well worth it.
[1:03:11] BertPotato: @girlscout224 That's a phone, not a PC.  If you want recyclability you can get modular phones but you take a risk on them
[1:03:12] chaotic_sage: Even plugged in ssds that connect using USBC are faster than HDDS in my experience
[1:03:14] buzzie107: I got a 2TB SSD and still think I need more sortage now😅
[1:03:16] migfx: yeah graphics are huge xD
[1:03:17] Exirel: Like Seagate Iron Wolf HDD are dedicated to Archive/NAS storage.
[1:03:17] WhoIsEpikus: @piplup_vulpix Australia Day, the day of Aussies playing backyard cricket, chucking snags on the Barbie, playing thong throwing competitions and filling up on dog's eyes (pies in UK English)
[1:03:19] bookworm2692: @Piplup_Vulpix anniversary of when the british invaded australia in 1777 or 1788 or somewhere around then
[1:03:40] Neamow: I cannot believe how massive GPUs have gotten in the past 2 genereations
[1:03:46] migfx: yeah the 40 series is stupid looking
[1:03:48] BertPotato: I'm still running a 2080ti, it's been working solidly for me in every game
[1:03:55] TheOGSpaceDingo: @WhoIsEpikus lmao as an aussie, can confirm 100%
[1:04:02] seibaby: Pearl, in what way are you most looking forward to challenging yourself in HC season 10?
[1:04:03] Piplup_Vulpix: @bookworm2692 oh ok, that sound interesting
[1:04:05] datguccipoochie: it gets me wondering, at what point will our chips get so small that it's actually a problem?
[1:04:11] TheOGSpaceDingo: wait gpus are up to 40 series?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?
[1:04:19] BertPotato: Given the way nVidia is heading, it seems likely that I'll be switching to AMD gfx for my next purchase
[1:04:19] girlscout224: @bertpotato oh yes, of course. Outdated parts can be reused for other uses. My gaming PC is outdated for gaming but it's still really useful when I need to do writing projects and taxes hahaha
[1:04:27] migfx: @TheOGSpaceDingo i think the 50 series is actually on the way
[1:04:27] shark_monty: What's your plans for world domination? :3
[1:04:28] alexyap0223: pearlieYes
[1:04:32] WhoIsEpikus: @theogspacedingo I started a tradition. Fly swatting comp, who gets most fly unalives wins
[1:04:33] chinook_a: i love seeing more mini games!
[1:04:35] TheOGSpaceDingo: @migfx W H A T ? !
[1:04:35] Sparcles5: would love to see more minigames pearlieHeart
[1:04:39] Kawaiitron_: Licorice finally stopped sulking and jumped onto the bed for some loves! pearlieLOL
[1:04:43] Stormi_Stik: pearl minigames :]
[1:04:44] preparedman: Will you bring back the map puzzle building?
[1:04:46] TheOGSpaceDingo: @WhoIsEpikus lmaoooooooooooooooo im goated at that...
[1:04:46] Stormi_Stik: Yeyyyu
[1:04:47] pancake_lover_333: i loved scars charity stream it brought hermits together and for a good cause
[1:04:48] Sparcles5: BINGOO
[1:04:50] WhoIsEpikus: @shark_monty well... Firstly I will...
[1:05:03] siesie123: Hey Pearl, l have minecraft bedrock and java on my laptop l dont know how to put mods on but l really want mods but dont know how to download them on it
[1:05:03] Stormi_Stik: BINGOOOOO
[1:05:07] domenator9995: Why has Grian not streamed since 2016?
[1:05:25] BertPotato: @domenator9995 Why don't you ask him?
[1:05:37] domenator9995: Ok
[1:05:56] alexyap0223: pearlieLOL
[1:05:57] WhoIsEpikus: @siesie123 websites
[1:05:58] BertPotato: I don't blame him, chat is weird
[1:05:59] doxisontwitchnow: he has, very very very rarely
[1:06:01] migfx: @migfx yeah i read somewehere ppl talking about 2025
[1:06:01] shark_monty: @whoisepikus not you, I'm asking pearl she has the influence and intelligence to.
[1:06:02] preparedman: He does mcc sometimes
[1:06:04] flappetyflippers: Grian streams MCC
[1:06:05] secret_agent4706: @domenator9995 he has, on his yt channel for mcc I think
[1:06:06] bookworm2692: @domenator9995 he has streamed on youtube since then...
[1:06:06] seibaby: I suspect Grian is too scatterbrained to stream comfortably :p
[1:06:10] WhoIsEpikus: @domenator9995 he did on yt
[1:06:10] Headset_Hobo: He has streamed. He streams when he is in MCC, but only on YT
[1:06:15] Neamow: I for one welcome our new pearlescent overlords
[1:06:17] Sparcles5: indeed! pearlieLOL
[1:06:18] DolphinJersey: If the hermit you mentioned with similar ideas is the one who announced something similar on Friday would love if you did a least something together S10, you'd work great togther.
[1:06:19] garnettgemm: exactly
[1:06:28] sapphicwhimsy: except for etho
[1:06:30] shark_monty: Hmm fair
[1:06:31] bookworm2692: etho being an exception
[1:06:35] Riff_Raff_: unless you're Etho :p
[1:06:38] mattie321: @domenator9995 grian has streamed some empire crossover last i saw
[1:06:39] doxisontwitchnow: Zed
[1:06:41] DolphinJersey: Zedsph
[1:06:43] haggleslag: pearl, grian, false, pete team for next MCC vqueen1Pray pete, false, and grian have always made it to DB when teamed, it's the ticket to your first MCC win
[1:06:45] Neamow: Zed's hermit olympics
[1:06:52] chinook_a: last time he streamed hermitcraft, he argued with chat (in a loving manner it was all jokes) LUL pearlieHeart
[1:06:56] Piplup_Vulpix: 5am Pearl is so ready for word domination lol
[1:07:04] BertPotato: No-one has said any dates so far afaik
[1:07:14] flappetyflippers: I just watched the double life song (great btw) and yeah, 5am Pearl could take over the world
[1:07:18] DolphinJersey: He was planning mini game streams from Hermitcraft
[1:07:18] shark_monty: I'm attempting to plant the idea of world domination in every hermit i come across lol
[1:07:18] TheOGSpaceDingo: @chinook_a wait was that him doubling back on calling chat liers when betrayed by server lag?
[1:07:21] toastboi22: cub telling us it's not starting for a year was the best
[1:07:24] theeDoctor10: @BertPotato Cub said April 22 2025
[1:07:27] BertPotato: Because you made it *massive*
[1:07:29] preparedman: It still hasn't ended in a way
[1:07:29] BaldBover: I think Zed just said that he's planning on doing the mini games thing for HC10 too.
[1:07:32] girlscout224: @seibaby he'd be late to every stream because he'd be too busy washing his trees and repotting his fake plants lol
[1:07:32] doxisontwitchnow: Cub had been trolling. it's been very amusing
[1:07:33] chinook_a: @TheOGSpaceDingo YES LUL LUL
[1:07:38] Kanavitas: is gonna be good!
[1:07:39] antalia_lotus: pearlieLOL pearlieLOL
[1:07:39] Sparcles5: pearlieLOL
[1:07:40] BertPotato: @theeDoctor10  No one has been serious about dates so far afaik
[1:07:43] pancake_lover_333: we want a funky cinematic tho
[1:07:44] TheOGSpaceDingo: @chinook_a lmao i remember that clip in his ep lmaooooo

[1:07:53] bookworm2692: @BaldBover impulse has also said he wants to do minigames
[1:07:56] sapphicwhimsy: false ALSO said similar
[1:07:59] Neamow: S10: Season of minigames confirmed?
[1:08:13] secret_agent4706: @voxkeys Bye! Gn
[1:08:17] Kawaiitron_: Shamrock10 Random, but thoughts on The Sims? Mortimer Goth was mean to my cat, so I burned his family and forced him to paint for me forever. Never be mean to my cat. pearlieLOL
[1:08:18] Zehss: Cub's chaos game XD
[1:08:18] blueguineapig78: There were a number of not-at-all-mini games :D
[1:08:18] chinook_a: season 9 had so much interactive stuff, it mightve been my favourite so far
[1:08:18] GaspsHiChat: minigames are so cool and i love how much it brings the hermits together
[1:08:21] Sparcles5: I love when you all play minigames pearlieHeart lots of fun interactions
[1:08:23] kazriel_: return of minigame district???
[1:08:35] migfx: im so excited to see you guys all together again and having fun and i love that quite a few of the hermits are thinking of playing more with eachother rather than building exclusively
[1:08:38] Neamow: @kazriel_ all map is a minigame district! pearlieLOL
[1:08:42] preparedman: Back I'm season 4 or 5 (I don't remember) they had a minigame district with everyone's minigames
[1:08:42] datguccipoochie: based (literally)
[1:08:42] lags611: do you have ideas about what your S10 base design will be?
[1:08:45] GaspsHiChat: @kawaiitron_ honestly mortimer deserved that
[1:08:46] antalia_lotus: yes we love it pearlieHeart pearlieHeart pearlieWoo pearlieWoo
[1:08:47] shark_monty: Next season will be full of minigames for the first half then someone will make a decked out 2 and the rest of the server will be playing except for the last two months
[1:08:50] girlscout224: Season6 minigames era was amazing. Season 9 had a lot of big games that took a long time. The gaming districts of HC are some of the best parts. Mini or major.
[1:08:52] Stormi_Stik: what are the odds of a chicken spawning from an egg in java again?
[1:08:55] Nightbot:  Be respectful - No spamming - No advertising - English only

[1:09:07] BaldBover: Yeah.  No spoilers.
[1:09:08] tyry95: My server started on one island with a world barrier for the first 2 months
[1:09:15] bookworm2692: @Stormi_Stik 1 in 8 iirc

[1:09:51] toastboi22: base bros
[1:09:55] BaldBover: You should collab with Skizzleman!
[1:09:56] PathaGenic: Several Hermitopias hahha
[1:10:01] Wallubo: hi pearl im back
[1:10:01] Neamow: base up with a redstoner, they can build farms, you can make them pretty!
[1:10:02] seibaby: I think several hermits have teased S10 will feature lots of collabs or teaming up and I love that
[1:10:02] Piplup_Vulpix: soup group 2.0
[1:10:02] eorilia_music: Hermitopia 2.0
[1:10:05] NeverEatPearss: 👀👀
[1:10:05] alexyap0223: pearlieExcited pearlieExcited pearlieExcited
[1:10:05] antalia_lotus: oooo pearlieExcited
[1:10:06] jasper_186: Pearl+Doc+VintageBeef Colab?
[1:10:07] haggleslag: josoBLANKIES

[1:10:15] migfx: ohh so cool i love when you interact with everyone you, Gem and doc are my favs its ablast to see you have fun
[1:10:16] cremation2204: Soup group
[1:10:17] shark_monty: I think it'd be cool to get every member to contribute to it in some place lol
[1:10:17] jasper_186: worldwide base
[1:10:25] flappetyflippers: Soup group and boatem having collaborative bases have been some of the best parts of their respective seasons!
[1:10:26] alexyap0223: pearlieYes
[1:10:29] kazriel_: my favourite part of new season is the brand new themes and dynamics eeeeeeeeeee
[1:10:31] castlebeki: just build a base at spawn and ban beds XD
[1:10:36] mattie321: i have thougth about just letting Scar and Pearl do terraforming and let the other hermits build in it
[1:10:37] secret_agent4706: Yeah would love to see something like the Boatem group or soup group
[1:10:38] FairyOrchidMC: Even if you do not get anyone, Cub will just live in your basement
[1:10:39] bookworm2692: so many people at the end of s9 were so inspired by the soup group trio of bases!!! so this is exciting to hear from you!
[1:10:40] Stormi_Stik: @bookworm2692 imagine a minigame where you stand on a trapdoor and you throw 8 eggs at a pressure plate, you get a chicken, you die. but if you dont get a chicken then you win an amount of diamonds
[1:10:41] cardmoney734349: I enjoy watching collabs
[1:10:43] NeverEatPearss: that sounds so much fun
[1:10:45] pancake_lover_333: if its impulse youll be with him 3 seasons in a row...
[1:10:47] castlebeki: hermit visits guaranteed
[1:10:48] sugeyyyyyyyy: i really loved the big eyes crew base in Season 8, would lvoe to see more hermtis base togethe
[1:10:50] girlscout224: I'd love to see a future season where there is a shopping district at spawn, and then a donut around the shopping district of bases housing minigames like Cub's Target 🎯
[1:10:54] datguccipoochie: imagine grian just builds his face into your build and dips
[1:11:00] meowmmin: YESS COLLABS
[1:11:12] girlscout224: Cub's pyramid* sorry Target was one of the games lol
[1:11:13] meowmmin: I LOVE COLLABS !!
[1:11:16] shark_monty: @datguccipoochie i bet ya that will
[1:11:18] migfx: haha the formation of the soup group keeps bringing me to those first few episodes of all you 3 i just love it
[1:11:29] meowmmin: @datguccipoochie OMG LOLLL
[1:11:32] kspykrmstrabdonutnistalga: yoooo I pearl im here late cause I wanted chips so I’m making chips
[1:11:35] castlebeki: i would love to see an X and Pearl collab
[1:11:36] bookworm2692: soup group was the best part of s9
[1:11:37] chinook_a: ive only heard hermits say this: i want to collab more
[1:11:37] alw72354: Pearl/Etho collab would be amazing.
[1:11:37] blueguineapig78: You also need to play at the same time, so timezones can make certain teams difficult.
[1:11:43] WhoIsEpikus: As Grian said tho, you, Gem and Impulse have very different style but still made it work
[1:11:47] Stormi_Stik: is it weird that i keep imagining life series scenarios that would be cool that are very very specific
[1:11:49] Kawaiitron_: @datguccipoochie That’s a Grian thing. pearlieLOL
[1:11:53] sushiloveryay: life series is designed for interesting interactions though
[1:11:58] Piplup_Vulpix: if there are new hermits it would be interesting to see how changes things
[1:12:00] daimmessi007: Giga Base
[1:12:04] meowmmin: I hope you look for someone to collab with :>
[1:12:05] snowystar122: i cant believe youre on your third season already
[1:12:14] gamingnscience: i admit I have a hard time seeing you baseing with Hypno or xB
[1:12:14] datguccipoochie: grain is a funny little creature
[1:12:17] girlscout224: Pearl, I think you and Zedaph would have really great collab ideas. You're both in Australia as well so the time zones would be less of a problem
[1:12:24] Neamow: hermits not being hermits??? pearlieLOL
[1:12:28] eorilia_music: Scars country road idea is perfect!
[1:12:29] alexyap0223: pearlieYes pearlieYes pearlieYes
[1:12:30] bookworm2692: many many hermits were inspired by soup group, so maybe more likely for more touching bases
[1:12:30] migfx: i loved that your styles were different the contrast made all your bases better
[1:12:33] chinook_a: walking through the soup group base was SO fun, it never ended!
[1:12:35] kazriel_: yyyeeess
[1:12:35] kittykid9133: Make a giant pizza
[1:12:37] SKYESIE: double decker couch!

[1:12:43] Kawaiitron_: @eorilia_music Country Roooooooads!
[1:12:45] TwinkleTues: New HermitTowers
[1:12:45] sapphicwhimsy: touch elbows sometimes, it wont kill ya
[1:12:46] Nicklii: that statement reminds me of aque town in season 7
[1:12:47] Code4Coffee: Shanty town time?
[1:12:47] jasper_186: oh, so like ZombieCleo and Lizzy? /s
[1:12:50] iceberg_slim_bk: well u can count xB out.
[1:12:51] datguccipoochie: @SKYESIE lego movie?
[1:12:57] seibaby: @kittykid9133 building Midgar in MC would be so awesome
[1:12:58] MartPlaysStuff: I must say, a very touching subject indeed
[1:12:58] flappetyflippers: I think soup group worked so well because they were all so different but flowed really well
[1:13:02] WhoIsEpikus: Someone said on an Impulse vid, season 7 Grian made a mini base in Impulse Mega base but in 9 Impulse made a mega basement in Gem's megabase
[1:13:05] kspykrmstrabdonutnistalga: lightning vibes rn
[1:13:06] castlebeki: yeah hermits were very impressed by soup group base, I think this will have an impact on season 10
[1:13:07] kazriel_: and the base lore that comes from that is awesome too
[1:13:09] cremation2204: Soup group again would be amazing
[1:13:13] numbermore: you should have the next hermitcraft season that you can only build in a chunk next to a built chunk. Whoever built on that other chunk
[1:13:14] nerditation: in season 4 iskall's cave accidentally connected to X's
[1:13:17] alexyap0223: pearlieLOL
[1:13:23] numbermore: automatic constant collabs!
[1:13:27] WhoIsEpikus: Pearl, you are truly inspirational, greatest Hermit, God bless
[1:13:30] migfx: @castlebeki yes everyone complimented it so much it felt like a big impact

[1:16:21] NeverEatPearss: seeing the names of blocks gives it away a bit though?
[1:16:23] Glitchd_Demigod: Katherine does a lot of that sort of thing
[1:16:26] snowystar122: imp and skizz podcast episodes?????
[1:16:27] elaphant66: pearlieHeart

[1:16:53] GaspsHiChat: @secret_agent4706 OMG YES i've been thinking about her on the podcast for weeks
[1:16:55] narucrafter1234: Hi pearl
[1:16:57] sushiloveryay: i think there was a trend of using an all white texture pack i think
[1:17:00] alexyap0223: What you do, we will like it
[1:17:03] anastasiaice1: Could do it with a different texture pack too from vanilla to add to the challenge because some texure packs change the colours slightly too
[1:17:06] greenlander64: Hi
[1:17:07] WhoIsEpikus: I made a minigame. You have two minecarts, same direction one track. Each player gets a well enchanted bow and gets in a minecart, lots of turns and speed, they have to try shoot eachother
[1:17:08] datguccipoochie: it's a grayt idea
[1:17:20] Sparcles5: I think it sounds fun! you should go for it!
[1:17:21] Nicklii: pearlescentmoon, when doing long recording sessions like when lot happens on the first day of server opens
[1:17:26] Stormi_Stik: you have no idea how excited i was when i saw you grian and impulse appear on jimmys christmas town build
[1:17:28] pancake_lover_333: what would you do with the names of blocks
[1:17:30] WhoIsEpikus: Idk, I blew up in a few days
[1:17:34] tyry95: You have that one song stuck in your head huh?
[1:17:49] Stormi_Stik: @pancake_lover_333 blur them prob
[1:17:49] pinksox_: traditional art challenge would be fun too!
[1:17:58] blueguineapig78: For block names, just change to   another language
[1:17:59] Piplup_Vulpix: is there a mod that hides the names of blocks?
[1:18:01] lags611: of course there are things in Minecraft that haven’t been done, because Minecraft is unique since there are invite things you can do or build!
[1:18:03] elaphant66: how close have you gotten to death
[1:18:03] preparedman: as long as you’re not quitting like everyone else on yt pearlieSad pearlieSad pearlieSad pearlieSad
[1:18:14] Exirel: 5 is wide but it allows 3 blocks to travel, and then 1 block on each side for decoration.
[1:18:18] pancake_lover_333: @blueguineapig78 smart
[1:18:24] RCMNexus: @preparedman I don’t think we’re losing Pearl for a good while
[1:18:26] elaphant66: that’s lucky
[1:18:31] datguccipoochie: wugh im gonna go the flu is actually killing me rn, cya
[1:18:38] Sparcles5: pearlieHeart pearlieHeart pearlieHeart pearlieHeart
[1:18:42] BertPotato: Other than the skeleton wrangling I don't recall seeing a lot of damage
[1:18:45] chinook_a: were all gonna be 80 and grey and watching pearl
[1:18:47] kaes_100: You could build your drawings in minecraft as a video
[1:18:48] RCMNexus: @datguccipoochie bye bye
[1:18:59] preparedman: did you yawn to the song or was that my imagination? pearlieLOL
[1:19:00] Nightbot:  Join the discord: https://discord.gg/pearlescentmoon

[1:19:18] BaristaSimmer: how annoying
[1:19:20] Nightbot:  Don't be a dry potato, remember to stay hydrated!
[1:19:25] secret_agent4706: Heard that twitch has been  struggling a little bit in getting profits
[1:19:27] shark_monty: Oh i just had the idea to make like blank slate houses like a canvas in like a town and other people could decorate them and colour them in or something like that
[1:19:27] girlscout224: @datguccipoochie awww get better!!
[1:19:33] Stormi_Stik: not me lol i am constantly checking your channel so you definitely appear when you upload
[1:19:33] chinook_a: youtube does that with sausage for me, i look him up and miss 2 episodes all of the sudden
[1:19:34] cattootler: Yeah the strain to keep on producing content to appease the algorithm - not conducive to good mental health
[1:19:36] shark_monty: Youtube twitch both should be dead
[1:19:40] Nightbot: Remember to check out the Frequently Asked Questions (#faq) channel on discord!
[1:19:41] RCMNexus: that happened to me with your limited life finale I got spoiled before I even knew it was out pearlieSad
[1:19:41] Neamow: do people not use the subscriptions tab? I've never I've never missed an upload there, it seems only the Home tab being kinda random
[1:19:43] seibaby: wait, your subscriber feed doesn't list all videos from your subs as they come out? :/
[1:19:46] DeltaAvenue: i only watch youtube videos in my subscribtions tab
[1:19:47] shark_monty: It's a miracle they're still afloat
[1:19:50] migfx: yeah thats been years
[1:19:55] Glitchd_Demigod: I haven't gotten a notif for someone I'm actually subbed to in years I just manually check now
[1:19:58] lunarcloak: it's part of the layoffs, it sucks
[1:20:00] Nightbot:  Be respectful - No spamming - No advertising - English only
[1:20:02] DanielJNewman: :( my friends wife was laid off
[1:20:06] TwinkleTues: i wanna get back to using the subscriptions page instead of recommended, but i have 12-13 years of subs ;~;
[1:20:07] chaotic_sage: @preparedman I didn't even realise she did yawn xp
[1:20:09] castlebeki: it's also that notifications are set to "custom" by default, so you are not guaranteed all the notifications right?
[1:20:22] Stormi_Stik: Being in acdt time i would constantly stay up til 10:30-11 waiting for your secret life episode then watch yours the moment it appears
[1:20:23] seibaby: @Neamow I ONLY use the subscriptions tab because I refuse to turn on watch history
[1:20:27] shark_monty: You sure?
[1:20:27] siesie123: Im currently playing minecraft bedwars while watching this
[1:20:38] Sparcles5: oh nooo
[1:20:46] paperbird76: If youtube was more likeable I would'nt even mind paying for it .
[1:20:53] shark_monty: Oh okay
[1:20:56] chinook_a: awww, hearing a lot of people getting layed off lately its so stressfull
[1:21:08] shark_monty: I forgot lmao
[1:21:09] chaotic_sage: @paperbird76  true!
[1:21:12] Neamow: @TwinkleTues don't be afraid to unsubscribe, it happens
[1:21:13] musicfreaklol: Hi!<3
[1:21:14] Kawaiitron_: Do Nugget and Olive ever break into their treats? I went downstairs for 5 minutes to get a drink, and when I come back upstairs, I find the treat container on the ground with the lid off, treats spilling everywhere. pearliePalm
[1:21:38] Zigordion: I exclusively use the subscription tab
[1:21:38] WhoIsEpikus: I'm gonna build a 1:1 scale Australia in mc while watching this no world edit
[1:21:39] Duckable_: i just use the notification tab, and then put everything i wanna watch into watch later to.. watch later :P
[1:21:41] lunarcloak: who are you awtching right now then?
[1:21:42] TwinkleTues: @Neamow It's not fear, it's time. I need to purge my feed but it's going to take so long
[1:21:43] BertPotato: recommended keeps suggesting things I have no interest in or things I've already watched, I ignore it
[1:21:43] RCMNexus: @kawaiitron_ my dog treat box was opened this morning I feel that pain
[1:21:49] lillacbeloved: hello!
[1:21:49] migfx: yeah usually im on recommended i even disabled shorts and such cuz i dont wanna see those
[1:21:50] finnthefrogkid: honestly same
[1:21:52] kyunghki: I do the same
[1:21:55] cattootler: yeah I check the channels because otherwise I can miss stuff so easily
[1:21:55] Kawaiitron_: Cats are scheming geniuses. Parrot was the only one upstairs, so she must’ve done it. She’s only a kitten and she’s already a mastermind!
[1:22:00] devsea_: i try have a sub clear out every year
[1:22:05] Stormi_Stik: not me who watches everybodys life series episode in the morning on my way to writing club
[1:22:08] elaphant66: YouTube should promote smaller creators more often
[1:22:09] chinook_a: same, too many subs that i dont watch regularly
[1:22:20] GaspsHiChat: wait omg you can turn off shorts ???
[1:22:20] finnthefrogkid: i watch like two people and just rewatch the heck out of them
[1:22:24] Duckable_: i need more 15 hour video essays
[1:22:24] Neamow: @TwinkleTues unsubscribe all and resubscribe only to the channels you really want
[1:22:26] shark_monty: @elaphant66 they have been actually
[1:22:28] WhoIsEpikus: @stormi_stik w
[1:22:32] migfx: shorts are a time waster and if you click one your whole recommended is ruined
[1:22:33] bee1234567891: i'll scroll through my recommended but i always rely on my sub box tbh
[1:22:34] lags611: meanwhile I’m subscribed to 120 channels 💀
[1:22:35] castlebeki: i feel like recently, recommended finally understood what i like, it just recommends my subscriptions lol
[1:22:36] seibaby: I love docs 1 hour HC videos
[1:22:39] Stormi_Stik: @whoisepikus why thank you
[1:22:40] chinook_a: still love long form content, makes my heart happy
[1:22:41] UrbanAri50: You can press and hold on your youtube app, and place a shortcut for Subscriptions. This is what I use to bypass recommendations
[1:22:47] finnthefrogkid: the shorts for the kids who cant get tiktok at this point😔😕
[1:22:52] BaldBover: Yes!  Size does not matter!  Confirmed!
[1:22:53] eavolve: I have the Hermitcraft website permanently open in a tab in my browser. Check it every day. Even out of season.
[1:22:54] cattootler: shorts on YouTube are just a way to compete with tik-tok, imo
[1:22:55] kyunghki: I watch some longer videos and shorts as a intro for longer video
[1:22:57] eorilia_music: I use a custom filter extension. Categorizes channels how I want, I have a Hermitcraft tab for all that shows instantly when someone uploads a new vid
[1:22:59] TwinkleTues: @Neamow then i need to make a list of which creators i want to resub to, which means sorting through the list anyway
[1:22:59] doxisontwitchnow: about 30-45 minutes is a sweet spot for me. consumable during my lunch break
[1:23:02] girlscout224: I just throw everything that looks interesting on a playlist to watch when I have time lol every few years I go through it and see what's still unwatched and if I've lost interest in it then I delete the playlist and start with a fresh one.
[1:23:07] x_clace_x: Is Lizzy Alive?
[1:23:07] migfx: @GaspsHiChat i did with an extension called enhancer for youtube
[1:23:10] ciciplayingmc: i usually dont have the attention span to watch long videos but the other day i watched a whole mcc vod in one go
[1:23:18] Luna__tik: I just prefer longer content, especially cause it allows me to vibes and possibly listen / watch while doing something else, like now, im technically "at work" well remote working, while vibing here. And if there isn't a stream, longer video does the same purpose, it's better than.. short videos or shorts imo
[1:23:24] shark_monty: Big Chunks of people are starting to get sick of shortform and others don't
[1:23:24] miracleasl: I really hope you and Grian hang out more next season pearlieHeart Skybling duo pearlieHeart
[1:23:30] ciciplayingmc: i get lots of smaller creators recommended
[1:23:32] finnthefrogkid: fr
[1:23:33] x_clace_x: LDShadowLady?
[1:23:35] devsea_: give me an hour video and i gobble it up
[1:23:36] Neamow: have you guys noticed that youtube seems to have started to always put one video in the recommendations on the side that is from a super small creator and only has a handful of views? seems always super random but I kinda appreciate the thought
[1:23:38] Rrrayven: Hello!!!
[1:23:39] DanielJNewman: I like the long ones I listen while i play video games
[1:23:42] kyunghki: I like 20 mins
[1:23:43] SKYESIE: queen elizabeth OBV
[1:23:46] BaristaSimmer: And I enjoyed it
[1:23:49] migfx: i loved your episode sooo good
[1:23:50] chinook_a: @x_clace_x shes just not active rn, shes okay
[1:23:50] preparedman: a good hour though
[1:23:54] annay_bff: Hi
[1:23:56] L1ncolnFPS: I just died in hc to a stalagmite g1ngeCrying
[1:23:58] cattootler: so was your first HC episode over an hour tbf gtwsLol
[1:24:02] herbertthecow1: why would she not be
[1:24:05] emchmu: weirdly i only started getting small creators recommended after i started making content myself XD
[1:24:07] alexyap0223: I first saw you is in YouTube pearlieLOL
[1:24:09] finnthefrogkid: we havent seen lizze for a while is she ok?
[1:24:10] radiation_zone10yti: gm
[1:24:11] x_clace_x: true
[1:24:28] devsea_: why would you jump to death if someone hasnt posted 😭
[1:24:31] WhoIsEpikus: Agreed. So many small creators pour their hearts and souls into videos and then you have huge creators that just do little effort, a couple words or they just get clips from other people for their own work
[1:24:35] Nicklii: last i heard joel said she has been decorating their new house
[1:24:43] NeverEatPearss: I think Lizzie is partly struggling with bad internet
[1:24:46] cattootler: I loved those episodes but that's just me gtwsLol
[1:24:47] TheOGSpaceDingo: Huh... meanwhile DocM77 intensifies...
[1:24:52] PeterpleRabbit: @finnthefrogkid she was just in secret life??
[1:24:53] chalky574: i adore your longer videos but i understand
[1:24:56] TheOGSpaceDingo: I personally prefer the feature films.
[1:25:00] emchmu: doc makes documentary sized ocntent and i love it
[1:25:00] miracleasl: booo to anyone that said that
[1:25:01] Stormi_Stik: @nevereatpearss understandable
[1:25:02] Glitchd_Demigod: Yeah docs just getting longer
[1:25:02] sapphicwhimsy: i love the long videos!
[1:25:06] ciciplayingmc: i prefer watching smaller creators most of time
[1:25:07] Stormi_Stik: I too suffer from bad internet
[1:25:08] BaristaSimmer: @TheOGSpaceDingo Himself and his videos lol
[1:25:10] cursed_hyacinth: I loved those episode lengths pearl, but I understand pearlieHugs
[1:25:11] Kanavitas: huh
[1:25:11] chinook_a: i could watch hours of your building, but i get people just want to see the build and boom be done
[1:25:11] girlscout224: I love long form videos 🥹 I watch YouTube when I'm doing my chores so having to choose a new video less often is preferable
[1:25:13] migfx: yeah you shortened the videos i personally love longer videos especially if its yours, Gem'S or DOC since impulse doesnt do long videos
[1:25:14] shark_monty: Pearl I'm curious will there be a new member of hermitcraft next season or have their been thoughts of candidates?
[1:25:16] blueguineapig78: There's more than one there I think
[1:25:19] finnthefrogkid: hey im new here and i think your rly cool and fun to watch. keep doing what your doing😋
[1:25:20] Luna__tik: iron farm LOL xD
[1:25:21] Kanavitas: why they there
[1:25:22] blueguineapig78: uh
[1:25:22] acolyte_of_mephala: It wasn't me!

[1:25:25] TheOGSpaceDingo: lmaooooooooo
[1:25:28] chinook_a: LUL LUL LUL
[1:25:28] Glitchd_Demigod: Bit to be fair those of us at docs want to everything about the redstone
[1:25:29] annay_bff: WHT is that
[1:25:29] TheOGSpaceDingo: so is forgotten
[1:25:30] RCMNexus: irony
[1:25:30] Neamow: oh look, an iron farm! pearlieLOL
[1:25:31] FairyOrchidMC: Longer vids for start and end of the season are really nice. I prefer longer vids during holidays
[1:25:34] antalia_lotus: huh pearliePalm pearlieLOL
[1:25:35] zer0ntt: LUL LUL LUL LUL
[1:25:36] annay_bff: Oh
[1:25:37] cattootler: I watch all his episodes too what does that tell you
[1:25:41] shark_monty: Lmao
[1:25:47] chinook_a: if doc uploads a short video, id be concerned
[1:25:51] MusicFreeGaming: The reality is that most videos from small creators are not good. YouTubes who make good content don't stay small
[1:25:53] Stormi_Stik: I fell asleep to impulse’s secret life movie lol
[1:26:05] Neamow: wonders of minecraft AI pathfinding
[1:26:05] NoraTion__: Hello pearl :D Do you have any tips for smaller creators on generation of original ideas for videos?
[1:26:06] herbertthecow1: @cattootler wow thats days of your life you will never get back
[1:26:08] greenriyder: I don't mind the longer videos because I love watching you and if I don't want to watch the whole thing at once, I can watch it in spurts, but I usually don't have to do that
[1:26:08] seibaby: Iron golems (unless you built them yourself) are potentially world ending mobs
[1:26:09] great_zeddicus: Love my hour and a half doc videos. Lol.
[1:26:12] UrbanAri50: Lava bucket time
[1:26:12] Zehss: i love the longer hermitcraft videos something nice to watch while playing minecraft grinding 1000s of blocks of sand
[1:26:13] Nicklii: its cozy, dont question it LUL
[1:26:14] Glitchd_Demigod: Yeah but doc said he's gonna start streaming again this year and I cannot wait
[1:26:14] migfx: i watched most hermits on S9 but you, Gem, Impulse and DOC are the ones i watched all episodes
[1:26:14] TwinkleTues: @MusicFreeGaming Absolutely not true. The algorithm can't judge quality.
[1:26:19] cattootler: @chinook_a yeah it's usually kiddie unwell or internet is rubbish
[1:26:29] xxthemythicalegendxx: I watch doc's videos they are quite good
[1:26:31] emchmu: everyone starts somewhere
[1:26:34] miracleasl: do you intend to use your second channel more often?
[1:26:35] shark_monty: Doc attracts more mature people because he's too smart it hurts my brain
[1:26:49] flamingorilla44: Hai
[1:26:57] finnthefrogkid: hello
[1:27:05] flamingorilla44: Are u saying size doesn't matter ? GlitchCat GlitchCat GlitchCat
[1:27:07] Glitchd_Demigod: Doc attracts Redstoners and technical minecrafters and fanartists
[1:27:11] Shenko: @MusicFreeGaming That's just disrespectful for 99% of the youtube space,
[1:27:12] girlscout224: @ciciplayingmc I do that with a lot of videos lol especially educational videos that aren't edited and it's just a recording of someone speaking about their specialization. My ADHD will get me distracted from the topic of the speaking is too slow lol. Closed captions and 1.75x speed is my fave haha
[1:27:12] devsea_: i assume the older your viewers the longer videos theyd watch
[1:27:13] flappetyflippers: "In that instance"
[1:27:14] WhoIsEpikus: @musicfreegaming small creators often pour their hearts and souls into their content whilst you have bigger yters just saying a few words or getting other people's videos and reposting on their channel
[1:27:18] cattootler: @themythicalegend I'll always watch a Pearl vid first but when HC was on, Doc and I had a date every Saturdday lunch time
[1:27:21] RCMNexus: @shark_monty if I see it I try to put it into cartoon context and see if I can understand it then
[1:27:24] BaristaSimmer: @shark_monty He is a mastermind with his hivemind and I struggle with a sugar cane farm for my first redstone farm lol
[1:27:40] castlebeki: tbh even if people dont mind 1h vids, they are not going to watch 10 x 1h vids so they will look for some shorter format too
[1:27:44] NoraTion__: Do you have any tips on coming up with ideas for videos?
[1:27:44] finnthefrogkid: hello im new here your rly cool and fun to watch. thank you!
[1:27:48] migfx: @themythicalegend haha yeah Pearl, DOc ang Gem was an instant click for me too
[1:27:49] wallflowrpower: hello!!
[1:27:51] Neamow: so you're saying size doesn't matter? pearlieLOL
[1:27:52] Exirel: Pearl ASMR is shoveling sand and humming calmly.
[1:27:52] MusicFreeGaming: @twinkletues But audiences can and that's what drives recommendations
[1:27:56] Kawaiitron_: @whoisepikus As a small creator who just loves to make videos, I did find that person’s comment quite rude.
[1:28:12] cattootler: @Exirel <3 <3 pearlieHeart
[1:28:13] Stormi_Stik: @musicfreegaming i know a bunch of small creators who are very good
[1:28:14] girlscout224: Have a great day/night everyone & Pearl ✨ I gotta head out. Cheers!
[1:28:19] shark_monty: Something I say often is being a Minecraft youtuber the best thing to put all his skills into @baristasimmer
[1:28:22] xxthemythicalegendxx: @cattootler yeah, fair enough
[1:28:24] Stormi_Stik: for example the spooncraft people
[1:28:27] emchmu: my first intro to your channel was the dragon egg dragon, i was dumbfounded that that build wasnt the entirety of the video, on ly part of it
[1:28:29] Glitchd_Demigod: Yeah I watch doct and he explains a part of a redstone system and I'm sometimes just like wait a minute that'll fix this problem in my own machine with far less headache
[1:28:43] miracleasl: I feel like you’re building 2 different audiences between youtube and twitch
[1:28:48] Stormi_Stik: (mumbos discord servers minecraft server)
[1:28:52] blueguineapig78: Just a bunch of dragon eggs....
[1:28:54] shark_monty: Oh yeah definitely doc is very good with that @glitcheddemigod1
[1:28:56] Nightbot:  Follow Pearl in all the places: https://www.youtube.com/pearlescentmoon  https://twitter.com/PearlescentMoon https://www.instagram.com/pearlescentmoo/
[1:28:56] DeltaAvenue: i never understand it, because when content is too long you could just watch it in 3 sessions right
[1:28:58] ciciplayingmc: egg
[1:28:58] TwinkleTues: @MusicFreeGaming But an audience can't find a video unless they find it, the algorithm is the biggest driver of new viewers. Bigger channels are better at gaming the algorithm, not at making a higher quality of videos.
[1:29:00] devsea_: gtwsLol
[1:29:01] xNemesis_z069: personally any form of content is fine for me as long as the length of time is consistent so we know what to expect
[1:29:02] emchmu: Just a bunch of dragon eggs????
[1:29:02] toastboi22: it's -20 outside and I have a stand mixer. I now have an ice-cream machine
[1:29:03] devsea_: egg
[1:29:03] chalky574: what people like to watch and what they consider good is subjective anyway
[1:29:03] sapphicwhimsy: look. EGG
[1:29:04] seibaby: Just a bunch of dragon eggs she says....it was 70000 dragon eggs!
[1:29:05] Shenko: Cheer100 When you start out or are a smaller creator, you get to experiment and really get in touch with what you really want to make pearlieWoo I can say for a fact that worked for me as a smaller Minecraft Creator pearlieFingerGuns
[1:29:05] garnettgemm: egg
[1:29:08] Kanavitas: egg! [gestures wildly]
[1:29:11] miayuki08: Do you have a dream build in terms of building style?
[1:29:12] secret_agent4706: Egg

[1:29:31] Ender_Creeper173: Egg
[1:29:32] cattootler: that dragon egg statue was one of the most amazing things I ever saw in MC and I totally loved that episode
[1:29:39] chinook_a: seeing that dragon in game... i severly underestimated how big that actually was
[1:29:40] migfx: pearl that dragon is mesmerizing i spent nearly half and hour just looking at it
[1:29:45] Nightbot:  Reminder to be kind in chat!
[1:29:48] seibaby: Oh you're right sorry it was probably only 50000 eggs Kappa
[1:29:48] Stormi_Stik: Ooo what movies
[1:29:49] BaristaSimmer: You probably could have made 5 more because there were SO many dragon eggs :)
[1:29:51] WhoIsEpikus: I have rlly got headphones with directional audio. Noteblocks sounded like in irl I was concerned, lifted headphones but couldn't hear nothing, same with shulker made me jump
[1:29:52] pancake_lover_333: that was the crazy part...
[1:29:54] shark_monty: Ikr those types of builds are evil!
[1:29:58] NeverEatPearss: As an Australian, may I ask why you tend to stream so late for us?

[1:30:08] herbertthecow1: did you use lightmatika
[1:30:09] emchmu: video seemed clickbait, than just realised you were insane
[1:30:15] cattootler: yes the technical requirements to achieve it - so cool and clever
[1:30:17] alexyap0223: Scar is shocked pearlieLOL
[1:30:20] damorpeko: also like, How did you plan that out!!!!
[1:30:25] shark_monty: Yeah the hermits don't clickbait they're all insane
[1:30:26] Stormi_Stik: @seibaby silly us thinking she had to place 50001
[1:30:32] BaristaSimmer: @alexyap0223 I liked his reaction Lol
[1:30:34] Glitchd_Demigod: @nevereatpearss BC most of the audience is from the other side of the world
[1:30:35] gamingnscience: how often did you misclick on an egg and send it wherever?
[1:30:35] ciciplayingmc: im about to go to bed and i am not even from eastern Aus why are you up pearl
[1:30:36] RiddlEm_: would you be willing to try Hermitcraft geoguesser? they updated to season 9 :D
[1:30:36] secret_agent4706: I originally found you through grian's old videos with you but only started watching consistently after s8 started
[1:30:39] WhoIsEpikus: @nevereatpearss because of other viewers who are foreign, it's for viewers overseas
[1:30:42] skyhighmc123: Hello!
[1:30:45] miracleasl: I hope you come up with some excuses to build even more dragons in s10 pearlieHeart
[1:30:50] xxthemythicalegendxx: @NeverEatPearss because it matches the other time zones, but I agree as an Aussie myself
[1:30:53] migfx: yeah i've come to accept that you just go all out since i started watching you in S8
[1:30:57] NoraTion__: Why are your instruments and weapons named the way they are?
[1:31:11] shark_monty: What was the best movie you watched during that?
[1:31:12] seibaby: There's a dragon egg in the decked out redstone that might be yours
[1:31:13] Ryvenarie: I’m currently working on a Skyrim themed base on the iSV server and I found your dragon portal tutorial. I’m good with buildings, okay with terraforming, and rubbish with live creatures.
[1:31:17] NeverEatPearss: @themythicalegend rip australians
[1:31:23] lunarcloak: OH YEAH!! Pearl have you seen the hermitcraft geoguessr??? You should check it out!!

[1:31:57] Ciefiell: Don't forget to donate to the Warden
[1:31:58] chinook_a: warden is at 81% already oh gosh people
[1:31:58] xxthemythicalegendxx: @NeverEatPearss yeah pretty much, not many streamers stream at a reasonable time for us
[1:32:17] seibaby: Nah the hardhat was a nice touch
[1:32:18] migfx: i love the helmet it was a great choice
[1:32:20] blueguineapig78: It was brilliant!

[1:37:25] Neamow: 100 days in Minecraft is one of the worst trends that happened
[1:37:32] lunarcloak: matpat has a really good video on excess video content- about how you don't need to do excessive things for videos
[1:37:34] emchmu: pearl is speaking the largest of truths
[1:37:34] augustasman: but usually its fun to watch them
[1:37:48] saleo37: So what we doin today?

[1:38:14] ciciplayingmc: there are some people who do actually spend 100 day in minecraft and some who cheat which is sad for the people who do spend the time to that
[1:38:16] seibaby: There are just so many people making videos. I can understand a single creator would want to make a high-effort video to draw people in, but then there are so many people doing the same
[1:38:16] augustasman: yeah
[1:38:20] pinksox_: lot of work in short amount of time content often feels hyper time lapsey and less personal

[1:38:57] gamingnscience: fwhip and Joel do these videos quite well. but they build them on their personality. they might as well do a different video style and it would work
[1:39:00] shark_monty: I'ma do a surviving 100 days in Minecraft but most of it will be me in a hole afk for an april fools
[1:39:12] Nightbot:  Don't be a dry potato, remember to stay hydrated!
[1:39:22] Kawaiitron_: I just make videos and upload them whenever I feel like it. pearlieIDK
[1:39:28] cattootler: @seibaby that's so interesting because I will always want to watch a video with a good story even if it's not the best technically.  If there's a good story I can look past that
[1:39:30] Firestxr16: It's sad to me because the algorithm is just what people are watching. It's basically the "demand" per say
[1:39:30] Neamow: obviously we need to start a counter-trend: "1 day in Minecraft" where you just do a slice-of-life 12 minute video with no cuts of what you do in one day pearlieLOL

[1:40:12] Kawaiitron_: Not Minecraft, but The Amazing Digital Circus was a bit too overstimulating for me, so I only watched the first 6 and a half minutes. pearlieDed
[1:40:13] chalky574: its excessive yeah
[1:40:14] NoraTion__: Is this "music" made by allays an actual music or just random sounds they made that sound like music due to how many there are?

[1:43:02] preparedman: The 100 hours hardcore with Grian Scar and Joel was pretty fun
[1:43:14] chinook_a: i like that fwhip and sausage dont follow trends per se with hardcore, makes it so much more fun and authentic. Joel does great with 100-day formats since hes making it more personal

[1:45:11] GaspsHiChat: my little sister is five and had the attention span if a rock but the only long content she can watch is your videos and even that's pretty rare
[1:45:12] Firestxr16: I think it's because of how it's become a battle for time, and the value of time. Because of that, it's gotten into the direction of the most content in the least time possible to fight for that "value"

[2:07:59] Nortic_Ciap: Its actually good, the seeds taste good

[2:08:16] stany_d: the seeds are a little bitter but it's not a problem
[2:08:19] LunarLumina: eating the core?? i'm unsubscribing!
[2:08:19] sapphicwhimsy: thats poISONOUS
[2:08:20] preparedman: I always eat the whole apple seed included
[2:08:21] What_At_Twitch: @mashferef_wijafkjfa Nope, you'd need nearly impossible amounts for it to have any effect
[2:08:22] GaspsHiChat: you're not meant to eat the seeds ?????????
[2:08:23] chinook_a: i was told the seeds were poison
[2:08:23] BertPotato: apple seeds contain small amounts of cyanide, so it's not advisable
[2:08:24] emchmu: APPLES HAVE POISON SEEDS
[2:08:24] greenlander64: Hey do you play ylands
[2:08:25] antalia_lotus: i have to go now bye pearlieWave
[2:08:25] Kawaiitron_: Apple seeds contain cyanide, but the amount is so small that it’d take hundreds of seeds to cause harm.
[2:08:26] Mr13igh: Eww your a wrong un Pearl 🤮 LUL
[2:08:27] pim_the_crow: no the seeds have cyanide
[2:08:29] PaulTales: We just take them outside and chuck them into the woods for the deer

[2:08:38] preparedman: Tap water is more toxic than apple seeds
[2:08:40] giannnovich: You literally sacrifice 1 bite for certain poisoning why eat the core
[2:08:41] garnettgemm: the seeds are dangerousss
[2:08:42] Neamow: @chinook_a cancelled!
[2:08:44] Nuk22: Well the birds would have eaten the rest of the apple by the end of the day

[2:08:50] kawther55: hiiiii
[2:08:50] camilla_rep: you have to eat a lot of seeds though and you have to break them
[2:08:53] Nightbot:  Be respectful - No spamming - No advertising - English only
[2:08:58] BertPotato: Once in a while is unlikely to kill you, but if you do it regularly, you risk cyanide poisoning
[2:08:58] chibiplaysgames: you would have to eat like a full cup of apple seeds to feel ill
[2:08:58] azrafdaguy: @Kawaiitron_ every time I eat a cherry, everyone around me HAS to hear about the cyanide content in cherry seeds. Its a requirement
[2:09:02] stany_d: there's nowhere near enough for a few seeds to be dangerous
[2:09:02] fxoons: Whats worse than finding a worm in ur apple?  (Half a worm)
[2:09:07] toastboi22: you would have to eat thousands apon thousands of seeds for it to be harmful
[2:09:11] damorpeko: one apples worth of seeds wont be horrible to you but in large quantities they can be toxic
[2:09:11] What_At_Twitch: The seeds are not dangerous, thats bad science, too much water can intoxicate you
[2:09:13] Treity: @BertPotato They do, but unless something goes horrible wrong, your body shouldnt be able to extract it durring digestion, so you hsould be ok
[2:09:16] beeboo909: Yeah apple seeds contain the tiniest amount of cyanide
[2:09:16] WhoIsEpikus: Paprika goes with everything. My fav food is paprika mixed in ice cream

[2:10:01] PaulTales: I could forgive the apple core but Kiwi skin?
[2:10:02] blueguineapig78: You'd have to eat an awful lot of the seeds and crush them in order for there to be enough cyanide to kill you.

[2:10:12] Mr13igh: Thought apple seeds had small amounts of cyanide in them
[2:10:12] Nicklii: the trick is not chew the seeds
[2:10:12] magpie_life: you should add a “drink water” channel point redemption
[2:10:14] Kawaiitron_: @gaspshichat Your… own teeth? Like, after biting into your food? Right?

[2:11:06] Treity: @BertPotato "the average adult would need to eat anywhere from 150 to several thousand crushed seeds (depending on the apple variety) to be at risk of cyanide poisoning"
[2:11:07] SumerSnow: apparently its fine to eat the core, just dont chew the seads or eat to many seads.  and yeah, water poisoning is a thing, tho i think less common than dehydration lol
