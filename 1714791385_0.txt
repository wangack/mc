[3:35:56] MstresVampy: the backpack
[3:36:25] UndeadMutt: im playing on a single player world, i picked up a chest piece if i hae it equipped it crashes my game, only way to fix it is dying never picking that body up ever again

[3:36:47] MstresVampy: I found a bat one
[3:36:52] Darkaros: @UndeadMutt known bug. You need to downgrade ImmediatelyFast mod to 1.1.5 instead of 1.1.6
[3:37:51] UndeadMutt: sounds like alot of work , i just left my body in a corner of my house and put a sign saying dont touch unless want crash
[3:38:05] jakemurphy62: Hello
[3:38:26] SplatterDoll: @MstresVampy yeah, the mod pack never updated the textures for the backpack so the button is invisible. It works for all the backpacks with abilities though.
[3:38:39] Darkaros: @UndeadMutt ijpSIP it was easy enough Gassy did it. Hope you don't pick up a helm or chest that crashes you because it's multiple textures
[3:38:45] Msg1025: need to cook the cobblestone twice
[3:39:33] UndeadMutt: its a chest piece everything was fine until i picked up the legendary chest, but it worked after i died just picked my body put it in the corner put the sign

[4:19:10] BarryCarlyon: shrugs
[4:19:14] Fetko1: his server supports 71 people though
[4:19:34] BarryCarlyon: it's just normal modded mineraft weird things.
[4:19:47] Xanderan_Madman: gassyBEF

[4:20:59] ShaiHulud66: @TomatenPleb i mean there is probably a mod for that so...
[4:20:59] BarryCarlyon: I changed the time rule. So it only needs one guy
[4:21:02] Paikou64: @Fetko1 LUL

[4:21:25] bakedsourpanda: Max i watched some old vids of nanners and i couldnt stop laughing at how well you do Macho man randy savage its so good
[4:21:27] BarryCarlyon: I just have it setup to pause time when one or less people are on so the server doesn't run winter with no one on
[4:21:33] bakedsourpanda: i miss those days
[4:21:40] XiliaVield: that bam kinda sounded like morgan freeman
[4:21:42] XiliaVield: XD
[4:21:58] BarryCarlyon: can now :-D I changed the rule to 0 perople instead
[4:21:59] Paikou64: @bakedsourpanda that section of vids is my fav because of the randy savage impersonation lol
[4:22:18] themetareaper: It‚Äôs cool
[4:22:21] Zombienetics: @BarryCarlyon i want learn the ways of the barry

[4:22:55] BarryCarlyon: No thats JEI
[4:22:56] Paikou64: @bakedsourpanda i think for nanners, its the hidden series that cracks me up the most
[4:23:02] bakedsourpanda: @Paikou64 tho i have to skip some vids with certain people in it cause i wish they were not bad :(
[4:23:19] Se7enade: a greater realm with wenches and hallucinogens aplenty
[4:23:27] Paikou64: @bakedsourpanda i respect that
[4:23:34] DJLexx42: Gassy server best server

[4:25:59] BarryCarlyon: Servers only load the areas where people are.
[4:26:00] XiliaVield: yeah it is
[4:26:21] BarryCarlyon: The issue is usually down to entitiy count.
[4:26:35] Goochy: You can load into me any time
[4:26:52] BrainsAndBrawn: whats in yo heeeead, in yo heaeaead
[4:26:57] Zombienetics: @Goochy oh my
[4:27:00] ByteHammer: @Goochy Grats on the name change
[4:27:05] Goochy: goochLove
[4:27:17] Goochy: Thx dude, I‚Äôm pumped for eco
[4:27:18] Paikou64: @Goochy gassyHEART gassyHEART gassyHEART
[4:27:21] Goochy: LOOL
[4:27:24] Goochy: One and only baby
[4:27:27] BarryCarlyon: So you've only got a birb and a fe other things to tick with. You killed the server during a shit tonne of combat and one of the mods ticked wrong and crashed the server.
[4:27:28] bakedsourpanda: Leaving your door open letting in the cold air trying to heat the out doors?
[4:27:34] DJLexx42: Kenith was great
[4:27:35] Goochy: Ya I‚Äôm playin Kenny
[4:27:39] WDForty: the whole freezing to death is the worst part of this mod i think, esp when you go indoors
[4:27:45] Goochy: TOMMY CHIVE
[4:27:49] Zombienetics: yay kenny is back
[4:28:02] WDForty: can you cook cobble to make normal stone
[4:28:05] MstresVampy: u need all gear pieces on
[4:28:05] Goochy: Ya I‚Äôm excited to RP with the boys and everyone, last year was so fun
[4:28:11] MstresVampy: or u will freeze
[4:28:11] BarryCarlyon: Any _lag_ is down to local side rendering and processing of network data. And on the other server you are next door to the farm(s) and thats a lot of ticking.
[4:28:36] SplatterDoll: heating stones I thought
[4:28:37] sirluc2: stone, not cobble
