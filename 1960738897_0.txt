[1:56:29] schendsa: i had to shoot gale's romance down like 3 times KEKW
[1:56:29] DisforDemise: can someone post in chat when spoilers end so I can unmute?
[1:56:57] Teacosy_: I had it as a friend NODDERS

[1:57:17] Sumokippikhoofd: LUL
[1:57:19] hansanpaints: my innocent ears
[1:57:20] Viztee: i did a little mizzora romance yesterday pedSmug
[1:57:21] Purple_Chewbacca: a creeper in the castle, la la la la al
[1:57:23] Dabberdees: you can, but you can't be as nice to him at times, maybe do some murder ;) and i had it as a friend, maybe gale was scared of my love in lae'zel, she would've ended him
[1:57:29] elwyn001: @disfordemise spoilers are over
[1:57:33] Idunyken: @DisforDemise safe now
[1:57:34] big_richard_head: Wyll - I'm in love you, Kirsty - Thank you
[1:57:43] SecondBreakfastPip: Not fully
[1:57:51] DisforDemise: @Idunyken thankies ^^
[1:58:05] SecondBreakfastPip: I think he wants to sleep with you at least once at the start bobsHands
[1:58:13] retro_processor: but this is Baldur's Harem?
[1:58:17] darth_baggins: Yep. Romance in games is never realistic.
[1:58:23] Merlinovitsch: KEKW
[1:58:23] SwyfteWinter: Divinity 2 was not quite so bad for that.
[1:58:23] RubelliteFae: Some might say it's for nerds to live out their fantasies LUL
[1:58:25] DariusHasDogs: LUL
[1:58:30] ChisRift51: KEKW
[1:58:32] hansanpaints: cyberpunk did it REALLY well. especially the whole progress of relationships and the stories as well
[1:58:34] RufusTheHairyCatWrangler: They are all playersexual
[1:58:52] Dabberdees: me, being a horrid looking creature: the party: so pretty
[1:58:54] RubelliteFae: On another note, dating in Palia... anyone?
[1:59:00] DisforDemise: see, I think that's much more authentic than having some options arbitrarily out of reach because of race, gender or size
[1:59:01] HeliosAlpha: Because for every character, there's always a group of players that love that character
[1:59:03] SlowMotionAtomicBomb: it sounds like the opposite of real life Sadge
[1:59:09] Mr_Revus: well cyberpunk changed that up and peeps where angry about that
[1:59:20] Viztee: i do like playersexual actually because i hate the amount of times the gays have been fucked over for romance in games in the past
[1:59:53] SecondBreakfastPip: I just want to be able to be asexual in games too, without the characters hating you cause you don't wanna fuck
[1:59:53] hansanpaints: true viz
[1:59:55] DisforDemise: Like, it's 2023, there's no excuse for characters not to be bi and poly in games any more
[2:00:00] Arnhawl: LUL
[2:00:01] Qchaos: or the savage answer : "I like you as a friend"
[2:00:08] Tim_Plumbstein: well life threatening situations is an aphrodisiac so maybe that has a influence
[2:00:18] Arnhawl: KEKW
[2:00:20] Teacosy_: KEKW]
[2:00:23] Teacosy_: KEKW *
[2:00:28] Viztee: lmao i love her
[2:00:36] Dabberdees: bae'zel <3
[2:00:46] SecondBreakfastPip: Asexuals unfortunately draw the short straw in games
[2:00:48] daft_dave_41: brionyOhno Laezel speaks her mind, if nothing else
[2:00:54] RufusTheHairyCatWrangler: One thing I will give to Dragon Age Inquisition is characters are not playersexual. If you try to romance someone that is not into you they will just be like "sorry dude, I'm not into that"
[2:00:55] Scorchfield: I feel like it should be an option, like if you want them to be super horny you can turn that option on but it shouldn't be default
[2:01:34] Idunyken: KEKW
[2:01:39] Overlite: i think the logic is the tadpole makes everybody run on an accelerated timeline
[2:01:41] Teacosy_: KEKW
[2:01:42] falla_softpaw: George Michael?!
[2:01:43] ChisRift51: KEKW
[2:01:45] Arnhawl: SH does have nice build up, but every other character in my party has tried it on with me and it is a bit annoying bobsLAUGH
[2:01:47] falla_softpaw: brionyLul
[2:01:49] SwyfteWinter: "You may be wondering how I got here. Truth is, so am I"
[2:02:02] MrAzullMoro: @Dabberdees Bae'zel pcCheer
[2:02:10] benjambles: feels far to close to some of the parasocial relationships that are far too common now. They said my name?! They must love me!
[2:02:12] DisforDemise: I mean the thing about there being no buildup - a, there's unbelievable amounts of buildup with shadowheart, jesus christ this is a slow-ass romance arcc. But secondly; it's not like the player needs lots of slow buildup to be horny af for a character, so why should the characcter need it back?

[2:02:19] The_Disturber: I guess everyone in baldurs gate is just pansexual
[2:02:21] RovioFin: The way you're describing these situations it's kinda bordering sexual harrasment Sweaty
[2:02:26] RufusTheHairyCatWrangler: That's not to say Dragon Age doesn't have its gay characters, but just like real life you can't expect everyone to fall for you just because. If they are gay or straight that's who they are
[2:02:44] lux_miles: i would have been here earlier but my friend was educating me on "emet selch x warrior of light smut" LuL
[2:02:58] SwyfteWinter: Divinity OS:2 sounds like it takes it slower too
[2:03:06] Tim_Plumbstein: but briony you do want to marry everyone in stardew
[2:03:08] TheGrahame: D for Demise?.... you mean Dis rythian LUL
[2:03:14] senthist: Yessss stardew, where you must bribe your love interest
[2:03:25] SecondBreakfastPip: You can be gay, bi, pansexual and asexual, which is what everyone forgets
[2:03:26] Steephv: image any office was like bg3... "I love how you fetched that paper out of the printer, let's eff"
[2:03:36] thehappyplumber: They can also draw the difference between lust and love
[2:03:38] Viztee: Shadowheart is the slow romance but i think shes like the only one LUL
[2:03:47] Arnhawl: ^
[2:04:08] SwyfteWinter: So one way to describe it is that Rythian wants to be able to romance anyone, but does not want to romance EVERYONE
[2:04:27] MFRGamingTV: What is he going on about?
[2:04:27] Arnhawl: KEKW
[2:04:30] silentp13426: tbf, considering all of them have a tadpole in their head providing a potential expiry date on themselves, they're not wanting to wait around
[2:04:33] MFRGamingTV: I tuned into a rant xD
[2:04:34] retro_processor: I like putting in romance tokens into NPC machines. It's healthy representation of romance
[2:04:41] Arnhawl: I've only got eyes for Shadowheart so I've not experienced this problem
[2:05:01] DariusHasDogs: To be fair, it's a fantasy so yeh, maybe everyone in this world is pan
[2:05:05] Overlite: honestly, i wish the companions romanced each other a bit more as well
[2:05:05] Faaafv: PEEPERS cursorLUL
[2:05:12] RubelliteFae: Even in Palia not everyone is into the player and not everyone is polyamorous. It's a nice flip from the real world w/o being unrealistic
[2:05:15] SecondBreakfastPip: I don't like that they hate you if you don't want to fuck
[2:05:17] Qchaos: @silentp13426 I was thinking maybe said tadpole was influencing that, like maybe it is an emotional catalyst
[2:05:21] The_Disturber: to be fair, the game is supposed to be like a DnD game right? so I guess in spirit everyone is just a bard in that game LUL
[2:05:31] Arnhawl: I had to tell Gale to stop romancing me FOUR TIMES
[2:05:34] silentp13426: @Qchaos also this as well
[2:05:36] Arnhawl: Bro needs to calm down
[2:06:07] gregrtx: Hint? You don't have to spoil?
[2:06:12] SecondBreakfastPip: 100%
[2:06:19] Overlite: ooh yeah that i was super not there for
[2:06:21] Arnhawl: Hmming
[2:06:26] RufusTheHairyCatWrangler: I haven't played BG3 yet but as I generally don't give a fuck about romance in games I have a feeling when I do play it I'm going to be disappointing a lot of people
[2:06:35] General_Amphibian: Can i unmute from BG3 spoilers yet?
[2:06:40] gregrtx: I am in Act 3. I must have missed it
[2:07:05] Arnhawl: @gregrtx Yeah I must've missed it too LUL
[2:07:06] retro_processor: "im just ploughing my way through the content!"
[2:07:09] DisforDemise: why would anyone not be?
[2:07:09] Viztee: I think the amount of times i've played games where the character I am the most interested in is not attracted to my character because their gender is wrong is really annoying and i end up modding them to romance them anyway so idk i like when there isn't an arbitrary barrier to romance
[2:07:19] NeutralQuartz: I love that Halsin just walks right up and says "want to fuck?" the second he joins your party LUL
[2:07:20] Overlite: some companions are more comfortable with it i think?
[2:07:34] Scorchfield: it does kind of break immersion
[2:07:36] RubelliteFae: I agree with Rythian. Players are spoiled
[2:07:50] silentp13426: Viztee agreed, I'm so frustrated that Tali in ME won't go with FemShep
[2:07:59] The_Disturber: this conversation is getting us some great quotes LUL
[2:08:01] RubelliteFae: feel entitled to be able to do everything with no repurcussions
[2:08:03] DukeOfGlouchester: Yeah, what is this some sort of 'fantasy'?!
[2:08:05] Arnhawl: RIGHT SILENT????????
[2:08:09] SecondBreakfastPip: @viztee yeah not to romance, but sexual attraction? There should be an option to not have that
[2:08:27] darth_baggins: In Kirsty's chat play-through we invited Shadowheart to a threesome and her response was "not tonight," so yeah, the characters seem open to pretty much anything.
[2:08:30] Viztee: unless your a lesbian lmao
[2:08:34] SockOnYourChowd: this is honestly most of all shounen action manhwas lately
[2:08:34] lux_miles: the most annoying romance ive had in a video game was fire emblem awakneing
[2:08:38] Arnhawl: ^
[2:08:44] gregrtx: Garris or Tali. The only options
[2:08:49] Arnhawl: I played femshep and was sad I couldn't romance Tali
[2:08:57] Mr_Revus: where they tho? it was just talk to them and they like you
[2:08:58] NeutralQuartz: Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous had some good romances too.
[2:09:07] meauwer: Tali supremacy
[2:09:09] Sumokippikhoofd: I couldnt be with Tali because I was playing female Shepard
[2:09:10] TheGrahame: for Masculine gay relationships there is only one charchter you can romance
[2:09:10] RufusTheHairyCatWrangler: Thing is Viztee, and I get it's a game, but in life not everybody is going to be attracted to your gender. You don't get to just pick whoever you want to bbe with, you pick from the people who are attracted to you

[2:09:43] DariusHasDogs: Noice
[2:09:43] lux_miles: in fire emblem awakening the main character chrom HAS to marry a female character for the story to progress. so if you play as a female character and chrom has no other options the game straight up goes "yep you had babies with chrom"
[2:09:44] Overlite: enough of being attracted to gender, it's time to be attracted to class where are my wizardsexuals
[2:09:48] Essenthight: coldplay EARPERS

[2:10:33] Arnhawl: and they were friends
[2:10:35] SwyfteWinter: Oh my gods, they were FRIEND DATING?
[2:10:42] Viztee: if your a lesbian you can romance Liara or whose race has no gender, and then in 2 and 3 you romance your Yoeman NotLikeThis
[2:11:05] NeutralQuartz: Harvest moon and Rune Factory have always been pretty gay right?
[2:11:12] TheGrahame: you have to remember ME3 didn't have a masculine gay scenes cause area's in America lost their shit that you could be gay in the game
[2:11:13] RubelliteFae: The original being like that is a major reason Stardew exists
[2:11:14] silentp13426: Viztee which seems really wrong considering you are their commanding officer, that's a fucked up power dynamic
[2:11:16] Purple_Chewbacca: LINUS

[2:11:51] TheGrahame: shit.... is kirsty gonna make this a tetris 99 stream?... kirstHmm
[2:12:11] hansanpaints: I haven't been into any romance in games for years...and then judy in cyberpunk came along :)
[2:12:34] Maxwell_Bloodfencer: Battle Royale, but it's all Briony
[2:12:48] Viztee: @silentp13426 yea its an odd thing for Shep to do, but they were in a very tense situation so maybe they can be forgiven for being a bit more lax
[2:12:55] hansanpaints: well written romance
[2:13:03] Viztee: Yea i hated that i wanted to romance Panamn
[2:13:19] silentp13426: Viztee end of the world/galaxy does allow for some wiggle room KEKW
[2:13:24] Viztee: She was so into my character and then she suddenly was like go fuck yourself
[2:13:29] Viztee: i was so sad
[2:13:30] lonefox1234: im mostly confused on how they locked of panam in cyberpunk to straight. Like she is literally flirting with you and then says no
[2:13:37] benjambles: As a female V I tried hitting on Kerry Eurodyne. Kinda glad when he said 'Nah, I'm good'
[2:13:42] hansanpaints: @Viztee I thought that her turning you down (when female) was written well though. And you stil have a very deep connection
[2:13:50] Ruffyluvy: It is a more realistic approach in that respect, with Cyberpunk.
[2:14:04] SwyfteWinter: I mean, it is realistic for characters in games to have gender locked relationships. How many times do you hear stories of men saying like "I asked out this girl, but she turned out to be lesbian" or "I asked out this guy, but he is gay"
[2:14:31] mcquiznos: Love yall
[2:14:40] lux_miles: fire emblem three houses has characters that are bisexual but won't marry the player because they arent into them
[2:14:54] Ruffyluvy: There is also the "how big do you want this game and how long do you want it in development just to make dialogue perfectly mimic actual life relationships"
[2:14:56] Viztee: EXACTLY
[2:15:03] SketchThisWave: sometimes people be like that tho
[2:15:04] hansanpaints: yeah okay the way you describe it
[2:15:04] Viztee: god i was so sad
[2:15:07] lux_miles: although it does fall into the catagory of "they were close close friends and when the other died they died of sadness two days later"
[2:15:08] RubelliteFae: What if they are into the players gender, but they just find you ugly?
[2:15:12] hansanpaints: but judy
[2:15:16] retro_processor: if you put in more romance tokens...
[2:15:16] Scarf1991: a greater distinction of when it's non-romantic intimacy?
[2:15:25] hansanpaints: yeah it is written extremely well
[2:15:26] TheGrahame: but that would mean having 2-4 cutr scenes for different options
[2:15:28] RubelliteFae: Kappa
[2:15:39] Ruffyluvy: Plus gender-locked romance is great for replayability
[2:15:41] Maxwell_Bloodfencer: Cyberpunk actually made me care about the Detective Guy
[2:15:42] hansanpaints: oh I forgor about
[2:15:46] hansanpaints: rock-guy
[2:15:51] hansanpaints: WHAT MAX?

[2:15:56] hansanpaints: that guy was soooo stupid LUL
[2:15:59] RubelliteFae: no romancing peach?
[2:16:02] TheGrahame: character devolpment in Cyberpunk is great, Rythian are you gonna romance panam?... cause that cut scene... it's something.

[2:17:21] Davidofsmeg: Classic Rythian talks about romance during ace awareness week
[2:17:21] roundburrito4: I mean I was pretty oblivious to "leading" people on... My now husband pointed it out. Though I don't think treating people like a human means I'm flirting, lol....

[2:18:57] JBMiniatures: the older i get the more i want companionship over sex, dont get my wrong sex is nice but having not had it for 3 years i can go without, much rather a hug and kissing and spending time someone

[2:19:31] Ruffyluvy: thats why its called 'romance' and not 'sex pest'
[2:19:35] anantiapple: Wait there are tokens? I knew i was missing something!
[2:19:37] Idunyken: NODDERS
[2:19:48] SlowMotionAtomicBomb: sex and romance and both such nice things to have, I presume FeelsBadMan

[2:19:52] big_richard_head: Wait, that's not how it works? What about all the friend tokens I've wasted the?
[2:19:52] LividCode: dialog is sexier NODDERS
[2:20:05] lux_miles: when you complete friendship 50 times you can then trade in your 100 sex tokens for the mount in the next patch
[2:20:08] Jetnox: False. Romance is a Reese‚Äôs peanut butter cup straight from the fridge
[2:20:15] Qchaos: a traitor among us ? pedSus
[2:20:16] 3v1lc0w: daveCheck
[2:20:21] Teacosy_: LUL
[2:20:21] RubelliteFae: I'mma keep harping on Palia, but when you romance people you get a pin to show others your love & when you max it out you get a photo of them. No sexy times.
[2:20:29] Davidofsmeg: More work does equal more good
[2:20:32] Idunyken: pcGiggle
[2:20:32] Purple_Chewbacca: KEKW

[2:20:44] Ruffyluvy: Well Baldur's Gate is a great example of work put in, not just in the romances but every nook and cranny of that world has things to see and do and quest and find and die in. And that is well worth the wait on development. So there is something there

[2:23:00] Ruffyluvy: even concepts like "romance" and "love" are difficult to actually describe or define and vary from person to person - sometimes greatly. So its an odd requirement

[2:23:18] silentp13426: tbf at that stage in the series they hadn't exactly nailed down what he was
[2:23:22] benjambles: I think the other things that games/media pushes is still the idea that sex can only exist as part of a relationship - which is a point of view very based in  religion
[2:23:25] Overlite: i think sex is used as a tool to humanise characters quickly in shows like that
[2:23:29] NeutralQuartz: Is this gonna somehow lead back into Data's cum tank?
[2:23:29] RufusTheHairyCatWrangler: I'd like a game that is really nuanced, where characters are not only attracted to you or not based on gender but also other characteristics of your character. Like depending on your alignment, physical appearance, personality type, etc. Because those are all factors we take into consideration when choosing a partner, whether we want to admit it or not
[2:23:30] RubelliteFae: Yes Briony! Based! In-game romance being based on "I'm such a nice guy, why can't I 'score'? I put in so much time." That's not how to be a social creature. Too much gamification of "time spent with people should lead to me getting what I want."
[2:23:38] Hodgelett: also bodily appreciation. I like a good butt. But struggle with what is considered 'hot'
[2:23:39] Ruffyluvy: "fully functional, and anatomically correct"
[2:23:40] HeliosAlpha: I know about this because Tom and Ben has several times talked about where Data's 'liquids' come from
[2:23:41] SwyfteWinter: Apparently Gene Roddenbery was a bit of a sex pest
[2:23:48] retro_processor: @FusionGB that's the part about Data that creeps me out... he's fully equipped...

[2:25:04] retro_processor: Tom and Ben talked at great lengths about the logistical challenges involved with Data being fully equipped. including a tank or reservoir of klim
[2:25:10] SecondBreakfastPip: Sex in games is cool, but it shouldn't be mandatory
[2:25:13] RubelliteFae: Rythian put a bow on his entire "thing?"
[2:25:14] willhelm211: You heard it here first, Guys, rythan approves of sex. You can go ahead
[2:25:26] Qchaos: @AntiChrist7 superseducer stream would be hilarious
[2:25:33] Ruffyluvy: Romance and sex and relationships in games can sometimes feel very "checkbox". Similar to M&Ms supporting Pride.
[2:25:43] Stefnos: MACHINEGUN MAZZY
[2:25:50] mswlik: Mazzy is great!
[2:25:50] RufusTheHairyCatWrangler: I'm all for it being there, just not so much the expectation that you are going to engage with it. I generally don't engage with it and it gets annoying when the game keeps pushing you to pick someone
[2:25:59] The_Disturber: or at least make it that if you are not their prefered race, it is difficulter to romance them
[2:26:10] SlowMotionAtomicBomb: Kirsty, knock him off that platform and see if he stops
[2:26:12] Faaafv: capture some villagers make them have babies give them a job with an easy trade like stick for fletcher, easy xp and repair bobsChin
[2:26:14] thehappyplumber: Or even if you don't get locked out but it's harder if you have certain traits
[2:26:26] SwyfteWinter: I started playing a 2e game recently, the whole system is weird restrictions like that. We should consider ourselves lucky it does not inflict stat debuffs for being AFAB.
[2:26:36] Hodgelett: I mean I play games like AC Odyssey with sure I'd have sex with anything, she's Greek and eff the Greeks for giving sex liberation only to the men
[2:26:43] binary_sys: I like how he's pacing as well LUL

[2:27:47] RubelliteFae: Interested to hear Rythian rant about the FATAL system
[2:27:59] SwyfteWinter: Oh ***gods***
[2:28:01] silentp13426: the less said about FATAL, the better
[2:28:06] RufusTheHairyCatWrangler: Now that's something that does annoy me in games, when classes are gender locked
[2:28:08] binary_sys: if youre small you should get a damage BONUS for being closer to hell and fuller of rage NODDERS
[2:28:12] thehappyplumber: I don't think there is a problem with changing averages and things but it shouldn't apply to the main characters
[2:28:24] willhelm211: Oh god it is  a creepy system
[2:28:47] binary_sys: KEKW
[2:28:47] SwyfteWinter: What do you think about 5e's newer changes like separating stat changes from race?
[2:28:49] FusionGB: Can you explain thaco ?
[2:28:49] Scarf1991: @binary_sys easier to get to the crotch/knee-based weak spots
[2:29:00] RufusTheHairyCatWrangler: NO FLYING KIRSTY!

[2:29:34] retro_processor: I remember back in early WoW you wanted to line up racial perks.. gnome spellcasters ftw!
[2:30:00] Ruffyluvy: "the average halfing - etc"
[2:30:06] RubelliteFae: Eh, I think people min-max for being good at fighting and ignore RP anyway. I prefer to take some minuses in order to make an interesting character

[2:30:18] Dunc101: differnece between flavour text and mechanics
[2:30:25] thehappyplumber: The main character is meant to be extraordinary and not the norm
[2:30:28] PerkulatorBenny: "The average X" is this or that, but you are not average.
[2:30:39] Ruffyluvy: the games I play now are basically are RP, we do D&D as largely theater of the mind so its nice to have the flexibility
[2:30:40] retro_processor: my gnome warrior was the best part of RP WoW
[2:30:49] RufusTheHairyCatWrangler: Agree. The player character can be the exception because they are the protagonist, they are expected to be exceptional. NPCs should stick to racial averages though
[2:30:49] RubelliteFae: But it's fun to have some mechanical setbacks. Makes you think more laterally and have more fun RP
[2:30:51] Arnhawl: In the only DnD I've done I played a super charismatic Kobold and it was a great time LUL
[2:31:09] Zwyley: Me over here with my first paladin being a dragonborn.
[2:31:37] Ruffyluvy: the best characters i've played have been the ones I've rolled low ability scores on.
[2:31:44] Hodgelett: You're Rping Bullroarer Took?
[2:31:49] SwyfteWinter: Now that I think about it, it does not really make much sense for characters to have modifiers tied to race at all anyway, since all your characters are genuinely superhuman. The average human commoner is 10 across the board, whereas a 5e character is considered weak if they do not have anything higher than 15
[2:31:59] binary_sys: @retro_processor I dont rp in wow but I think having "odd" race class combos is great, like tauren rogues LUL
[2:32:04] RubelliteFae: I guess that's what house rules are for. I think players are too OP in D&D anyway. Lot's of powercreep ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

[2:32:32] hansanpaints: hah! titties under wraps. what a wordplay
[2:32:35] Ruffyluvy: And yeah that is the other side of it, no one ever has to play "rules as written", take it as a basis then do what you want.
[2:32:52] benjambles: But there is an issue in making your species largely just a cosmetic given the history/conflicts set up in the universe
[2:32:57] Davidofsmeg: It's fine these rants are perfect for the Jingle cats video

[2:33:19] hansanpaints: briony has been very brave this year. doing so much things
[2:33:23] retro_processor: @binary_sys I really wanted them to have undead paladins.. i get the lore reason, but there's something about making characters at odds with themselves that i find interesting
[2:33:23] SwyfteWinter: PF2e has a really interesting way of doing stat increases, I think I was an elf and I got 3 stat bonuses, one of which should be in dex. I cannot remember if that is how it was or not
[2:33:32] Arnhawl: Tabu brionyAww

[2:33:39] Ruffyluvy: When to we get Rhythian on Mystery Quest?
[2:33:39] android__99: this game ripped off colony survival
[2:33:44] Scarf1991: speaking of LOTR and D&D, the cast of Critical Role cosplayed as the Fellowship on their Halloween episode!
[2:33:56] ChisRift51: TABU
[2:33:58] RufusTheHairyCatWrangler: I'm a big fan of the tiny girl, giant sword trope sp I like it when games enable that. But that's for the player character only, since they are the hero.
[2:34:32] binary_sys: @retro_processor in theory we will get that at some point but paladins are some of the hardest to impliment due to art and design requirements I believe :(

[2:47:45] Cetsuo: the Hellstrom household sounds like a Lovecraft story
[2:47:54] Purple_Chewbacca: is it like how americans say 'jones residence'
[2:47:56] Cetsuo: *hellstrand
[2:48:07] benjambles: Surely not on the mobile where you have peoples names saved?
[2:48:10] Ruffyluvy: I use the Pixel phone call screening...
[2:48:11] Arnhawl: if they're calling me they already know who I am

[2:48:18] darth_baggins: Just pick up the phone and open with "Talk to me."
[2:48:20] Faaafv: why would you introduce yourself they are calling you
[2:48:25] RufusTheHairyCatWrangler: It's up to the person calling to introduce themself, they are the one calling you
[2:48:29] Stefnos: Bunny-household, the resident of the house speaking
[2:48:33] SwyfteWinter: Because "Briony" is a forename, I pictured an entire household filled with Briony clones
[2:48:33] Hodgelett: It's like the answerphone messages your dad would leave with 'you have reach the X family, if you are not a cold caller or sales please leave a message'
[2:48:34] captainwowzerz: i dont answer the phone
[2:48:36] falla_softpaw: "The Bucket residence, the lady of the house speaking!"
[2:48:36] PopeOsama: I have to call a lot of people at work, and I hate getting the people who just grumpily say hello and not their name because I don't know if I got the right number
[2:48:39] b00a: sometimes I call myself just to get a call history
[2:48:39] silentp13426: @RufusTheHairyCatWrangler agreed
[2:48:42] DariusHasDogs: Just pick up the phone and say "gamer?"
[2:48:44] hansanpaints: these islanders, so rood
[2:48:45] SketchThisWave: I like the Italian way of answering phones. "Pronto" just Ready!
[2:48:54] SwyfteWinter: My grandma did that too!
[2:48:56] RovioFin: Kirsty just doing heavy breathing to anwser
[2:48:59] benjambles: Tell them your number is ex-directory and you'll sue the sh(t out of them. That's a fun game
[2:49:05] Ruffyluvy: "moshi moshi"
[2:49:09] AnalogueDroid: my parents did that yeah
[2:49:12] Hodgelett: Alexander Graham Bell wanted us to answer 'aye aye'
[2:49:15] Mr_Revus: is rythian registered for the "call a swede" number?
[2:49:20] Mr_Revus: ?!
[2:49:20] Dyilinn: I got called by my HR a couple of weeks ago and i thought it was a scam call and put the phone down. Had to write an awkward apology mail to HR KEKW
[2:49:23] Ruffyluvy: "Hellstrand, desu"
[2:49:32] PerkulatorBenny: Apparently that's a French thing. I heard they pretty much answer with "Hello, I'm listening." Because if you're calling them, you want to talk to them and know who they are, and if not you don't need to know who they are. :P
[2:49:36] SwyfteWinter: Power move is to answer the phone with an industrial-strength anime noise.
[2:49:38] 3v1lc0w: PEEPERS
[2:49:52] Hodgelett: @Dyilinn unfortunately I can get work related jobs from 'unknown' callers. Means I have to answer everything
[2:49:57] b00a: Yes this is dog OhMyDog
[2:49:59] silentp13426: @PerkulatorBenny I'm gonna have to try and use that one
[2:50:01] Dyilinn: Sounds a lot likeblaming

[2:51:07] captainwowzerz: what about 53 boatloads of soup?
