[0:09:28] Nexhunter: @complexprotein yeaaaaap

[0:09:32] Mike190Twitch: 3k flip KEKW
[0:09:35] Driitzz: 70% more expensive than a 3080 for less than 10% performance gain if you get it at MSRP , is it worth it ?
[0:09:45] Nexhunter: like it is great to spread away from microcenter but like shit even us central mass got fucked sadKEK @complexprotein
[0:09:52] complexprotein: @Nexhunter Least here in AZ it's actually in Phoenix KEKW

[0:10:32] Nexhunter: 3070ti will be same for best buy to avoid the bots
[0:10:36] Driitzz: also a 3080TI is a 3090 cut in half , so they make 2 3080Ti instead of a 3090 which is 1500$ , shouldnt the price of a 3080Ti be 750$ then ? Yes. it should
[0:10:37] Cry0S: I'm comfy with my 3080, but I can def see the value

[0:19:38] UncleBen2689: competing for 30 cards is better than competing for none
[0:19:41] complexprotein: LTT did a mini game you had to play and beat in order to queue @Giantwaffle
[0:19:44] Duckaerobics: Tie the purchase queue to a drivers license and social like when you sign up for a bank account kekw

[0:19:47] priam__: LUL

[0:20:40] BobPatience: that's not fair for unlucky people
[0:20:42] Nexhunter: @Sn00zr minus the fact they opened up the elite program to active forum posters besides active evga product owners sadKEK
[0:20:45] Cry0S: It sucks but it's supply/demand
[0:20:45] aeadon: @Giantwaffle lets do mail catalogs and you can request it via your address, like absentee ballots KEKW
[0:20:46] luminousAJ: nvidia's golden ticket!
[0:20:49] MrHashbrowns: firt come first serve no swapsies

[0:20:56] Sn00zr: @Nexhunter Really?! WTF
[0:20:57] Tabakhase: i think " 3 days of camping" is bullshit -- but so is "arrive 1 minute before and get lucky with lottery" is assy too...
[0:20:59] Macari_: Newegg shuffle is the best model
[0:21:11] 4rakthis: that's kinda of fair...we have x amount of cards...thefirsy

[0:21:37] Macari_: There are bots that can bypass the best buy system. It's so fucked waffle
[0:21:39] ShirtyElm: LIL
[0:21:42] bee_mow: it should be lottery. not everyone can 'no-life' in a line for 3 days in advance. people have lives - work, family, responsibilities.
[0:21:42] Driitzz: lottery / giveaway / raffle are illegal in quebec KEKW
[0:21:44] JadedOnyx19: yah wtf lol
[0:21:45] complexprotein: I'd give blood for a card
[0:21:47] RamseyRinehaus: there are always going to be losers in any model, but lottery is at least giving most people an even chance at getting one
[0:21:47] Crack9860: we aint fbi
[0:21:50] Venxuri: you're lucky its possible to even get it in your country, eastern europe 0% chance you get one LUL
[0:21:53] Chronoes: This reminds me of the waiting lists for cars in the USSR
[0:21:58] 4rakthis: if they have 40 cards...the first 40 people in line get it
[0:21:59] Sn00zr: @Nexhunter Damn, that sucks. I thought it would be more exclusive.
[0:22:03] McFatbutt: KEKW give credit card info, ssn, everything
[0:22:04] McFatbutt: KEKW
[0:22:05] BobPatience: elif KEKW

[0:22:12] Moobot: You can sub to Waffle by clicking this neat link -> twitch.tv/giantwaffle/subscribe
[0:22:20] Goldenlion5648: use sublime?
[0:22:23] DaGMC: does vscode support it?
[0:22:33] Tabakhase: you dont need pattern matching there anyhow
[0:22:49] Macari_: I program like that BibleThump
[0:22:56] QwyIl: According to the Pycharm dev tracker it will be in Pycharm 2021.2
[0:22:58] Nexhunter: @Sn00zr yea the associate program is the elite of elite now KEKW
[0:23:03] Driitzz: thats exactly like switches , does python support switches ?
[0:23:10] Apparentthreat: any reason you're using pycharm and not just a generic IDE that supports multiple languages?
[0:23:15] DaGMC: @Giantwaffle Tabakhase is right, the one block could be optimized with an simple if
[0:23:25] ZyianDev: just disable that check
[0:23:37] Apparentthreat: or do all IDEs have this issue when a new version comes out?
[0:23:41] JacobSolo: What about PyCharm EAP?
[0:23:41] Nexhunter: https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/PY-47446 and for your pattern matching in pycharm here is the issue tracking to watch
[0:23:43] Nexhunter: @Apparentthreat yes
[0:23:44] n8level: seems costly compared to elifs
[0:23:44] aeadon: you could just use switch and have statements fall through
[0:23:45] Liquighost: just hide red lines :)
[0:23:51] Nexhunter: @Apparentthreat pylance for VS Code isn't updated yet either
[0:23:58] thomasyeet_vip: i think we should hunger games for the graphics card
[0:24:03] JacobSolo: EAP is that @Giantwaffle
[0:24:05] JadedOnyx19: Do we have a plan for today or we just goin?

[0:24:44] n8level: coffee talk without the coffee
[0:25:02] skylers_ok: just hopped in what is he working on?
[0:25:19] Tabakhase: pull it wider, less ANDs in the ifs
[0:25:31] realkingphilippe: Use case Kappa
[0:25:42] realkingphilippe: Python cries
[0:25:43] aepervius: can't you solve this with a decision matrix ?
[0:25:44] Goldenlion5648: does the matching work on line 13?
[0:25:48] Goldenlion5648: with the pipe
[0:25:56] thebrawno: It would be more Pythonic to use just if's and else ifs
[0:25:59] QwyIl: Based on last years release (which 2021.1 followed), 2021.2 would come out at the end of July

[0:26:15] sogerr: are we going to have No Mans Sky today? peepoShy
[0:26:26] Tabakhase: you pattern matching a number on a number Pepega
[0:26:27] Goldenlion5648: 2 | 3 is bitwise or, no?

[0:26:48] Venxuri: "& hope you go for a long time" pls dont go Sadge
[0:26:49] SakoK: you can pattern match on math true, then case with the condition
[0:26:55] SakoK: match*
[0:26:57] hunterdotorg: anyone in chat wanna help me with an omnifactory power issue? i'm going nuts rn haha
[0:27:01] nxusr: @Goldenlion5648 not in 3.10 match expressions
[0:27:01] Sn00zr: @Nexhunter I cant even login to EVGA right now... WTF
[0:27:09] realkingphilippe: Ups Airfore, Airforce muscle memory
[0:27:10] Shmelf: Don't tell my boss though
[0:27:11] Airfore: air4 Kappa thank you everyone keep up the work imma be lurking :)
[0:27:23] luminousAJ: imagine watching waffle in high school & now some people in chat went through med school
[0:27:31] nxusr: you can do match (foo, bar): case (10, None) for ANDs
[0:27:35] SakoK: @giantwaffle read my earlier msg
[0:27:40] Driitzz: stackoverflow say you can replace that with a dictionary or lambda they have a few examples
[0:27:41] thebrawno: switch case in Python is a long standing open issue
[0:27:54] realkingphilippe: Waffle's beard is so 4K when he goes full screen
[0:27:56] Crack9860: cheer1000
[0:28:00] Crazyfox55: C# supports switches with pattern matching
[0:28:02] Tabakhase: but youre not using any of thsi YEP
[0:28:05] Apparentthreat: bitties PogChamp
[0:28:05] n8level: @SakoK LU
[0:28:05] SeanTKE: you could always use a library that implements switch / case as a function
[0:28:06] Goldenlion5648: @nxusr he is using an if statement == (2 | 3) which is bitwise, no?
[0:28:08] aur1so: AYAYA
[0:28:13] Shmelf: getting my vaccine tomorrow
[0:28:17] DaGMC: if x in ("get", "obj"): # is the same
[0:28:19] hunterdotorg: chat and waffle, do y'all have a resource you use for omnifactory help
[0:28:44] nxusr: @nxusr lol I missed that, yeah that would be bitwise or
[0:28:54] Chronoes: @DaGMC no? it matches on a list of 2, where the first element is "get" and second is assigned to a variable
[0:28:55] ItsOnMax: Morning Waffle and chat!
[0:29:01] chochi314: @Giantwaffle Your "sum(..) == (2 | 3 | ..)" will not work as you expected, try e.g: "3 == (1 | 2)" (it returns "True")

[0:29:11] minedmatrix: minedmatrix subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months! 
[0:29:26] nxusr: @Giantwaffle you can do and with match (foo, bar): case (10, 20). this is the same as if foo == 10 and bar == 20
[0:29:29] Goldenlion5648: | is bitwise or in if statement
[0:29:34] n8level: bitwise OR and logical OR not quite same
[0:29:46] DaGMC: @Chronoes mk, I'm currently on 3.9, doesn't use the new feature
[0:29:50] Crazyfox55: open a python terminal and test it
[0:29:51] Slymph: KEKW

[0:30:57] loafabreadly: Woah this is a cool Minecraft mod KomodoHype
[0:31:09] Wulthan_: Waffle did you take a look into Screeps? Its a programming game where you have to control a hive of workers etc. and build it up, kind of strategy-game like
[0:31:18] Chronoes: "sum(roll) in (2,3,12)" will actually work as expected, it's a bitwise OR otherwise
[0:31:20] Slymph: susHmm
[0:31:21] chochi314: "sum(roll) == (2 | 3 | 12)" is same as "sum(roll) == 15"
[0:31:23] MrSmokey013: nice one chat
[0:31:30] Tabakhase: 3 in [ 2, 4, 7] is what you want likely @Giantwaffle
[0:31:41] Tabakhase: IN
[0:31:41] Chronoes: in
[0:31:48] nikalehuh: brakets
[0:31:49] 0x000000: in []
[0:31:49] Goldenlion5648: use in [ nums]
[0:31:56] chochi314: sum(roll) in [2, 3, 12]
[0:31:57] DaGMC: | is bitwise OR => +
[0:32:01] Goldenlion5648: ^
[0:32:07] Chronoes: KEKW
[0:32:07] Apparentthreat: type "or"
[0:32:10] Crack9860: cheer500 cant wait for pizza tomorow. should get next badge with this one
[0:32:16] Goldenlion5648: reee
[0:32:32] DaGMC: its already python Kappa
[0:32:45] Goldenlion5648: or does not work right here
[0:32:47] nxusr: you'd have to do sum(roll) in (2, 3 12)
[0:32:57] 0x000000: it won't work this way
[0:32:58] joaofcmb: gonna fail cause you're comparing num with bool
[0:33:01] t_a_t_s_u_r_o: no more nms sadge
[0:33:05] ZyianDev: For that red squiggle errors you can add # noqa on each line to surpress the warning per line
[0:33:06] nxusr: (2 or 3 or 12) will become just a True
[0:33:11] Aarimous: Future waffle problem
[0:33:12] joaofcmb: Or maybe do some weird type conversion shit
[0:33:12] Shmelf: haven't had wendys or fastfood in a while myself
[0:33:14] Kooven: chicken nuggies
[0:33:15] JadedOnyx19: Fuck yeah live yo life
[0:33:15] FrostedSentry: mmmm wendys ftw
[0:33:15] Chronoes: what @nxusr said
[0:33:15] thatguymarckonov: KFC for life
[0:33:21] engram: I’m eating that right now haha
[0:33:25] chochi314: @Giantwaffle still bad "3 == (2 or 3)" is "False"
[0:33:25] johndontmiss1: double dave is the best fast food burger
[0:33:26] Apparentthreat: why would it just be true?
[0:33:31] Jypy93: How was your pizza last night ? :D
[0:33:34] SchroTN: The bourbon burger wendys has is pretty damn good
[0:33:36] FrostedSentry: wife is headed to best buy... cross those fingies cohhSip
[0:33:37] SkywardDev: Bcuz they are not 0 @Apparentthreat
[0:33:45] chochi314: Currently it is same as "sum(roll) == 2"
[0:33:45] SkywardDev: 0 is False
[0:33:46] nxusr: @Apparentthreat downcasting to boolean
[0:33:49] Nexhunter: @FrostedSentry way too late
[0:33:52] daemonaedryn: So the ads worked Kappa
[0:33:52] Desszo: KEKW
[0:33:54] Mike190Twitch: Its been storming for a day now, here in Tennessee
[0:33:54] Shmelf: is that how ads work?
[0:33:56] Winner5001: KEKW, aggresive marketing
[0:33:59] dasmako: they will just show you more ads if you buy it LUL
[0:34:06] bee_mow: bullied into buying LUL
[0:34:10] Stillglade: that will teach them to advertise to you...
[0:34:12] DecoyOcelot: so glad yesterday was sunny. i was able to mow the lawn before all the rain

[0:34:56] ZyianDev: https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/disabling-and-enabling-inspections.html#suppress-inspections
[0:35:12] Tabakhase: == just compares
[0:35:14] DaGMC: or => logic or, | => bitwise or
[0:35:15] Crazyfox55: | is a math operator
[0:35:16] Goldenlion5648: this is checking if sum is not 0 currently
[0:35:23] nxusr: bitwise OR of 2, 3, 12 will take all the ones in the binary representation of it and OR that together
[0:35:27] 0x000000: because 0x01 | 0x10 will become 0x11
[0:35:30] joaofcmb: Cause it's bitwise, you're thinking logical or
[0:35:37] Vizzlou: What are you trying to create?
[0:35:42] chochi314: Try in Python interpreter "(2 | 3 | 12)" and "(2 or 3 or 12)"
[0:35:46] Chronoes: (2 or 3 or 12) is always equal to 2, btw
[0:35:46] Stoods_: 2 | 3 is 01 | 11 = 11
[0:36:01] Tabakhase: == has nothing todo with and/or wtf you talkn about LUL
[0:36:09] SeanTKE: bitwise or is an operator so you get back the operand not a comparison
[0:36:11] Chronoes: just try it in the interpreter
[0:36:19] chochi314: You can write "2" instead of "(2 or 3 or 12)"
[0:36:19] Goldenlion5648: ^
[0:36:25] Rolnaro: if you want to check if roll is in a set use "in"
[0:36:33] Goldenlion5648: interpretter?
[0:36:34] SkywardDev: And (2 or 3 or 12) is always True
[0:36:40] chochi314: You need to use "in [..."
[0:36:41] 0x000000: expression on the brackets evaluated first and then compared with sum()
[0:36:45] Rolnaro: the set is defined as set = {1,3,5}
[0:36:47] Chronoes: you need to do "in (2,3,12)" if you want to check for multiple values
[0:36:53] Thief2K: chat what is Waffle coding now?
[0:37:02] nxusr: yeah that's the best way
[0:37:02] Goldenlion5648: that is correct
[0:37:03] Rolnaro: curly braces
[0:37:04] DaGMC: just use a tuple (2, 3, 12)
[0:37:22] Styzer369: you have 200€ to invest into crypto, what crypto would you buy?
[0:37:33] Tabakhase: sum(roll) == (2 or 3) -- becomes sum(roll) == true, then 5 == true, then false
[0:37:41] FrostedSentry: ETH, hands down
[0:37:44] Goldenlion5648: same issue in dont_pass_line_bet
[0:38:01] Goldenlion5648: and the elifs
[0:38:07] Shmelf: I'm going to start taking profits out of coins and slapping them into stable coins and enjoy that sweet, sweet interest
[0:38:20] johnny_dan: dont forget to replace ( with [ cuz ur using an array now since you have a comma

[0:38:32] aur1so: spaces
[0:38:37] HyperHydroX: or does it ?
[0:38:38] ItsOnMax: Does not matter, but spaces is for readabillity
[0:38:41] HyperHydroX: i like spaces
[0:38:41] nxusr: in general, I just use pyfmt and don't care about style
[0:38:43] bugsplatter23: Im 50/40 ETH/BTC with the last 10 in whatever others
[0:38:44] philipkatis: Use what you think is more readable
[0:38:46] ultimathot: its a linting preference, but typically devs use spaces
[0:38:50] QuesoBad0nga: let the ide format it
[0:38:56] Slowkill333: use pylint
[0:38:56] Shmelf: @DaGMC Mines for you or mines for them? lol
[0:38:57] Driitzz: machine doesnt care , your whole code would be written on 1 line and be fine with it
[0:39:01] chochi314: Spaces (but it is highly subjective, and source of lot's of disagreement in bigger teams)
[0:39:11] SeanTKE: I would put spaces if I was using variables and no spaces if I'm representing a fraction like 1/3
[0:39:13] Tabakhase: you can let it dreformat "only selected text"
[0:39:15] Chronoes: I usually use autoformatting for most cases anyway these days KEKW
[0:39:15] Tabakhase: but ye
[0:39:16] Goldenlion5648: anyone know some jobs that can be automated with python?
[0:39:16] QuesoBad0nga: yes it wont do nothing
[0:39:19] Stoods_: Yeah, i like to do no spaces with * and / but spaces with + and -
[0:39:27] johnny_dan: There is a standard called 'PEP', which is now at version 8 (PEP 8) if you are interested
[0:39:31] chochi314: Python probably has some recommendation (some other languages does not have)
[0:39:41] DaGMC: @ShmelfShmelfShmelf Mines for you in safe manner, so hackers cant get your cryptos, WTF they are selling
[0:39:44] johnny_dan: there are things like this for almost all popular languages, even PHP has 'PSR'
[0:39:45] complexprotein: Do we know when DOGE goes live on CB Pro? I'm thinking of flipping it like when ADA went on.
[0:39:45] dasmako: pepperoni?
[0:39:56] Tabakhase: click PEP index YEP
[0:40:01] chochi314: You can look at PEP-8
[0:40:04] fbidumont: @giantwaffle PEP are the standard, for nomenclature look at pep8
[0:40:04] JBourden: when does bill take control its been 35 mins
[0:40:14] nxusr: PEP is Python Enhancement Proposals
[0:40:33] LinearLayer: widepeepoHappy Style
[0:40:37] Chronoes: @johnny_dan you sure you know you're talking about? PEP numbers are just proposal numbers, not versions
[0:40:39] DaGMC: tabs or spaces
[0:40:47] SkywardDev: @Giantwaffle You can get code formatter plugins that adhere to this standard and auto-format when you save the document.
[0:40:52] Dazakii: "whitespace in expressions"
[0:40:57] ultimathot: thats for indentation
[0:41:31] LinearLayer: @DaGMC Tabs 100%. people can adjust sizes of indentations and it saves memory ;)
[0:42:05] Chronoes: almost, but all operators without spaces is bad
[0:42:21] QwyIl: Pycharm automatically makes formatting suggestions based on PEP8 iirc
[0:42:33] Tabakhase: some rules are left open on purpose so you can decide while doing codereview depending on if you like the dev or not Kappa
[0:42:35] DaGMC: @LinearLayer many issues told me that space is better, but its a preference
[0:42:39] brorr: Do whatever is the most readable to you. As long as you are't working in projects it doesn't matter
[0:42:39] Valentin_PV: I was hoping for more no man's sky
[0:43:02] LinearLayer: @DaGMC Im actually curious, can you elaborate?
[0:43:10] Tabakhase: betas here "EAP" @Giantwaffle https://www.jetbrains.com/de-de/resources/eap/
[0:43:12] Legopiraat: You can try the EAP Version of Pycharm maybe that helps

[0:51:07] luminousAJ: yeah youll need sata power
[0:51:11] Miestro: there could be user locks on the partition from windows too
[0:51:11] Wazix11: That wont work, those cables usually only work for the 2.5 inch drives
[0:51:16] DaGMC: @Giantwaffle have you seen the video about the paper claiming that SgrA* is an object made of dark matter ?

[0:51:42] ruccoa: that's what some site I found said
[0:51:42] Eksitus_: the 2.5'' and 3.5'' drives have different power requirements for sata
[0:51:56] AzrekenSchamane: the second you recover your wallet doge will dump to 1ct KEKW

[0:52:37] Akunin_EQ: I use those all the time
[0:52:40] Eksitus_: platter drives are 3.5''
[0:52:47] ThatOnneGuy: fuennii wallpaper engine I believe
[0:52:48] ultimathot: yeah not 3.5
[0:52:50] Tabakhase: 3.5platters can be iffy, 2.5platter should be no issue unless its a 10k-rpm
[0:53:02] Fuennii: thanks ThatOnneGuy
[0:53:04] eEKBAh: it works with laptop sized platter drives which I guess is 2.5
[0:53:04] FlammAlpha: the USB power is enough for SSD, HDD might work, but could also cause problems
[0:53:07] ruccoa: between jan and feb of 2014 it jumped from 300 to 1200, so it'll be somewhere in the middle for what you earned, so it's potentially more than 150 doge per day
[0:53:09] Akunin_EQ: Power req is same for all SATA and SSD with that connector
[0:53:26] Stoods_: Could be drivers too hdds are very complicatied
[0:53:33] Schowzy: Remember folks, molex to sata, lose all your data

[4:03:30] DewDragon: waffleNS
[4:03:36] DrHax_: instructions unclear, closed my eyes
[4:03:45] mechoriet: @Dannythebrill13 like the game or irl?
[4:03:50] PureSpider: DrHax_ too hard, go back
[4:03:53] Dannythebrill13: @mechoriet Game
[4:04:24] ZephMW: Kinda though, cause your fluid conduits will be become a bottleneck with how much steam they can move unless you go ender fluid conduits
[4:04:40] mechoriet: @Dannythebrill13 new version of game soon
[4:05:02] mechoriet: wafflePog seems like the whole damage and grip model has changed alot
[4:05:28] Dannythebrill13: @mechoriet I know, can't wait, so much more customisation so I can make the my team career 10x harder YEP

[4:06:20] ftrluke: waffleT4
[4:06:33] ZephMW: Shadow Word: Pain is priest in wow so probably that
[4:06:34] DemonicHell3: the wow priest spell is shadow word: pain
[4:06:35] Shadow_of_Pain: might be lol been here before XD
[4:07:08] Miestro: oh shadow of pain, I heard shadow word pain
[4:07:24] BobPatience: is that a KEKW
[4:07:25] deathmf: Yeah who would do that LUL
[4:07:28] omar_i_: Kappa
[4:07:29] PureSpider: confirmed, that stupid bamKEK

[4:07:38] PureSpider: NODDERS
[4:07:42] BaTu016: here it comes widePepeLaugh
[4:07:54] C0ldf1re: widePepeLaugh
[4:08:43] Rangetuur: you can remove that enderchest LUL
[4:09:33] aeadon: ender chest three blocks away KEKW
[4:09:33] Humphr3y: is there a ender tank
[4:09:33] Moobot: Support Waffle by using his Epic creator code: Giantwaffle
[4:10:26] DemonicHell3: now you can fix the stairs
[4:10:28] PureSpider: the input chest is literally like two blocks away from the output chest bamKEK
[4:10:29] JimTheShark: Is it on
[4:10:31] MJKalas: NODDERS
[4:10:54] YOUCEP: how much rf is this total?
[4:10:57] Humphr3y: b e a utiful
[4:10:58] PureSpider: fix stairs?
[4:11:05] Hyodo_P: You can hold the wrench and sneak + Left click the conduit to config the conduit without break anything
[4:11:14] PiitchFk: noob here, do u need 2 ender chest?
[4:11:14] Rangetuur: endechest is a little overkill :)
[4:11:16] PureSpider: nice igaG
[4:11:17] TarMonA: is the sugarcane  still hitting the floor??
[4:11:20] Foooks: do you need the enderchests now?
[4:11:32] Hyodo_P: You can do that with that hammer
[4:11:53] ThatOnneGuy: PiitchFk they're connected. It's just cleaner looking for this
[4:11:54] dax573: 2000 per input
[4:11:55] TarMonA: 2k per node @Giantwaffle
[4:12:26] xfrozev2: Use assembler table @Giantwaffle
[4:12:44] Fehdaykin: Can't the split them and have 2 cables?
[4:12:50] xfrozev2: It gives more
[4:13:02] Venxuri: luckily enough replacing enderio conduit is ez
[4:13:05] xfrozev2: Did you update to the dev version ?
[4:13:09] Hyodo_P: hurray power production
[4:13:27] ZephMW: wait, so you mean you can have like.... 10k running through the cable just only having 2k per attachment?
[4:13:31] ZephMW: @chat
[4:13:32] MrDocth: does this pack have wireless power ?
[4:13:40] ZephMW: like 2k i/o
[4:13:50] 8Shuffle: somebody said boner play? Kappa
[4:13:51] PureSpider: yes ZephMW
[4:14:45] TarMonA: @ZephMW  yes and if you want a machine  have 4k input just add another node/cable touch it
[4:15:05] lazermage24: Imagine your input chest is three blocks from an output chest and can be used else where LUL

[4:19:24] Silver_Skeeter: oh shit he is back. hide the cigs
[4:19:27] Invalidm_: insomniac. Its just way more rough then usual

[4:19:55] Mapleton: pepeSmoke this is maple leaves im smoking chat
[4:19:59] BobPatience: urines for it?
[4:20:23] DewDragon: insomnia is great. zero energy for 72ish hours then 14 hours of sleep. repeat
[4:20:26] raaggeeee: try tea
[4:21:01] Invalidm_: except for me its like maybe an hour or two of sleep
[4:21:02] SmokyMtnRed: Gary Coleman zombie are killers
[4:21:30] Miestro: do you mean... bitwise | or || or OR?
[4:21:32] Chronoes: you need to look up bitwise operations and what they do, they're math operations
[4:21:33] Miestro: OH
[4:21:37] Silver_Skeeter: peepoHmm
[4:21:47] daedmissica0: @Giantwaffle have you seen https://youtu.be/aocnh2Rv2u0 ?
[4:21:48] nxusr: bitwise 2 | 3 | 12 is 15
[4:21:51] chochi314: "(2 | 3 | 12)" is evaluated to "15"
[4:21:53] Chronoes: no, (2 or 3 or 12)  is always 2 due to short-circuiting
[4:21:56] TallicDragon: Order of operations
[4:21:57] daedmissica0: Perseverance Spots Petrified Wood ? | Did Green Vegetation exist on Mars ?
[4:22:08] Miestro: bitwise is a bit operation
[4:22:11] QwyIl: Yep, you're doing binary arithmatic
[4:22:14] Chronoes: "|" is not the same as "or"
[4:22:15] m3lm4n: bitwise "or" is an "arithmetic" operation like multiplication it just creates a new number
[4:22:20] nxusr: (2 or 3 or 12) will be True
[4:22:21] JimTheShark: 2 | 3 | 12 would work in typescript though
[4:22:25] InoUno: 10 | 11 | 1100 = 1111 = 15
[4:22:27] DigitalVortex92: or == || not |
[4:22:28] Miestro: binary arithmetic is NOT the same as logic or
[4:22:31] PureSpider: what InoUno said
[4:22:32] nxusr: bitwise OR means you take the binary representation and you OR the bits
[4:22:32] LordDynom: The first one stats your intentions better
[4:22:35] Miestro: google bitwise or for a visual example
[4:22:36] DaGMC: you could also 2 + 3 + 12
[4:22:40] Ebonmourn: it or's the bits together.. thats what bitwise or means @Giantwaffle
[4:22:40] chochi314: Bitwise or performs or bit by bit
[4:22:46] msfWEBdude: OR in bitwise is like addition
[4:22:49] PureSpider: 2 | 3 is just 3 though, wtf
[4:22:53] DatBlindArcher: bitwise plays with bits, normal or plays with true and false
[4:22:58] JimTheShark: bitwise or is functioning on the bits and you're trying to function on the ints
[4:22:59] spiwn: because it evaluates the things inside the () before ==. Even without the (), it would evaluate the | before the ==
[4:23:00] Nexhunter: oh boi evga starting to process the queue kyleisHmm
[4:23:01] nxusr: @Giantwaffle https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR
[4:23:04] Soul_Synergy: Turn the numbers into binary
[4:23:08] Miestro: no, bitwise is taking the binary values and oring each bit
[4:23:09] QwyIl: The "or" term is a unique python syntax to make chained ifs easier
[4:23:11] Soul_Synergy: then it looks at each position in them
[4:23:12] dylan0806: Google bitmasks
[4:23:13] DigitalVortex92: no
[4:23:20] msfWEBdude: but == is 15 == 15 not 15 is like bit matching or 15
[4:23:20] JimTheShark: No
[4:23:22] DonShadow: everyone in chat a coder now
[4:23:23] Miestro: no
[4:23:29] DatBlindArcher: bits overlap
[4:23:29] bobolpwnz: expression in the parenthesis is evaluated first
[4:23:32] wooodiii: 10 | 11 | 1100 = 1111 = 15
[4:23:35] C0ldf1re: peepoHmm . o ( Pepega )
[4:23:36] HailTheDemocracy: backseat coding kekw
[4:23:38] Astronaut_SIoth: Bitwise or is a mathematical operation, not a logical operation
[4:23:49] PureSpider: 2 | 3 | 12 == 15, neither 2 nor 3 nor 12 == 15
[4:23:49] SmokyMtnRed: murdaTink
[4:24:01] DigitalVortex92: input == 15 is the same as input is 15
[4:24:08] DigitalVortex92: == isn't a binary operator
[4:24:09] m3lm4n: @giantwaffle bitwise "or" is an "arithmetic" operation like multiplication it just creates a new number. It;s like sum(input) == 2 * 2
[4:24:14] nxusr: nah input == 15 is fine
[4:24:28] nxusr: "is" can be dodgy because it does id checks
[4:24:30] chochi314: 2 is 0b0010, s is 0b0011, 12 is 0b1010, so it is 0b0010 | 0b0011 | 0b1100, which is 0b1111 (which is 15) [if there is 1 in any number it is 1 in result at same position]
[4:24:40] Miestro: & is a bitwise and && is logic and
[4:24:42] DigitalVortex92: &&, ||, ==, ++, -- <--- NONE of those are bitwise.
[4:24:59] DigitalVortex92: You can though. Its interchangable
[4:25:00] professorSlow: is in python literally means it is the exact same object in address space, i believe
[4:25:07] DigitalVortex92: no
[4:25:07] Soul_Synergy: In python && is AND
[4:25:08] DatBlindArcher: yes
[4:25:08] Apparentthreat: I thought && and || don't exist in python?
[4:25:10] Soul_Synergy: no
[4:25:11] DigitalVortex92: That wouldn't work
[4:25:12] Nexhunter: not in python
[4:25:12] omar_i_: You should use debug more often Waffle, you would see what are the values of variables at any line
[4:25:13] bobolpwnz: no
[4:25:14] Nexhunter: cause they don't exist
[4:25:15] PureSpider: no
[4:25:18] DigitalVortex92: 2 || 3 || 12 is always try
[4:25:20] PureSpider: bitwise or is NOT logical or
[4:25:21] DigitalVortex92: true*
[4:25:23] DatBlindArcher: ah not in python ye
[4:25:23] Nexhunter: and | and & is bitwise operations
[4:25:24] Nexhunter: not logic
[4:25:25] DaGMC: you use & when you bitwise and
[4:25:28] JimTheShark: Oh that is what works in typescript
[4:25:31] DigitalVortex92: anything not 0 is true IIRC
[4:25:35] ruccoa: bitwise and-ing integers outputs an integer value not a binary value
[4:25:35] Moobot: You can find Waffle's Youtube channel here - https://youtube.com/giantwaffle
[4:25:38] chochi314: Important thing is order of evaluation - bracket is evaluated first
[4:25:42] Nexhunter: @JimTheShark yea python uses and and or for && and ||
[4:25:45] Chronoes: bitwise OR is a math operation, logical OR is a boolean (discrete math) operation
[4:25:55] DigitalVortex92: yes
[4:25:56] Nexhunter: yes
[4:25:56] PureSpider: always indian people
[4:25:57] nxusr: yes
[4:25:58] PureSpider: yes
[4:25:59] Miestro: yes
[4:25:59] m3lm4n: yes
[4:25:59] JimTheShark: you can use both in python tho right @Nexhunter
[4:26:01] Soul_Synergy: yes
[4:26:01] Nexhunter: bit manipulations
[4:26:05] Nexhunter: @JimTheShark no
[4:26:05] PureSpider: ^ is xor
[4:26:06] DigitalVortex92: ^ = xor i though
[4:26:07] Miestro: ^ is XOR
[4:26:08] nxusr: ^ is XOR
[4:26:08] PureSpider: ~ is invert
[4:26:10] QwyIl: ^ is xor, ~ is not
[4:26:22] DaGMC: ~ should be not
[4:26:25] Nexhunter: @JimTheShark it fucked me up on my first real job cause it was my first real foray into python KEKW
[4:26:25] Ebonmourn: yes its left shift and right shift
[4:26:29] Apparentthreat: Nexhunter "python uses and and or for and and or" pepeLaugh
[4:26:29] JimTheShark: Ok well I have used both of those operators with python so apparently i'm doing something wrong
[4:26:34] PureSpider: penny dropped
[4:26:37] PureSpider: 4Head
[4:26:37] DigitalVortex92: We got there eventually danKEK
[4:26:37] FluoriteDH: EZ
[4:26:39] BobPatience: KEKW
[4:26:42] Miestro: hahah, yeah, electrical engineer should know this
[4:26:44] vuldure: EZ
[4:26:47] JimTheShark: not my main language though so I guess it doesn't matter that much
[4:26:48] Nexhunter: @JimTheShark yeap mehdiLAUGH
[4:26:49] wooodiii: 0010 | 0011 | 1100 = 1111 = 15
[4:26:49] Miestro: ROFL
[4:26:51] DigitalVortex92: @Giantwaffle As long as you understand & is bitwise, && is logical
[4:26:57] DatBlindArcher: KEKW
[4:26:59] BobPatience: twitch chat actually smarter than streamer wafflePog
[4:27:00] Luxen77: I need a 30 sec video to tell me everything I need to know
[4:27:07] InTheLittlePro: ECE101 Pog
[4:27:07] Nexhunter: bit operations are a whole lot of fun when doing flags
[4:27:07] Apparentthreat: start with this and end up w/ a computer. EZ
[4:27:07] PureSpider: what bothers me is that 2 | 3 is just == 3 igaSus
[4:27:17] Ebonmourn: He finally understands
[4:27:33] DigitalVortex92: @PureSpider Keepo k
[4:27:33] Chronoes: KEKW
[4:27:36] DigitalVortex92: danKEK *
[4:27:38] Chronoes: classic mistake
[4:27:43] DaGMC: it was called Digitaltechnik in school
[4:27:43] PureSpider: DigitalVortex92 carvemRage
[4:27:46] chochi314: to 15
[4:27:51] chochi314: 2 should not work
[4:27:56] PureSpider: DaGMC same bamKEK
[4:28:06] chochi314: (2 or 3 or 15) is 2
[4:28:17] Nexhunter: yes
[4:28:18] Chronoes: I mean, yes
[4:28:20] DatBlindArcher: What
[4:28:21] DigitalVortex92: @chochi314 (2 or 3 or 12) should be "true" not 2
[4:28:26] DatBlindArcher: I use them often for enum flags
[4:28:29] DigitalVortex92: because any number > 0 is true
[4:28:29] PureSpider: bitwise operators are ridiculously powerful, but you SHOULD know what you're doing bamKEK
[4:28:33] Miestro: I used bitwise stuff when I was doing hardware communication stuff, but that's it
[4:28:38] Nexhunter: yes
[4:28:39] Apparentthreat: why is it 2 and not 15? does it get truncated?
[4:28:41] nxusr: yeah (2 or 3 or 12) will evaluate to True
[4:28:43] JimTheShark: xor is literally the only thing I've ever used in actual code
[4:28:45] Ebonmourn: if its a logical operator then they default to the left most value or right most value @Giantwaffle
[4:28:52] DigitalVortex92: no no waffle
[4:28:57] DigitalVortex92: (2 or 3 or 12) evaluates to True
[4:28:59] Nexhunter: that is not 2
[4:28:59] Miestro: the last line there is best
[4:29:00] Nexhunter: that is True
[4:29:01] PureSpider: True, not 2
[4:29:08] Nexhunter: or is boolean logic
[4:29:12] DigitalVortex92: Any integer > 0 is true
[4:29:14] Chronoes: chat, did you even try it in the interpreter?
[4:29:17] DaGMC: @PureSpider did you also work with this giant briefcases/boxes which you could chain in serial
[4:29:17] C0ldf1re: peepoHmm
[4:29:22] PureSpider: because 0 is falsey, everything > 0 is truthy
[4:29:26] Nexhunter: so 2 is True, 3 is True, 12 is True
[4:29:28] DigitalVortex92: so its true or true or true LUL
[4:29:28] chochi314: @DigitalVortex92 Try in Python console, it evaluates to 2
[4:29:32] PureSpider: DaGMC yes :D
[4:29:33] Nexhunter: and True or True or True is True
[4:29:37] TallicDragon: The numbers get cast to booleans, so the whole expression is equivalent to (true or true or true)
[4:29:38] foxtail_q: wait, you comparing int to boolean?
[4:29:42] InoUno: Depending on the language, 2 or 3 or 12 is either 2 or truthy
[4:29:52] Nexhunter: Falsey or Truthy
[4:29:52] JimTheShark: Does Python have truthy and falsey values instead of just true and false?
[4:29:52] Negorath: pretty much, yeah
[4:29:55] Chronoes: no, (2 or 3 or 12) evaluates to 2 because of short-circuiting. try it in interpreter
[4:29:55] Miestro: yeah
[4:29:56] PureSpider: as truthy, yes
[4:29:58] LordDynom: implicit conversoin
[4:29:58] Nexhunter: @JimTheShark yes
[4:30:06] Luxen77: If LUL > than 0, then LUL = true
[4:30:07] professorSlow: @JimTheShark yes.
[4:30:07] Nexhunter: it is Truthy in boolean logic
[4:30:09] QwyIl: This is why I hate dynamically typed languages
[4:30:09] PureSpider: 0 is falsey, 2 is truthy
[4:30:11] JimTheShark: So None == False ?
[4:30:13] chochi314: x or y or z or ... just returns first value, which when converted to boolean is true
[4:30:13] Ebonmourn: yes
[4:30:19] DigitalVortex92: @chochi314 it may OUTPUT 2, but its implicitly converted to True
[4:30:27] PureSpider: it's not true, but it will evaluate to true = truthy
[4:30:27] professorSlow: @JimTheShark empty objects tend to be Falsy
[4:30:29] Ebonmourn: a positive int in Python is 'True'
[4:30:29] Nexhunter: it means it can be viewed as True in boolean operations
[4:30:30] DaGMC: @PureSpider it was fun building a counter with carry flag and multiple cases chained
[4:30:34] Nexhunter: but it isn't a boolean
[4:30:44] C0ldf1re: KEKW
[4:30:49] DigitalVortex92: It means "loosely" true
[4:30:52] Miestro: it's from javascript. mostly
[4:30:52] Nexhunter: it is when you're talking about values that are not actually booleans @Giantwaffle
[4:30:54] DigitalVortex92: or Loosely false
[4:30:54] BlainL: truth, thruthy, the truthiest
[4:30:57] PureSpider: because "" is not == false, but it will evaluate to false, so it's "falsey"
[4:31:02] Chronoes: truthy because it's not True, it's a value that evaluates to True if used in boolean context
[4:31:09] DigitalVortex92: It's where a value has an implicit value other than it's own when comparing basically
[4:31:12] PureSpider: 1 is not equal to true, but it will evaliate to true, so it's truthy
[4:31:13] Nexhunter: yea cause strings are arrays
[4:31:14] JimTheShark: Truthy means basically "if there is a value" and falsey means "if there is not a value"
[4:31:16] Ebonmourn: Truthness... truthy is faster to say
[4:31:23] professorSlow: Truthy sort of meaning, not True.. but something is there, Falsy sort of meaning.. not False, but nothing is there @Giantwaffle
[4:31:24] johnny_dan: Well a string is an array of chars
[4:31:37] chochi314: '"sub" in "substring"' is "True"
[4:31:40] UnfitCheetah: did you get the ferro lantern?
[4:31:50] galaxy_berry: what did you think of No Mans Sky yesterday? I had to drop off while you were playing
[4:31:52] Nexhunter: oh wait does he know about is keyword yet KEKW
[4:31:53] Ebonmourn: contains would be a method of strings
[4:31:55] lazermage24: Imagine your input chest is three blocks from an output chest and can be used else where LUL
[4:32:00] DigitalVortex92: ""sub" in "substring"" is invalid LUL
[4:32:09] DigitalVortex92: "sub" in "substring" is true
[4:32:18] RoninStorm: @Giantwaffle you ever watch any of the Journey to the Microcosmos youtube channel? So fascinating! Is my new obsession...
[4:32:23] Nexhunter: chat he might not know about IS yet KEKW
[4:32:25] DigitalVortex92: otherwise your statement is "" sub " in " substring ""
[4:32:28] Nexhunter: let not confuse him more sykLaugh
[4:32:29] Mike190Twitch: If you can dodge a blaze you can dodge a ball
[4:32:36] professorSlow: all i see is chat explanation deluge, i am guilty, haha

[4:39:06] ThatOnneGuy: ppOverheat
[4:39:08] aundros: Cables can't insert into drawer fast enough
[4:39:09] Equandor: just invest in to auto breakers
[4:39:10] CD579: transfer limit of the cable?
[4:39:13] blackhawksfan97: item conduits are too slow?
[4:39:14] Rangetuur: maybe lower the tick
[4:39:15] Watertoad: need to speed up the pipes
[4:39:16] DigitalVortex92: Yeah you need 15 speed for max LUL
[4:39:20] C0ldf1re: more ppOverheat
[4:39:52] Venxuri: make like 10 stacks of it LUL
[4:40:01] TarMonA: @Giantwaffle  easy way it add  2nd or 3 node  to the collector
[4:40:11] rbrody: dont forget to log in and check your kingdom on runescape
[4:40:17] TarMonA: Yes
[4:40:19] aundros: it will work
[4:40:20] PureSpider: the cables transfer per side
[4:40:22] Juddo: yes, true
[4:40:23] PureSpider: not per cable
[4:40:23] TheUnrealOculus: translocator from vacuum chest to interface from AE2 with speed upgrades
[4:40:59] TarMonA: other way @Giantwaffle
[4:41:01] TheUnrealOculus: Yeah that works as well
[4:41:07] PureSpider: yes, both sides
[4:41:11] hypnoshroom333: pull items from more sides
[4:41:11] aundros: Both solutions work
[4:41:11] PureSpider: both "ends" of the cable
[4:41:12] Juddo: Yes. on the vac chest.
[4:41:25] panda_boots1: On vacuum chest
[4:41:26] dylan0806: On the vacuum chest
[4:41:27] Hyodo_P: make more Ender Chest and put on each vacuum chest directly? You can set the side of the vaccum chest to output mode
[4:41:40] TheUnrealOculus: y u need sugar cane
[4:41:40] Moobot: Support Waffle by using his Epic creator code: Giantwaffle
[4:41:41] PureSpider: add more cables to the vacuum chest, too
[4:41:49] musicmad1278: Wuddup

[4:42:04] aundros: TheUnrealOculus
[4:42:09] TheUnrealOculus: Ah ok
[4:42:13] TheUnrealOculus: makes sense
[4:42:25] TheUnrealOculus: I wasn't here for that part
[4:42:25] TarMonA: enderIO is base on nodes
[4:42:25] SHUHARI: Is everything chunkloaded that would be consuming the sugar cane?  Seemed to happen after you left dim, but is clearing out now..
[4:43:00] TheUnrealOculus: Deep mob learning uses way tooo much power
[4:43:08] TarMonA: you can have a machine need 4k input you can have 2 x2k inputs
[4:43:10] Amirh2296: @giantwaffle u gonna do vanilla hwrdcore anytime soon?
[4:43:35] TheUnrealOculus: infinite iron using zombies in deep mob learning

[4:45:01] Nexhunter: well time to go to my best buy KEKW
[4:45:33] TheUnrealOculus: is there any goal in omnifactory
[4:45:44] aman36000: Im sure you have answered this, but do you plan on going back to No Mans Sky?
[4:46:27] Tapeman83: I really enjoy the modpack, tho I do have to take breaks due to having to wait for stuff sometimes
[4:46:30] Igmatic: OmniFactory can be pretty grindy at the start, really need to automate everything
[4:46:46] Tapeman83: yeah, the automation helps a ton
[4:46:47] studse: What is wrong with the modpack?
[4:47:10] TheUnrealOculus: Gregtech is a really hard an annoying mod, but as soon as you can understand it, it's great
[4:47:16] Mike190Twitch: Game speeds up post DML for sure
[4:47:26] BlazingHotSand: !charm
[4:47:30] Tapeman83: the pack really starts once you have to start working with the hundreds of fluids, imo. and autocrafting
[4:47:52] Venxuri: @Mike190Twitch how are you doing on your 2nd playthrough?
[4:47:53] Nagapito: you also not helping yourself, focus on DLM; instead of scalling current infrastructure
[4:48:05] TarMonA: and only evga elite member able to order that BS
[4:48:10] Nagapito: and please, make a pickaxe!!
[4:48:39] Nagapito: start small on DLM and use small DLM to keep growing and growing
[4:48:52] DecoyOcelot: you can run one numismatic by hand to get started. one numi would make more power than most of this setup
[4:48:57] Mike190Twitch: @Venxuri In local video, im at 114th episode
[4:49:00] Tapeman83: I scaled up before I went hard on DML too, it's fine
[4:49:04] lazermage24: Please tell the guy with over 10K hours in minecraft and mod packs how to play
[4:49:24] Igmatic: Lol the backseat gaming is real

[4:51:33] Nexhunter: sadKEK oh not bricked
[4:51:45] C0ldf1re: sadKEK
[4:51:55] lazermage24: If you have a constant supply and put the items you need would it just continue to feed properly?
[4:52:03] realbobmaster: gregtech robot arms can keep an exact numbers of items in a machine and not overfill
[4:52:15] dax573: can use arms as covers to limit items
[4:52:32] Nexhunter: wtf KEKW
[4:52:33] DecoyOcelot: need a filter to limit items
[4:52:39] DecoyOcelot: with the robot arm*
[4:53:00] realbobmaster: You can configure them with a screwdriver
[4:53:20] Nagapito: he also needs MV to make automated DML....
[4:53:56] MiniApprentice: LocKed item drawer as a filter?
[4:53:59] Nagapito: automating DML and then making AE autocraft system are the biggest challenges in the pack
[4:54:26] SHUHARI: !modpack

[5:04:05] Apolleto: And December/January, they have 31 each
[5:04:06] Chronoes: your knuckles start and end with 31 days, so if you loop from the beginning, you get 31 and 31
[5:04:33] ShellingFord55: you always learn something new :D
[5:04:36] Rolnaro: sept = seven, oct = eight

[5:15:26] DewDragon: it is super relevant and dark
[5:15:31] Bow_Shock: I mean, there are usually at least 3 chests per building and you would be faster with a scanner, so maybe it is the lack of chests? swayncPray

[5:36:11] foxtail_q: @Giantwaffle you can buy ruby ore, crush it once and get chromium from electrolyze
[5:36:12] FalleNM3rC: thats basically the whole pack in that statement
[5:36:30] masztufa: in GTNH you could electrolyze clay dust (from terracotta) to get aluminium
[5:36:42] masztufa: electrolyzing ruby is a decent enough way tho
[5:36:47] TheUnrealOculus: god apple pog
[5:37:07] navalship55: God apple pog

[5:41:54] budcats1: when did thay bring that out where you can mine 9 spots at once
[5:41:55] Nagapito: that is on this pack, normal GT requires you to process the ore and its a lot of work
[5:41:58] daemonaedryn: KEKW
[5:42:05] PureSpider: thats a horrible analogy lol
[5:42:14] djfrankfurter: you crush twice
[5:42:18] Scopes64: it scales basically

[5:53:46] Watertoad: 90% of finals shouldn't matter unless the class is bad
