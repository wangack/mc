[1:05:45] RoddyWarlock: LOVE that game
[1:05:57] moja_nazwa1: The one boardgame that has a house in it
[1:06:01] uranarz: I find playing 'mock' games with  open hands and talking through plays is really helpful for learning new games
[1:06:01] starrymomo: always think positively: no board game is worse than the campaign for north africa, the game that takes more than 40 days of play time to complete *one* run.
[1:06:02] pufflemaster2: betrayal is GOOD
[1:06:21] xVoidPunkx: I've played so much of it bc the board game club in college loved playing it as an easygoing game but now I'm worn out for it
[1:06:24] XargonDragon: Dune is like that, it can take weeks
[1:06:25] Lady_Faust: I played that once. I ended up being like a vampire or something and slaughtered everyone
[1:06:28] LewiksR: Betrayal at house on the hill walked so Among Us could run
[1:06:28] sionnach46: How many runs are there?
[1:06:30] Lady_Faust: And no one suspected me
[1:06:31] RoddyWarlock: I have Betrayal, if I'm ever over I'll have to pack it
[1:06:34] moonymain: @starrymomo I think I know people who would enjoy that
[1:06:39] pufflemaster2: ngl would be down for betrayal at house on the hill board game night at some point
[1:06:48] Guffington: I once played the Game of Thrones version of Risk which is actually very much different from regular risk and actually super fun
[1:06:56] Royalkman1: i can help with moral support
[1:07:09] starrymomo: it's an absolutely insane game and the editors for it told the author they just. couldn't playtest it fully because it'd take like 7 years to fully go through every option.
[1:07:10] Kaaz87: i been playing Descent and we've been at it for a while at this point

[1:07:34] xVoidPunkx: yes
[1:07:39] LewiksR: Yes
[1:07:39] starrymomo: @moonymain i also know a few people who'd enjoy it!
[1:07:39] masonunderhill: Gamer monopoly
[1:07:40] Kaaz87: board and videogame
[1:07:41] RoddyWarlock: I've played Dead of Winter, that one's also really good

[1:07:51] xVoidPunkx: I think I've played it??
[1:07:53] pufflemaster2: cake has never died in winter
[1:08:14] ShadowDragon7015: I had a version of monopoly that had credit cards and it made it So Much Easier to count out money and do transactions. so I started using that credit card system with all of my other monopoly games. Monopoly City was my favorite.
[1:08:18] Guffington: I died once in the winter. 2/10 would not recommend
[1:08:33] sionnach46: "If you make us play you'll be dead in winter!"
[1:08:51] SealThisDeal: My friend made monopoly version based on the group of me and my two best friends and it is so good. The university is the prison and stuff puffle11Arson

[1:09:12] neroicss: be glad
[1:09:16] boxedfoxes: i get violently competitive when playing monopoly it is not pretty
[1:09:17] pufflemaster2: I think my favourite family/party board game is Quacks of Quedlinberg, it's very fun and the magic theming is exactly what I like from a game like that

[1:09:40] lurvic: monopoly is awfull, unless you can cheat by "robbing the bank"
[1:09:45] Guffington: Monopoly is weird because like, it's not meant to be "fun" because the original point was to show how awful capitalism was and stuff
[1:09:48] RoddyWarlock: It's always worth the reminder that Monopoly wasn't originally made to be fun

[1:10:28] Redsyrup27: I have Star Wars Monopoly and one of the chance cards was "Let the Wookie Win pay $50"
[1:10:29] starrymomo: @Guffington pretty ironic considering how big monopoly is now
[1:10:29] xVoidPunkx: classic board games are so good
[1:10:37] Hakneil: snakes and ladders? I want REAL snakes and REAL ladders
[1:10:38] MrsKaese: I have played many games of monopoly in my life. I have not lost a single one of them. I have however been broken up with and lost three very good friendships over monopoly. I have few regrets

[1:10:39] xVoidPunkx: I want chutes and ladders and candy land
[1:10:42] lurvic: Can i not use the forbidden word regarding basic income? no catboy noises for basic income?
[1:10:42] pufflemaster2: any game where you know you're going to lose within the first 15-30 minutes is a bad game, see Monopoly and Risk
[1:10:46] xVoidPunkx: TROUBLE

[1:56:14] sionnach46: Also putting keep inventory on.
[1:56:26] pufflemaster2: @mochimoss20 the energy required for the pushup is what pushes it into gay sloth month
[1:56:32] karolinetheelf: peaceful is great until you need string, bonemeal and other monster drops

[1:56:34] CelloGirl394: more hype then dashcon
[1:56:47] rabo1621: I like that you corrected "pride" (dumb attempt at doing a bit) into "proud" (actual words of affirmation)
[1:56:52] moonymain: I should absolutely be doing chest exercises but I just can't get myself to exercise
[1:56:57] mochimoss20: @CelloGirl394 Push up in the ballpit
[1:56:59] rabo1621: But both!
[1:57:16] karolinetheelf: @mochimoss20 that sounds unsanitary
[1:57:19] pufflemaster2: oh top tip for twitchcon: if they bring back the foam pit go nowhere near it
[1:57:28] rabo1621: I hope they get the ball pit from Dashcon

[1:58:11] XargonDragon: I can't wait for Twitchcon where cake will deadlift MacDara and throw him like a javelin, killing me instantly
[1:58:23] pufflemaster2: I may or may not have set myself a mini goal to try and make a fursuit (partial) before twitchcon, so I guess I'll just melt if that goes ahead
[1:58:27] Geoffistopheles: @XargonDragon geoffiReally No.
[1:58:28] moonymain: Okay so what's the ball pit about? I think I remember the foam pit but there's also a ball pit mentioned all over Tumblr and I don't get it
