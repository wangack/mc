[0:15:13] lighttsoul: It's only 89%
[0:15:17] TheOGSpaceDingo: nether side: you setup two separate portals. one to lure him through, a second more than 160 blocks away (20 in nether) for you
[0:15:20] eavolve: Derp Dank
[0:15:21] bookworm2692: you need a second portal yeah
[0:15:25] NoraTion__: Is it possible to put the warden in a minecart?
[0:15:33] TheOGSpaceDingo: the portal the warden goes through is setup so that he's locked until you do otherwise
[0:15:40] seibaby: Set up a noteblock-observer clock on the other side of the nether portal to lure it into a holding pen
[0:15:42] Tinker_it: woo, some dunga dunga dunga views!
[0:15:50] soulwolfsikbwm: wow
[0:15:53] TheOGSpaceDingo: wardens cannot mount minecarts
[0:16:00] secret_agent4706: @noration__ no
[0:16:05] alexyap0223: pearlieExcited
[0:16:11] TheOGSpaceDingo: wardens cannot mount anything full stop
[0:16:12] augustasman: so simple :) :)
[0:16:14] bluubuns: Noise machine temporarily?
[0:16:17] jasper_186: Also a trap to prevent re entry to the portal?
[0:16:19] castlebeki: 90% feinClap
[0:16:27] seibaby: Preparation is key!
[0:16:37] castlebeki: noise machine are the best
[0:16:39] bigducky70: you could alwas ask tango to give you a hand he is probably an expert an moving wardans in the nether by now.
[0:16:44] preparedman: @seibaby yeah!
[0:16:45] brian_of_farce: Bring lots of party poppers!
[0:16:48] TheOGSpaceDingo: 15s iirc
[0:16:48] zer0ntt: pearlieBoop pearlieBoop
[0:16:51] TheOGSpaceDingo: plenty of time
[0:17:03] castlebeki: no
[0:17:03] TheOGSpaceDingo: but mobs including warden usually dont just randomly pathfind through portals
[0:17:03] eshaan: Choo Chooo HypeChill
[0:17:04] castlebeki: piston
[0:17:07] dashmax1214: @bigducky70 Tango is asleep currently
[0:17:12] bluubuns: And lots and lots of wool‚Ä¶ Do you have a wool farm just in case?
[0:17:14] pichingopower: Yeah I think nether portal in roof is the best option
[0:17:18] TheOGSpaceDingo: you also gotta remember that after those 15s chunks will unload
[0:17:18] brian_of_farce: Oh snap WutFace
[0:17:24] seibaby: Dont wing it like Tango did, be methodical and set up something that's safe and reliable, like Doc pearlieHeart
[0:17:31] castlebeki: no you need to use a piston, I think noteblock were not enough but I might be wrong
[0:17:32] the_mmx: bring netherite chestplate just in case
[0:17:35] vegito__official: Yo
[0:17:42] WhoIsEpikus: I got a cast today. Yesterday I fractured my wrist. Radiologist had gone home when I got my X ray and doctor didn't notice the damage.

[0:18:31] paleophilosopher: cleoHi gobboaBongo
[0:18:38] TheOGSpaceDingo: all redstone noise making contraptions will be enough
[0:18:57] bly1896_2: 90% of the way there, wooooo
[0:19:00] TheOGSpaceDingo: ***technically pistons activate more times per second but its insignificant the difference

[0:23:49] TheOGSpaceDingo: i bet the better thing to do for them is time them out indefinitely. technically not a ban so their challenge remains incomplete meanwhile they're banned

[0:24:30] TheOGSpaceDingo: For me in particular, the amount of bots that I've had. They are able to follow then advertise stuff literally against tos
[0:24:35] mimilayaa: @TheOGSpaceDingo some ppl sometimes come in and ask to be banned, it's much more fun to time them out for an obnoxious amount of seconds
[0:24:36] GaspsHiChat: my second ever stream i did i got called a slur and i haven't streamed since :<
[0:24:38] TheOGSpaceDingo: (follows, subs, views as p2w stuff)

[0:29:18] Asterionm: this was like post s8 hc ish?
[0:29:30] geever0: Can you re-spawn the dragon if you remove/lower all the towers?
[0:29:33] RCMNexus: 3

[0:29:35] haggleslag: pearl has a compilation of her hardcore deaths on her second channel josoDINKDONK check it out!
[0:29:35] cobalt241: 2
[0:29:40] TheOGSpaceDingo: it existed before s9
[0:29:43] waarisdetaart: you started it between S8 and S9 right?
[0:29:45] RCMNexus: was it not 3 I‚Äôm silly
[0:29:46] geever0: or will it "rebuild" the towers?
[0:29:50] mimilayaa: @TheOGSpaceDingo ive seen him use it once i think it was during an update and he was afraid he'd glitch into the void but yes, for the all part
[0:30:07] Headset_Hobo: @geever0 Yes, and the towers respawn as well. Essentially an infinite source of obsidian
[0:30:14] bluubuns: Maybe we should count in months tbh!
[0:30:19] TheOGSpaceDingo: @mimilayaa ??? that's not like philza, totems dont do anything for void.
[0:30:22] justyourusualplayer: hellloooooo
[0:30:36] waarisdetaart: it was between S8 and S9, I'm 99% sure
[0:30:41] geever0: Is there an official start date for S10 yet?
[0:30:42] haggleslag: count it in months like it's a baby

[0:31:49] dashmax1214: @geever0 that date is a joke definitely
[0:31:52] bluubuns: I had to block the word wordle on twitch lol
[0:31:52] Asterionm: cub probably has a mental count of how many times people ask and increases the date everytime by a week
[0:31:53] lilydeboef: i still regularly use wordle.

[0:35:18] vegeta_2001: don't think so
[0:35:20] Ohtacaro: No they dont attack camels
[0:35:21] cobalt241: Probably
[0:35:22] celi1794: sometimes
[0:35:26] pulpvincenzo: better prepare a fake village outside
[0:35:27] TheOGSpaceDingo: no all raid mobs only attack mobs as defined by captains
[0:35:28] bluubuns: Test on creative?
[0:35:30] majestic_mollyy: could you do it at a different village?
[0:35:30] TheOGSpaceDingo: and captains wont attack them
[0:35:30] sadkitty15: Be safe
[0:35:34] Ohtacaro: accidental camel shooting could happen
[0:35:35] Headset_Hobo: They won't target them, but they may catch a stray arrow
[0:35:35] gamingnscience: second Hermit in two days doing a hardcore pillager raid XD
[0:35:35] seibaby: The ravagers will break your leaves though
[0:35:37] Tinker_it: oof, that would not be fun... but probably funny
[0:35:39] celi1794: ren lost a cat to a raid yesterday
[0:35:41] WhoIsEpikus: No. But wouldn't it trigger the platform village cause you'll be right next to there?
[0:35:42] vegeta_2001: @pulpvincenzo no pearl would jsut uproot and move the whole base
[0:35:42] antalia_lotus: i dont know pearlieIDK
[0:35:43] Asterionm: the fangs might do accidental damage
[0:35:49] TheOGSpaceDingo: All raid mobs only attack mobs as commanded by their captain and the captain will not attack those guys.
[0:35:53] secret_agent4706: Idk I am not sure lol
[0:35:55] coolpigeon10: just move them to be safe
[0:35:59] jr_zans: even if they don't attack them, I would still hide them, but hey, that's just me lol
[0:35:59] bluubuns: What if you lose your villagers?
[0:36:02] geometryguy111: hello
[0:36:03] pichingopower: I think they only attack villagers and golems PunchTrees
[0:36:06] JaimieeBoo: passive animals generally only get hit by misfiring arrows
[0:36:11] waarisdetaart: oh no

[0:36:46] majestic_mollyy: yeah they were on the small hill in the middle
[0:36:47] bluubuns: Aww is there an outpost nearby?
[0:36:53] vegeta_2001: no 128 blocks for all hostile mobs
[0:37:12] seibaby: Nope, everything is 128 except mobs that are persistent (or Withers, or Shulkers, or Wardens being annoyed by noise)
[0:37:19] coolpigeon10: they would‚Äôve despawned for sure
[0:37:22] preparedman: They heard you were planning on taking them on and fled in fear
[0:37:25] MaosnDough: What's inside the cube?
[0:37:29] justyourusualplayer: thats sad BibleThump BibleThump
[0:37:31] vegeta_2001: should've put em in a boat
[0:37:40] gamingnscience: a single villager and a bed should be enough
[0:37:41] Headset_Hobo: I think they despawn quicker if they have no aggro and they hadn't seen you yet
[0:37:42] vegeta_2001: 1 villager with a job is enough
[0:37:50] morgothsdemise: one with a boat right?
[0:37:51] Glitchd_Demigod: I think it's just one villager with a job needed to start a raid
[0:37:53] vegeta_2001: (job is optional I think)
[0:37:54] JaimieeBoo: I think its 3 doors and any number of villagers
[0:37:54] antalia_lotus: @preparedman  true ,very true pearlieYes
[0:37:56] coolpigeon10: 1 villager is enough
[0:37:58] SkullyWho: One works.

[1:00:41] zsigmons1: Ancient cities generate under anything with low erosion, so they can generate anywhere it's high enough.
[1:00:44] pancake_lover_333: i thought that was next update
[1:00:45] Vi0letSiren: The villager changes happened in 1.20.2 so does it really count as the update?
[1:00:53] PineappleWarlord: @minerva_246 I sure hope that ones pronounced differently lmao

[1:01:30] beanraguu: it is in 1.20 as an experimantle feature
[1:01:33] phillykd11: Isn‚Äôt the change that villagers only have certain trades in certain biomes?
[1:01:33] pancake_lover_333: easy

[1:02:20] shark_monty: As you explore you'll find better places to set up base but y'know what just terraform your own base and put that desert above your base

[1:02:40] shark_monty: (btw that was a silly)
[1:02:50] seibaby: 1.20.4 changed it so you can't repeatedly cure villagers and stack discounts
[1:02:57] rsjankowski: even a murder camel
[1:02:57] WWWolf5: ooooh, I love it! let me tag it so I can destroy it later

[1:03:31] rooftile_mcgee: Ooo rafts are good to decorate with too - if you get them inside a block with crops on it it looks like bamboo veggie boxes, and if you stack em up they make cool trellises :D

[1:26:32] AllonsyRapunzel: I feel like imperial units are better for everyday measurements compared to metric
[1:26:33] pastel_cottontail: miles or kilometers?
[1:26:33] herbertthecow1: why are you killing pillagers you already have bad omen
[1:26:36] pinksox_: the jukes

[1:26:40] TheOGSpaceDingo: @pastel_cottontail km
[1:26:40] justyourusualplayer: everyone uses feet for height
[1:26:40] haggleslag: the UK does that too, prolly holdover from that
[1:26:40] rooftile_mcgee: According to google I'm 5'6/5'7 ;-;
[1:26:41] bookworm2692: most people i know use cm for height. i had to teach myself the feet height bc of internet reasons
[1:26:42] thataussiewillow: im like 160cm or smth
[1:26:42] JigRabble: would u measure distance with football fields tho
[1:26:43] ShadowTheHunterXIII: They trying to use the texture of the stone for hide from you
[1:26:43] BertPotato: I'm guessing Aus inherited the mix of Imperial and Metric measurements from the UK
[1:26:48] t_jayasuriya: Did you know that pillager outpost is not  symmetric
[1:26:53] tildalovesthedoctor: im 170 cm

[1:27:03] chalky574: it varies some people will be confused if i tell them my height in feet but others the other way around
[1:27:05] JigRabble: fair enough
[1:27:06] bariumdisodium: i guess its cause its easier to guestimate, it can be hard to know the exact cm measurement
[1:27:07] GaspsHiChat: can't believe pearl is as tall as my bed lol
[1:27:07] Minerva_246: I'm 124cm - I know I'm short
[1:27:07] WhoIsEpikus: It took me five minutes to open Panadol pills (gotta love a fractured a casted wrist)

[1:27:12] LunarLumina: For the non-Americans, 1 foot is about 30cm - quickmaf
[1:27:15] ekztermin80r: I don't know if I'm proud of my height or not
[1:27:16] miracleasl: do you use Fahrenheit or Celsius?

[1:27:28] ItzClutch9_: hello!
[1:27:29] thataussiewillow: @JigRabble or km
[1:27:34] TheOGSpaceDingo: @BertPotato only inherited imperial but then for the most part switched to metric when that was introduced. all non metric is used only colloquially you'll never see imperial-imperial officially.
[1:27:37] LunarLumina: @miracleasl Australia uses Celsius - literally on the US uses Farehnheit

[1:28:17] herbertthecow1: @FuriousSekhmet they doo
[1:28:19] TheOGSpaceDingo: @FuriousSekhmet they can if pearl wasnt sitting there (mobs cannot spawn within 24 blocks of player)
[1:28:20] BertPotato: @TheOGSpaceDingo We all need to just switch to metric and be done with it, it's been over 200 yeaers
[1:28:30] tildalovesthedoctor: @TheOGSpaceDingo fr its currently 273  here

[1:29:49] thataussiewillow: i wish you luck pearl
[1:29:52] TheOGSpaceDingo: In java our pillagers can spawn in the outpost itself but half the time us players are camped out in the outpost so they cannot spawn there because of the 24 block limit

[1:45:57] waarisdetaart: @ShadowTheHunterXIII If you ask Tango: yes. But they ended up killing quite a few people, just not as many as he wanted

[1:46:21] bluubuns: I strongly disagree with Gem here, Infinity>>>> Mending
[1:46:23] tildalovesthedoctor: @ekztermin80r fr you can just fix it with other bows
[1:46:26] TheOGSpaceDingo: and half of my arrows are non-infinityable

[1:47:18] bariumdisodium: im with gem too, i like to use weakness arrows for a raid anyway and its literally no effort to get any arrows
[1:47:22] bluubuns: @vegeta_2001 ‚Ä¶How do you disenchant just the Infinity? or just the whole bow??
[1:47:22] jenny_b14: I tried to do the mending bow because my skelly farm cranked out the arrows. but it‚Äôs so much work keep track of arrows and keeping them in the inventory
[1:47:24] herbertthecow1: ravanger jumpscare

[1:48:22] bluubuns: It‚Äôs ok we just debating Infinity vs Mending
[1:48:23] JaimieeBoo: @datguccipoochie they're being collected for naming redeems not for usage
[1:48:27] deletednamee: oh no pearl! hahah storm trooper aim
[1:48:29] datguccipoochie: oh is that why pearls doing a raid

[1:48:39] cupofjasmtea: speedy boy
[1:48:39] Asterionm: that evoker is going to yeet himself to death
[1:48:43] hatrisfan42: They should make an upgraded enchantment table that lets you put mending and infinity on the same bow, but it costs loads

[1:51:00] JaimieeBoo: every time u say ravy I think ravioli + ravager = raviolager
[1:51:04] DeterminedDaaf: You'd need like turtle master and strength to kill this with melee.
[1:51:26] datguccipoochie: raid farms are so powerful but can be so dangerous
[1:51:27] WhoIsEpikus: I bet 13k points that Pearl will win and won't near death
[1:51:30] BastianFeral: It's just hectic for me to do normal raids
[1:51:31] BaldBover: raid farm in hardcore would not be advised.  They are notorious for killing the user.
[1:51:38] TheOGSpaceDingo: @datguccipoochie if handled properly they're very safe
[1:51:41] solidtux05: Also raid farms are quite some time commitment to build as well
[1:51:45] geeninspiraty: raid farms do kill you sometimes
[1:51:46] hatrisfan42: Building farms is fun tho
[1:51:47] Headset_Hobo: Also, doing raids add a little bit of danger to the game, which is important in a Hardcore world
[1:51:48] the_mmx: raid farms are too op unless you play on an op server that needs it

[1:52:08] Beri: ah yes the patented pearlo raid farm
[1:52:13] TheOGSpaceDingo: @solidtux05 actually no. basic stacking are still powerful but only take at most 2h building (if you dont know what you're doing)
[1:52:16] FinnBear42: DanTDM lost his hardcore world from a raid farm, its honestly more dangerous

[1:52:49] TheOGSpaceDingo: @FinnBear42 good raid farms today ensure 1tap illagers whereas dan's was a normal mob grinder under raid spawning.
[1:52:50] FinnBear42: @TheOGSpaceDingo No offense, but you assume that is guarranteed not to happen with pearl?

[1:55:19] Nightbot:  Don't become a french fry, be a good potato, remember to follow the stream!
[1:55:19] greegypt: kill them for their insolence.
[1:55:24] t_jayasuriya: Save 2 and kill 10
[1:55:28] somemelondude: you can stack the rockets
[1:55:30] vegeta_2001: that's if you do multiple raids
[1:55:30] JaimieeBoo: they only do it periodically
[1:55:33] BastianFeral: they had to get a job 1st

[1:55:39] FinnBear42: @TheOGSpaceDingo @TheOGSpaceDingo I see where you are coming from, but I just see it as unnessecary. Pearl is a very safe player, I don't think she will need that many totems.
[1:55:44] DeterminedDaaf: It's up to them to repopulate.
[1:55:50] pancake_lover_333: pearls advice: child birth
[1:55:56] ShadowTheHunterXIII: @t_jayasuriya Isn't that the rable with less chair problem?
[1:55:58] marty0metz: misska51Cry mercy.

[1:56:04] BertPotato: don't tempt people pearl
[1:56:04] Takipuff: hey pearl i just wanted to say that im 5 months clean from self harm today! :]
[1:56:08] honami_chan: hit boxes maybe?
[1:56:08] TheOGSpaceDingo: @FinnBear42 it was all because of farm deisgn. dan had a design which didnt 1-tap, it was very primitive, and escape options were lacking in the greatest manner. raid farms today are built in the middle of the ocean, so no blocks to be using rockets on instead of boosting you. experience at the game also is irrelevant with modern raid farm designs, they're built to be all but grian/scar proof (pearl would have no trouble).
[1:56:11] tildalovesthedoctor: @FinnBear42 its a totemless run she doesnt really need any totems
[1:56:15] ShadowTheHunterXIII: @t_jayasuriya *table
[1:56:30] t_jayasuriya: Become Thanos for a moment
[1:56:33] Tinker_it: 94%
[1:56:34] TheOGSpaceDingo: @tildalovesthedoctor the totmes are for item redemptions not surviving

[1:56:44] PurpleEyes_14: my moon potato reset
[1:56:48] FinnBear42: @TheOGSpaceDingo does pearl have any experience building raid farms?
[1:56:51] theoriginalongboy: is this the same hc world on yt??
[1:56:52] TheOGSpaceDingo: @TheOGSpaceDingo and im just here advocating for raid farms and their benefits out of context
[1:56:56] ekztermin80r: Welp, there goes all my channel points
[1:57:10] tildalovesthedoctor: @TheOGSpaceDingo i know i was just replying in response to her not needing them from being safe
[1:57:12] BastianFeral: u do a trail ruins yet?
[1:57:18] TheOGSpaceDingo: @FinnBear42 nope, but that doesnt matter. i would like to direct you to a design by ianxofour, would you mind if i whispered you a link?
[1:57:26] ekztermin80r: Yez
[1:57:30] Mr13igh: Ohhh the long forgotten YT HC world üòî

[1:57:56] BastianFeral: what types of themes are you debating between for hermitcraft season 10?

[1:58:07] ekztermin80r: Also i redeemed the rename a mob last time
[1:58:13] bee1234567891: oh so people can name totems? nice
[1:58:18] FinnBear42: @TheOGSpaceDingo No thank you. I can understand your point though, I am only arguing that a raid farm is unnessecary in this situation.
[1:58:20] ekztermin80r: Oblobbles the sniffer
[1:58:22] somemelondude: howhave you not done oh shiny
[1:58:23] tildalovesthedoctor: the flying upside down in the inventory is so funny to me

[1:58:59] avsisflying: Striders aren't worth it. Look at Mumbo in Secret life lol
[1:59:04] FinnBear42: @TheOGSpaceDingo I will say though, you are right that in many situations raid farms can be very helpful. Bye chat, have a nice day!
[1:59:07] pancake_lover_333: i've been doing achievements aand i have 10/11 cats... so annoying and tedious though
[1:59:09] FinnBear42: bye pearlo

[3:23:28] PineappleWarlord: @dummyboar i thought that the loot in chests was based on the seed
[3:23:28] chinook_a: elytra is so good
[3:23:36] m1gr3nA: i want elytra trim though
[3:23:37] jaegertw2: @kattituude that should be a mod
[3:23:41] Intralacustrine: falseLurk
[3:23:44] haggleslag: if people want to explore on the ground they can just not use the elytra
[3:23:50] diarrhea_lad: I'd like Phantoms removed and give another way to repair elytra
[3:23:53] kattituude: @mulanv44 would be amazing
[3:23:55] Nightbot:  Follow Pearl in all the places: https://www.youtube.com/pearlescentmoon  https://twitter.com/PearlescentMoon https://www.instagram.com/pearlescentmoo/

[3:24:10] dummyboar: @pineapplewarlord yeah now that you mention it. I think it didn't use to be but now it is, that's a way they check for cheats in speedruns
[3:24:13] waarisdetaart: @m1gr3nA that would be awesome
[3:24:14] sea_unicorns: netherite tools in the ancient city, i could never be that brave :D
[3:24:16] Tinker_it: for me, elytra's fine, I just  know that it's two different games with/without elytra
[3:24:20] MerkDolf: Yes I love Elytra crashing into the trees and ground.
[3:24:25] Nightbot:  Don't become a french fry, be a good potato, remember to follow the stream!
[3:24:27] MusicFreeGaming: Exploring is one of my least favorite things so I love elytra for that.
[3:24:30] bluubuns: And if you don‚Äôt like it you can always choose not to use it!
[3:24:31] Heatherina94: That is a great take on Elytra. I think it helps with exploration.
[3:24:35] lightlyylucid: since the chest boat was added i've used boats a ton more.
[3:24:43] sea_unicorns: makes sense :D
[3:24:52] Nightbot:  Reminder to be kind in chat!
[3:25:04] glitchered: has pearl ever tried shaders in the deep dark? on BSL it looks quite interesting.
[3:25:12] TheBeeAndTea: @lightlyylucid I have a lil chest boat stocked for travel in my realm, it's so fun
[3:25:14] Nightbot:  Be respectful - No spamming - No advertising - English only
[3:25:21] TheMathGeek_314: Some friends had a server where I built an ice boat highway in the nether, but elytra instantly made the highway obsolete
[3:25:21] jangler07: I can't believe rockets don't set off shriekers

[3:26:48] sea_unicorns: @Sprits13 lol
[3:26:49] vegeta_2001: slow falling?
[3:26:50] mulanv44: falling?
[3:26:51] phildc101316: fly is with rocket, elytra is gliding not flying. i think lol
[3:26:51] bluubuns: Pearl is an ender pearl confirmed
[3:26:51] Neamow: @Sprits13 pearlieLOL pearlieLOL
[3:26:51] serrmardan: creative flight I think
[3:26:51] Asterionm: slow fall potions?
[3:26:52] rathgar1843: jump?
[3:26:52] Tealosaurus_Nyx: Falling or blown into the air lol
[3:26:52] t_jayasuriya: Fall
[3:26:53] CrunchyZedman: maybe its like, just being in the air? like sprint jumping
[3:26:54] somemelondude: Distance traveled upward and forward at the same time, while more than one block above the ground.
[3:26:54] gamingnscience: flown is just distance without touching ground maybe?
[3:26:54] alexyap0223: pearlieLOL
[3:26:55] little_birblet: Levitation effect?
[3:26:56] RamStone___: free cam?
[3:26:56] dim_the_lights: Shulkers?
[3:26:57] pastel_cottontail: using flight rockets vs gliding?
[3:26:59] drogonsfire: Under rocket power vs gliding?
[3:27:00] swirlycarl: riptide trident maybe
[3:27:00] kofithekofin: @huffcap am fishing still
[3:27:02] Monday_from_M: Maybe one is gliding, other is using a rocket?
[3:27:04] imotep_92: falling with style
[3:27:04] fxoons: Does it count if h
[3:27:05] lightlyylucid: I think flown is when your elytra is not actively being engaged with rocekts
[3:27:05] pancake_lover_333: google says fall
[3:27:06] cheesetoastiezss: @Sprits13 deffinately
[3:27:08] herbertthecow1: did we already decide the  warden name
[3:27:13] jaegertw2: riptide tridents?
[3:27:15] m1gr3nA: when hit by shulkers maybe but thats way too much
[3:27:15] bookworm2692: no but fallen is different to flown
[3:27:20] the_mmx: how many rockets you used?
[3:27:23] diarrhea_lad: "Distance traveled upwards and forwards at the same time, while more than one block above the ground" accouding to Wiki
[3:27:23] bluubuns: Elytra but the passive falling part? who knows
[3:27:29] fxoons: Does it count if ur just wearing elytra
[3:27:34] alexyap0223: pearlieGG
[3:27:36] chinook_a: wweeeptide
[3:27:40] jaegertw2: lol
[3:27:40] huffcap: I mean it's almost defo past midnight, redbull is needed
[3:27:41] glitchered: flown is probably the amount you do with rockets. not the elytra only.
[3:27:41] pastel_cottontail: flown by blast?
[3:27:42] august_by_ts: being hit by shulkers?
[3:27:46] sea_unicorns: distance by pig :D is a separate category
[3:27:48] PineappleWarlord: ok apparently "flown" is when you're going upward and forward
[3:27:51] WerLunar: You get flown distance by jumping. It's a very Minecraft thing
[3:27:52] pancake_lover_333: "distance traveled upward and forward at the same time, while more than one block above the ground"
[3:27:56] Alien221_: Distance Flown: Distance traveled upward and forward at the same time, while more than one block above the ground.
[3:27:57] mustavariz: Soup group assemble! Let's go! Riptide!
[3:28:00] rathgar1843: i think it's distanced jumped
[3:28:02] barbqued: It counts free cam, I noticed that on my world
[3:28:05] LunarLumina: I guess "jumping forawrd" counts as flown??
[3:28:06] alexyap0223: pearlieLOL
[3:28:15] dummyboar: ppl saying elytra ruined the game are annoying, just don't use them ? I use elytra for the sake of exploration. Finding cool new biomes and landscapes pearlieHeart
[3:28:20] m1gr3nA: @diarrhea_lad so does jump boost count?
[3:28:25] the_mmx: silence trim is like 1.2% chance per chest. the other one is more common
[3:28:34] diarrhea_lad: @m1gr3nA presumably
[3:28:34] PineappleWarlord: @lunarlumina that would only be one block up so i don't think it counts
[3:28:50] lightlyylucid: anyone else ever grab all the candles? just too lazy to deal with bees
[3:28:50] m1gr3nA: @m1gr3nA weird stat to single out
[3:28:55] gamingnscience: "Distance traveled upwards and forwards at the same time, while more than one block above the ground."

[4:57:23] Nightbot: January 18th 2024, 4:03:51 am AEDT GMT+11:00
[4:57:28] shanesunil: I think the only thing you did wrong was checking whether the hazard staircase on level 3 was open
[4:57:29] bluubuns: Could you have done better? of course. But was it fun? SO much fun!!!! pearlieHeart pearlieHeart
[4:57:29] cheshireswolf882: pearl out of curiosity how was it avoidable
[4:57:32] cheshireswolf882: ?
[4:57:38] cheshireswolf882: pearl you did amazing
[4:57:42] samcrafter112: The unavoidable berry bush
[4:57:47] cheshireswolf882: that was legendary
[4:57:47] rere8585: 3 wardens waiting for you at lvl 3 was not your fault
[4:57:48] alexyap0223: pearlieHeart pearlieHeart pearlieHeart
[4:58:04] cheshireswolf882: queen or goddess pearl
[4:58:11] shanesunil: hey, at least you didn't die to it, unlike Tango and Jojo
[4:58:12] waarisdetaart: i just meant at the start when the dungeon was being weird
[4:58:12] Z3R0TR0N: that was still a good run despite being cursed
[4:58:15] BhaalsPuppet: that berry bush was terrifying
[4:58:17] cheshireswolf882: that clank though
[4:58:18] VoxKeys: @samcrafter112 but she did the jump first time /j pearlieIDK
[4:58:23] lilheisenburg: I wouldn't say not your fault but it's just part of the game and you have to adapt and can
[4:58:25] jakholope: jakholope subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 20 months! blaming the game is a quintessential part of gaming
[4:58:37] cheshireswolf882: the heart beat it‚Äôs like Edgar Allen poe
[4:58:48] dragonhealergamer: Pearl, have you tried DOM (decked out manager), the datapack resets the dungeon every run, soo no stuck ravagers, mobs are reset so previous runs dont influence current run and other features.
[4:58:53] BhaalsPuppet: this is the run this is the run
[4:58:55] Hnkaa: what happens tomorow? :D
[4:58:58] BhaalsPuppet: believeeeeeee
[4:58:59] cheshireswolf882: pearl it‚Äôs still not your fault
[4:59:09] RCMNexus: Hello I‚Äôm back your still streaming?
[4:59:17] cheshireswolf882: does any one do decked out training
[4:59:18] Monday_from_M: @Hnkaa DO runs with Hbomb
[4:59:24] cheshireswolf882: ??
[4:59:24] cutmoonie: you‚Äôre gonna do great
[4:59:26] Hnkaa: @Monday_from_M cool thx :)
[4:59:27] RCMNexus: Oh we done the quest let‚Äôs go chat
[4:59:28] yellow_cerber: Good luck
[4:59:32] bluubuns: There‚Äôs meta in positioning ravagers right?
[4:59:42] cheshireswolf882: makes sense
[4:59:49] 19_meg_91: @rcmnexus yes we finished it today
[4:59:51] cheshireswolf882: you prefer a fresh run
[4:59:53] cheshireswolf882: ??
[5:00:19] cheshireswolf882: you like the unknown to some degree?
[5:00:29] cheshireswolf882: the mystery
[5:00:30] RCMNexus: @19_meg_91 yeah I was here during the village raid but it was only at 91%
[5:00:34] J_Skellington_: This game environment creation still blows my mind. Absolutely amazing.
[5:00:52] dragonhealergamer: Fair enought, you can still use the datapack to refill loot when you need to do soo though.
[5:00:52] BhaalsPuppet: bro this stuff is spooky to the max
[5:00:53] ive_h: I had Pain jump down to lvl4 in one of my runs LUL
[5:00:56] aayush__xd: Hello
[5:01:03] chinook_a: @ive_h oh my gosh how
[5:01:10] ive_h: I thought so too
[5:01:12] cheshireswolf882: this is jumpscare central
[5:01:14] rere8585: ok 2 warm up runs done, now the serious run to win
[5:01:15] cutmoonie: @aayush__xd hellooo
[5:01:18] alexyap0223: pearlieThink
[5:01:28] RCMNexus: @j_skellington_ the things people can do are actually insane I struggle to build a starter house but tangos out here building an entire dungeon running game with ease
[5:01:29] thecrowwitch19: I dont think ive actually seen decked out before, just heard of it, and this is insanely cool
[5:01:33] Kienlabadao: The warden can go along th edge in mid floor to fall down there
[5:01:39] shanesunil: so basically every time one goes down to level 4, hope for the door side or dripstone or lava area, which is ironice because these spots are the furthest from level 4 entrance.
[5:01:39] 19_meg_91: @rcmnexus yes we crushed it after that, everything happening at the same time LUL
[5:01:54] cheshireswolf882: ok so I‚Äôll try to get it going all hail queen pearl
[5:01:58] bluubuns: Either that or he‚Äôs lurking haha
[5:02:04] ive_h: I think he got pushed past the fence/glass pane by another warden. They can't pathfind past it, but they can fit
[5:02:08] RCMNexus: @19_meg_91 that streams gonna be epic
[5:02:10] rere8585: shop have some?
[5:02:11] shanesunil: you have the crown Pearl - you can always critique H's runs
[5:02:11] J_Skellington_: @RCMNexus Exactly how I feel. I can barely build simple Redstone farms without tutorials.
[5:02:15] BhaalsPuppet: this is the run believe
[5:02:17] chinook_a: H was like "yep thats what im dealing with" and checked out LUL
[5:02:24] the_mr_mds: You. Can. Do. This. Peeaaarrrlll
[5:02:29] 19_meg_91: @rcmnexus yesss!
[5:02:32] cheshireswolf882: pearl does have a crown
[5:02:39] cutmoonie: go pearl go pearl go pearl
[5:02:40] cheshireswolf882: pearl you got this
[5:02:40] ChloetheGaymer: CaptainSparklez played decked out and didnt die on his first run
[5:02:44] RCMNexus: @j_skellington_ if you told me to build a simple red stone clock il just leave in fear
[5:02:46] cheshireswolf882: go pearl go pearl
[5:02:49] J_Skellington_: I want to jump on MC now but I should keep working...
[5:02:49] 19_meg_91: U were being patient in those runs pearl
[5:03:05] cheshireswolf882: thank you pearl
[5:03:11] cutmoonie: pearlieHeart pearlieHeart pearlieHeart pearlieHeart
[5:03:12] bluubuns: Hey, Tango wasn‚Äôt exactly the most skilful lackey in the beginning either pearlieLOL
[5:03:20] J_Skellington_: @RCMNexus yeah... no way
[5:03:23] ChloetheGaymer: he got lucky hahaha
[5:03:30] shanesunil: Cap and Pearl collab runs when?
[5:03:36] BhaalsPuppet: weeeeeeeeeee
[5:03:39] ChloetheGaymer: but ya he played a lot of maps
[5:03:42] RCMNexus: @chloethegaymer he should‚Äôve died in the river he was so stuck

[5:04:34] RCMNexus: @pearlescentmoon you Coached Jojo into deadly you should be fine pushing newcomers into deep frost
[5:04:38] looorenam: h has been around lvl 4 on deadly, even left it but hasn't won one yet I think
[5:04:49] cheshireswolf882: go big or go home isn‚Äôt that the saying

[5:21:51] bluubuns: @19_meg_91 it just plays the sound twice! but only one tnt
[5:21:52] Asterionm: tango hermit proofed it
[5:21:56] 19_meg_91: @procedingfishingboats hope so, it would ruin the entrance
[5:22:03] rere8585: maybe 2 keys would trigger 2 bomb drops

[5:38:53] Nightbot:  Follow Pearl in all the places: https://www.youtube.com/pearlescentmoon  https://twitter.com/PearlescentMoon https://www.instagram.com/pearlescentmoo/
[5:39:23] Nightbot:  Don't become a french fry, be a good potato, remember to follow the stream!
[5:39:33] Asterionm: thats something like 70 pulses and 8 drops
[5:39:42] Monday_from_M: Is Speedrunner good tho? You would miss a lot of embers on level 1 and level 2
[5:39:44] Nightbot:  Reminder to be kind in chat!
[5:39:45] Kienlabadao: Level 1 have the ember cap as well
[5:39:46] alexyap0223: pearlieLOL
[5:39:59] m__sea: @riff_raff_ it runs completely fine on mac
[5:40:15] bluubuns: It has a cap for the number of toots said chat? 8 toots for embers apparently
[5:40:48] Kienlabadao: If you follow the level 1 ember line at the ember system, you will see it
[5:40:55] Riff_Raff_: @m__sea I'm sure it would, I just don't know where to put the download. I'm not very mac savvy
[5:41:00] bluubuns: Chat haha, I did not remember anything like this from Tango
[5:41:08] skullystorm: Oh yay! This is the first time i've caught a stream I hope you're having an amazing day!
[5:41:28] chinook_a: @Riff_Raff_ you dont have a .minecraft folder on a mac?
[5:41:32] cutmoonie: can somebody explain to me how card work?
[5:42:01] chinook_a: @cutmoonie best way is to watch Tangos vids
[5:42:07] m__sea: @riff_raff_ there are tutorials on reddit- it‚Äôs the same, mac vs pc. if you‚Äôre not sure of file paths just google it
[5:42:14] rere8585: he will get them all tomorrow with you help
[5:42:19] kinghingle: cant u copy ur hotbar in creative and import it that way via ur client?
[5:42:26] factorization4: I think he has 2 or 3 sprints
[5:42:26] Zarey_z: tango has his card storage though, you can just get them there
[5:42:27] cutmoonie: @chinook_a okay Thanks
[5:42:28] justScottyyy: could always find Tango's spare cards to make up what's missing
[5:42:33] bluubuns: If only you get more porkchops! Speedrunner was so bad for floor embers/ berries last time right
[5:42:42] Riff_Raff_: Thanks @m__sea  I'll look into it!
