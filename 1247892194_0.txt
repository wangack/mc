[3:30:22] VoicedAcorn252: You're saying a 4" table saw isn't enough for a deck?
[3:30:22] ninopanda: @Apparentthreat true
[3:30:26] PrismaticDuck: I have never found myself in need of a lathe LUL
[3:30:29] Enforcer__: Buy Nice...
[3:30:29] ninopanda: @cmmeth no
[3:30:30] BloodyLlama: Small table saws are fine.  You can extend the fence rail and build feed tables.
[3:30:37] Smileynator: I don't have large table size money man :P
[3:30:43] itaishii_: I saw your stream for the first time at age 12 playing mc

[3:30:57] Makaheehee: I guess I'm setting up a woodworking shop because I need to cut one 2x4. Kappa
[3:30:57] AnesthesiaFC: job site table saws are the way to go unless your processing your own lumber
[3:30:58] Enforcer__: buy a 3d printer and make your own!!
[3:30:58] iivu1canii: make more laths with the althe
[3:30:59] Enforcer__: bingo
[3:31:02] InTheLittlePro: 3d print your 3d printer
[3:31:03] Jayouz: @Giantwaffle I just imagine you buying a lathe, using it once on stream then never again :D
[3:31:09] ninopanda: @cmmeth oh so you need more... got it
[3:31:15] Alexlj92: I've been lucky, my dad is a woodworker and has all the massive machines for them
[3:31:25] iivu1canii: I wonder how the first machines where made like lathes and what not
[3:31:28] cmmeth: @ninopanda, please no MONKERS

[3:31:49] ninopanda: @cmmeth https://displate.com/akwan/demon-slayer
[3:31:52] BloodyLlama: I just quit my job as a cabinet maker.  I'm really going to miss having a whole wood shop to use.
[3:31:55] DbblD: can you write off a 10k pc then?
[3:31:55] Zappo91: My dad bougt me a 300kg bandsaw that can take 30cm objekts because i might start some woodworking.. still havnt used it

[3:32:12] Dagmoo: DatSheffy IRS HERE DatSheffy We'd like a word with you
[3:32:15] BloodyLlama: Oh yeah, I could, but we were a 2 man shop.

[3:32:18] cmmeth: @ninopanda, dude ... F my wallet AYAYABASS
[3:32:18] InTheLittlePro: @DbblD if its work related and you can prove it then yes
[3:32:21] MarquesCoding: I wrote like 50% of my car, which is dope
[3:32:22] R1Rider01: @Giantwaffle you don't have a POBOX do you?  I could send you a sample pint glass
[3:32:23] inclaved: That's going to depend on if your boss is a dick or not
[3:32:25] Smileynator: If your boss isn't an asshole
[3:32:25] Human_Variant: I never did
[3:32:26] ninopanda: HAHA
[3:32:27] Makaheehee: Typically liability wouldnt let you. But depends...
[3:32:28] ChuckMakesIt: Car mechanics usually own their own tools
[3:32:31] PaulFlies: someone i knew worked a design and tech teacher and just used the equipment after hours no problem
[3:32:35] Alexlj92: I mean I lot of mechanics own their own tools
[3:32:39] grayknot: my dad works in matinance and has access to the welding equipment for whatever
[3:32:48] ChuckMakesIt: Otherwise depends on the shop
[3:32:49] GalnaRosen: @ChuckMakesIt Wait what? In the US?
[3:32:54] AsHackDM: Yea sure

[3:33:12] Mbkuling: wafflePride
[3:33:13] Tetsomina: @Giantwaffle Yes, I have a friend that works at a dealership and the dealership assigns days where they can work on their own cars
[3:33:20] Makaheehee: First 50 pint glasses = awesome, after that = crooked, air bubbles, etc. Kappa
[3:33:20] Dagmoo: did you say you want a company that can manufacture in both NA and EU so shipping isnt crazy
[3:33:22] Jayouz: @Giantwaffle Get yourself some glasses, some stencils and a sandblaster! :D
[3:33:22] xDeadBringerx: International shipping is a hellhole
[3:33:26] ChuckMakesIt: Yes @galnarosen other than some car brands like Toyota
[3:33:28] ninopanda: i got my coworker this one. https://displate.com/displate/4843116 @Giantwaffle
[3:33:29] Math354e: Glass has to be packed really well
[3:33:30] MarquesCoding: @Giantwaffle I asked for your PO ages ago and you never replied...
[3:33:33] durxes: yeah 90% of the tools ar Amy own. Some shops are more picky then others, but generally you can use the lifts, press, alignment rack, etc.
[3:33:49] jessahh: Waffle LEDs drop shipped?
[3:33:55] Enforcer__: MarquesTwitch cuz you'd probably send him a 50-gallon drum of Ranch!
[3:33:57] Dagmoo: @MarquesTwitch DonoWall YEP
[3:33:59] R1Rider01: @Giantwaffle I have all the means to do it already.  I ship and sell online all day.
[3:34:00] ChuckMakesIt: Mechanics get out of school and then take on $50,000+ in debt to buy a tool set
[3:34:01] durxes: I have probably 10k+ in my own tools
[3:34:02] CocoScruff: we all are
[3:34:07] „Éî„ÉÉ„Ç∂„ÉÄ„Éá„Ç£: You mean all of the times?

[3:34:25] PrismaticDuck: That statue is crazy, who's working on that?
[3:34:26] heyemmanuelle: only a flaw if you make it a flaw waffleSmart
[3:34:32] GalnaRosen: @ChuckMakesIt Oh, that sucks. Here in Sweden we get everything we need. The larger tools you use like once in 6 months is shared but everyday tools you have your own
[3:34:34] durxes: @ChuckMakesIt mind you a good portion of that cost is a nice tools box

[3:34:53] Jayouz: @durxes I think it depends on the persons attitude, if you show good effort in your work the place won't mind you using their equipment, a friend used to rebuild his RX7 engine in the company workshop over Christmas :D
[3:34:58] Mbkuling: Kippa

[3:36:47] Larklen: just start over :)
[3:36:49] Jayouz: Did anyone else know Steam has an activation per hour limit? Hit it twice now :D
[3:36:57] MarquesCoding: last time I checked I had around 30GB of footage xD
[3:37:02] Cherokee__Chief: just film it in reverse by rolling back 24 hours a few times
[3:37:06] Enforcer__: when its done, take a pic, roll every block movement back, take the Before pic! :P
[3:37:17] Smileynator: sad
[3:37:20] JoeCrow: maximus172737475767 Oct 28, 2014
[3:37:22] Tetsomina: @Jayouz yep, asf has an auto timed activator
[3:37:28] Jayouz: I just forgot about 2 years of humble choice keys lol
[3:37:30] TheKnopex: even for correct keys there is a limit
[3:37:39] Tamerlain: puzzle scramble codes
[3:37:41] schwartzhogg: hey waffle, I tuned in on the first day of the build but haven't seen anything since. how's progress?
[3:37:42] AnesthesiaFC: was annoying for jingle jam where you had 40+ codes to enter
[3:37:44] Moondarra: thats weird. i bought the jingle jam this yearf and activated 40 games on steam in 15 mins
[3:37:45] Tetsomina: yes
[3:37:51] Moondarra: no issues
[3:37:53] GFQPR1882: come on u R's brb pepSmoke
[3:37:56] Tetsomina: 25 correct keys per hour
[3:37:58] GFQPR1882: pepeSmoke
[3:38:12] Tetsomina: used to be 50
[3:38:21] Tyluuuhh: Probably so that someone isn't stealing keys somehow.
[3:38:22] DeMayon: probably to prevent companies like G2A from taking complete advantage over regional pricing + keys
[3:38:29] Dagmoo: probably to prevent bots from stealing a ton of keys from one spot
[3:38:29] Jayouz: I can do 2-3months worth of humble choice keys per hour
[3:38:32] Hibame: Cant humble bundle now just oauth to your account and grant you the games?
[3:38:34] NephilimXS: it doesn't seem consistent, i've crammed between 25-40 on redeeming humble keys

[3:39:02] ZyianDev: I buy some book bundles
[3:39:04] Larklen: They used to be able to do direct activation, but Steam nix'd that function. Not sure if they've re-added it
[3:39:06] Tetsomina: my friend has 22k games on steam and he always complains about activation stuff
[3:39:27] daemonaedryn: bruh
[3:39:29] daemonaedryn: i got like 100
[3:39:36] MarquesCoding: 22k, I'm on like 2k bruh

[3:39:44] Jayouz: I just checked and I've got 265 unplayed games :D
[3:39:44] Tamerlain: @DaemonSzyman and still not have time to play all of them
[3:39:44] thomasausen: can you do a tour and show us all the builds
[3:39:50] Linkitch: Just buying 22k games would take a long time.
[3:39:50] Ragdexon: what job does he have
[3:39:51] Tenkaichi500: i have 326 but 150 were free
[3:39:53] BloodyLlama: The steam key API thing died because the only guy at valve who maintained it left the company.  Their weird structure meant there was nobody left who cared to keep it running.
[3:40:00] daemonaedryn: @Tamerlain lmao true KEKW

[3:40:27] DeMayon: how do you automatically replace the block in hand when you run out
[3:40:30] Smileynator: it's the games to blame, good games only replace small files, some games you redownload 10GB for 1 texture change. @Giantwaffle
[3:40:31] Askjong: How many games does Soda or Lirik have? LULW
[3:40:31] Tamerlain: @DaemonSzyman got Forza 5 premium and its already on the bench cos of work

[3:41:18] kiffar: I remember when games were under a gig
[3:41:18] ScarfaceTony: Icarus probably
[3:41:20] PaulFlies: you can push the MSFS stuff out to platter disk - doesn't really need high speed
[3:41:20] daemonaedryn: My Rimworld file was like 90gb at one point widePepeLaugh
[3:41:22] Mitchellmay: By waffle. Enjoy flying. Got to go to work
[3:41:23] Larklen: I need to throw a 10Gb NIC into my NAS so I can just start streaming my games from it directly KEKW
[3:41:24] Napoleanx: Napoleanx subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 42 months! 
[3:41:24] WoofWoofDude: pretty easy fix to that.. only install what you gonna play.. you already know you won't play 95% of the games you have
[3:41:26] disserno: no just uninstall game syou dont play xd
[3:41:28] KadMan04: @Giantwaffle im running 6 2tb m.2 drives lol
[3:41:29] Eruul: icurs
[3:41:29] Linkitch: Larger SSD storage is also faster. So a good upgrade
[3:41:30] Pewpewpal: just...just buy a 2nd 1TB drive LUL
[3:41:31] Zivs: atleast the price of harddrives have gone down and not up
[3:41:31] RoninStorm: dfssgJxbxgsy
[3:41:32] Tyluuuhh: I don't know if most people play 3-5 games though.
[3:41:32] DJ_ZG: remember games on 1.44MB floppys
[3:41:37] RoninStorm: d
[3:41:37] punkgeek: I remember when games fit on a 5 1/4 floppy
[3:41:38] Raqett: Hard-drive shortage incoming
[3:41:42] gazza8_uk: Tetris is 1tb
[3:41:42] ShionSinX: @Linkitch skip SSD, go for NVME
[3:41:43] Pewpewpal: disk space is dirt cheap
[3:41:50] RoninStorm: ddsx
[3:41:54] VoicedAcorn252: I've got 1.5tb and I never run out.
[3:41:55] kiffar: @DJ_ZG I used to play Sid Meier's Pirates on an Apple IIe lol
[3:41:57] AmitKings: bought an 8tb storage, never installed it TPFufun
[3:41:59] Tamerlain: @punkgeek rooLove  YEP
[3:42:03] TheDigitalWasteland: games so large i gotta clear out some of my homework folder Kappa
[3:42:04] VoicedAcorn252: I got rid of hard drives because I could hear them
[3:42:05] Pewpewpal: @Giantwaffle there's literally no reason not to be NVME other than cost
[3:42:07] RoninStorm: egsgdesey6xdr6eds6e6k
[3:42:14] zevbra: Can any sub join the server?
[3:42:16] Smileynator: platter drives are just too noisy

[3:42:21] Tamerlain: u can get pci express card for NVME drives @Giantwaffle
[3:42:25] matey1116: yeah
[3:42:30] Jayouz: @Giantwaffle What you do is upgrade to a 100Gbit network, then build an insane server with NVME drives
[3:42:34] Xerexos_: you can get 8yb
[3:42:42] Wild_Pachi: Larklen looks like hes having a stroke to me
[3:42:42] Moobot: You can sub to Waffle by clicking this neat link -> twitch.tv/giantwaffle/subscribe
[3:42:46] Kodish: I use a 10TB NAS with an SSD cache to stream games to my PC
[3:42:51] Tenkaichi500: what differences NVME from other harddrives?
[3:43:01] Larklen: I just do raidz2 with platters, read speed is fine enough, my bottle neck right now is just the 1Gb NIC KEKW
[3:43:03] Myekos: after 1tb the prices go up more than linearly
[3:43:06] Tamerlain: @Tenkaichi500 its like 1000 times of speed
[3:43:06] Allmostdone: what you don't already have that?
[3:43:09] ForgottenTime: @giantwaffle 980 pro 2tb is on sale on Amazon right now 31% off
[3:43:10] Francisco_Scaramanga: Synology NAS is the answer

[3:43:34] Beufff: i bought a 2tb on cyber monday for like $140
[3:43:35] NephilimXS: gen 4 NVMEs are fucking expensive
[3:43:36] PaulFlies: 10Gb networking is pretty affordable these days, 100Gb is probably still a bit too enterprise
[3:43:36] ShionSinX: @Tenkaichi500 SPEED. TL;DR imagine a hard drive thats as fast as RAM
[3:43:38] zevbra: I have a 980 pro and its so so good

[3:43:55] Traaxus: the new WD m.2s are pretty fast compared to samsungs now.
[3:43:59] Ragdexon: ü¶≠ arf arf
[3:43:59] AnesthesiaFC: 970 vs 980? whats the difference?
[3:44:01] Hunter_Boone: 3% off if you buy 2 Kappa
[3:44:08] Citriz: @Aldiron i mean .. compared to even 5 years ago its not.
[3:44:09] Damikiller37: You really don't need anything above 3k read/3k write. Especially for games. It's plenty fast.
[3:44:11] Francisco_Scaramanga: @Kodish NODDERS
[3:44:11] Tamerlain: WD Black and ADATA XPG have good models too its like 7500 WRITE speed @Giantwaffle
[3:44:11] InTheLittlePro: gen 4 pog
[3:44:13] CookieSnooper: nvme for storage? just make NAS with SSds
[3:44:16] kiffar: One of these days I'll get an NVMe
[3:44:17] WoofWoofDude: pcie5 is getting implemented in the next gen cpu :)
[3:44:18] theflyingamerican74: Faster read and writes
[3:44:18] daedmissica0: $940 for 3 of them
[3:44:19] Giantnoggin: To bad I can only have M.2 drive
[3:44:20] MaxedLuck_: @Giantwaffle exactly what i have, so nice. its also a longer overwrite life
[3:44:21] gazza8_uk: I need to get a msata to m2 adapter
[3:44:25] ForgottenTime: It‚Äôs on sale on Amazon right now
[3:44:26] Variandra: @Giantwaffle 980 has higher write speed
[3:44:29] xDeadBringerx: That's what I did. 10 Gbit on PC and NAS. ZFS spinning rust array with NVMe L2ARC(caching reads) and SLOG(caching writes)
[3:44:31] InTheLittlePro: imo youre never gonna use the bandwith of gen 4 so stick to 3
[3:44:31] MarquesCoding: @Giantwaffle Just get 4 of them and raid 0 them (as long as you don't care about your data)
[3:44:32] Dagmoo: yeah i went with 1tb NVMe when i just did my build
[3:44:32] Dibbsu: I use a SX8200 Pro
[3:44:41] ScarfaceTony: Read and write Speed
[3:44:42] Tamerlain: @Dibbsu the best value ones
[3:44:42] Traaxus: I got the WD50 Black and it far out performs my samsung.
[3:44:45] Jayouz: @Giantwaffle Just get a PCI-E card for more NVME's
[3:44:53] AleXanDreMau: i can buy 2 4t HD it that  money dont need the speed now
[3:45:03] MaxedLuck_: its the overall capacity for overwriting. massive up with 980 pro
[3:45:03] Kublaka: I bought that same one on prime day. it was a bit cheaper
[3:45:03] Francisco_Scaramanga: You can get PCIE addin cards that have 4 m.2 slots
[3:45:12] Larklen: @gazza8_uk if you have to convert your m.2 into a SATA cable, then you might as well just get a regular SSD, since SATA will be your limiting factor anyways
[3:45:32] Larklen: 16
[3:45:35] Aldiron: 16
[3:45:36] LordDynom: Depends on the mobo as well
[3:45:41] Xerexos_: blazed63Love blazed63Love blazed63Love blazed63Love blazed63Love
[3:45:49] Tamerlain: NVME using 4 lanes
[3:45:51] InTheLittlePro: you dont need a 16x for your GPU lol
[3:45:51] Hunter_Boone: z99
[3:45:52] Scrapped: geez, I thought at least 24
[3:45:52] Giantnoggin: Yeah thats the problem it will steal from the gpu
[3:45:54] Francisco_Scaramanga: Still wont matter that much.
[3:45:58] aman36000: 490?
[3:46:10] Mr_Perril: Go Threadripper, 128 lanes
[3:46:12] adogkills: PC upgrade stream soon???
[3:46:15] Smileynator: I have not had the need to update my gaming PC in 7 years. Still on a 980GTX NotLikeThis
[3:46:15] Tamerlain: 20 PCIE gen 4 = 40 PCI gen 3
[3:46:30] ak1732: just got glasses today and everything looks weird. wtf
[3:46:36] Scrapped: How many lanes dooes the 12900 have?
[3:46:36] ShionSinX: I N T OMEGALUL L
[3:46:39] Tamerlain: DDR 5 cost soo much for 12900K @Giantwaffle
[3:46:46] Strinom: The Kingston KC3000 are probably the mos insane. 4TB 7,000/7,000MB/s 3.2TBW @Giantwaffle
[3:46:50] Tamerlain: but its a beast
[3:46:50] trabadam: i prefer SATA SSD for bulk storage tbh
[3:46:55] xDeadBringerx: I have a Zen+ ThreadRipper. Mobo + other parts are a pain to get.
[3:46:55] Mbkuling: Apple M1 Max Kappa
[3:46:57] Allmostdone: a new intel chip is still long off
[3:46:59] TheTrueGaysian: TheTrueGaysian subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 19 months! 
[3:47:05] WoofWoofDude: also needs to think about which slot to use, thye don't all go to the cpu. generally only one of the m.2 goes to the cpu the other one goes through the chipset
[3:47:06] ShionSinX: imagine trying to permit yourself Kappa
[3:47:06] chopsacado: evo > pro
[3:47:14] Scrapped: You can use DDR4 for the new intel board.
[3:47:14] shadytx: its really not a good time for PC building
[3:47:18] InTheLittlePro: DDR5 is not worth it rn. also the 12900k only has 20 lanes
[3:47:22] WoofWoofDude: same for pcie slot
[3:47:22] Larklen: moon2HUH
[3:47:23] rredmoka: Yo
[3:47:27] NephilimXS: this is why i went with ahigh end pre-build.  paid a premium but was able to get latest stuff
[3:47:34] Scrapped: you just cant mix and match DDR4 and 5
[3:47:37] VoicedAcorn252: You can literally get 32gb of ddr5 for only $1200. Not bad at all
[3:47:38] IamWambo_: yeah my PC is dying, I really need to build a new one and this is the worst time to build one
[3:47:38] Tamerlain: i cant find it even for my custom project PC they like 900 $ for 32 Gb @Giantwaffle
[3:47:39] Larklen: did someone say pci-e lanes were limited by mobo and not cpu OMEGALUL
[3:47:45] JusticetoAll: I've been wanting to upgrade for a year and a half now, but don't want to due to GPUs
[3:47:57] Francisco_Scaramanga: DDR5 High speeds are not available yet wait on it
[3:48:06] chopsacado: check out the 970 evo plus
[3:48:10] Astalavista87: Asus just showed a ddr4 to drr5 converter board
[3:48:11] Larklen: its limited by the lower of the two
[3:48:16] TheTrueGaysian: @Giantwaffle just got my shnazzy email saying I have officially graduated college. Thanks for all the entertainment throughout this time. PostDoc party here I come!
[3:48:17] Larklen: ye
[3:48:18] Kaomie: You have PCI lanes switches so yeah it depends on the motherboard too
[3:48:22] Tamerlain: @Francisco_Scaramanga 5200 pretty much on the same level as ddr4 low latency 3600
[3:48:26] Tiggaboo: There are more lanes on the Mobo, but they go to the chipset and not direct to cpu
[3:48:33] MrChucklesz: bought all my parts but a GPU waited 6/7 months to try and get a 3080. Then said fuck it and got a 3080Ti on release. Its very overkill
[3:48:40] BloodyLlama: Yeah PCIE multiplexors work, they just really make mobos more expensive
[3:48:44] Jayouz: The household servers are more powerful than my desktop, makes me sad :(
[3:49:00] Tamerlain: @Kaomie if u have pcie slot in mobo it suports that lanes with chipset of CPU

[4:23:57] lvyEartman: why do you need to build down?
[4:23:58] Mr_Perril: u need a 12-16 speed H shifter for Truck Sim
[4:23:59] Dagmoo: @zukotsukid he showed it earlier. Trevor had to spend a ton of time clearing jungle so that slowed him down a bunch
[4:24:11] Deadlyconfuzion625: You have a splitter and a range
[4:24:19] TheWonderLlama: You usually use a function key to change the range
[4:24:24] symaski62: hi
[4:24:26] Jayouz: @Giantwaffle Most trucks are automatic these days :D
[4:24:27] Mr_Perril: yea hotkey
[4:24:29] Harmar: yes
[4:24:33] nxusr: I do odd and even sets
[4:24:36] TheWardz: u use the base from thrustmaster that, then u go for a skrs on top of that if u wanna be baller
[4:24:39] Bobersale: there is a knob you can put on your shifter
[4:24:40] AmitKings: @catberg2788 how's it a black sheep PogChamp

[4:24:48] Northlyte: You can get a mod for the h shifter that goes on top, has switches for moving between gear sets
[4:24:52] Bbluess: they are in EU
[4:24:53] LiL_LiLi_ALi: someone knows when is the next ETS 2 stream ?
[4:24:53] Harmar: you have to order them special for 10-18 gears now
[4:24:53] Bored______________: in EU its like 99% automatic
[4:24:55] chopsacado: it is true yeah
[4:24:55] Deadlyconfuzion625: Yeah you go through 6 gears, then split and go back to first gear which will be 7th and go through again
[4:24:56] mytzusky: i think my logitech shifter had bigger steps than 1
[4:25:02] Bbluess: american trucks are weird man
[4:25:02] BloodyLlama: New trucks maybe.  Still a shitload of old trucks on the road.
[4:25:14] Chelsrawr: @LiL_LiLi_ALi probably next tuesday
[4:25:16] Bobersale: has high low and splitter
[4:25:25] PlushReptar: Most trucks are automatic yes.
[4:25:30] Zenon908: or just map the gears to be odd or even only
[4:25:42] chopsacado: for a while, manual transmissions became so unpopular they hardly made any at all. but then they made a very slight comeback. Still theres few out there compared
[4:25:43] Alcky26: there is 1 stone block that is blending in the wall D:

[4:26:28] Jayouz: The truck being automatic is also seen as a safety feature these days and it's less distraction for the driver
[4:26:33] TheWonderLlama: That was what I did when I played with a shifter. I had it do only the even gears, then you just skip the odd ones. I liked it more than using all the gears

[6:58:48] 619srt: I can't type

[6:58:57] tinyforce: flight sim great stuff. Looking forward to the great build in MC. Always a great Christmas treat
[6:59:07] Kevincav: Takeoff is "easy" but it's the point of flight with the highest risk.
[6:59:10] sandvoxel: I would only do like 7 max
[6:59:13] Kevincav: So you need to be ready for things
[6:59:26] Oogabooga901: I‚Äôm a flight instructor, it‚Äôs not exactly easy, but just about everyone can learn to do it given enough time.

[7:00:13] fritsie89: Oh yeah i have that with heavy crosswinds
[7:00:14] 619srt: @Allmostdone OMEGALUL do it.. no balls

[7:01:31] Oogabooga901: @kevincav Definitely get your IR, I‚Äôm surprised you have a CPL and no IR. I don‚Äôt think many flight schools will hire if you don‚Äôt have an instrument rating

[7:02:08] Awsad: @Giantwaffle you have been to sweden right?
[7:02:10] fritsie89: couldnt you buy one of those little hobby planes
[7:02:12] Kevincav: @Oogabooga901 I'm working on it.  The reason I got the CPL first is because I bought a plane and had CFI friends.  So I'd go on fun flight sand come back with 4-5 requirements done.  Eventually everything was knocked out so I took the checkride first.
[7:02:19] Allmostdone: @619srt [Air Marshals put handcuffs on you]

[7:04:35] Oogabooga901: @kevincav haha nice yeah that‚Äôs one way to do it, but yeah definitely get IR before anything else. It opens up worlds of opportunity and genuinely makes you a much safer pilot. If you have any aspiration of going into flying for a living you need to get solid on IFR. I‚Äôm starting at an airline in a couple minutes and IFR regs and procedures is all they really care about.
[7:04:36] elf_machine: @fritsie89 Sweden's not too bad. I used to live there. Norway is fucking expensive tho KEKW

[7:29:59] kaos4666: This game looks cool too @Giantwaffle
[7:30:18] PlaneBoy737: What server are you on?
[7:30:22] Kevincav: @Ev1lNr1 I def prefer a stick instead.  It's usually out of the way, plus it's a lot more sensitive in my plane with the stick.
[7:30:22] benjeit: whats a good budget steering wheel? or what you recommend
[7:30:33] stormblaz: planes could come in yoke or stick right?
[7:30:38] stormblaz: so its preference irl?
[7:30:43] Kevincav: @stormblaz Depends on the plane.
[7:31:08] M1k3D3l7a: ILS RWY 14 next?
[7:31:13] VoodooMidnight: do you need pedals for this?
[7:31:14] stormblaz: thats actually dope, I love seaplanes, im from florida, and seaplanes are such joy
[7:31:15] Kevincav: @stormblaz But no you don't get to pick which one to use when you get a plane.  It's defaulted to a stick, side stick or a yoke.

[8:05:34] banshay3: is this locarno?
[8:05:35] PaulFlies: so you should pass CALDO at 6000, then loop back round as per the headings and distances to PINIK, descend to 5000 to intercept the glideslope into land
[8:05:44] stormblaz: ground roll?
[8:05:46] stormblaz: nice
[8:05:56] PaulFlies: basically, the important bit is to be at 5000 at CALDO aligned with the runway
