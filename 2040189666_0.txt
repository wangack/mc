[0:24:57] z_e_ns: now it's a choice
[0:24:57] TheReaperOf1985: its fine, more FUN FOR ALL =D
[0:24:58] Ribery931: the only other way would be giving them burgers to get to 100
[0:25:00] kibaz_x: But then get rid of it
[0:25:00] spurlucke: Let them join fight with Herald please
[0:25:01] sharkastic_shark: Just have fun

[0:25:03] stary_kartofel: no of course not
[0:25:04] JustusIsOnline: all non level 100 players should be banned from the server i think

[0:25:06] jeeukko_: friends > lore

[0:25:21] auszgrill: I don't message often very much a lurker, but this series has been my favourite Hermit related series in a long time!
[0:25:22] thespectrescall: That would be just be kind of unfairly punishing
[0:25:22] TobyButt89: Even if they aren't lvl 100 everyone has put in effort, and they deserve to have some fun with y'all at the herald
[0:25:23] cl4sh3r_69: maybe just go to 1000 days just to be safe
[0:25:26] spurlucke: Just for the Herald, hopefully Beefers can join too
[0:25:26] thenightmare02: I mean if the Herald itself does not change it only makes it harder for the lower level people
[0:25:26] dawwsoon: oh

[0:25:42] tobydog_aka_hento: Uh oh
[0:25:43] paloution808: It's fine, play how you want. I new most Hermits would not reach 100. It took me 6 months playing casually

[1:01:38] Zinoba: its ok. some of us are hunters
[1:01:38] kibaz_x: Sometimes I also get traps even at 100% disarm lol, rarely tho
[1:01:41] laptop_user1: the bug complilation gonna be a 20 hour video

[1:01:45] Flantixz: Can you see treasure doors on the map?
[1:01:45] eijebong_: Do you really want to open a treasure door in this patch LUL It's gonna be trapped somehow
[1:01:46] LiverLover00: "man I'm terrible" so true iskall
[1:01:48] paloution808: How many keys you got on you?
[1:01:49] Kasszi_: do we want to gamba how many trapped chests he gets KEKW
[1:01:53] G_M4K: 7

[1:02:02] toomuchinertia: imagin if a treasure chest became trapd
[1:02:04] ViciTheTenorOon: They fixed trap disarm but coded it in for iskall as a game rule
[1:02:05] Knew_It_Owl: @Kasszi_ actually good idea
[1:02:07] Ribery931: maybe it increases trap chance now KEKW
[1:02:10] falsesymmetry: no baby is safe in this update
[1:02:10] babyinastr8jacket: @kasszi_  do it in ranges
[1:02:10] TobyButt89: Didn't you already amend trap disarm when you False and stress ran a vault, and so if it got edited by someone else, has that compounded the issue?
[1:02:12] CutePyro0: #babykillerupdate
[1:02:14] z_e_ns: 1 in 3 is trapped it seems like
[1:02:17] G_M4K: 8
[1:02:17] mechawarrior11: 8
[1:02:20] Kasszi_: @babyinastr8jacket yea i was thinkin that
[1:02:25] Z0eff: Ok yea this is def more than 5% lol
[1:02:25] Darkstar159: If the base rate for traps is 5%, isn't it more valuable to add 5+% item quant instead?
[1:02:27] mechawarrior11: 9
[1:02:28] Novet: this update insulted my cat
[1:02:28] zeus_o9o2: you can see it in the end screen @iskall85
[1:02:35] Kastumoem: Let's hope it's not something stupid like the paradox vault to modifiers applying because you had to attempt it to use the paradox fault
[1:02:36] falsesymmetry: well itll be more than the bin baby falseLurk
[1:02:38] GhoulHunter811: well atleast elixir is good from dewelrs and fighters xD

[1:02:49] cozmo42: @novet your cat deserved it
[1:02:50] TheImmortaldonut: Iskall is throwing out ALL the babies with the bathwater
[1:02:50] Ribery931: that feels like a lot of traps rn
[1:02:50] dawwsoon: trash baby :(
[1:02:54] khanngi: you should at least get XP for trapped chest

[1:07:40] karthavya: killing faster is better than taking less damage iskall that's why life leech is not much used
[1:07:41] basman333: !stress
[1:07:42] cozmo42: what does lucky cry do?
[1:07:45] kibaz_x: I love captainsparklez archon build, iirc he has like 800% mana regen
[1:07:45] TobyButt89: Lucky hit hard to get (like one guys spent like 57 fundis to try and get it) and life leech seems weak
[1:07:45] jimitiethedude: Hobe you thought of adding classes to vh , one example could be a mage which increases base mana and mana regeneration but lower base health and lesser Max health or smth
[1:07:48] tobydog_aka_hento: gotta go i got a test now
[1:07:54] kibaz_x: Had*

[1:13:45] HoboWith2Shotguns: @basman333 think of it as a critical hit chance, but the outcome (mana steal, more damage etc) is chosen by the player in their skill build
[1:13:47] mastertaint: @jackkabuki the high levels are running living chests to farm burgers for the low levels

[1:39:56] mahik750: Is bisect hosting still sponsoring VH by the way?
[1:39:57] Knew_It_Owl: @Kasszi_ Amount of god altars completed?
[1:39:59] ImDSG: Scav is the best

[1:40:04] avariomc: Oh. Bisect.
[1:40:05] Pambo3: Good!
[1:40:07] RaulRB36: most fun is elixir
[1:40:09] angelfoxruby: I love scav.
[1:40:09] ViciTheTenorOon: I like scav
[1:40:09] fightingpandanz: @iskall85 being persistent here , Any chance in a  trangsmog for a Shield .. to change it into a Axe. Make it look like im Dual wielding in a Vault. ? Thankyou for VH . its what i didnt know i needed. :P Love from NEw Zealand.
[1:40:11] kibaz_x: Running a scav rn lol
[1:40:14] TheNewDingo: group scavs are great fun with my group
[1:40:18] kibaz_x: It's exciting
[1:40:19] stary_kartofel: that's just a skill issue
[1:40:23] itzliam_222: @fightingpandanz nz W
[1:40:27] excaliburhero19: why d you still get trapped chests even after 100% trap disarm? I dont see any clumsy modifiers here is this a bug?
[1:40:29] KubyTuby: scav is challenging but i nevertheless like it. not my favourite tho
[1:40:31] joeri_van: I don't have experience in coding in Java, which IDE do developers commonly use?
[1:40:33] hinsher116: Everyone has their preferences
[1:40:33] VeraldOsu: its just bad sad that rng plays such a huge role
[1:40:33] fightingpandanz: o7 :P
[1:40:34] EllieIsShmexy: Mam who are these ppl saying scavs is bad?? I love scavs
[1:40:39] craftydanno: can we run a poll? scav is the best
[1:40:40] mahik750: @fightingpandanz Imagine if you could transmog anything into anything. I could run shoes on my head xd
[1:40:45] LachlanMG: I used to hate scavs but I came around, the challenge is fun
[1:40:46] EllieIsShmexy: Man*
[1:40:54] ViciTheTenorOon: Xp boost is dope
[1:40:56] IceSpice12: creamskall
[1:40:57] anthonythompson3: anthonythompson3 subscribed with Prime. 
[1:40:59] Pineapple0nPizza: I'm not very good so can't complete them often but I still love scavs - I know I take too long killing mobs but I like the challenge and occasional victory feels so good!
[1:41:02] itzliam_222: omg i can stack xp gain oh my lvling is ez mode
[1:41:05] zeus_o9o2: there can be like the scan gets harder on consequtive wins and abit easier on losses
[1:41:11] paloution808: It very difficult to complete as a single player. It still really rewarding when you can actually get it done
[1:41:19] despinias: Group scavs are so much more fun, than solo scavs IMO
[1:41:21] pendelluft: good takes and good pizza from @pineapple0npizza
[1:41:21] evesteroo: Scavs are great, I don‚Äôt complete them most the time but still have fun trying
[1:41:27] Kasszi_:  GAMBA IS UP
[1:41:28] TheReaperOf1985: ive sarte to like hunt the guardians, weird =D
[1:41:28] RaulRB36: @iskall85 have you thought about changing the way it works? To make it always completable by submitting any item, but if you submit the specific items requested, the reward is better
[1:41:33] NelisCornelis: If you do anything, make a separate gamerule.
[1:41:33] VeraldOsu: well make a new difficulty?
[1:41:35] Jackkabuki: How about an expertise that decreases the amount of objectives by a percent
[1:41:35] Knew_It_Owl: Go Gamba Dylans!
[1:41:38] fightingpandanz: @mahik750 I get it ... was just a drean
[1:41:45] dcptcncrescendo: My two year old, watching stream: I see iskaman. Where he go?
[1:41:45] mahik750: Gamba is for finding or completing the altars?
[1:41:50] Darkstar159: @joeri_van learn neovim, it's worth the effort
[1:41:57] mahik750: @fightingpandanz it would be cool
[1:42:00] Pineapple0nPizza: @pendelluft <3 PizzaTime
[1:42:04] MikeyPi_: Don't forget to use your lucky cry
[1:42:06] illycat_: scavs are the best
[1:42:09] QDC__: ;-;
[1:42:10] Zinoba: WHAT
[1:42:11] melodyyunjou: no
[1:42:11] illycat_: WHY!!
[1:42:12] mahik750: WHAT
[1:42:12] joeri_van: @Darkstar159 thanks
[1:42:13] christalplays: AWWW
[1:42:13] mahik750: noooooo
[1:42:14] gaymersalsa: WHAT??
[1:42:15] kimiko2547: that is a great decision
[1:42:15] angelfoxruby: Bleh
[1:42:15] dogoowithagun: WHATT
[1:42:15] Danymaddox: WHAHAAT
[1:42:15] EllieIsShmexy: NOO DON'T CATER TO THEM
[1:42:15] bshugks: Booooo
[1:42:16] ViciTheTenorOon: No
[1:42:18] illycat_: they are the best!!
[1:42:18] christalplays: L Take
[1:42:18] kibaz_x: Noooooooo
[1:42:18] NM_crazy: L
[1:42:19] Benayman: It can go either way. I've had 2x Omega Scavs, that I won out of luck - and I also had Scavs, that I lost because of 1x stupid drowned hide or something like that
[1:42:19] twistytommy01: please no
[1:42:20] RaulRB36: good change imo
[1:42:21] excaliburhero19: NO
[1:42:21] Attackeight: noooooooooo
[1:42:22] pukahontus: could you do the same thing with braziers? Easy vault difficulty is only positive modifiers?
[1:42:22] regardingcoco: nooo
[1:42:22] timmiegamer_: NO pls no
[1:42:22] GhostlyMarrow49: noooooooooooo
[1:42:22] wendymoto: noooooo
[1:42:22] swordo3612: No
[1:42:23] sgt_susman: I don‚Äôt like that
[1:42:24] GrumpyK4t: nooo
[1:42:24] lilylolzmc: teenNUHUH
[1:42:25] Darkest9469: uh oh chat gone wild ü§£
[1:42:26] Baumhunter200: why?
[1:42:28] HeyimJrules: im just so slow in scavs for some reason
[1:42:29] paloution808: Umm,  I  don't know man
[1:42:29] Emogina: I'm in a love hate relationship with scaves :D
[1:42:29] illycat_: Please don't take it out
[1:42:29] cozmo42: Maybe have scav modifiers, like catalysts, which can lower rarity or quantity
[1:42:30] ViciTheTenorOon: Makes me sad
[1:42:30] darahs_00o77: Gggh
[1:42:30] LunarLanderMK2: Nooooooooooo
[1:42:30] Danymaddox: well
[1:42:34] zivziv5: No keep it in the random rool
[1:42:35] mahik750: I wish you didn't do this
[1:42:36] dogoowithagun: wel well well
[1:42:37] kimiko2547: let the players chose
[1:42:41] CedH1: No please ü•∫
[1:42:41] lightdemup22: Lame
[1:42:45] hinsher116: I sometimes fail even elixir KEKW
[1:42:45] Limbolobo: Why not, not take it out but lower the chance of getting it
[1:42:47] leo2369q: no
[1:42:50] regardingcoco: exactly... makes u feel great, when u can complete
[1:42:50] twistytommy01: we deserve scavs
[1:42:51] Jackkabuki: maybe have a gamerule that enables scavs in the random rotation
[1:42:53] Ferdster02: Hm, controversial
[1:42:54] pendelluft: It‚Äôs probably a good idea.
[1:42:54] TheNewDingo: maybe its cause scav is the only obj with a lower success rate?
[1:42:55] CedH1: So hype when I start random vault and it's a scav
[1:42:57] leo2369q: we want scavs
[1:42:58] illycat_: i don't wanna get more hunt the gardians, they are boring
[1:42:58] haze_deadline: I loveee when twitch gives me a stream notification an hour into the stream! Hallo
[1:43:01] sgt_susman: cant you just make it an option I LOVE having it in the random pool
[1:43:02] Stephexfox: i think scavager is a team vault evet =)
[1:43:02] lauraannierose: cheaper seal then?
[1:43:03] Baumhunter200: no dont it that way
[1:43:03] dogoowithagun: it is a bad idea in my opinopinion sir
[1:43:06] CedH1: Don't take them off from random please
[1:43:07] NaraicM: What about a command that allows you to select what objs you can get in the random pool at the beginning of a new world?
[1:43:08] vhblast: Make a command to do that better then having it as default
[1:43:10] AyushJind: Hey @iskall85 the stats of vault on vaulterhunters web seems to have reset??
[1:43:11] paloution808: I think scavs are pretty good since update 11
[1:43:14] khanngi: survived instead of bailed
[1:43:14] IceSpice12: just make it a seal sir
[1:43:16] Baumhunter200: its good that you cant complete everthing
[1:43:21] leo2369q: its just boring if you always get the same objective
[1:43:21] cozmo42: I almost always failed solo scavs
[1:43:21] ausgewandert_: dont do it D: tell ppl in a quest, that its not designed to be autocomplete
[1:43:21] dawwsoon: poll it
[1:43:22] Zinoba: Some new people will never try out scavs then bc they won't know what that seal will do.
[1:43:23] zinou2019: what about making eazy garenty a scave item in every chest ?
[1:43:29] Pineapple0nPizza: No! The challenge is fun though! I feel like it's a small minority being loud about disliking scavs - you don't have to make everyone happy
[1:43:30] Darkstar159: KEK
[1:43:30] Plaeymaker: can we gamerule it?
[1:43:30] nounou26x: nooo
[1:43:31] the_whtvr: I'm playing solo so I modified the config to make scavs slightly easier, still manage to fail when I get kekd by eg. coin POIs (especially when I forgot to respec hunter)
[1:43:31] juxtaposed39: Sadge
[1:43:31] illycat_: can we have a setting to put it in rotation?
[1:43:32] Rafikosik1612: season 3 beginning flashbacks
[1:43:34] swordo3612: Why the game is already super easy
[1:43:34] Nicola_002: Sadge
[1:43:34] thebayker: OH that's NEWWW
[1:43:34] iljalz: oh?
[1:43:36] ViciTheTenorOon: Can you make it a gamerule so you can add it if you want
[1:43:36] momkus: its easy to craft.. why u all crying
[1:43:37] Nightbot: www.youtube.com/iskall85 | www.twitter.com/iskall85 | https://youtube.com/@vodskall85
[1:43:37] Baumhunter200: and it feels amazing when you do complete a difficult one
[1:43:38] VeraldOsu: what about iskallia servers?
[1:43:38] Ferdster02: Potion does nothing
[1:43:38] Zinoba: POTION DOES NOTHING BTW
[1:43:41] melodyyunjou: sadge
[1:43:41] toby8998: love to watch the scav vault
[1:43:41] leo2369q: please no
[1:43:41] Darkstar159: Wait no way you're serious
[1:43:46] Benayman: the Standard rotation is just 2 things then, isnt it?
[1:43:47] KubyTuby: scav are my least favourite and I barely manage to finish one. yet it feels very rewarding if I finish it
[1:43:47] TobyButt89: If the scav was somehow the secondary objective, then it would feel less like something you have to do, and something you can attempt if you want. But ye making it a seal only thing is a good idea
[1:43:48] mahik750: That's sadge
[1:43:52] dogoowithagun: i have not gone past lvl 60 but whenever i got scav it was hard but its good too
[1:43:53] Attackeight: quest line!
[1:43:56] dogoowithagun: a bit of fun too
[1:43:58] GrumpyK4t: gamerule to allow/not allow scavs in random vaults?
[1:44:02] dogoowithagun: not a bit a lot of fun
[1:44:04] HFBalanann: So i failed an exlier yesterday (two coin dungeons) and a dragon room - - just unlucky coin didnt give elixer
[1:44:04] MxRency: Should a toggle in gamerules to opt in if you want random scaf
[1:44:05] TheImmortaldonut: I'm bad at Scavs and I am starting to like the challenge of random Scavs. There are some vaults that I just accept I won't finish, and I loot and exit
[1:44:11] iljalz: true
[1:44:18] jimi_dean: Is it a simple command to put scabs back on to rotation? I want them
[1:44:18] autumspog: noooooo i like getting a random scav :(
[1:44:20] swordo3612: I don't think that's a good change
[1:44:22] lightdemup22: Don't remove it
[1:44:23] cozmo42: That‚Äôs a good choice
[1:44:27] Nightbot: Vault Hunters Reddit for you to check out! https://www.reddit.com/r/VaultHuntersMinecraft/
[1:44:27] jimi_dean: Scavs*
[1:44:29] perdoxide: no more scavs for plunderer?
[1:44:30] henks50: When is the next video on the main channel coming?
[1:44:35] CedH1: Please sir don't take scav out of the random objectiv
[1:44:37] abtechgen: scavs are good
[1:44:38] mejeree: The only thing I have trouble with in Scavs is needing 20+ ripped pages or 8+ pottery Shards every single time. I can't spend the entire vault looting wooden chests and still get everything else I need
[1:44:39] VeraldOsu: what about iskalia servers, would this setting be local or global so we wont have this?
[1:44:42] Zinoba: i've never disagreed with a change more tbh
[1:44:43] EllieIsShmexy: So then the rewards for the bounty should be better if you have to craft it
[1:44:43] ViciTheTenorOon: I like the random odds
[1:44:45] IceSpice12: let mr streamer do what he wants
[1:44:47] fightingpandanz: @iskall85 Ill play any version that you "the creater" deem to be a wearthy update or version.   for the public to play .
[1:44:50] Nightbot: For everything Vault Hunters, check out the website! https://vaulthunters.gg/
[1:44:53] evesteroo: @theimmortaldonut same here, it gets boring if you can always complete!
[1:44:54] pcfc: People need to get used to changing their objectives.  There are some objectives that I look at as soon as I enter the vault and know that I won't complete, so don't bother.  My objective then becomes looting and not completing.
[1:44:54] alxo: good change PogU
[1:44:54] illycat_: i wanna plunder and scav
[1:45:01] Pineapple0nPizza: Could it be a setting? I like not knowing if a vault will be easy or difficult when I enter
[1:45:02] mcpeking18: but in choas there should be a scav
[1:45:03] abtechgen: dont take them out of random obj sir
[1:45:07] Attackeight: I want an afterlife scav!
[1:45:09] Darkstar159: Gamerule for which objectives are in random rotation
[1:45:09] reverendheart44: Are you able to make it so that you can opt into it being in the random objective?
[1:45:09] Nauhar: make plunder sealable ?
[1:45:09] zivziv5: Then what about soul flame runs?
[1:45:09] alexandrospent: You can craft seals th8
[1:45:11] Lizerdman87: I think scavs should stay in the pool and people should stop being whiners lol
[1:45:12] dogoowithagun: it would not be as much fun if its like not in the random thingi it will not be as fun to know what you have to do
[1:45:14] NM_crazy: Just don't change it...
[1:45:15] scouty1989: @iskall85 would it be easier to add a recipe to a crystal - say combining a snowball + crystal - removes scav type from a random cystal? like adding a modifier "crystal cant be scav"
[1:45:15] grynd3rfl: Add a seal to the pearl
[1:45:15] Kasszi_: allow it to go on sealed crystals?
[1:45:15] warfirev: I would love to get a little Scav bag when I enter a Scav vault, that only works for that vault, that only collects scav items
[1:45:16] Nightbot: Twitch Tiers 2 & 3 subs & Patreons Diamond level & above can now sign up to play on the Vault Hunters servers. Join iskall's Discord at  discord.gg/iskall85 & sign up https://vaulthunters.gg/server-status Patreon https://www.patreon.com/iskall85
[1:45:17] JustusIsOnline: i think if you are going to make scav seal only then you need to make blank seals more easily obtainable
[1:45:20] Limbolobo: Don't take it out of rotation just lower the chance of getting scav
[1:45:26] paloution808: I know I wont complete most scavs, don't mean I'm not willing to try
[1:45:29] the_whtvr: I don't think I like the idea of removing scavs there, I do agree they are sometimes really hard simply due to the amoung of RNG in them (way more than other objectives) but still, it's a nice challenge
[1:45:32] dogoowithagun: i liked it when i got it randomly
[1:45:32] leo2369q: make it an accessibility thing
[1:45:33] mahik750: I don't really like this idea, because I am too much of a chicken to opt in to scavs, but I like the challenge when it is randomly rolled.
[1:45:36] Zinoba: sir ur potion doesnt do anything
[1:45:37] ViciTheTenorOon: Maybe make it a game mode like hard mode
[1:45:39] missionimpossible_: i feel like vh needs to learn about semver
[1:45:40] hypens_: potion is bugged?
[1:45:41] hamisharms: !update
[1:45:41] zinou2019: make the chance of a scave item in chest or ores scale with difficulty?
[1:45:52] swordo3612: Make it a game rule. Not a permanent thing
[1:45:53] Ferdster02: I kinda like to just run into a random vault and take what I get as an objective, don't particularly love scavs, so only put the seal on when i have a bounty, but i love the challenge when it comes up
[1:45:54] Darkstar159: This seems like a change you'll regret in the future
[1:45:57] alexandrospent: U can craft sealss!! @iskall85
[1:45:57] karthavya: is grievious wounds multiplicative sir?
[1:46:00] Darkstar159: The customer isn't always right
[1:46:01] fightingpandanz: add
[1:46:01] cozmo42: Some people feel like scavs are auto failure
[1:46:01] LangeDraak: Maybe link de scav in the rotation to the difficulty
[1:46:05] mommyfinn: ad
[1:46:06] GrumpyK4t: gamerule that would allow/ not allowscavs in random rotation?
[1:46:07] the_whtvr: does your potion work?
[1:46:09] mahik750: Gamerule? Make scavs optional true false?
[1:46:17] OddAbandon: I think the people you shouldn't please should be the ones angry at scav
[1:46:19] Luxi86: another table hryPog
[1:46:19] Zinoba: iwait but didnt you do that change to please some people in the first place?
[1:46:20] hamisharms: Whats the update on the update. Just joined
[1:46:23] Darkstar159: People don't know what's best for them
[1:46:23] TobyButt89: Maybe scavs can just be more rare in the rotation?
[1:46:23] pcfc: I love scavs.
[1:46:24] mahik750: @OddAbandon agree
[1:46:25] bhavyajain05_: remove them and add a command to add scav to random rotation
[1:46:25] ASmoothCr1minal: has it really been such a sticking point? seems most people here love scavs
[1:46:26] randomicFMIA: definitely agree it does feel like failure to not complete objective. I don't know what could be done about that.
[1:46:27] UTxMelina: But would that not mean it will not be runned? Or you add it only on Crystals what you modify with Vault catalysts ?
[1:46:28] mirohtomysoul: Gamerule or linked to difficulty?
[1:46:32] pootch_1: i feel like a toggle off for scav is best, since people will experience it but can decide if its too much
[1:46:32] nipla13: Hi iskall! Now that you mentioned lol. Do you watch the LEC games ?
[1:46:34] f4ty7th3e: why dont you have it as an optional thing like you have hard mode
[1:46:37] heighleybaily: The ledditers have worn him down
[1:46:37] Ferdster02: Could do it on gamerule base, or difficulty locked
[1:46:37] paloution808: Scavs are not my favorite, but I can only play as a single player
[1:46:38] lightdemup22: Command to add scavs
[1:46:41] angrrrrydad: @iskall85 i think random scav should stay, as you said "not every vault should be auto complete"
[1:46:54] gaymersalsa: back, pupper is brushed and looking fancy widepeepo
[1:46:56] ViciTheTenorOon: I think it's OK to fail
[1:46:57] paloution808: I do still like the objective
[1:46:59] Jackkabuki: Maybe add a gamerule to switch the scav show up or add an item that toggles it.
[1:47:05] rhometheus: I vote for a game rule random scav on / off
[1:47:08] vi_the_kingmc: @pootch_1 hallo Tomer
[1:47:09] Knew_It_Owl: @iskall85  What will you do after this challenge ends in a week or so? Continue on this server or go back to the VH SMP?
[1:47:09] wendymoto: @gaymersalsa pupper kaatCute
[1:47:09] kriptou21: can you make it so its something you opt in if you want to only play scav with seal (something like arcade)
[1:47:09] norvillesdingus: Why not allow seals to be put on plunder pearls?
[1:47:15] fightingpandanz: SCAV MUST STAY .. i hate them .. But they must stay .
[1:47:15] hinsher116: I do like scavenger, I just dont like getting impossible scavenger
[1:47:16] dogoowithagun: and it is not completly failing if you get the loot
[1:47:17] paloution808: Exactly
[1:47:24] mommyfinn: use lucky cry!
[1:47:26] Madpockz: When do you think 1.13 will come out?
[1:47:27] babyinastr8jacket: I'm off to go back to bed.  Gn everyone. See you in the replay
[1:47:28] ricnunes: @iskall85 why not make it like the cake loot? If you don't complete the scav, you don't get the full crate, but you always get it
[1:47:29] pukahontus: They are for sure the most difficult, but the most rewarding from a completion feeling, love a good scav
[1:47:31] excaliburhero19: Why is he getting trapped chests without clumsy modifier and with 100% Trap Disarm?
[1:47:37] Mr13igh: When was the last time you did not complete a vault?
[1:47:38] samsam21amb: have a gamerule for scavs in random crystals by default and then have the option for some people to remove the scav from the random crystals
[1:47:38] randomicFMIA: maybe a buff to bounty reward/exp and nerf to completion crates would help? So the main objective is bounties and completion is a bonus, rather than the other way around
[1:47:43] pcfc: I miss the 'bailed' notification.
[1:47:44] cozmo42: bug day
[1:47:46] LunaticGoneMad: hey @iskall85  is the over all limit on god rep is still 25 cuz X said that limit will be gone so 25 in each god at once will be possible
[1:47:48] babyd252: Maybe work on performance make it less laggy when running on a server
[1:47:49] RMZing: Sir, artifacts are 80% tied to completion. The whole objective of the game is mostly tied to this thing you're calling a bonus
[1:47:50] gaymersalsa: BRAAAAACE FOR BRAZIER
[1:47:51] KJAERB0: Scav runs does not encourage you to turn Scavitems in beore you have them ALL .. Maybe turning in parts of the scavs should give you something , maybe just exp or so
[1:47:52] supermonkeyfart: Could set the scav objectives to needing 10 coin items, but pearls are worth 5 and vials are worth 1?
[1:47:52] paloution808: Locked scav, is pretty bru6
[1:47:58] paloution808: Brutal
[1:47:59] ProfBits: for scavs and feeling cheated: maybe say on level X, 1 omega, 1 epic, ... fixed and the items come from exactly 3, (4) diffrent sources only. eg. 2 diffrent omega or 5 diffrent looting targets at once
[1:48:05] missionimpossible_: @KJAERB0 why is that a problem?
[1:48:12] AceK1n9: if trying to get to lvl 100 would focusing on living from the beginning be good?
[1:48:14] timmiegamer_: yea somwhere in that region
[1:48:15] gaymersalsa: perfectly balanced.
[1:48:18] Pineapple0nPizza: the fact that you can just exit if you don't complete is why I don't get the scav hate - there's no negative penalty to not completing
[1:48:18] G_M4K: somewhere around 15-16%
[1:48:20] gaymersalsa: balanceUpdate
[1:48:32] mag_ring23: hello @iskall85
[1:48:35] hinsher116: Mice potion KEKW
[1:48:38] MarkDatter: potion isnt working...
[1:48:41] missionimpossible_: @Pineapple0nPizza people percieve it as a negative because they didn't complete the vault, get xp, etc
[1:48:42] IceSpice12: mmmmmm oh yeag
[1:48:44] mahik750: I think many games go down this route, where it gradually gets easier and easier to accomodate upset people. But then you lose some of the fun too in my opinion
[1:48:45] mirohtomysoul: Is the potion bugged? It's not depleting
[1:48:45] EllieIsShmexy: @acek1n9 yes
[1:48:45] Gnilane: Butbnow it feels ok that I can't complete a vault because I know I'm not supposed to. Taking the scavenger away iut the random roll is gonna make me feel bad about not being able to complete because it's supposed to be easier...
[1:48:46] TheImmortaldonut: One thing I still struggle with on Scav vaults is knowing which mobs drop which essence
[1:48:46] elffern: i like that it rolls randomly , something like a plunders pearl or gamerule to stop them would be good
[1:48:46] melodyyunjou: potion not working
[1:48:46] falsesymmetry: ...rip potions too
[1:48:47] Ferdster02: Mixed up the values for clumsy and trap disarm
[1:48:47] Pineapple0nPizza: test.json
[1:48:48] zeus_o9o2: potion not working no ???
[1:48:48] ViciTheTenorOon: @pineapple0npizza exactly
[1:48:51] khanngi: BRB im gonna walk with my dog it is nice weather outside
[1:48:52] mahik750: Potion not working sir
[1:48:55] missionimpossible_: winning has become expected for some reason
[1:49:00] Jackkabuki: Borked Patch
[1:49:00] Noni_230: what does lucky cry do?
[1:49:01] falsesymmetry: captain oblivious
[1:49:03] Chrispello1995: removing scavs from the random pool would e a horrible decision. maybe just making them show up later would be better?
[1:49:04] dia__hi: LUL LUL
[1:49:04] Zinoba: weve been telling you this for an hour hryLaf
[1:49:06] Jackkabuki: Dowsky
[1:49:09] zeus_o9o2: DOWSKYYYY
[1:49:10] the_whtvr: you did change the mana amount though
[1:49:10] jaanonimpl: good code
[1:49:11] cozmo42: I bet you‚Äôve applied the patch wrong
[1:49:11] fightingpandanz: so 16% base , PLUS my what ever trap disarm ... Makes it worse ? this could be fun
[1:49:12] floppypidgen: is there anyway for vh to accept contribution? Im a java dev and would love to help debug
[1:49:12] Zinoba: legacy potion
[1:49:13] Roll_It_Twice: Try dropping it and picking it up
[1:49:13] mahik750: Everything is falling apart slowly
[1:49:13] InflatablePanda: Is it legacy potion?
[1:49:15] Asterionm: how did he not notice
[1:49:16] mihea13: You fixed mana potions
[1:49:17] MarkDatter: did he bring multiple or leave it in a pouch? i mised the start of the vault
[1:49:18] devo_gr: balanceUpdate
[1:49:18] theqif: Cos computer says no
[1:49:19] excaliburhero19: Really awful KEKW
[1:49:19] MonsieurBorger: maybe because the amount was lowered so it broke?
[1:49:20] ViciTheTenorOon: Somebody touched it
[1:49:21] IceSpice12: farty potions
[1:49:21] missionimpossible_: sir you need unit tests
[1:49:22] 60wattlightbulb: No more heals
[1:49:23] jane_co11: Well it is 13
[1:49:24] itzliam_222: you did touch it cause u changed it to lower mana amount
[1:49:24] mirohtomysoul: Maybe with the legacy potions?
[1:49:25] ViciTheTenorOon: Gave it a poke
[1:49:25] adts413: Maybe because it's a legacy portion
[1:49:26] Fanet0oo: Legacy potions
[1:49:30] snaptin5643: the idea that everything should be completed in games need to realize that it take the fun out of a game if you know you can complete everything. some fails need to be in the game
[1:49:30] excaliburhero19: It's because it's old maybe?
[1:49:31] Dezzles: Just programming problems
[1:49:31] LangeDraak: You changed mana value right?
[1:49:31] itzliam_222: laegacy
[1:49:31] alexandrospent: Maybelegacy
[1:49:32] LalaDiable: IskLuck? lol
[1:49:33] Giel2002: I think it broke when you hit the potion recharge pylon
[1:49:34] mahik750: It didn't work in your previous vault either I think
[1:49:35] Knew_It_Owl: Rip vanilla health regen, Rip potion, Rip Bin Baby...
[1:49:35] craftydanno: gtievous?
[1:49:35] paloution808: Nothing
[1:49:36] sgt_susman: could be because it‚Äôs legacy
[1:49:38] MxRency: Maby beacause its an old potion
[1:49:39] fAt_CaT123456: is this a server or a private world?
[1:49:39] Q_Meets_The_Doctor: potion nerf patch
[1:49:42] jimi_dean: Try turning it off and on again
[1:49:43] P3pp3rF1y: I probably see what's wrong with trap disarm - it gets ignored as soon as there's a trapped chance
[1:49:44] Nukeri: I guess breaking the potions is a nerf after all
[1:49:48] PaVLo_2L: AntiPatch&
[1:49:50] pendelluft: I might have missed the answer but will Scavs still be apart of Ascension?
[1:49:53] Zinoba: It already wasn't working when it had the high mana on it
[1:49:53] gaymersalsa: !armory
[1:49:54] Nightbot: Check out what level the Hermitcraft members are on their Vault Hunters server: https://vaulthunters.gg/armory/browse
[1:49:56] Jackkabuki: Peppaaaaa
[1:49:58] blah_321: Chat, did he run the special vault he was trying to do in the start?
[1:49:58] freddyb8: Can you reload the configs
[1:50:03] devo_gr: maybe it's the washedup.js ?
[1:50:05] Thomlennix: greeeta gris knorr
[1:50:05] alexandrospent: Legacy??
[1:50:09] advcky: pepa stronk
[1:50:11] falsesymmetry: Peppa please save us!
[1:50:12] mahik750: @P3pp3rF1y Sassy traps. "I see you have a trap disarm, but I Don't care!" :D
[1:50:15] TheRedBrain: the joy of coding and especially minecraft coding touch this thing and something completely unrelated dies
[1:50:18] fightingpandanz: Almost sounds like you need a few more testers :P
[1:50:20] cozmo42: Try binning a baby false
[1:50:25] ViciTheTenorOon: Peppard putting in the work
[1:50:26] IceSpice12: Harry‚Äôs dog?
[1:50:27] tobydog_aka_hento: yay. im back and my test went great.
[1:50:29] angelfoxruby: @blah_321 nah, it didn't load and he has to wait for the 24 hrs to run it
[1:50:29] swordo3612: I think the game is getting easier with each update and I fear it getting too easy.
[1:50:35] Pineapple0nPizza: @missionimpossible_ Yeah I understand that but it's just a lack of gain rather than a loss - I don't think changing the whole game idea to "you can always win" is a good solution, maybe it just needs bettter explained that a completion is a bonus not a given?
[1:50:37] gaymersalsa: üå∂Ô∏è
[1:50:42] h2ikco: In peppa we trust
[1:50:44] falsesymmetry: those blocks did that before the  update too. plus any you place in the area you hammered
[1:50:44] zeus_o9o2: @cozmo42 LUL LUL LUL  tried once not working
[1:50:46] craftydanno: u added that green heart thing
[1:50:49] Jackkabuki: hot-pepper
[1:50:49] mahik750: @TheRedBrain 99 little bugs in the code, take one down, patch it around, 117 little bugs in the code
[1:50:52] pendelluft: @swordo3612 if you‚Äôre not playing fragged then played fragged
[1:51:01] kostasdida: Maybe try making one with the new modifier values
[1:51:03] Kasszi_: has he even done any god altars
[1:51:10] IceSpice12: no
[1:51:12] mahik750: @Kasszi_ I think he forgot
[1:51:15] pendelluft: @kasszi_ I chose wrong lol
[1:51:16] zeus_o9o2: nope they were broken
[1:51:17] Nezyka: Nezyka subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 53 months! 
[1:51:18] forelini: you should be able to get burger chillis from treasure chests
[1:51:19] G_M4K: Potion wasn't working before the modifier
[1:51:22] unknownbasket: No
[1:51:23] TheRedBrain: @mahik750 ... profit?
[1:51:23] Kasszi_: Classic
[1:51:24] Gryfenfer88: Iskall, shouldn't spec hunter into objectif, so u can find more god altars ?
[1:51:26] adts413: No potion was broken in the last vault too
[1:51:26] missionimpossible_: @Pineapple0nPizza yeah I agree, but not sure how to get people to understand that. people always expect to do well i guess. "everyone's a winner!"
[1:51:27] iljalz: might?
[1:51:27] RMZing: You aren't even consuming potion uses
[1:51:34] Enoila123: !update 13
[1:51:35] jimi_dean: Nope, potion was busted before that brazier
[1:51:41] ViciTheTenorOon: Vendoor
[1:51:44] Zinoba: OHHH
[1:51:46] ricnunes: adding this again for visibility, but @iskall85 why not make it like the cake loot? If you don't complete the scav, you don't get the full crate, but you always get a fraction of it
[1:51:48] Danymaddox: YES
[1:51:49] Nukeri: poggskall
[1:51:49] Z0eff: :o
[1:51:51] Attackeight: !release

[1:51:52] excaliburhero19: FINALLYYYYYYY YOU GET THESE SCROLLS
[1:51:52] alexandrospent: Maybe the potion isn't working, bc it's a legacy potion
[1:51:53] forelini: YOOOO

[1:52:37] MistyWhip: howdy
[1:52:37] mahik750: @missionimpossible_ I agree. When games get too easy to make sure that nobody gets upset, you also lose the feeling of earning your wins
[1:52:43] ViciTheTenorOon: Pickerang will always be missed
[1:52:49] alexandrospent: @iskall85 Maybe the potion isn't working, bc it's a legacy potion
[1:52:50] gaymersalsa: sbammy
[1:52:57] henks50: have you done your daily vault?
[1:53:08] AeIaen: you can make ores trapped, with silverfish like monsters
[1:53:10] ViciTheTenorOon: Daily vault was bugged
[1:53:15] Khalin1212: @henks50 he tried, but it bugged and went on cooldown

[1:55:50] mommyfinn: feels beeter!
[1:55:54] Noni_230: when finale?
[1:55:57] ViciTheTenorOon: Can you get so many champions that the vault is 100% champs
[1:56:21] falsesymmetry: were there new ones added? didnt see champ before
[1:56:23] thegoginator2000: what is a useless talent/skill you have?

[1:57:05] gaymersalsa: !commands edit !end 9 DAYS until the 100 days Vault Hunters challenge is over and the Hermits need to have the artifact puzzle completed to fight the Herald! Iskall‚Äôs last episode of the series will be out on February 1st!
[1:57:05] Nightbot: @gaymersalsa -> The command "!end" has been updated successfully.
[1:57:06] Night2315: wait, whats on this potion if not mana?
[1:57:08] mahik750: Circling back to the completing every vault feel issue, what if the name changed to not make you feel like "completing is a must". Like bailed got changed to survived, completed could change to ... I don't know, something that holds the meaning of "extra cherry on top of your loot and XP"
[1:57:11] Luxi86: I heard the buzzle is gomplete already Cheergi
[1:57:12] pendelluft: @gaymersalsa idk if iskall mentioned but i was watching joe a couple days ago and he said that you don‚Äôt need to be level 100 because anyone who is level 100 can sponsor non-100s
[1:57:39] fightingpandanz: sorry chat... any word on publick release of update ?
[1:57:41] pendelluft: That Etho - what a hater!
[1:57:50] Icerz_: @night2315 potions are broken
[1:57:51] Attackeight: @pendelluft based
[1:57:57] paloution808: How do you finish a brazier vault? Exit like the old monoliths?
[1:57:59] gaymersalsa: yeah pendelluft
[1:58:15] zeus_o9o2: @paloution808 yes
[1:58:26] Nightbot: www.youtube.com/iskall85 | www.twitter.com/iskall85 | https://youtube.com/@vodskall85
[1:58:27] Cerise_Cordelia: Sorry, but what does the pillage option mean? It's the first time i'm watching this type of vault objective
[1:58:31] mahik750: @paloution808 yes
[1:58:33] IceSpice12: we love a challenge
[1:58:35] cobswicked: is update 13 out?
[1:58:40] pendelluft: @cerise_cordelia loot
[1:58:41] mortualiaa: LORE?
[1:58:42] falsesymmetry: I like the idea of a challenge the second time you play fighting at lower levels.
[1:58:49] mahik750: @Cerise_Cordelia You click braziers to get loot and some negative modifier.
[1:58:58] Cerise_Cordelia: @mahik750 thank you!
[1:59:02] paloution808: Roger
[1:59:07] falsesymmetry: That's the correct way to use it I think
[1:59:10] cozmo42: What‚Äôs your favorite magic spell?
[1:59:23] gaymersalsa: gamerule Cheergi
[1:59:26] z3bu_: so who can get the lowest level herald completion possible?
[1:59:31] Zaraca90: Bdouble will reach lvl 100
[1:59:36] mahik750: Infinite burgers for people?
[1:59:38] archie666: @iskall85 to be fair .. scheduling over christmas was not optimal for people. Thats 14 Day or so gone
[1:59:38] pendelluft: Yeah. Xisuma has been saying that he‚Äôs going to take on a ‚Äúsupport role‚Äù. But‚Ä¶ how.
[1:59:42] Knew_It_Owl: But if you set it to level 70 and most of the hermits are lvl 100, aren't you making the boss too easy?
[1:59:43] z3bu_: lvl 40?

[2:08:33] LachlanMG: it‚Äôs quite strong
[2:08:34] leo2369q: but its kind of boring
[2:08:34] dogoowithagun: it iss
[2:08:37] ViciTheTenorOon: Burn the old gear
[2:08:37] dogoowithagun: underratted

[2:08:40] profesorpineaple: I am neutral about it
[2:08:41] Fanet0oo: I'm into healing efficiency
[2:08:42] RMZing: I do focus a bit on healing efficiency. It works very well for Aid Cheer100
[2:08:42] Assass1n69420: I am and its great cuz i can heal all my hp with 1 heal
[2:08:43] falsesymmetry: bin baby confirmed to be leaving the SMP. rip

[2:08:46] KJAERB0: You are not healing still
[2:08:46] CedH1: It's good
[2:08:49] thatfunnyyt: I have never used healing efficiency, to me it feels more natural to go towards damage builds
[2:08:50] LachlanMG: I combo it with mana shield
[2:08:51] kowbieee777: I have 130 I only need 1lvl in heal
[2:08:51] Giel2002: I usually try to have it on at least one gear piece

[2:08:58] CallumPO6: If I get it, I roll with it, but it's not something I actively want to put on a build
[2:08:59] pd1maahee: Pylon probably
[2:09:00] itzliam_222: used it alot before potions
[2:09:01] Zinoba: it didnt work in both vaults you ran
[2:09:02] untruthfully: i think its just opportunity cost if u dont need heal that much
[2:09:03] the_whtvr: I'm pretty sure the potion didn't work in an earlier vault too
[2:09:04] cobswicked: i play full health and heal eff for lucky heal build. Its perfect! and super easy
[2:09:05] Gorbyas: its great but IQ and IR just *feel* better
[2:09:07] ShadowCrafter_01: No I can recall it not working in the other vault you did today
[2:09:07] niku71: I think at higher levels I started appreciating it more
[2:09:08] gamingwithtoimen: i  have not come across a healing effiency yet but not sure if i want to use it
[2:09:10] xPebblesx: @falsesymmetry That's sad.  i really enjoyed bin baby
[2:09:13] LachlanMG: high level heal and mana shield makes me immortal

[2:09:32] LangeDraak: Bring a backup potion to the next vault
[2:09:35] pendelluft: I miss bin baby
[2:09:36] Nauhar: it's confusing to know how it works with low % and low health pool: How the rounding works ?
[2:09:39] alexandrospent: @iskall85 Check if its only the Legacy potions dont work
[2:09:44] CallumPO6: does healing efficiency work on life leach?
[2:09:46] ProfessionalsOnly: Everything's too stronk LUL
[2:09:46] TheImmortaldonut: It wasn't bin baby's fault

[2:12:27] Jackkabuki: @laxxbe The doll records all you do inside the vault and the person that crafted the doll can kill it to get a Duplicated share of the stuff. They have exp % and Loot % efficiency so thats your "share"

[2:33:28] blah_321: Unit test cases. They are important
[2:33:30] P3pp3rF1y: especially when you start combining stuff together we just have so many combinations  to test
[2:33:32] Codeman750: It's always hard to catch every edge case

[2:33:53] joeri_van: I am sure there are some Dylans who could be bug tester, but certainly not me
[2:33:55] JonesiBlitz: Always add more bugs, doesn't matter how many get squashed, is annoying sometimes :)
[2:33:56] unknownbasket: How do max reputation points work again?
[2:34:01] ViciTheTenorOon: With no potion
[2:34:05] ShadowCrafter_01: There are more problems than programs to solve them. Proved that at uni.
[2:34:06] ViciTheTenorOon: I wouldn't
[2:34:09] justchaoui: Is a hydra cut one head two grow

[2:35:21] ggamito: couldn't champions be considered tanks? LUL
[2:35:27] braydenpiag: TRUE
[2:35:44] Jarethkor: braziers seem like and exciting meta and fun control over the experience
[2:35:53] EnslavedMoist: but the downside is that you have to be back at the exit
[2:35:53] gaymersalsa: brazier is fonna be really fun for cata runs
[2:36:05] CallumPO6: and also if you elixir focus something with no elixir, then you're a bit stuck
[2:36:17] johnnnnnnnncena: my friend got sand room in his divine
[2:36:24] LangeDraak: Could there be a modifier that gives spawners a chance to spawn in more waves?
[2:36:27] gaymersalsa: oh yes
[2:36:29] jeeukko_: yes
[2:36:30] gaymersalsa: based baaed
[2:36:31] cozmo42: ooooh
[2:36:32] Niko_993: i think thats nice
[2:36:32] Frulicity: That is such a nice idea
[2:36:32] vi_the_kingmc: ooooo
[2:36:34] Kasszi_: thats a great idea
[2:36:35] jezzif1: That sounds a lot more intuitive
[2:36:36] ViciTheTenorOon: That's good
[2:36:36] gaymersalsa: and dungeon damage?
[2:36:36] L_Basker: yes
[2:36:37] sharkastic_shark: That sound better
[2:36:38] HFBalanann: Oh i love that! very intuitive to design
[2:36:41] Danymaddox: i like
[2:36:41] joeri_van: it would certainly make it more coherent
[2:36:42] mahik750: that sounds great
[2:36:43] ViciTheTenorOon: Champion damage
[2:36:52] peppa_j: gg
[2:36:52] Kasszi_: @gaymersalsa we know what etho is taking
[2:36:53] Ribery931: ye i like the idea too.

[2:36:54] N_Y_G_G: Sad
[2:36:56] MahSpoogies: If y'all were to expand your dev team, would you post a public application? Fellow comp sci major here obsessed with this awesome game you created!
[2:36:57] LachlanMG: isn‚Äôt the current stuff better for dungeon optimisation?
[2:36:58] gaymersalsa: lol kass
[2:37:07] CallumPO6: would there also be a dungeon/champion mob damage boost?
[2:37:08] Niko_993: they replace tank mobs in most spawners
[2:37:12] ViciTheTenorOon: Gamba is won
[2:37:12] z_e_ns: bugskall
[2:37:13] MunchNL: that is already in update 12
[2:37:14] nounou26x: it always was tanks
[2:37:15] LunaticGoneMad: they haven been like that from a while
[2:37:15] nasrou85: Is there any possibility of running a paradox vault today?
[2:37:15] hinsher116: bugskall gaming
[2:37:16] Fanet0oo: Nope they have always been tanks
[2:37:21] sp0rsk: they always seem to spawn with tanks
[2:37:23] MarkDatter: the magmatic piglins do spawn in place of tank mobs at first, right?
[2:37:25] LachlanMG: like nether damage and such
[2:37:27] gaymersalsa: @mahspoogies email iskall! they‚Äôre always looking for more people to work with
[2:37:28] MunchNL: piglins are tanks in update 12
[2:37:29] karthavya: magmatic piglins are tanks because they are mainly in tank spawners
[2:37:31] vidiush: i think they should be tanks because they roll allongside the tanks in spawns
[2:37:31] Gorbyas: thats in game for a long time the piglins
[2:37:33] LeoTheLeopardNZ: @hinsher116 nope, bugs on patch day mean the timer was spent
[2:37:35] craftydanno: magmatics often accompany a tank
[2:37:36] TobyButt89: They always spawn with the tank spawns. I would HATE for the magmatic to spawn along side spiders!!
[2:37:37] joeri_van: only doing dungeons of a type that you spect in
[2:37:42] gaymersalsa: poggSpinskall
[2:37:43] the_great_tan: Can you run 1 divine paradox on camera plzz
[2:37:45] Tazzad: Why does braziers affect dungeons, but catalysts doesnt?
[2:37:46] MahSpoogies: @gaymersalsa Oh great thank you! Do you know where I can find his email?
[2:37:48] mcpeking18: why is your idona reputation going down
[2:37:51] ViciTheTenorOon: @nasrou85 it's bugged not till tomorrow
[2:37:52] gaymersalsa: !yt
[2:37:52] Nightbot: For more Iskall content, sub to him on YouTube! https://www.youtube.com/@iskall85 || To never miss a stream, sub to vodskall85! https://www.youtube.com/@vodskall85
[2:38:03] the_whtvr: so accustomed increases all XP or only from the point of getting it?
[2:38:05] gaymersalsa: mahspoogies there‚Äôs a link on his about section on main YouTube
[2:38:05] cl4sh3r_69: hoard damage wouldn‚Äôt rlly matter as you one hit them most of the time anyway, maybe some kind of aoe for hoards instead
[2:38:06] JashinFanatic: can't you add adjustments on the fly to dungeons like the new cake vaults do?
[2:38:06] MahSpoogies: @gaymersalsa Oops not sure how that turned into an emote
[2:38:10] the_flerken: please add a chat message for getting a reputation point with info on the total reputation as well (e.g. you got +1 velara, now you have 7). it's more intuitive, especially for unexperienced players imo
[2:38:15] MahSpoogies: @gaymersalsa Great thanks I'll look!
[2:38:25] gaymersalsa: @MahSpoogies where WHAAAT LuL
[2:38:26] joeri_van: and more weapon types as swords and axes?
[2:38:27] LangeDraak: Could there be a negative modifier that gives spawners the chance to spawn in more waves?
[2:38:31] Drummer10113: Does accustomed apply toeverything you did in the vault before you got the brazier?
[2:38:50] peppa_j: what type is herald?
[2:38:53] EnslavedMoist: I'd go for horde to one shot them probably
[2:38:53] angrrrrydad: you should utilize hunter for the altars and braziers ..
[2:38:56] RMZing: Could be a great way to differentiate swords and axes. Swords can get Horde Damage, and Axes can get Tank Damage exclusively
[2:38:58] nasrou85: Paradox vault today?
[2:39:00] HFBalanann: however, you dont see tanks as often as other mobs
[2:39:06] TobyButt89: Assassin damage over tank damage anyday
[2:39:07] sgt_susman: axe buff
[2:39:09] chezzmcmeat5: 7 min iskall
[2:39:12] fiddlyfudbucket: gamber payout?
[2:39:14] gaymersalsa: he tried running paradox earlier but it was bugged out
[2:39:15] DavidOJChapmanGaming: When does update 13 come out
[2:39:15] Luxi86: speed hryPog
[2:39:20] Pineapple0nPizza: class damage sounds cool - tank vs assassin vs hoard rather than nether vs undead etc would be awesome!
[2:39:26] MathanW: you could make various tools make more/less damage against various mob types
[2:39:26] mortualiaa: 7m
[2:39:33] ProfBits: or catalysts for dungone amount and difficullty?
[2:39:36] ViciTheTenorOon: I know iskall said the hermits could make a custom item just watch someone be an absolute troll and pick a vault crossbow or something
[2:39:38] baka_raion_hato_31: @DavidOJChapmanGaming  curently hot fixing
[2:39:39] mcpeking18: can someone answer me why did iskalls idona reputation go down when he gained one velara
[2:39:54] Jackkabuki: Is accustomed retroactive? or does it only boost exp from after you took it?
[2:40:03] DavidOJChapmanGaming: @baka_raion_hato_31  ok
[2:40:05] EnslavedMoist: @mcpeking18 because the max reputation you can have is 25 over all gods
[2:40:07] RMZing: No experience for trapped
[2:40:08] gaymersalsa: lead dev everybody
[2:40:10] LeoTheLeopardNZ: @mcpeking18 In U12 you can only have 25 reputation total
[2:40:12] ViciTheTenorOon: @mcpeking18 there's limits to how many reputation total you cannhave
[2:40:18] pursued__toast: What‚Äôs the rationale Behind wooden chest, breaking different than gilded or Nate in living?#
[2:40:21] karthavya: no other than killing mob trap dwellers
[2:40:27] blackeydpanda: Hey @iskall85 finally caught a stream. Usually just watch this youtube channel people should follow Vodskall85
[2:40:28] mcpeking18: @EnslavedMoist thanks :D
[2:40:33] baka_raion_hato_31: @ViciTheTenorOon  crosbow are useless  ( unless rockets ) better use  the hovering tridant throw
[2:40:34] kinglarrythe5th: could we add a thing that is where if you have less hit points you are stronger and faster?
[2:40:35] fiddlyfudbucket: gamba payout when
[2:40:35] Ferdster02: @mcpeking18 you can only have 25 max totak reputation, if you exceed you get a decrease in a random other god
[2:40:39] GhoulHunter811: accoustmed applied to dolls as well?
[2:40:41] gaymersalsa: @pursued__toast wooden chests are more vanilla like
[2:40:53] N_Y_G_G: When you start to pillage, how many you need to do before completing the vault?
[2:40:55] gaymersalsa: @fiddlyfudbucket when kass can complete it!

[2:41:11] Kokloler: below????
[2:41:11] RMZing: @gaymersalsa Don't say that, they're gonna think you need an axe to break it
[2:41:18] fiddlyfudbucket: @gaymersalsa Yipee!!
[2:41:31] nasrou85: Paradox vault?
[2:41:33] PRIPYAT715: @forelini it is with VH stuff...

[2:41:53] valkojam: not at all
[2:41:53] ShadowCrafter_01: At first when you asked us to sub to vodskall I was skeptical and didn't do it. But you started pumping out so much good content there that I just had to!

[2:42:14] gaymersalsa: classic complaining about neverending stream of content like it doesn‚Äôt take any effort
[2:42:18] Niko_993: he missed it 2 blocks away
[2:42:19] gaymersalsa: kass he got 2 rep already
[2:42:24] mortualiaa: missed one upstairs
[2:42:24] gaymersalsa: or thingies
[2:42:28] goldfish_paradise: it vwas in the middle of this room
[2:42:41] Kokloler: greedskall
[2:42:41] mimilayaa: @gaymersalsa people complain about more content?
[2:42:46] juxtaposed39: wait you can get more than 1 reputation point per vault?!
[2:42:46] MathanW: @gaymersalsa i dont really agree though, it is just that content is either something you consume out of habit which needs to be regular, or if it is in the spotlight
[2:42:46] Darkstar159: Are you planning to add competitive vaulting like habba?
[2:42:47] Onne: How do you always get over 100k exp in your vaults? I only get like 60k when at level 85
[2:42:48] joeri_van: that is why vodskall is good, not everybody likes watching twitch but they still get their weekly dose of iskall content
[2:42:50] zebrainap: noooooooo running a hunt the guardians for my legendary bounty and ofc it rolls a void vault AAAA
[2:42:54] StandaSK: would like to see your keybinds for various abilities. I have like 4 skills and I'm already struggling  with that :P
[2:42:57] Kasszi_: @gaymersalsa oh i forgot i made it 2+ and not 3+
[2:43:01] Kasszi_: as the highest
[2:43:02] GhoulHunter811: iskall what kind of build u will take for the herald? Stomp one?
[2:43:03] ash_tronaut616: Coin hammer???

[2:43:12] nihalm_32: YOOOOOOOO
[2:43:14] baka_raion_hato_31: watch out for the clancs
[2:43:14] FrostiTosti: on the other hand. if a youtuber you love doesn't upload for a while the excitement when he does is even bigger! so why take the time to unsub before the ''i quit'' video @iskall85
[2:43:20] ash_tronaut616: What happened to coin hammer??
[2:43:29] cl4sh3r_69: @kasszi_ too late now paggers

[2:43:51] pancake_lover_333: just remembered to sub to vodskall
[2:43:51] gaymersalsa: @mathanw it‚Äôs still a weird comment to make because it downplays the amount of work that goes into putting out content and the emotional toll it can take on creators
[2:43:54] LangeDraak: Brazier!
[2:43:56] gaymersalsa: HUMBLE SECCI
[2:43:59] pancake_lover_333: !stress

[2:44:03] mimilayaa: it's very nice that theyre cut down :)
[2:44:12] forelini: failing a brazier is wild
[2:44:18] Onne: It's not failing right? Kappa It's getting resources
[2:44:21] blackeydpanda: unfortunately the stream is during work hours for me. BUT today im working from home so i can just chill with the stream on my second stream xD
[2:44:23] statsnerd1550: cheer seki
[2:44:23] hufppuf: are other hermits joining next season, Pearl would be good at it I think
[2:44:24] peeeepooo: You should include delooting phase after the vault in VOD as well
[2:44:24] Nightbot: Vault Hunters Reddit for you to check out! https://www.reddit.com/r/VaultHuntersMinecraft/
[2:44:29] gaymersalsa: planskall
[2:44:29] GhoulHunter811: does pillaging give xp?
[2:44:34] mahik750: I am loving the new style vodskall content. I will not start a 4h 30 m episode during my lunch, but I will watch a 40 minute one for sure. (I know you can pause a 4h 30m too but, come on, pausing iskall is hard)
[2:44:44] forelini: @ghoulhunter811 gives loot
[2:44:46] country_str0ng: Because of time zone differences, vodskall is typically where I get my VH fix.  Love it
[2:44:54] redstonedad: Secci is MVP
[2:44:56] Nightbot: For everything Vault Hunters, check out the website! https://vaulthunters.gg/

[2:45:09] Nightbot: Watch iskall85‚Äôs VOD‚Äôs at https://youtube.com/@vodskall85
[2:45:14] Q_Meets_The_Doctor: I am usualy asleep when you stream so i like the content on vodskill85
[2:45:25] LeoTheLeopardNZ: I feel like a cut down stream is a lot easier for EVERYONE, since sometimes as a viewer you don't want to watch 3 or 4 hours of a full VOD replay, but you'll watch something that's a bit edited down to get all the things you need. And for a streamer its nice because you dont have to edit much else
[2:45:32] Niko_993: how many times did you repair your machete so far?
[2:45:34] TheJollyPainter: take the alter

[2:46:04] mahik750: @forelini yeah
[2:46:04] Nero918: Curious for your opinion on Mega Jump, Iskall. I've playing my first playthrough the last 2 weeks and watching others play, and it just seems to be worse Dash? I can see the point if you need a 'second charge' of Dash for cooldown reasons, but it feels like a waste of skill points.
[2:46:07] drewbacca1981: It's really great having you more active on vodskall and the main channel. Definitely been missing all this Iskall content
[2:46:09] baka_raion_hato_31: did watch vodskal 85 for  a week due to travel but when i came back it was like watching a moovie  better then narnia as far as elternative pocket dimention

[2:46:28] Megaking202: I can never understand why people unsub, if i watch a channel enough to be sad that they don't upload, unsub would just take away the joy of watching them from myself forever
[2:46:30] sharkastic_shark: Im getting so many ads today

[3:08:36] angrrrrydad: why make it hard.. its charity
[3:08:40] FrostiTosti: 100 miners in 1 vault is quite ok right?
[3:08:53] jaegerdreadful: @FrostiTosti It needs to be 1 million
[3:08:57] mahik750: @Niko_993 special chests give out loot per hit, wooden chests break all at once. So for wooden, you need mining speed, which is not relevant for gilded, living, ornate and coins.
[3:09:04] jaegerdreadful: Yes he is
[3:09:06] ViciTheTenorOon: Feel like you need to transmog the gear
[3:09:07] pg_109: How to unlock?
[3:09:07] LupiCanis: O/
[3:09:08] mahik750: @mahik750 Except at high levels, where you have strong boxes.

[3:09:30] FrostiTosti: @batt3ryac1d in 1 single vault? :O
[3:09:33] jaegerdreadful: Yes sir
[3:09:40] braydenpiag: how many times have you been hit by a falling anvil in a vault?
[3:09:41] henks50: 500 seems too much. 300 is fair
[3:09:42] baka_raion_hato_31: @braydenpiag  to open the door no ( but vendor are generated like dungeon after the vault loot ore are generated ) so you'r fine it's just browsing
[3:09:42] ViciTheTenorOon: We'll remember
[3:09:49] ShelobsLair_: NOTED

[3:10:33] alivedemonnyte: 500 sound like a nice round no
[3:10:33] pendelluft: test
[3:10:37] batt3ryac1d: @Onne Update 13 which is TBD I think
[3:10:57] Onne: Ah okay
[3:10:57] the_oscar_cat: lvl 100 yeah, but lvl 50 or 25, even 100 is hard early game, so it depends when you want the transmog to be accessible
[3:11:02] fiddlyfudbucket: gamba for book bounty completion

[3:41:45] axolotine: the toxic gamer in me will not allow me to ignore ascension
[3:41:45] lostcoltgame: Grand scheme of things, this has been a pretty cool community collaboration. Lots of players, lifting each other up, which is what I want from a hermitcraft collaboration.
[3:41:54] AyushJind: why are peoples stats resseting for vaults run? on web
[3:41:57] LachlanMG: the completionist in me wants trophy
[3:42:02] lazypandaman: wait xB would do them?
[3:42:16] pendelluft: Joe was so worried about accidentally killing Beef‚Äôs dog the other night when he accidentally brought bad omen to Beef‚Äôs base. He doesn‚Äôt have to worry now
[3:42:17] gaymersalsa: miss steak
[3:42:19] EldritchDigger: I've been enjoying most of the content from the group, but focused Iskall, Wels, Vintage, Etho and Stress (Joe and False as well, in lower quantities)

[3:43:11] lazypandaman: watch out, wels has the book of shadows
[3:43:12] axolotine: I do wish that succeeding with ascension got you a vault crystal with the ascension already on it instead of needing to craft another
[3:43:16] kibaz_x: As long as its shiny I want it

[3:43:45] Zaraca90: Balls?
[3:43:46] TheImmortaldonut: Title idea:  The Pun-isher
[3:43:47] c5r1a5z0y: saved it
[3:43:48] mimilayaa: KEKW
[3:43:51] gaymersalsa: YEP

[3:44:02] Thomlennix: Joe is doing his thing, mad respect
[3:44:05] drewbacca1981: Joe was mid 80s at the beginning of the night I think
[3:44:06] MunchNL: titles should be the names you give your family members ;)
[3:44:06] illycat_: "Oh my god you killed Kenny" needs to be a title
[3:44:10] LowKeyChemist: chutzpah
[3:44:11] notTheRealHelmis: some hermits should watch a hbomb or barry vault to get an idea of the sheer pace you need
[3:44:12] Yesat: And Joe is playing "badly" on purpose.
[3:44:17] advcky: a man can enjoy another mans balls
[3:44:17] lazypandaman: the best title is "washed up"

[3:44:42] Matkimble: Your donation to Joe was exactly what he needed. he was struggling before
[3:44:44] EldritchDigger: I really like Joe's build. It kind of inspired me to look into different builds.
[3:44:47] mimilayaa: @cozmo42 stop KEKW
[3:44:48] LachlanMG: if you fail the first objective on a flame the title should be washed up
[3:44:54] Zinoba: thats the problem i identified as well
[3:45:00] ggamito: @iskall85 just one question about elixir, every run there is only one action that gives lots of elixir, right? and the other actions gives less but never none?
[3:45:04] thebeaz2: Joe has made the rule for himself that he will run vaults and get XP to get half way through level and then he burgers the rest
[3:45:07] da1dman: @LachlanMG is that too complimentary though?
[3:45:07] ViciTheTenorOon: Joe had crazy ballistic abilities

[3:45:21] Vardinycx: I missed this earlier, but which hermit did Iskall say likely wouldn't be getting to lvl 100?
[3:45:21] AceK1n9: if living chests are so needed for burger parts, would it be better to get 100 lvls
[3:45:22] bruhhmaaoo: "snapping turtle" title idea
[3:45:23] Endermands: @iskall85 is there anything in this game that youve designed that you enjoy but didnt expect to enjoy?

[3:47:11] spurlucke: Dylan's have to exist in game too
[3:47:11] gaymersalsa: @prismaticpixiedust no date
[3:47:14] CallumPO6: Why did you decide that ascension should have 0 in-vault benefits? Not saying it's a bad decision, just curious on the thought process
[3:47:18] PrismaticPixieDust: ok ty
[3:47:18] OneTrueSpry: For the new video that you post you should say I broke the game just a little bit.
[3:47:39] notTheRealHelmis: @prismaticpixiedust the date is up‚Ä¶. because it‚Äôs *ahem*
[3:47:40] gaymersalsa: nerf
[3:47:41] pendelluft: Checked the armory - Etho has run 386 Vaults. That‚Äôs 142 more runs than he ran the Dungeon in Decked Out 1 (111) & 2 (133) lol
[3:47:43] younghexagon: what does the ascension make more difficult? The objective or the mobs? Both?
[3:47:43] OneTrueSpry: It's completely understandable to bring mana down it was op
[3:47:44] c5r1a5z0y: Fixes can still be a nerf
[3:47:48] gaymersalsa: nerfskall hryLeddit
[3:47:51] cozmo42: what about a tribute transmog for technoblade?
[3:47:57] captainzylo42: was there any consideration for removing mana as a potion modifier and making potions either healing or mana?
[3:48:01] PixleChris: Good day friends!
[3:48:03] axolotine: yeah I would never have used any other potion effect than mana
[3:48:04] EllieIsShmexy: Gilded secret to ur left
[3:48:05] Pineapple0nPizza: yeah the mana was way too strong - i loved it, but it was OP
[3:48:09] someBoots: are good vendor items less common now?
[3:48:12] spurlucke: Technoblade o7
[3:48:12] redstonedad: Nerfs from now on will be called feature fixes

[3:48:45] CallumPO6: wont lie, i did think that it was a bug that Mana regen potions were so high
[3:48:58] pendelluft: @nottherealhelmis don‚Äôt forget his relics lol
[3:49:07] fiddlyfudbucket: I miss when iskall was running gambas and would get invested in them üòû
[3:49:09] OneTrueSpry: Tbh you shouldn't be able to infinitely run abilities like quill without having the proper relics.
[3:49:09] angelassassin2586: does the probability of fundies change at this level?
[3:49:14] Jackkabuki: How about a Crowned pig helmet
[3:49:15] cozmo42: Potato war is classic content
[3:49:17] vimick: Any thoughts  on unique items with unique effects or guaranteed stats?
[3:49:21] alxo: is there any chance of getting a moveable vault timer as a UI setting in the future?
[3:49:27] phoenixdrakenfire: TFC transmog perhaps?
[3:49:27] notTheRealHelmis: @pendelluft truuee
[3:49:29] freddyb8: What if you failed a flame vault without a doll on your head.

[3:59:24] Xaeilla: Thoughts on achievement rewards that aren't transmogs... What about changing the starting vault room. Like, adding a couch, or the statues become gold plated, or add chandeliers. Aesthetic, bragging rights within the vault.

[4:19:30] rayceland: would you ever add an option to the gem cutting station to choose to remove an attribute after its reached level 10 without lowering the size any further? Wanted to put a perfect gem on my sickle for the trap disarm & item quant, but it had shoveling and I didn‚Äôt want to accidentally rip up dirt so I just scrapped it

[4:20:48] boredbadger: @jackkabuki +2
[4:20:49] kibaz_x: @da1dman i think they're doing this to get burger parts rather than exp now
[4:20:50] gkizzle88: gg
[4:20:54] tangerinedoro: @da1dman no no, maybe it just means there's no more dolls to run from then until they log on again

[4:23:30] 60wattlightbulb: I've never given it a second thought
[4:23:32] tangerinedoro: @laxxbe a player crafts a doll so that other players in the smp can run a vault with them. dolls have a random % of exp and loot they'll get for free based on how much exp and loot the other person got from the vault
[4:23:33] kibaz_x: wasn't it called stockholm syndrome?
[4:23:34] mimilayaa: Well i know what POI is but what does it stand for

[4:38:44] MysticBlacksmith: could the treasure hunter modifier be added to the random modifier roll list. so it could get rolled on unmodified vaults

[5:17:00] hamil_town: Thing about vault hunters is you can play on the server and never do a vault. Maybe the hermits should just play on the server.

[5:20:37] Saranas: Yes so much this, there are way to much ad's nowadays on Twitch. I have been getting up to 6 long ones in a row several times and someties its almost the same ad in clutches in their longer forms. And twitch is failing in quality getting more and more a bad viewer experience overall.
[5:20:39] Fittypeace: Love your work and videos Iskall, NEVER STOP DOING YOU
[5:20:43] beefy_booty: One thing a streamer I watch mentioned would be helpful, is if the streamer could control when ads happen. Like oh, we're grinding boring materials, have an ad break. Oh, we're vaulting, pause ad break
[5:20:45] MittensLeFay: MittensLeFay subscribed with Prime. 
[5:20:46] erinlynn82: @revt0 no pc. if u can I haven‚Äôt found a way to do it

[5:20:55] capfox13: @Knew_It_Owl I know right!
[5:20:56] ViciTheTenorOon: XB will be a champignon after this

[5:21:08] silvain_shadows: there's a lot of streamers i like that i just don't watch anymore due to how bad the ads are, bc i can only afford a few subscriptions and i had to prioritize
[5:21:08] gaymersalsa: @beefy_booty that‚Äôs an option, you can do auto ads and also snooze ads from happening
[5:21:13] maetti1286: A mush needed (sh)room

[5:23:05] Lyteat: are you gonna make a goblin's vial?
[5:23:06] Knew_It_Owl: Is it possible to be able to modify your pickup notifier? Cuz people have different priorities with what they want on it.. @iskall85
[5:23:09] zeus_o9o2: HOW TO WRITE IN MORE CAPS ? LUL LUL LUL
[5:23:12] JustARegularRhino: is it possible to add a champions abode catalyst?

[5:24:17] MomofAppleJ: What does Iskall mean when he says cascading?
[5:24:17] timmiegamer_: If I saw  hit right, mobs do a good bit
[5:24:18] therealtolazytothink: I'm still chasing that pick-a-rang.  At his point I should just craft it.
[5:24:22] Knew_It_Owl: @gaymersalsa Then I would assume this is easily added in the game itself via the accessibility setting, am I right?
[5:24:23] hermitcraftfanaccount: What if something like the soul flame was a chase item? just thinking outloud
[5:24:27] EldritchDigger: I don't mind chase items. I just know with my limited time, I'm not going to get them, or it will take me longer to get them.

[5:26:14] Lyteat: iskall are you gonna make a goblin vial?
[5:26:21] gaymersalsa: @callumpo6 don‚Äôt think so, it was decided against a while ago
[5:26:22] NakeZast: Iskall totally not in a race against Etho to reach lv 100 first.

[5:26:54] Monatae: idk, 9 is pricey but not awful
[5:26:54] ViciTheTenorOon: Nah beat him and then tell *** was a race
[5:26:56] Niko_993: i would not buy mod boxes for that price given how often i get them anyways
[5:26:56] gaymersalsa: iskallMAN VS ethoMAN
[5:26:58] TAxels: idk sounds great early when mods progression is more important
[5:27:00] Mercutio42: are we balancing cost from barter cost then raising it... or from normal cost then barter lowers it?
[5:27:04] ash_tronaut616: !time
[5:27:08] RMZing: Mod Boxes probably should not be in vendor loot. Or have like 3-5 in one pedestal for 15-25 gold
[5:27:13] rayceland: i mean you can buy mod box from black market for like what 400-700 shards? i‚Äôd rather do that than pay gold
[5:27:15] gaymersalsa: @monatae hryAdmire
[5:27:15] omarjet05: I think you should add a trinket that gives you discounts in the shopping rooms

[5:27:19] baka_raion_hato_31: neat and great

[5:27:22] Jarethkor: excuSkall #notagamer

[5:29:33] 999nightmare999: Ooh prosperous
[5:29:51] s42ndy: @ikayuri the big packs, yeah. not tanks or champions
[5:29:52] gaymersalsa: @ikayuri the mobs that spawn in a large amount!
[5:29:55] CallumPO6: is feb 1st when you fight the herald? Or is that going to be scheduled or the future?
[5:30:01] ViciTheTenorOon: Ooooh Vendoor

[5:30:27] Niko_993: i think clumsy is quite a lot punishing
[5:30:28] Night2315: the vault looks so much sadder now that cascading is fixed
[5:30:30] gaymersalsa: np!
[5:30:33] pendelluft: @nakezast things have happened in 2023 i coukd never have predicted or woukd have thought were 100% unlikely. but etho proved me wrong by playing in mcc and bringing back team canada for two different maps. so i never say never anymore
[5:30:34] s42ndy: np
[5:30:36] Artorias921: Hello @iskall85  Iam here to say thank you again for your game. Right now Iam on lvl 70 and I have enjoyed your game as much as I enjoyed Armored core 6 wich have recently finished <3 <3 <3
[5:30:40] Cosmic_Star123: any guides out there for making vault tools?
[5:30:42] NakeZast: oh btw I went afk when Iskall was supposedly gonna restart the server to tweak the trap disarm and potion stuff.  Did that work out for the tram disarm guys?
[5:30:52] Ferran_v: One thing that i'd love for curseforge to add is a function to make it so when you press play in the curseforge launcher that it actually also boots up your game and not only the minecraft launcher, the amount of times i've been waiting for my game to launch while forgetting to press start in the minecraft launcher....
[5:30:55] gaymersalsa: @artorias921 hryAdmire glad you‚Äôre enjoying it!
[5:31:01] NakeZast: @pendelluft IKR!
[5:31:07] No_xor: i think both trapped and clumsy should be in
[5:31:14] gaymersalsa: @ferran_v switch to prism lololol
[5:31:16] Knew_It_Owl: Iskall explaining math because he's good at mathing

[5:31:51] Mr_shadowdragon: i‚Äôm gonna be honest i think people that only can watch iskall85 on youtube and don‚Äôt have the time to watch the full streams they missing alot of tiur gameplay sadly‚Ä¶
[5:31:57] c5r1a5z0y: Mathskall
[5:31:58] pendelluft: Unlikely but is anyone here an editor of the dungeon archive?
[5:32:09] gaymersalsa: @mr_shadowdragon that‚Äôs why vodskall85 exists :)
[5:32:09] 999nightmare999: 7.5%
[5:32:18] NakeZast: ahhhh cool
[5:32:26] RMZing: Let me explain it better: Every level of Clumsy is +2.5% trap chance. Every percentage of trap disarm is -.05% trap chance. Trap disarm above 100% makes trap chance go negative, which does nothing but protect against the Clumsy modifier
[5:32:26] neednaame: not too bad
[5:32:27] gaymersalsa: iskTalk number glorp
[5:32:27] Niko_993: ohh, i thought it was like that but my server mate gaslit me
[5:32:30] Monatae: i am already lost
[5:32:31] VogelVrouw: Ohh
[5:32:38] thebeaz2: makes sense
[5:32:41] 999nightmare999: 8.125 probably?
[5:32:41] c5r1a5z0y: Diminishing? Increasing, right?
[5:32:42] Niko_993: sorry and thanks for the clarification
[5:32:43] Mr_shadowdragon: yes but some people don‚Äôt have the time to watch 4h of streams on youtube. thats what i mean
[5:32:44] axolotine: hmm. increase it to 100% per stack
[5:32:44] pendelluft: @mr_shadowdragon that‚Äôs what vodskall85 is for iskHeart
[5:32:45] Khalin1212: 7.5 + 3.75 = 11.25
[5:32:46] Bobbingtonn: 11.25 i think
[5:32:47] ms2008_: hi iskall how are you today?
[5:32:49] EldritchDigger: I was told there would be no maths.
[5:32:50] gaymersalsa: trying to understand when the stream keeps cutting off LUL
[5:32:54] 999nightmare999: Ooof
[5:32:55] pst0808: It's exponential, not dimishing, lol
[5:32:56] bom222243: its not diminishing.
[5:32:57] ViciTheTenorOon: 11.75%
[5:32:59] lightspeed820: I guess that's why we need to learn math
[5:33:04] Mr13igh: You lost me at "are you listening chat" LUL
[5:33:07] xkraiix: Yeah i cant understand shtt
[5:33:10] Fourier52: what if my trap disarm is 55%?
[5:33:13] gaymersalsa: @mr_shadowdragon that‚Äôs why there are shorter videos from streams uploaded hahah
[5:33:15] Khalin1212: imagine trying to play video games to avoid your math homework...

[5:33:43] gaymersalsa: bye mona hryWave
[5:33:43] thebeaz2: so going over 100% trap disarm is a good idea for omega vaults
[5:33:47] Andyghandi97: Yeah it's a good change
[5:33:52] RedCoded5: it's not diminishing but exponential (*1.5)
[5:34:05] 999nightmare999: Ideally 200% disarm would be grewt then I think
[5:34:09] dracozzlol: I had an explosive modifier on a wooden vault yesterday, it was the most chaotic thing ever
[5:34:18] mrtrouble437: can you get trapped and clumsy at the same time
[5:34:18] NakeZast: sounds cool
[5:34:21] gaymersalsa: dininushing and exponsntal are the new fortiriotus
[5:34:29] RMZing: @Fourier52 You have a base trap chance of 2.4%. One Clumsy raises it to 4.9%, two to 7.4%, and so on
[5:34:30] ViciTheTenorOon: You are the cause of your own demise in vault hunters
[5:34:31] Kvand: Lodestone, noted.
[5:34:39] k1_setae: how about if i have 6 trap on my maxed paradox, do i need to make 400% trap tool to mitigate that?
[5:34:47] AyushJind: KEKW
[5:34:48] 999nightmare999: What about copiously overstacking how would that work?
[5:34:49] TAxels: back

[5:35:01] bom222243: you left them
[5:35:02] RMZing: @k1_setae Yeah, 400% to make your trap chance 0%
[5:35:03] crazyshezy: will this not bother early game players.. those below level 50
[5:35:04] Ferran_v: Kiwi heart attack
[5:35:04] Kvand: Voided all the kiwis
[5:35:07] the_whtvr: you just looted some
[5:35:09] P3pp3rF1y: just pickedup 3 kiwis now
[5:35:10] tre_2018: hmm weird
[5:35:11] BAChemicalX: You said no kiwis this vault
[5:35:12] mrtrouble437: k1stete no 100% it‚Äôs fine for trapped but you need more for clumsy
[5:35:12] VogelVrouw: Weird
[5:35:13] gaymersalsa: iskKiwi
[5:35:13] Ktolos: It will probably force some of us endgame player to have to make a replacement Prismatic Chestbreaker post update

[5:35:14] VIrosueS: voided?

[5:35:17] braydenpiag: on your hot bar

[5:35:32] BlazeSpaceRl: back slot bag
[5:35:34] melonhunt: LMAO
[5:35:35] TobyButt89: Ye the maths is better, but it reads way worse. 10% chance for trapped chests, with 3x trapped modifier is 40% trap chance. Which sounds way worse that reducing your trap disarm by 50%
[5:35:35] k1_setae: voided, or someone added junk?
[5:35:39] gamerman_i_g: gread is good
[5:35:51] Z0eff: Yes please

[5:36:56] Vlazmanian_Devil: For context, with how iSkall described this, it takes 9 clumsy to give all traps with 50% increase per level. With 25% increase per level it takes 15 clumsy.

[5:41:56] RMZing: Please just get rid of the concept of Trap Disarm and flatten it into a Trap Chance

[5:42:01] HazzaBazza9: graphs required maths to hard un to understand from words
[5:42:01] TAxels: it could have been at the bottom of the pink backpack (scroll bar)

[5:42:05] braydenpiag: lol
[5:42:09] TobyButt89: Wait, so does it get rid of 50% of your total trap disarm, or does it get rid of 50%? So if you have 200% does 1 clumsy take you down to 150% or 100%??
[5:42:09] saxymatt: it's a feature, not a bug

[5:44:08] theghostofkarl: Hello Mr. Streamer, hello chat. I hope you all are doing well.
[5:44:08] Lakosius2: 8 clumsy means you have 10% traps on 200% Trap disarm then ?
[5:44:08] RedCoded5: is it add or multiply current trap chance by 1.5 i.e. add 50%
[5:44:08] Z0eff: excellent explanation
[5:44:09] Ferdster02: It used to be 10%-dotted, meaning a straight addition of 10%, now it's 50% what you have
[5:44:10] RMZing: Base trap chance is 5%. Every level of Clumsy is +2.5%. Every percentage of Trap Disarm is -0.05%.
[5:44:11] bailey_watches_twitch: @iskall85 does getting to 0 start the trap progress, so should I always have 101% trap disarm to get me the third clumsy proc?
[5:44:11] gaymersalsa: @marknu yo
[5:44:12] satanxm: what if i have 150% trap disarm on my tool? does that prep me for additional in that vault
