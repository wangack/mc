[1:58:05] JULZLO: LETSFUCKINGGO
[1:58:22] lastspartan607: doesn't work right with slow fall
[1:58:26] Lucas_DnTs: it's a glider
[1:58:37] lastspartan607: careful
[1:58:43] Smeeeze: mercy wings
[1:58:43] lastspartan607: look level to slow down
[1:58:46] shay_tuna: you need to be careful with your speed
[1:58:53] Jumpin_Beans101: its a set of wings you glide with but they take durability you can view through your inventory
[1:58:55] JULZLO: land like ur landing a plane, just dont land straight down.
[1:58:58] JULZLO: keke
[1:59:01] shay_tuna: if you collide with anything while going fast you can take damage and die
[1:59:01] JULZLO: KEKW *
[1:59:03] Lucas_DnTs: leap of faith
[1:59:42] JULZLO: get him fireworks

[2:00:08] CoHHoe_Obla4ko: Like Mercy
[2:00:27] Smeeeze: It doesnt boost you its just like pressing space bar on mercy
[2:00:27] Jumpin_Beans101: like how quickly would you fall to the ground from standing?
[2:00:35] Jumpin_Beans101: its gliding
[2:00:37] Lucas_DnTs: not exactly
[2:00:37] JULZLO: fireworks give you height
[2:00:41] Lucas_DnTs: you glide really fast
[2:00:51] PatPatPatriq: it lets you glide, if you gain enough of speed you can fly up
[2:01:09] lastspartan607: not over void
[2:01:10] Jumpin_Beans101: angle also affects speed
[2:01:39] shay_tuna: on it's own, an elytra only lets you glide. to truly fly, you need firework rockets to accelerate you.
[2:02:14] ArmyofThalia: Okie I left VC to work on my home. Thanks for setting this up @KarQ It was fun =)
[2:02:21] CoHHoe_Obla4ko: but if you fly fast and crash into some block or land incorrectly - you will die)

[2:16:08] CloudedDarkness: It's a chest in a chest, but what makes it special is that you can store stuff in it, and break it, and put it back down and it retains everything
[2:16:11] CloudedDarkness: so it's basically more space
[2:16:22] Queido: i feel like a boomer, minecraft looks so different from when i played

[3:36:52] coliibriii: terraria
[3:36:52] XboxIsBoom: Nathan are you going to exnchant your leggings
[3:37:14] XboxIsBoom: it’s only 8 levels
[3:38:08] coliibriii: yeah
[3:38:08] ItsFatRabbit: the only multiplayer worlds I have ever made was when I was still in school with a bunch of my mates. 8 years later and we still play but different world again as of 1.2
[3:39:19] XenoGamezTV: @KarQ has been confirmed as the next Smash character after playing 8+ hours of Minecraft o w o
[3:39:28] XenoGamezTV: He will replace Steve
[3:39:31] sassa321: every one with no friends that likes minecraft xD
[3:39:43] ArmyofThalia: Car Shoveled. Shower Taken. Dinner Acquired. Hotel Trivago
[3:39:50] ItsFatRabbit: I have my own solo world and then I have a world with me and my partner and then the friends groups world but that changes world with big updates
[3:39:56] XboxIsBoom: why don’t you do a solo world show us how good you actually are
[3:40:07] sassa321: can anyone join this world ?
[3:40:14] XenoGamezTV: Hey! You can be created with Minecraft! Someone made Macho Man Randy Savage with Minecraft blocks
[3:40:16] XboxIsBoom: only subs
[3:40:23] CloudedDarkness: this is pretty large for me. In terms of a general build, survival server, this is massive
[3:40:25] XenoGamezTV: And that's the cream of the crop
[3:40:28] shay_tuna: this is my favorite track, sad it only plays in creative
[3:40:39] CloudedDarkness: but you can get "big" servers with stuff like hunger games styled modes, etc
[3:40:56] BigLordRiptide: @KarQ What shaders mod are you using?
[3:41:00] XboxIsBoom: that village seems like it’ll be fun to raid
[3:41:07] PatPatPatriq: !shaders
[3:41:07] Nightbot: Complementary Shaders (Reimagined) - https://www.complementary.dev/shaders/
[3:41:09] CloudedDarkness: there's prop hunt modes, "pictionary" via blocks modes, skill challenge modes
[3:41:11] Nightbot: 1 TIP for EVERY HERO Series Playlist: https://bit.ly/37SBDwu
[3:41:13] coliibriii: i found that one last lol i kidnapped them from like 1k blocks away
[3:41:22] CloudedDarkness: I think the adventure maps are probably super insane now compared to the olden days
[3:41:34] shiroe0010: lol Coli
[3:41:43] ItsFatRabbit: you really understand the scale of the game after you get the elytra
[3:41:56] CloudedDarkness: for the laughs, you could do a "dropper" map on stream
[3:42:05] CloudedDarkness: unless someone on the server makes a dropper area
[3:42:14] unovianume: why not trigger a raid in a village to get totems?
[3:42:19] sassa321: no
[3:42:19] GoldenHyungHobi: not really
[3:42:29] BigLordRiptide: not really
[3:42:31] unovianume: LUL
[3:42:32] XboxIsBoom: we have a raid farm
[3:42:33] kycool12: @unovianume we have a raid farm
[3:42:48] XboxIsBoom: I have a entire double chest full of totems
[3:43:07] CloudedDarkness: dropper is a map type where huge like, "rooms" have been built and they go from max sky hitbox height down to bedrock. The goal is to "drop" down through the designed room and make it to the bottom. Sometimes it's straight forward, sometimes it's tilting
[3:43:10] CloudedDarkness: but it's fun
[3:43:17] CloudedDarkness: takes a lot of skill to "fall" well
[3:43:20] ItsFatRabbit: the fact that Minecraft worlds are more than 7 times the size of earth still baffles me. you will never see an entire minecraft map
[3:43:42] Haceous1: "starter shack" the person who currently lives there -> sadCat
[3:43:48] PatPatPatriq: LUL
[3:43:51] CloudedDarkness: Wow, Fantastic Baby

[3:45:37] PatPatPatriq: nope
[3:46:04] CloudedDarkness: looks like a pirate ship wreckage
[3:46:09] CloudedDarkness: only partially generated
[3:46:24] XboxIsBoom: eat the stew
[3:46:25] PatPatPatriq: im at 1040 2260 according to one of my screenshots
[3:46:29] shay_tuna: treasure
[3:46:30] GoldenHyungHobi: treasure
[3:46:44] CloudedDarkness: Yeah
[3:46:48] kycool12: where is the white dot?
[3:46:51] CloudedDarkness: so you gotta move until your "dot" becomes an "Arrow"
[3:46:55] CloudedDarkness: so you know you're on the actual map
[3:46:58] PatPatPatriq: and my starting shack was at 100 1080
[3:47:01] kycool12: you go south west
[3:47:08] cloudz_ii: @ItsFatRabbit nah, killed ender dragon +40 times... im talking about those maps like ctm or minigames
[3:47:08] sassa321: yeah .. u need to go S
[3:47:12] PatPatPatriq: (aka i yoinked one of the villager houses)
[3:47:13] kycool12: west is left
[3:47:19] CloudedDarkness: at this stage, not really
[3:47:21] XboxIsBoom: no
[3:47:23] GoldenHyungHobi: sometimes
[3:47:25] kycool12: NO
[3:47:25] CloudedDarkness: but it's a lil' adventure you can do
[3:47:27] CloudedDarkness: Lol
[3:47:29] kycool12: you go west
[3:47:34] GoldenHyungHobi: but not at the ending parts of the game
[3:47:42] shay_tuna: heart of the sea for a conduit
[3:47:51] cloudz_ii: maybe for a conduit monument
[3:47:58] garrchair: Oh a temple
[3:47:58] CloudedDarkness: keep the map on hand to see your movement towards/away from the point
[3:48:05] XboxIsBoom: we don’t need more conduits
[3:48:33] coliibriii: ohhh those are temples
[3:49:16] cloudz_ii: whats the bulldozer advancement?
[3:49:29] XboxIsBoom: mining
[3:49:48] cloudz_ii: dedication...
[3:49:54] ItsFatRabbit: @cloudz_ii well ctm is good. even though it’s old the sky block has always been a good challenge. there is a nice sky block map that was made where you are able to get all the different wood types as well so that’s pretty neat
[3:50:04] CloudedDarkness: Oh, a natural one?
[3:50:10] CloudedDarkness: there's treasure underneath the main building
[3:50:12] unovianume: have u found an ancient city yet?
[3:50:16] Etreyu: 'oh cool sandcastles'
[3:50:18] CloudedDarkness: oh wait
[3:50:19] Etreyu: KEKW
[3:50:20] CloudedDarkness: it's a village
[3:50:23] CloudedDarkness: not a sandcastle
[3:50:24] unovianume: also hi just got off work :)
[3:50:28] CloudedDarkness: if it's a sand castle, there's stuff
[3:50:35] CloudedDarkness: but a village is just a village
[3:50:40] XboxIsBoom: we have found everything and done everything
[3:50:41] kycool12: its not a desert temple KEKW
[3:50:42] PatPatPatriq: have you met a witch? fitzy's biggest enemy? KEKW
[3:50:50] cloudz_ii: @ItsFatRabbit i was looking for a slow-progress map, skyblock sounds perfect
[3:51:00] shiroe0010: lol mining fatigue fight a witch :3
[3:51:12] XboxIsBoom: Nathan needs to fight the wither tho
[3:51:26] shiroe0010: ^

[3:51:49] CloudedDarkness: find some iron in the village
[3:51:51] XboxIsBoom: I found one
[3:51:52] CloudedDarkness: make a bucket and milk a cow
[3:52:00] ItsFatRabbit: @cloudz_ii I have always gone back to sky block. it puts to test your knowledge of the game
[3:52:11] onlyhamsow: keep exploring it, maybe there’s something else
[3:52:15] XboxIsBoom: I think we have pretty much every biome

[3:59:28] XboxIsBoom: @cloudeddarkness the tbink we’ve been waiting for like weeks
[3:59:31] hellupline: lukewarn sea with shaders is so gorjeous.
[3:59:33] unovianume: @jackan20121 the things about advertisements is... they sont care if you buy or not, they're in your head already. thats all that matters, that you KNOW the products they advertise exist in your mind... they pay to take up space in your head. if that makes sense. MrDestructoid
[3:59:38] XboxIsBoom: I don’t think there is any chest
[3:59:48] CloudedDarkness: @XboxIsBoom For real. So glad we're finally here. Lmao
[4:00:13] jackan20121: @unovianume but I’m still going to buy skullcandy…
[4:00:15] PatPatPatriq: did they finally add ray tracing to java or is it still bedrock exclusive?
[4:00:17] XboxIsBoom: @cloudeddarkness I only got 2 rn gotta get more
[4:00:24] CloudedDarkness: Can I trade you for some of the sea pickles? They make great decorative items.
[4:00:28] ItsFatRabbit: my adhd brain and this game are a bad combination. I’ll be like I need to build this. 8 hours later I placed one block where I planned and did everything that I didn’t plan but looked cool
[4:00:36] CloudedDarkness: Dunno what you'd need though
[4:00:44] XboxIsBoom: I wanna fill my ender chest with shulker boxes
[4:00:47] twiggybadger: I tuned back in and all I here is "all my pickles"
[4:00:53] unovianume: @jackan20121 thats valid

[4:02:27] ItsFatRabbit: try not yo eat a mountain while flying around
[4:02:39] CloudedDarkness: @XboxIsBoom It's 46k ish
[4:02:42] kycool12: its on fire because you are loading like 2 million blocks
[4:03:00] CloudedDarkness: if you can stack 64 blocks per slot, and each shulker has 27 slots, plus you can put 27 shulkers into an ender which has 27 slots, it's 64k
[4:03:10] CloudedDarkness: 46k*
[4:03:15] PatPatPatriq: its worse, he's forcing the server to generate the chunks KEK
[4:03:27] PatPatPatriq: since i assume no one was here earlier
[4:03:39] CloudedDarkness: Alright, I need to head off cause class shortly
[4:03:43] XboxIsBoom: @cloudeddarkness then you can fill your own inventory with em
[4:03:44] Artxinez: is it a vanilla server??
