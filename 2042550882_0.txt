[0:31:56] Amandroid: linkzzeyChaoss
[0:31:59] KilledCody: with a game like MC it is pointless to run 300fps
[0:32:02] bunnygirlnextdoor: in before bill says twitch doesn't even run at 60fps or whatever bunnyElf
[0:32:07] Epicgamer_7236: it will make it less laggy if you have no FPS cap
[0:32:13] ItChili: @Daphness thats why he is lagging in mangrove its canada not USA lol
[0:32:13] Epicgamer_7236: with shaders
[0:32:14] MTY_ZWGreen: how are you only running the same fps as before do you have it capped?

[0:33:09] MTY_ZWGreen: what fps do you run uncapped?
[0:33:15] atscovilllezzey: Fps headaches are bad.. Cant focus.. Brain goes brrrr
[0:33:17] 24leandro06: @bunnygirlnextdoor i am thanks, but whats annoying is that i still need to go for some regular checkups
[0:33:20] Amandroid: @MTY_ZWGreen like he was saying, he did that earlier - you can check the vod if you wanna see it!
[0:33:33] xopa: maybe try popping a totem, those animations are pretty intense
[0:33:34] Epicgamer_7236: turning off the FPS cap can make you get more FPS with shaders
[0:33:36] ShoopinPoopin: crunch

[0:34:26] Lekerstein: @Í≥†ÏñëÏù¥Í∑ÄÏÜåÌîº That's what he implied... it's easier on the eyes to have a fixed framerate, rather one that fluctuates up and down

[0:35:52] jackasses: stream looks dope! worth the wait
[0:35:57] Í≥†ÏñëÏù¥Í∑ÄÏÜåÌîº: FPS and monitor hz are both in this conversation, they cannot be unlinked @lekerstein
[0:36:07] MTY_ZWGreen: did you get a ring light? you look a bit brighter.
[0:36:29] StreamElements: @Monozzey48 was an idiot and needs to vanish quickly into the depths before they get made fun of KEKCAM

[0:52:56] Amandroid: @ninjahballz linkzzeyHii welcome!
[0:53:03] yodanotiam: flux is a program that runs in the background that slightly takes away the blue light from your monitor. barely notice it until you turn it off and are blinded
[0:53:07] tacsyt: im doing great, curently studying for my last diploma on friday\
[0:53:17] ninjahballz: Wow this is a crazy world
[0:53:22] Aniiyta: @tacsyt good luck!
[0:53:25] Coorisnar: @Poppinralph software adjusments can help with color and contrast, but it will still all run off the base the monitor itself can provide.  the purer the base is, the better the software adjustments are
[0:53:30] CraftyCat200: Holding the axe please linkzzeyBlush
