[1:30:46] wait_what_why: push a redstone block every pulse
[1:30:47] Salix__: @Giantwaffle voice problems? You sound different
[1:30:53] enol3est: What does Comfort Status Effect give you?
[1:30:53] John222212: so fresh
[1:30:55] Allmostdone: Unionize the bees
[1:30:56] orangecreamsicle3: PepegaChat waffle have done this
[1:30:57] Razorain56: how did he get upgraded hives?
[1:31:01] Slymph: Its a mentality thing YEP
[1:31:02] kerpenverpen_: KEKW 󠀀 󠀀 󠀀 󠀀 󠀀 󠀀
[1:31:02] Buuddzz: does it need sheers?
[1:31:05] KNOXVlLLE: add another redstone, try it
[1:31:06] Vovosunt: KEKW
[1:31:07] Larklen: it always works first time after placement, so something blocks it afterwards monkaHmm
[1:31:09] hisdue: wtf
[1:31:09] orangecreamsicle3: rooBlank I have no idea
[1:31:10] Zunderz: Extend the redstond by 1
[1:31:14] Allroundnoise: Maybe put redstone als at the end one more
[1:31:23] BroCreed1: Is there something like a mechanical user in this mod pack?
[1:31:25] Face_32: inst quasi connectivity fun? @Aldiron
[1:31:32] mage178: chunk border?
[1:31:43] Vovosunt: you can use create deployers to do this too
[1:31:52] enol3est: What does the Comfort Status give you?
[1:32:03] TnkUK: do all the slots need to be filled with scrapers?
[1:32:17] Belgarath81: are gliders a thing?
[1:32:18] Razorain56: How did you get a tiered hive @Giantwaffle
[1:32:20] DX_Plates: No the other ones only have 1 and they work.
[1:32:23] Salix__: @Giantwaffle you sound diffe
[1:32:26] Face_32: @TnkUK yeah it might be like sheers
[1:32:34] Salix__: @Giantwaffle voice problems?
[1:32:50] NurseTrevor: Was the dispenser faced the correct way?
[1:32:55] rickster845: are the dispensers broken? remember from the botania petals?
[1:32:55] SquarePlate: @Salix__ he's not
[1:32:58] 감자타인: can you see if its on a chunk border?
[1:32:58] Larklen: so block doersnt like redstone after it triggers once? pepeLaugh
[1:33:01] Shoobinist: can try powering them from the back
[1:33:03] TheChefChops: swap hives around to see if problem follows?
[1:33:04] lcePops: what are all the blocks around it?
[1:33:05] Purecrew: swap dispencers?
[1:33:10] MCas86: if you put the timer on the other side, does the left one not work?
[1:33:10] FenrisulfrX: Pu the timer in the other side to test? @Giantwaffle
[1:33:12] stormzwest: autonomous user?
[1:33:14] Face_32: build the inmod apiary @Giantwaffle
[1:33:15] wait_what_why: put dispencer on top
[1:33:22] chaoskub: Does the hive take a signal? is it causing a logic lock?
[1:33:22] Allmostdone: Broken bees
[1:33:28] JoxerTheM1ghty: Is that one dispenser in a different chunk?
[1:33:32] Buuddzz: what bee is it?
[1:33:46] dennis0712: try the timer on the other side to see if it is the hive or the redstone signal?
[1:33:47] Allroundnoise: Maybe it thinks it’s one block it’s connected to, the brown bee block
[1:34:06] MrHashbrowns: has to bee
[1:34:10] FenrisulfrX: Pu the timer in the other side to test? @Giantwaffle
[1:34:12] unreall: are you watching any anime this season waffle?
[1:34:16] MrHashbrowns: pun intended
[1:34:18] BadLa: it could bee
[1:34:20] VaultPls: bees are indeed bugs
[1:34:22] Kaley4D: what block took so long to get?
[1:34:23] Face_32: i think the resourceful bees modpack has a multi block structure called a bee apiary that is made to help with all this @Giantwaffle
[1:34:26] babyaddalyn: put the restone begind the dispenser so the bee block does not get a redstone signal
[1:34:26] chaoskub: I think it has something to do with the hive. I think it may be causing a redstone logic lock
[1:34:26] DarthDerpy: it worked twice in a row when there was no red stone on top
[1:34:27] Tabakhase: put clock on the other end of that row
[1:34:27] Ezrion1: maybee
[1:34:28] Xeus_The_Demigod: try runnning the redston in the back of thee dispenser
[1:34:28] Tabakhase: LUL
[1:34:31] Larklen: try picking up the tier 1 block and seeing if the tier 2 starts again
[1:34:36] lcePops: has to be the tier 2
[1:34:42] babyaddalyn: put the restone begind the dispenser so the bee block does not get a redstone signal.
[1:34:44] Kouga00: lol bees, I always remember Sev saying Fuck Bees
[1:34:45] Egrassa22: try disconnection previous dispenser
[1:34:48] Allroundnoise: Just get a second timer :p
[1:34:48] Tabakhase: whack a button on it or so to check yea
[1:34:53] Dizz1227: @Face_32 With this being an expert mode pack he most likely cannot make it yet
[1:34:54] chaoskub: @Milexna this ^^
[1:34:56] thepolaroidbear: Check chunks?
[1:35:05] Waterpsy: is there an item user? couldwork better than a dispenser?
[1:35:10] MrHashbrowns: what mod is the apiary from?
[1:35:12] Django0: !modpack
[1:35:12] Moobot: Waffle is playing Enigmatica 6 Expert mode! You can get it at curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/enigmatica6expert
[1:35:14] Face_32: @Face_32 i thought the quests give you most of what you need for your first one no?
[1:35:14] lBardownski: grab another block to test with dispenser maybe
[1:35:15] Purecrew: Blaze honeycomb is important so gotta fix it lol
[1:35:41] Lightplay: waffleDab butts
[1:35:44] KetaKapsalon: what are you making?
[1:35:49] KetaKapsalon: that takes 5 hours
[1:36:00] BroCreed1: I mean if all else fails, your bees could just be in sets of 3 instead of 4
[1:36:07] Drudo: work on getting to apiary then it won't be an issue
[1:36:30] ruxraccoon: Are there higher tier bee scoops?
[1:36:39] Face_32: lol
[1:36:40] SquarePlate: lul
[1:36:44] Staramus: too often?
[1:36:47] GFQPR1882: waffleAngry  bUrself
[1:36:52] lazybum4147: bees are always angry
[1:36:55] Kaley4D: dont anger the bees waffle!
[1:36:58] Face_32: @Drudo ^ this
[1:36:59] CommanderUrsus: stockBeeBetter
[1:37:00] chaoskub: no break block
[1:37:00] SquarePlate: fuck bees
[1:37:03] chaoskub: anger bee
[1:37:09] GFQPR1882: leave us bUrself alone LUL
[1:37:09] Moobot: You can sub to Waffle by clicking this neat link -> twitch.tv/giantwaffle/subscribe
[1:37:10] chaoskub: lul
[1:37:12] Egrassa22: can you put this hive alone and try it?
[1:37:15] TheChefChops: swap hives around?
[1:37:34] Waterpsy: If you only need to right click with the item an item user could work? Some sort of machine that simulates a right click. I've seen that in other modpacks at least
[1:37:42] TheWonderLlama: First try! \o/
[1:37:50] babyaddalyn: its probly the new upgraded hive interacts with redstone controll
[1:37:55] Egrassa22: so the redstone WAS the problem:)
[1:38:02] Allmostdone: Bee all you can bee
[1:38:03] nwl1515: on time too short?
[1:38:06] Face_32: quasi connectivity is a pita
[1:38:11] MagicaKing: If it works with the timer at the spot of the button it must be a chunk issue
[1:38:17] GFQPR1882: waffleHmm
[1:38:25] Dizz1227: need one more repeater
[1:38:29] Face_32: redstone powers adjacent blocks all wonky like
[1:38:35] Sloppy_D: ez fix lol
[1:38:44] Dagmoo: waffle 5 minutes ago "its not the redstone" pepeLaugh
[1:38:44] enol3est: Need one more repeater
[1:38:46] NovemberCo: nothing like hitting something to get it to work again
[1:38:47] Apparentthreat: huh? haha
[1:38:53] lcePops: hit them by mistake?
[1:38:53] matey1116: redstone bee? KEKW
[1:38:55] Dizz1227: It became their redstone lol
[1:38:56] Face_32: it sounded like you hit a bee when you broke the redstone
[1:38:57] MagicaKing: maybe you changed the state of the hive or something?
[1:38:59] Apparentthreat: equivalence of ipad kids but bees and redstone
[1:39:00] Mitzzyyy: it was on there property
[1:39:10] Allmostdone: Red stone shock
[1:39:18] Cmdr_Void: is there maybe a bee that eats redstone?
[1:39:19] olabba: nothing like hitting something to get it to work again
[1:39:21] chaoskub: Maybe one of the bees like redstone
[1:39:27] lcePops: renters have more rights than owners
[1:39:39] Face_32: what all is required for the multiblock structure apiary
[1:39:43] Slymph: early access game, cant expect too much of it Kappa
[1:39:44] hisdue: PauseChamp
[1:39:49] Jibbur: this feels like a lot of work... why not just make an apiary?
[1:39:49] GFQPR1882: bUrself bee like u braking my redstone im gonna fuck u up KEKW
[1:39:56] YOUCEP: chunkborder
[1:40:21] bustinsilhouette: the might have hive inside
[1:40:21] CommanderUrsus: Clap
[1:40:31] Mandorake: @Giantwaffle its so fascinating that modpacks are basically just visual programming without a debugger
[1:40:36] GFQPR1882: W H OMEGALUL
[1:40:53] MrHashbrowns: 3 dimensional becuase subchunks
[1:40:56] SquarePlate: thats interesting
[1:41:10] GFQPR1882: waffleHmm
[1:41:13] ayaya_prime: sounds like forager
[1:41:20] PeterZ_97: it sounds like compact claustrophobia modpack
[1:41:21] lcePops: kind of like city skylines buying land?
[1:41:21] eXeBalance: !modpack
[1:41:21] Moobot: Waffle is playing Enigmatica 6 Expert mode! You can get it at curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/enigmatica6expert
[1:41:24] Shadowmail: What if those resources are not in your first chunk'
[1:41:28] Maykr__: with a fog of war kinda effect?
[1:41:29] Allmostdone: What about the game were you were in the boxes?
[1:41:30] Xev_00: Just horizontal or vertical chunks too?
[1:41:41] NyarrX: what is this? your making a modpack?
[1:41:41] YOUCEP: ftb coin/currency system
[1:41:51] CallofDuty_Monster: Hey waffle why not go off of achievements?
[1:41:55] lcePops: chunks now are technically 16x16x16
[1:41:58] thunderdan11: isnt a chunk a square area?
[1:41:59] AlphaSchnauzer: like shapesz?
[1:42:00] EZL1190: What would end goal be?
[1:42:03] Face_32: subchunks are vertical i believe
[1:42:04] Andersxa: why not have something like the EMC value of each block? and every processed material is worth more
[1:42:05] Kouga00: I really liked the idea of Sevtech, i wish more modpacks were made like that where you unlock new tech.
[1:42:09] drsnaki96: rustic waters has something similar to this idea
[1:42:22] Opusdeity: Would have to be set seed or?
[1:42:25] Razgriz_Actual: That is a good concept! It reminds me loosely of Cities Skylines in the sense of expanding your build area
[1:42:25] orc1g: wait like tileman from RuneScape
[1:42:31] EZL1190: Shit that's either 0 chunks or alot
[1:42:41] CommanderUrsus: they had that world gen that looked like Settlers of Catan
[1:43:09] witty_pup: using different items is a good way to force progression the way you want
[1:43:15] Urovah: Would the next chunk require more xp?
[1:43:18] TelRehiad: make it so the first X number of chunks can be via XP and then move to a diff thing
[1:43:20] Face_32: just blaze!
[1:43:22] chaoskub: Might be nice if you allowed max's per item
[1:43:24] Lazermage23: The way to curtail that is to make unlocking a certain growth path to where its not viable to just farm xp
[1:43:36] Andersxa: maybe something like the old MMO server mod with gathering, mining and vampirism and all of those and use the EXP from those?
[1:43:52] Face_32: exponential price increases
[1:44:06] DewDragon: use your formula from the gambathon
[1:44:12] Kaley4D: u prob def cant do all the achievement in a certain area.
[1:44:21] katastrophi_: Are "chunks" like "plots" in Eco?
[1:44:22] chaoskub: You can pay up to 20 levels to expand, up to 100 diamonds, up to 500 netherquartz, etc
[1:44:22] Lazermage23: Unlocking cetain acheivements give you a certain amount of chunks
[1:44:27] iQuantumFlux: Waffle, caught up on yesterdays VOD and loved your commentary on workplace mishap videos. I do aircraft mishap investigations, and it’s always amazing how tough it is that sometimes the stars actually do align.
[1:44:34] MrHashbrowns: 3000?\
[1:44:37] Dizz1227: I think it is within 1000 blocks but I could be wrong
[1:44:40] daemonaedryn: Different world gen...
[1:44:41] Coringa2k: 3000 i think
[1:44:56] Andersxa: base it on McMMO exp so it is more like the OSRS one?
[1:44:58] Face_32: when the "how did we get here" achievement gets updated to include the blindness from the warden, thats gonna be crazy hard to do
[1:45:05] AlphaSchnauzer: they have done a ftb challenge with lots of rooms, forgot the name
[1:45:19] Face_32: closest what? stronghold?
[1:45:36] Shantrix: 1000 blocks are like 62 chunks
[1:45:36] Moobot: Come join the Waffle House Discord! <# https://discord.gg/fhGFtMuzdS
[1:45:38] GFQPR1882: @Giantwaffle what about an island thing where u complete 1 task then can move to the next island ? just a  thought
[1:45:38] Face_32: they normally spawn in a diameter from spawn
[1:45:49] F6MaxDamage: what if you unlock chunks in nether? since it's 8 in overworld
[1:45:51] Face_32: there are spawning rules for strongholds
[1:45:51] tommyfod: can you not change the distance as part of the mod?
[1:46:06] chaoskub: Or give them a way to make an endercake
[1:46:14] Face_32: nether travel would be very good yes
[1:46:25] Face_32: its a speed run strat
[1:46:27] phntmCC: !modpack
[1:46:27] Moobot: Waffle is playing Enigmatica 6 Expert mode! You can get it at curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/enigmatica6expert
[1:46:31] MagicaKing: Or be evil and make each chunk 2 blocks in the nether to offset the 1 to 8
[1:46:32] Face_32: you can predict where the stronghold will be
[1:46:43] axeraider15: use trig
[1:47:04] BroCreed1: It would unlock intermittent chucks in the overworld right? That would be very interesting.
[1:47:15] BBQ1: WutFace
[1:47:20] Xev_00: My eyes
[1:47:36] Face_32: yep
[1:47:46] SquarePlate: huh?
[1:47:50] Kaley4D: the radius needs to be
[1:47:52] Kaley4D: yeah
[1:47:53] Face_32: F3 screen even has degrees i think
[1:47:58] Dagmoo: as a mod designer do you really want to make players feel like they NEED to do the math for nether portal placement?
[1:47:59] Awesomepotato221: pog math
[1:48:03] BadLa: waffle doing trig monkaS
[1:48:08] BroCreed1: The other thing to think of is how the portal to the end cities would work? Would the chuncks they teleport you to be unlcoked by default?
[1:48:11] daemonaedryn: so about 12ish nether chunks?
[1:48:16] EZL1190: Depends on how you lock the chunks
[1:48:17] AsHackDM: thats how mats works
[1:48:49] Kaley4D: it soft locks you??
[1:48:53] rykk3r1: then there should be a safeguard to not brick you
[1:49:00] rykk3r1: mm
[1:49:05] TelRehiad: or force back to spawn
[1:49:08] F6MaxDamage: respawn at spawn or bed like you leavve the end
[1:49:24] dennis0712: you could try to make the obelisk take alternating ingredients to unlock new chunks to prevent early farming
[1:49:25] daemonaedryn: Or if you want to be harsh, it kills you so you cant get your gear back
[1:49:26] ChripsyZombie: could just have it kill the player
[1:49:28] JommyBee: or you drop items and sends you back 󠀀 󠀀
[1:49:30] axeraider15: unsafe chunks teleport to spawn.. only issue is someone enderpearling to pick an item up
[1:49:37] palmagranet: pistons, beds esc
[1:49:38] Awesomepotato221: cant teleport unless you can afford a chunk?
[1:49:43] HazyBanks: !modpack
[1:49:43] Moobot: Waffle is playing Enigmatica 6 Expert mode! You can get it at curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/enigmatica6expert
[1:49:52] chaoskub: Make it drop a grave, so they try to unlock to get it back
[1:49:53] GoranFalth: GoranFalth subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 5 months! 
[1:49:57] EZL1190: Can you spawn in a soft lock, like a place where you can't find what you need to unlock chunks
[1:50:08] Kingia: FeelsMokokoMan monkaS
[1:50:09] BroCreed1: Nah just cure Zombie villagers
[1:50:13] palmagranet: It sounds super fun
[1:50:13] baseballx: golden apple zombie vilalgers would take awhile
[1:50:16] daemonaedryn: Would this be with other mods or vanilla?#
[1:50:25] Coringa2k: i would play for sure
[1:50:50] Staramus: charge $2 per mod install pepeSmoke
[1:50:54] rykk3r1: This would be great with other mods too
[1:51:17] Face_32: imagine spawning into a chunk without trees
[1:51:18] lcePops: Won't guranteed spawn with wood tho
[1:51:20] MagicaKing: Could you configure it to cost different things depending on biome?
[1:51:21] Royal_TRC: start with sapling for apples
[1:51:23] MCas86: theres a chance a chunk wouldnt have water though
[1:51:26] Egrassa22: resources are good like trees for the first chunk, iron for next , etc etc
[1:51:27] Buuddzz: biomes change per chunk?
[1:51:29] dennis0712: @giantwaffle you could try to make the obelisk take alternating ingredients to unlock new chunks to prevent early farming
[1:51:33] Coringa2k: this mod + e6e lol
[1:51:34] Staramus: i spawn with wood everyday
[1:51:40] daemonaedryn: It would need customization since some resources only spawn in certain areas/biomes
[1:51:44] SirKaelan: KEKW
[1:51:45] CodyOrSomething: just spawn with a sapling
[1:51:46] Xev_00: KEKW
[1:51:46] Larklen: KEKW
[1:51:47] chaoskub: Just add EE and use EE value to unlock chunks lol
[1:51:49] EZL1190: Lets say you have 3 chunks and you need diamonds for the next chunks, but you're unlucky and there aain'y enough in your chunks, or used them for gear before you new you needed them
[1:51:50] SquarePlate: KEKW
[1:51:51] Sharust: starting spawn more than a couple chunks
[1:51:52] Dagmoo: KEKW
[1:51:52] JommyBee: could start with sapling 󠀀 󠀀
[1:51:53] vikroww: Bounus chest
[1:51:54] BroCreed1: I think it could be like Iskall85 vault hunter where the requirement takes a random amount of 4 randomly selected items. So every chunck requires something different, and you need progressively more of the items.
[1:51:54] walkerboh1479: Length of time survived?
[1:51:56] MCas86: and a bucket of water
[1:51:57] lcePops: like a starter chest
[1:51:58] axeraider15: force world gen to spawn you with tree in chunk
[1:52:03] Buuddzz: twerk to grow faster
[1:52:11] Face_32: you could just do a spawn chest
[1:52:12] palmagranet: restrict spawning locations?
[1:52:29] F6MaxDamage: you spawn with 1 or more sapling in your inventory
[1:52:35] daemonaedryn: Force teleport to nearest forest?
[1:52:38] palmagranet: id say focus on vanilla first imo
[1:52:39] EZL1190: Build it around a specfiq seed
[1:52:40] Kingia: The Obelisk grants life! -Gives you a sapling/seed and dirt block.
[1:52:41] lcePops: I like that DaemonSzyman
[1:52:44] Waterpsy: yes it is
[1:52:56] Jeatio: Yes
[1:52:56] tommyfod: @giantwaffle it would be super hard to sleep through nights
[1:53:01] lcePops: literally just a single tree
[1:53:03] daemonaedryn: watger
[1:53:04] Kingia: Wood
[1:53:04] Coringa2k: what if around the world more obelisks spawns with idk 1-3 uses
[1:53:06] JommyBee: wood really
[1:53:07] Shadowmail: Maybe you can set how many chunks you are alloted at the start. So if people get annoyed they could start in a chunk and have lets say 3 free chunk unlocks. Set ahead of time
[1:53:08] Coringa2k: but cheap
[1:53:10] Face_32: there might be a way to set world parameters for spawn requirements and only lets speeds that spawn in a plain of forst biom
[1:53:12] axeraider15: give sapling and force the player to survive a night with dirt waiting for tree to grow. lol
[1:53:15] chaoskub: Make the obelisk have a Starter Pack, with what you deem needed. and force the spawn chunk to be what is needed. (override the normal gen)
[1:53:17] FroZenThai: Can it not have a single tree on a single dirt next to the obelisk
[1:53:20] daemonaedryn: pretty high
[1:53:23] InTheLittlePro: generate multiple spawns and select the highest density of trees and ores? add variables for water and such
[1:53:23] F6MaxDamage: a cauldan can get water from rain. LUL
[1:53:25] Face_32: water from cauldron
[1:53:28] Kingia: I was just typing that
[1:53:28] daemonaedryn: Ex nihilo mod?
[1:53:30] Kingia: Water from rain
[1:53:31] Alamose: biomes without rain though
[1:53:35] Coringa2k: u should write this
[1:53:35] EZL1190: you spawn in mountains, with no trees, then you can't break stone to get down to dirt
[1:53:42] palmagranet: A book with a guide
[1:53:42] Moobot: You can find Waffle's Youtube channel here - https://youtube.com/giantwaffle
[1:53:46] natsu130: today goal auto crafter? Kreygasm
[1:53:51] HQuinnch_tv: you dont really need anything to start minecraft. IMO
[1:53:52] Ichigolo: 1 seed tree bucket water lava
[1:53:55] daemonaedryn: desert
[1:53:57] Larklen: desert
[1:53:58] Larklen: KEKW
[1:54:00] daemonaedryn: KEKW
[1:54:01] Jibbur: desert chunk?
[1:54:04] lcePops: desert kekw
[1:54:04] Waterpsy: you can force a specific seed?
[1:54:04] Face_32: i think you can make spawns only in certain biomes @Giantwaffle
[1:54:05] Jeatio: Letting the obelisk contain starting items is nice
[1:54:06] imTymp: sand to stone
[1:54:07] MagicaKing: couldn't that be a little punishing, forcing you to get 7 iron and a rain to even start growing crops?
[1:54:09] Kaley4D: not always
[1:54:11] lcePops: but there is stone and sandstone
[1:54:11] daemonaedryn: sand to sandstone to stone
[1:54:12] CommanderUrsus: yeah skyfactory you start on top of a tree and thats it
[1:54:15] BroCreed1: Desert might not have wood though
[1:54:16] EZL1190: Can you break stone with bear hands, no tools to get to dirt?
[1:54:16] Kaley4D: dirt does spawn underground in nodes
[1:54:21] TheGeekPeek: why not just give a fairly generous starting pack. then later make a more expert version
[1:54:24] baseballx: trees give apples
[1:54:26] Shoobinist: water in caves too
[1:54:28] JoyToyJay: @Giantwaffle Just put a basic starter pack in your obelisk, with basic tools and maybe 1 or 2 nessescities.. will solve a lot of issues
[1:54:31] chaoskub: a bucket of water in the starter pack
[1:54:31] F6MaxDamage: you need dirt to grow tree. you need tree to get wood. wood is needed to get tools...
[1:54:39] palmagranet: I really think this is a good idea
[1:54:43] thunderdan11: @EZL1190 how are you gonna kill a bear though?
[1:54:45] imTymp: 1 dirt block 1 ice block 1 sapling 1 seed would set u
[1:54:47] Xev_00: Hardcore expert chunkman savixDespair
[1:55:00] Dizz1227: water
[1:55:00] lcePops: water
[1:55:00] daemonaedryn: water
[1:55:01] BroCreed1: Water
[1:55:01] InternetPlumber: break it to water
[1:55:03] Dvidan: WATER
[1:55:05] rykk3r1: water
[1:55:07] imTymp: then u cant move it
[1:55:09] imTymp: no free bucket
[1:55:10] Dizz1227: that way they dont get a free bucket
[1:55:23] daemonaedryn: KEKW
[1:55:27] GFQPR1882: NOTED
[1:55:29] BroCreed1: Technically you could give them a water source block lol
[1:55:29] SnackableGames: Everything changed when the seed block attacked
[1:55:30] Face_32: can you use the seeds for fuel?
[1:55:32] baseballx: ice only works if not in snow biome
[1:55:46] daemonaedryn: Netherite
[1:55:54] TheGeekPeek: I think certain resources would be more fun than xp
[1:55:54] MagicaKing: @baseballx  you can re-break the ice for water
[1:55:56] palmagranet: nether star unlokcs the end?
[1:55:58] Dizz1227: maybe some sort of villager esk interface? give items get expansion item or what not
[1:56:04] Kryllyk: like the old FTB Map Pyramid
[1:56:08] Alamose: feed the dragon egg
[1:56:17] TheGeekPeek: maybe at accepta different resources but has a cap for each type?
[1:56:20] Face_32: @baseballx once you get a lightsource next to it, it will stop refreezing
[1:56:20] Shadowmail: Do you have to feed the obilisk in order? Or lets say you someone had a nether star right away could you feed it in
[1:56:21] InternetPlumber: progressively harder tasks
[1:56:23] Force_Angel: Eat the dragon egg omNom
[1:56:24] rykk3r1: materials of obelisk change, and act as a beacon maybe?
[1:56:28] MagicaKing: Maybe you could buy different biome chunks for different costs?
[1:56:29] TheGeekPeek: would force you to be diverse
[1:56:31] BroCreed1: Maybe achievements give you free chuncks? Like kill the wither is worth 10 chuncks.
[1:56:33] axeraider15: combination of all the things would be fine, with scaling returns
[1:56:33] imTymp: yes
[1:56:34] RedalousTheRed: You are just reinventing a ctm map at this point tho?
[1:56:35] InternetPlumber: start with levels then onto exchanging items or something
[1:56:36] palmagranet: yes
[1:56:38] SirKaelan: Which minecraft update will this be for?
[1:56:41] IlsaGold: Dirt
[1:56:44] imTymp: expert is hardcore u have to reset to get a good rng start
[1:56:45] Xev_00: I would 100% play this modpack along with you
[1:56:45] palmagranet: Name?
[1:56:45] lcePops: I'd call it normal+
[1:56:46] The1_TS: If you know Deadpine, he was working on a single chunk challenge modpack earlier this year.
[1:56:50] Xev_00: or just mod rather
[1:56:52] daemonaedryn: gonna reset more than i do for my rimworld colonists KEKW
[1:56:58] chaoskub: PLEASE have all of the values configurable in a config for integration with other mods waffleHeart
[1:57:05] MrMoneybagMan: @the1_ts this one unlocks chunks
[1:57:07] Face_32: @SirKaelan good question, after 1.18 the chunks double in size
[1:57:09] InTheLittlePro: @chaoskub THIS
[1:57:11] mr_blair: maybe add food, dirt, saplings to the obelisk so you have to choose between unlocking chucks or surviving?
[1:57:12] daemonaedryn: KEKW
[1:57:12] danilul9: KEKW
[1:57:15] MagicaKing: Call it Tilemine
[1:57:16] Kaley4D: waffmatica
[1:57:22] The1_TS: @MrMoneybagMan, but has the same type of issues at start
[1:57:22] TheEndMyFriend: harcore should be the "temporary mode"
[1:57:25] hoffs: so gregtech?
[1:57:33] daemonaedryn: Chunkman?
[1:57:34] JoyToyJay: @Giantwaffle I'd honestly put a wood tool (pickaxe / axe at least) in start pack on normal.. would be pain to have to wait around first before u can kinda get going xD (if you spawn without wood for example)
[1:57:36] Face_32: would it be 1.16.5 or newer? makes a difference on the chunk sizes @Allmostdone
[1:57:40] davethulhu: @Giantwaffle reddit added trophies for r/place if you placed on a fresh square, had a place on the final canvas, and a place in the whiteout
[1:57:59] Kaley4D: i bet you'd like the rwtema minigame pack.
[1:58:00] SovietSerbian: what about having the obelisk as an item you can place in any chunk you want but cant break any blocks until you place it?
[1:58:08] CaptainAlkohol: did you figure out the dispenser problem? had to go grocery shopping
[1:58:17] Egrassa22: when you feed obelisk with item to unlock -> is the item gone? or its just checks if you have it?
[1:58:26] Coringa2k: space elevator with a button to submit
[1:58:36] rickhawks: hey chat, any modpack recommendations with kinda simple tech progression/explore/pvm/farm/trade?
[1:58:36] ayonme: !modpack
[1:58:36] Moobot: Waffle is playing Enigmatica 6 Expert mode! You can get it at curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/enigmatica6expert
[1:58:49] Shoobinist: could villager interface, feed obelisk and unlock new trades/achievements
[1:59:04] daemonaedryn: How about everything has a certain value, but using the same item exponentially loses value?
[1:59:08] Monty0x: Ender Hopper or Factory Hopper
[1:59:21] BroCreed1: The world master villager
[1:59:25] Itchyy_: is this idea somewhat inspired by tileman?
[1:59:29] CurbSerpent: How about paying to open up a chunk ... diamond block for 2 days ... etc.
[1:59:39] Kaley4D: would the item always be the same? or would it get progressivly harder?
[1:59:44] daemonaedryn: the gunsmith moved out PepeHands
[1:59:48] palmagranet: I would like a super challenging aspect of vanilla
[2:00:03] Apparentthreat: buy from villager. item has special nbt tags. detect item use. idk
[2:00:05] chaoskub: That would also basically stop softlocking if you include all needed start items to trade. And allow basic blocks to trade for 1 and only allow 1
[2:00:14] Mandorake: @Giantwaffle what if you could choose what kind of biomes were in the next chunk you unlock?
[2:00:24] daemonaedryn: What if the "obelisk" had health and if it got destroyed you die monkaHmm
[2:00:26] Kaley4D: hmmm
[2:00:35] Andersxa: and the item you get you just place on the border of a chunk to unlock it=
[2:00:36] Monty0x: You need to see if it's codable to complete multiple trades for a single unlock
[2:00:37] tommyfod: brrrrr scope creep
[2:00:40] lcePops: tower defense? DaemonSzyman
[2:00:43] daemonaedryn: @lcePops NODDERS
[2:00:43] virtualstorm24: whats the xray thing you use to find ore?
[2:00:45] MagicaKing: And if your starting out with 9 free tiles like in tileman you could spawn in with 9 of a certain item to trade for a chunk
[2:00:45] Kaley4D: we should prob write all these ideas down
[2:00:54] natsu130: what if you can select special chunk to spawn like only flat or just iron for more XP
[2:01:02] tommyfod: start simple and build it out from there. but keep it simple first and build the MVP
[2:01:09] palmagranet: maybe hardcore will have increasing mob waves?
[2:01:15] Shoobinist: big guardian is the only other vanilla boss
[2:01:17] DeadFury222: !modpack
[2:01:17] Jibbur: can't you make nether brick and wither skellys spawn anywhere on those in the nether?
[2:01:17] Moobot: Waffle is playing Enigmatica 6 Expert mode! You can get it at curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/enigmatica6expert
[2:01:20] daemonaedryn: it would be nice if the bonus gave perks or something
[2:01:20] MrHashbrowns: sponges
[2:01:21] MagicaKing: Sponges?
[2:01:21] EZL1190: The cost of the chunk should depend on the distance form spawn. In the interface you could choose North, South... chunk to unlock
[2:01:23] Dizz1227: sponges
[2:01:25] Shoobinist: Conduit?
[2:01:41] InternetPlumber: dragon head
[2:01:49] dennis0712: good luck getting netherite

[2:02:13] lcePops: you were making a vauum hopper
[2:02:16] lcePops: or vacuum something
[2:02:20] Shoobinist: don't forget vacume hopper
[2:02:46] lcePops: waffle distracted KEKW
[2:02:52] daemonaedryn: i dont think this modpack has a vacuum hopper?
[2:03:02] InternetPlumber: maybe some of the bosses from that enchanted forest mod?
[2:03:17] daemonaedryn: KEKW
[2:03:27] Xev_00: KEKW
[2:03:30] KillTheNite: enough of the mod already
[2:03:31] Khaall: Isn't this an old challenge map? where achievements expand your area by a tile or so
[2:03:40] lcePops: Ci would add a secret trade for 1 seed for 1 chunk
[2:03:44] drebisdavid: break the plant with fortune pickaxe and u will get many seeds
[2:03:47] natsu130: make it simple but hard
[2:03:56] Alamose: captive minecraft
[2:03:56] daemonaedryn: Similar concept as claustrophobia I guess, just a different direction
[2:04:03] RedalousTheRed: complete the monument?
[2:04:21] Alamose: the maps with those rules are usually pregenerated
[2:04:25] RobbyUlv: maybe totem can unlock somthing
[2:04:34] cyberhalo: make sure you add face hugging mosquitos
[2:04:58] Racko5: what about face hugging wasps
[2:05:06] HQuinnch_tv: yes to face huggers. upvote
[2:05:12] bJoHEi: broke your chunk boundry = facehugger YEP
[2:05:14] Kaley4D: pog!
[2:05:22] Monty0x: trasure bags just give you gold items. gold boots, nuggets, ingots
[2:05:23] spratydad: they work just fine
[2:05:23] Vovosunt: they're garbage
[2:05:26] spratydad: only GOLD
[2:05:27] HammerssC: jUST GOLD
[2:05:30] HammerssC: Nothing good
[2:05:33] Kaley4D: prob like loot bags from skyfactory.
[2:05:33] drebisdavid: no they are like dungeon chests loot
[2:05:41] InternetPlumber: those chests from the Lootr mod are broken AF
[2:05:44] Deji0: !pack
[2:05:54] CaptainAlkohol: yeah
[2:05:56] CaptainAlkohol: those work
[2:05:58] thunderdan11: make them from diamond
[2:05:59] lcePops: !e6e

[2:06:55] cheppard: are we going digital today, again?
[2:07:06] rykk3r1: COPIUM
[2:07:11] not_elinn: COPIUM
[2:07:11] CaptainAlkohol: dont even need vacuum hopper, just spikes on top of a normal hopper
[2:07:27] lcePops: haha

[2:07:30] Supremelurker: a?

[2:07:47] lcePops: Guys, he's had digital for a week and a half already. What do you mean
[2:07:48] Kaley4D: delorean?
[2:07:49] not_elinn: the modpack is run on a computer does that count as digital?
[2:07:49] kingjord: I was wondering what is more worth it mining bitcoin or athyrium
[2:07:50] Mikael_Since: devil may cry?
[2:08:03] bJoHEi: DM-Ci pepeLaugh

[2:09:04] Larklen: yeah, a butt OMEGALUL
[2:09:05] ThatOnneGuy: said his texture was ugly
[2:09:06] DX_Plates: His textures looked like butt
[2:09:14] Kaley4D: isnt that against curseforge tos...
[2:09:18] danilul9: KEKW KEKW
[2:09:18] Tackler52: so my water cooler went out on my PC yesterday...just moved to air cooling and did the fix myself. I'm proud of me :D

[2:10:09] FroZenThai: I'm yellowlisted
[2:10:11] chaoskub: Allow / Deny is pretty common. I've also seen a lot of people using grata, nongrata
[2:10:16] Apparentthreat: little dick energy
[2:10:20] danilul9: KEKW
[2:10:22] Belgarath81: wasn't that some Factorio shit?
[2:10:24] rykk3r1: wut KEKW
[2:10:26] Larklen: KEKW
[2:10:28] Dagmoo: micro peen energy KEKW
[2:10:30] J0hanAndersson: sounds like a factorio mod :D
[2:10:34] Face_32: then dont release it i guess
[2:10:35] chaoskub: Go work for microsoft
[2:10:35] HKRage: I get it but at the same time that makes no sense LOL
[2:10:37] chaoskub: lol
[2:10:38] AlphaSchnauzer: thats also illegal LUL
[2:10:38] Cmdr_Void: also he had a super insane licence on it so noone was allowed to even edit it
[2:10:42] orangecreamsicle3: fuck em
[2:10:43] Mandorake: completely against the spirit of modding as well
[2:10:50] chaoskub: That is legit insane
[2:10:52] Bweggar: just pay him 4Head
[2:10:54] Apparentthreat: literally could not work w/o the game
[2:11:03] DeadFury222: Factorio could probably sue their ass @Giantwaffle
[2:11:03] natsu130: soo you pay him?
[2:11:06] Face_32: isnt it illegal to profit off other games like that?
[2:11:06] HKRage: Modding is supposed to be open source, kinda goes against that
[2:11:11] thunderdan11: tbh that guy probably isnt allowed to do that
[2:11:11] AlphaSchnauzer: just put yur name on front
[2:11:11] InternetPlumber: probably against the TOS of Factorio also
[2:11:17] Kaley4D: see i get when game devs who make story games are like "dont stream the game" cause games are getting so close to movies story wise that its like streaming a free movie.
[2:11:21] Kaley4D: but mod devs... nah
[2:11:22] Allmostdone: It’s his husband why would he pay him
[2:11:31] Sentinel1_9: @Giantwaffle didnt his mod also get fucked into the ground after that by factorio devs?
[2:11:40] Dizz1227: Calamity
[2:11:41] KillTheNite: talk show
[2:11:42] rykk3r1: calamity
[2:11:44] chaoskub: I don't hate the patreon links. I actually think its a nice way to build it in without being pushy
[2:11:44] drebisdavid: calamity
[2:11:46] InternetPlumber: tmod leader for 1.4 is in beta
[2:11:47] chaoskub: Calamity
[2:11:56] Salico: calamity could be terraria 2
[2:12:06] Allmostdone: It use to be in the MC agreement about making money off it
[2:12:11] Kaley4D: this sounds like that mineplex game.
[2:12:16] Dizz1227: is that not what Hypixle is
[2:12:20] twobyfor: that swhat dota2 did
[2:12:23] Kaley4D: yeah hypixle
[2:12:25] GuardMoony: Isn't that like what dayz did and such
[2:12:28] Face_32: modpack makers often make thier own games after doing big  big packs like that
[2:12:28] twobyfor: or hytale
[2:12:29] Tiggaboo: they couldnt use a single asset
[2:12:29] NecropoIis: i mean pubg made their own game after being an arma mod
[2:12:30] SelIout_: as long as they dont reuse assets that arent theirs
[2:12:38] twobyfor: or even [ubg
[2:12:38] Cmdr_Void: thats literally what DOTA did @Giantwaffle
[2:12:48] Allmostdone: Nope clone away… in games and software. In America
[2:12:49] Nutteria: Cant stop them for sure. But publisher might deny them. And marketing is expensive
[2:12:50] NoSpacesDan: how does pokemon sue the fan games? @Giantwaffle
[2:12:56] AlphaSchnauzer: would be a fun law suit
[2:13:12] Tyluuuhh: @NoSpacesDan 90% of the fan games are based on the pokemon engine.
[2:13:12] Drudo: like DayZ
[2:13:14] HKRage: theirs plenty of minecraft adventure lookalike games
[2:13:14] orangecreamsicle3: Dayz was a mod in Arma 3 and it became a full game
[2:13:22] Larklen: @NoSpacesDan cause they take money for those projects and re-use IP/Trademarks/Assets
[2:13:26] Allmostdone: US law is different than other parts of the world
[2:13:27] Kaley4D: its a lot of money yeah.
[2:13:35] Face_32: arma 3 is still heavily modded
[2:13:36] Monty0x: Ender Hopper or Factory Hopper
[2:13:38] InternetPlumber: in the case of terraria I doubt concerned ape would care
[2:13:39] Dizz1227: yes
[2:13:43] DeadFury222: Is the claustrophobia minecraft mod good?
[2:13:48] CaptainAlkohol: you dont need a vacuum hopper, normal hopper works @Giantwaffle
[2:13:55] Ras2709: do the botania one LUL
[2:13:58] Face_32: is the quark hoppers dissabled?
[2:14:03] CaptainAlkohol: just put spikes above a hopper, nest in front
[2:14:09] Face_32: 3x3
[2:14:17] Ohmec: @orangecreamsicle3 Also, DOTA
[2:14:35] orangecreamsicle3: @Ohmec I never heard of DOTA
[2:14:55] Face_32: i dont think spikes damage items so its okay to use it ontop of hoppers
[2:15:04] hisdue: crafting terminal does a little trollin

[2:50:05] ashinkusher47: I missed the whole joke chat
[2:50:10] ChromaCym: I just remember how dumb Ventrilo was because you couldn't set your own password, an admin had to set it for you so they would know your password
[2:50:16] CbsGurchus: they used ts3
[2:50:16] ChromaCym: (server admin that is)
[2:50:17] Moobot: You can sub to Waffle by clicking this neat link -> twitch.tv/giantwaffle/subscribe

[2:50:54] sogerr: raidcall was cool
[2:50:56] VaultPls: whats funny is teamspeak 5 is switching to the Matrix protocol (a.k.a federation with your servers to other servers)
[2:51:02] Jakosin: Neither do I and I hosted a vent server
[2:51:05] Gelil: One of them had an mIRC plugin for auth
[2:51:10] Tabakhase: yea vent is mTLS
[2:51:15] ChromaCym: A server I was on got hijacked because some dumb admin made an admin account and set the guy's password to "password"
[2:51:16] Denel55: i used teamspeak for arma alot
[2:51:18] ChromaCym: and it never got changed
[2:51:23] VaultPls: its funny because they were centralized
[2:51:27] VaultPls: now theyre going distributed
[2:51:48] LMNTRX92: im form the time where you had to do a conference call on your phone to play with your friends online LUL
[2:52:03] VaultPls: but if theyre based off of a open-protocol...whats the point of using teamspeak when you can use an opensource server

[2:56:47] LadyPotaty: A vanilla spawner works fine, so a cardboard box works fine. @Giantwaffle
