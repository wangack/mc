[3:58:24] CizerK: I like the TTT / GTA only because I can have that in the background and be fine
[3:59:07] CizerK: These I'd like to watch with more focus, but I'm a pretty recent fan
[3:59:58] 1In4Lifetime: ahhh im more of an oldie lol. Watched TTT and GTA in beginning. TTT has too many roles and stuff. So its the opposite for me so i completely understand your view
[4:00:32] CizerK: And they've added 4 more, lol. Crazy
[4:02:31] Immindragon: Man does it feel weird to see someone describe being an oldie as starting with TTT and GTA.  Sometimes I have to remember just how long they've actually done those...
[4:03:22] 1In4Lifetime: I didnt start with ttt and gta lol
[4:03:51] 1In4Lifetime: Ive been watching since SOI
[4:04:19] 1In4Lifetime: i meant I only really watched TTT and GTA when they began those videos
