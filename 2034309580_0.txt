[0:26:11] Legoguy2020: @name_under_rennovation wdym AD for atheists?
[0:26:13] jurishacker: Do you have a scanner to show the image?  It would be really cool to watch how you approach a design with the reference in front of us.
[0:26:25] buzzie107: @tinispicy  really?
[0:26:36] brett_lieffers: Good idea. Can't wait to see how it helps your designs grow
[0:26:46] TiniSpicy: @buzzie107 yea, nex to the chat box, chat identity
[0:26:46] zipn_streams: i kinda like those builds that mash different time periods and styles together
[0:26:48] BrokenPhysics13: for those unaware, it's considered more secular and modern to use BCE and CE instead of BC and AD nowadays
[0:27:05] ClassyCashier: The first step to understanding architecture for MC is the term "post and lintel construction." Once you learn the anatomy of putting up a ceiling it becomes easier.
[0:27:11] GingerTheLily: @ClassyCashier Hello and welcome in!
[0:27:14] poisso3: Having dated an Architect who specialized in historical restoration, you really don't want to mix modern and historical styles in a way that is jarring.
[0:27:15] BrokenPhysics13: because not everyone is Christian
[0:27:16] fragglemeat: @Legoguy2020 because AD stands for anno domini or year of the lord, it's very christian

[0:29:10] brett_lieffers: Gables are always difficult for me to get looking good
[0:29:26] name_under_rennovation: I redownloaded minecraft when I initially got into Hermitcraft/MCYT, but I have no real drive to actually play. I’m too much of a coward to do survival, and I don’t have any grand build plans for a creative world
[0:29:28] jreds007: I'll be looking up step by step tutorials soon. It's making me crazy.
[0:29:32] mitchmethinks: you silk touched your rooted dirt for the roots didnt know that was a thing
[0:29:32] poisso3: I spent a few hours on Sunday putting an observatory dome at the top of a large circular tower. Probably the hardest "roof" I have ever constructed.
[0:29:33] fragglemeat: it's also easier to do a non-45-degree roof the larger the building is, just because it's easier to disguise a diagonal the farther away from it you view
[0:29:38] square__s: once activated with set effects and ingots, does a beacon stay activated forever?
[0:29:54] ClassyCashier: I feel like the difficulty in making roofs is that they're normally an accent color, and being different blocks it's attaching the blocks that's tricky to learn at first.
[0:29:56] TheDruidJenn: yes square__s
[0:29:57] GingerTheLily: @square__s yes, untill you take it down
[0:29:59] kris10183: I’m still struggling to make stuff look less like a box and add more shapes. it’s a lot harder than I thought it would be
[0:29:59] BrokenPhysics13: if you're having a hard time designing a roof, search up different roof styles and try building them in creative to see what you like best
[0:30:09] Legoguy2020: Pix what day are you on?

[0:33:08] buzzie107: @pixlriffs I’ve started using slabs to make my roof have more dimension than just blocks for making it completely out of slab stairs it’s makes it look alittle more 3D imo
[0:33:11] NikeName: when i tried building roofs, i overthink it by considering what would the roof look like weathered

[0:34:11] Bedrig: technical mods can satiate that desire, buuuutt vanilla is a limited palette.
[0:34:13] jreds007: I like a Gothic style, or high pitched look. Using blocks and slabs to get a curve. It's a struggle to get it to look natural on small builds.

[0:40:16] zipn_streams: would be a cool mechanic tho
[0:40:32] ClassyCashier: I recently tore down a similar project in my survival world. I always like the big n quick farms I just wish there was a way to blend them in easier like permanent farms.

[1:00:29] jaredvv86: Is that possible for those to stay alive there?
[1:00:49] Kai1108: does foxes actually make tons of screeching noise like in the game
[1:00:54] boxthebee: @kurogane42 town criers got paid to scream really loud
[1:00:54] kattepootjes: city parakeets have been an invasive species in big Dutch cities too. i guess it started like that too

[1:03:44] vikingmama901: So you recorded foxes the day before Guy Fawkes Day?
[1:03:48] kurogane42: @LitesLAB having been around hyenas, I would say spot on
[1:03:54] Colli39_: to think that there was an entire song made about this sound…
[1:03:54] kuruasu: I think the word for it is 'geckering'
[1:03:55] poisso3: If you want something that will make the hair on the back of your neck stand on end, have a bobcat in your area scream in the middle of the night.

[1:06:53] kurogane42: @LitesLAB I mean I was in the army at the time, so I was not concerned for my safety. They just stink to high heaven, and are much bigger than you think.
[1:07:04] mcwheesus: Unfortunately with camera feeds you gotta be careful from doxxing yourself too cause folks be creepy
[1:07:20] AbsentNyx: @GingerTheLily It did actually. Just threw blindly at the hedge I thought it was in and it made it stop

[1:15:07] kattepootjes: yeah I’ve noticed there’s a bug in refilling trades sometimes
[1:15:10] Kai1108: compared to the storage door
[1:15:18] internal_error_1: Sticks, Rotten Flesh, Wheat. Those work well for the quick trading.
[1:15:37] EfilsGod: can you pull them with a lead or fishing rod?
[1:16:04] GingerTheLily: appreciates the thanks
[1:16:07] kurogane42: attaching a lead to a villager, is a bad look
[1:16:18] reyan_manc: you think a cherry blossom themed castle would be a good idea for this world?
[1:16:21] poisso3: In bedrock, you can put them in a boat and drag the boat with a lead
[1:16:25] Big____Tasty: as opposed to fishing them?!?!
[1:16:25] internal_error_1: I think you also need to have at least one item left over in the trade box for the space to work. It the trade leaves the box empty, I don't think space will refill - it doesn't know what to fill with.
[1:16:27] Treity: @kurogane42 I have seen lots of real life people put leashes on their children
[1:16:36] cyaanknight: It's only a war crime if we get caught with the villager tradign halls, Pix.
[1:16:39] ashdances: imagine if you could make one of the backpack leashes you get for small kids to put on villagers
[1:16:43] jenny_b14: villagers aren’t normal people lol. they’re far more stubborn
[1:16:47] EfilsGod: Yeah but locking them in a room with a zombie is weird too, and some people are into that
[1:16:56] kurogane42: @Treity doesn't make it a good look
[1:16:57] TiniSpicy: would be so much easier lol
[1:16:59] Kai1108: how our lives would be so much easier if we could leash them
[1:17:00] kmb600: haha it'd be funny if you could only leash baby villagers
[1:17:02] square__s: wait u cant u put villagers in a boat in java?
[1:17:07] Whimsella: They are people so ofc you can't use leeds... but sure use a fishingrod🤣🤣
[1:17:11] GingerTheLily: @square__s you can!
[1:17:11] jaredvv86: Omg I am laughing too hard at the child leash joke
[1:17:14] e_sonofander: you can put them in a boat, you can't put a lead on the boat
[1:17:15] Axynim: @square__s Can't put leads on boats in java
[1:17:20] FerriaForever: It would be nice if they would follow you if you are holding an emerald.
[1:17:30] mitchmethinks: Alright so consensus is we can lead baby villagers not adult villagers
[1:17:30] square__s: ohh right
[1:17:46] cyaanknight: @mitchmethinks I like this plan

[1:17:59] Vinka90: Once (like 16yrs back) I saw a woman with a child on a lead in Krakau. Quite a weird and little disturbing view
[1:18:03] internal_error_1: You can't do ANYTHING with teens.
[1:18:05] mitchmethinks: Lead breaks and they run
[1:18:05] kattepootjes: @ferriaforever sometimes I think they do but usually that’s just me being delusional
[1:18:10] Axynim: Would love a nametag/potion that stops aging
[1:18:10] Colli39_: hey pix, what camera do you use for your webcam? and, apart from your phone, do you have any cameras that you use for photography?
[1:18:17] e_sonofander: Lead just pops off, because it's too small for them now, lol

[1:24:10] RageKitsukii: second to last recent

[1:24:37] RageKitsukii: paths*?

[1:25:08] GingerTheLily: ginger469Tyop
[1:25:14] jaredvv86: That reminds. With the iron farm design you used. Do all of your villagers sleep at night therefore not spawning golems?
[1:25:17] maiki79: Hallo everyone
[1:25:19] kris10183: What’s the best way to farm warped wood? Is it easier to just go looking in the nether or set a bunch up and chop them down?
[1:25:21] paperbird76: Hi chat!
[1:25:23] GingerTheLily: @maiki79 hi!

[1:27:12] Kai1108: i rly recommend the tree farm by ianxofour, its simple and bold but yet effective!
[1:27:14] AbsentNyx: @Colli39_ It was a temporary water sources yes. He just hasn't replaced it
[1:27:28] PapayaCraft77: @CoraxChimera Same! Super cheap and easy to make and sooo good!
[1:27:42] GingerTheLily: I was on holiday is Scotland once, and iot was "Lentil Soup Week"
[1:27:51] Colli39_: i see, fair enough
[1:27:54] UwUDragonLord: we stripped something i think
[1:28:18] CoraxChimera: Sorry! I wasn't paying attention! Is the tree farm still within the bamboo farm range for it to be growing?
[1:28:24] CoraxChimera: (Had lentils on the mind)
[1:28:30] kuruasu: hi! I've been a fan on youtube for a while but this is only the second stream of your I've caught (I only just started watching twitch in the new year  and between busy projects and getting sick it's the only thing keeping me sane lol) thank you for being awesome!
[1:28:39] GingerTheLily: @CoraxChimera Sounds uncomfortable!
[1:28:41] CoraxChimera: Oooh.

[1:30:11] PapayaCraft77: Haven't had the chance to listen to the new episode, but I am excited! Will listen to it while clearing lava in the nether at least it will keep me entertained.

[1:32:03] kurogane42: @TheMysticCrafter Wlcome on in
[1:32:16] andrecruz04: Wattles have this behavior of decorating farms
[1:32:21] Artecie: My farms don't get decorated, but that's because I get builder's block (lack of creative ideas around them).
[1:32:22] blankcircuitboard: I advocate for Pretty Farms because you spend o much time there.
[1:32:29] cutecraft325: Hellooooo
[1:32:33] zsigmons1: Like The Machine on Empires S2
[1:32:38] TheMysticCrafter: hi :)
[1:32:39] e_sonofander: that's why my iron farm "builds" are always ginormous, to keep the blocks far enough away from the spawning areas, lol
[1:32:42] maiki79: Do you plan on playing skyblock again in the future? I really enjoyed the series and the it suddenly ended…
[1:32:45] kuruasu: I have a mixed iron farm and villager trading hall in one of my worlds, so the same villagers I trade with also spawn all the iron golems
[1:33:01] houseoftomorrow: I usually decorate mine but I'm never in a hurry for a ton of resources.

[1:34:00] houseoftomorrow: Scar's storm might be my favorite large scale decorated farm. That looked so good.
[1:34:02] RunePr1est: while on farms, do you recommend any gold farm (thats works after 1.20.2) please :-)

[1:35:13] cutecraft325: Btw , Pixl, what about the RTX survival series? Do you plan on starting one again?
[1:35:18] mpsteel95_: I'm so ready for spring and warm and the sunshine to be up and outside more
[1:35:20] internal_error_1: I just want to see the sun on the way to and from work.
[1:35:24] begaydocrime2: I'm Canadian and work 5-8pm, so it's just started getting light on my way to work again
[1:35:30] AbsentNyx: I always sleep in when I can. Regardless of the amount of daylight
[1:35:50] e_sonofander: sadly, RTX has mostly been abandoned it seems
[1:35:59] Axynim: RTX is dead, fwiw. Render Dragon and baked in shaders FTW
[1:36:00] EvilShadoww: hey pix! how're you doing today
[1:36:03] IsDiscoCreeper: I woke up this morning to frost on the inside of my windshield, so that was new
[1:36:06] fragglemeat: there's much better raytraced java shaders anyway
[1:36:23] GingerTheLily: The joke is that the Irish used to be sun worshippers, but they gave up because there was no evidence that the sun exists!

[1:38:18] internal_error_1: Hopefully the cold snap here is about over. Woke up to -13F/-25C this morning.
[1:38:21] cutecraft325: I agree
[1:38:34] LitesLAB: modern RTX is quite nice on the PC, rivals Java Shaders now
[1:38:36] GingerTheLily: @internal_error_1 that cold would cause internal errors!!
[1:38:38] kris10183: @internal_error_1 that sounds miserable

[1:39:15] GingerTheLily: @Whimsella Ray Tracing - its a method of rendering light to look much better
[1:39:25] BrianGLHF: When you have a dev speaking on your podcast does Mojang have to review your content before you post it?
[1:39:55] Whimsella: Ah ofc. Thank you @gingerthelily @axynim
[1:40:03] PretzelRocks: Now Playing: Esfera - Instrumental by Juan Rios -> https://prtzl.io/wyH6JlmG1gV4Y5UV
[1:40:17] fragglemeat: shaders are just programs. they can do anything they want - raytracing is still shaders.
[1:40:29] LitesLAB: RTX has come a LONG way since you last used it Pix, it would be worth giving it another go just to show the differences.
[1:40:34] FatherOfKayos: Absolutely love the sideburns! I can't grow them and I've always wanted mutton chops. So I'm going to be giving them to my avatar.
[1:40:35] TheMysticCrafter: well we are hopefull for the ray tracing, but what about having light while holding torch without mods? you don't need rtx for that, idk why it's not a thing yet
[1:40:51] Axynim: Shaders = Stagnant  light, predetermined. RTX = Dynamic, fluid

[1:50:27] mpsteel95_: What DO we know about what the armour is going to be capable of?
[1:50:28] technicallyblue: Better AI sounds great. A good start is path 2 whole blocks around lava....
[1:50:40] kattepootjes: wild wolves already kill sheep so it would also be a logical next way of them healing themselves
[1:50:55] cutecraft325: @gingerthelily so they're far more lazy or not at all? Lol
