[0:50:13] Desierfire14: overlapping voices are a lot... is it possible to show the video rather than hear the audio for people?
[0:50:20] SketchyManager: @vonfirmath, true. Impulse and Kizz have a series wherein they survive naked and scared XD

[0:54:58] SketchyManager: run cub run!
[0:55:03] cptBardo: @garauandrea003 the game prompts them I believe, with the current goals.  So the first one told them to kill a boss to trigger the raid, then they have to kill all the enemies.    Next game the trigger will be different
[0:55:08] chastocaa: HypeLol

[1:15:47] atom_chu: last round is "oops all withers"

[1:15:54] kirk1122_theythem: IDK
[1:15:57] BradMyer: Everyone forgets about TFC. He's a Hermit too.
[1:16:01] holix_o0: @sketchymanager Yes
[1:16:04] WeirdlyRF: axes do more damage, but swords are faster
[1:16:08] Toxin543: nooooooooooooooooo
[1:16:08] 6unknown_source9: @sketchymanager yes but they have slower attackspeed and low attack range
[1:16:11] ramnite_tv: @sketchymanager High crit single mob damage, lower attack spped, no sweep
[1:16:12] kirk1122_theythem: Who?
[1:16:16] TachtY_o: Leets do that HypeHeart
[1:16:21] cptBardo: so there are 0 points for finishing the raid last.  I'm really surprised they aren't just waiting out the timer trying to get diamonds or lapis.   But maybe they want the EXP?
[1:16:24] TinitheBini: @sketchymanager it depends which version you’re playing. I think axes are better in Java
[1:16:25] morbiditeas: im stressing
[1:16:25] DahliaM77: go hypno, Ren, and Martyn!
[1:16:30] SketchyManager: @Toxin543_ , mumbo doesnt stream at twitch and twitch rivals only feature twitch streamers
[1:16:47] MoonShadowStory: @sketchymanager Axes do more damage but are slower in comparison to a sword
[1:16:50] world303: PogChamp
[1:16:56] yostation: twrTeamrecrent
[1:17:00] WeirdlyRF: Swords also can damage more than one target at a time.

[1:17:37] dontdehydrate: dothey still get te points tho even if they dont finish?
[1:17:41] levitichong420: twrTeamimangelikaa twrTeamimangelikaa
[1:18:00] 6unknown_source9: for Crowd Control, better use swords since you can damage and push back different mobs, while axes for single target
[1:18:07] cakesinthemaze: hi ren was lying to y’all he definitely did not have a plan
[1:18:07] 05TyTheGuy: we asked Ren how he'll prepare, he said YES

[1:19:16] Randy_27: forsenInsane STOP
[1:19:21] DahliaM77: is derpcoin gonna be a viable currency??
[1:19:23] cptBardo: A wooden Axe crit (jumping and hitting on the way down) does the same damage as a diamond sword I think.
[1:19:32] ozzyo_0: pixl and joe are doing such an amazing job :')
[1:19:36] Hindanger_Ash: 3-way tie for 2nd
[1:19:37] WeirdlyRF: wow pixlriffs definitely does not look how I imagined
[1:19:39] talingad: As the buff and debuff are cumulative, you have all interest to get a bugg in the first round to have the 4 other round be easier than finishing first and have 4 rounds with a debuff and possibly lose because of it
[1:19:48] holix_o0: @cptBardo yeh thats why axes are a bit harder to use
[1:19:53] naomi__187: SeemsGood

[1:20:19] LadyRhianna: @dark_regalus Martin and hypno
[1:20:19] cptBardo: @radical_play they also take double durability when attacking, so they'll break faster than a sword.
[1:20:22] SketchyManager: @dark_regalus, IntoTheLittleWoods and Hypno

[1:31:06] ozzyo_0: ahahahaha
[1:31:06] SketchyManager: @generous__gamer, finished or not, last placer gets a single point.  In Mario Kart, thats how it works cuz there are 12 competitors but because there are only 6 teams in this event, giving a single point allows the 6th placer team  to catch up and have chance.
[1:31:08] chastocaa: voyunHey
