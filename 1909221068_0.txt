[1:16:04] BandaiNenzai: @KayEffCeee Find gold in the tunnels and collect sand to extend your timer. If the timer runs out and you're still exploring, you loose all collected gold. To keep your gold, you either leave the dungeon before the timer ends or bank coins (losing 20%) so you can collect more.
[1:16:31] cjbellace: lets goooooo
[1:16:39] InTheLittleWood: It's a simple dungeon explorer. The goal is to get coins from coins on the ground, cracked walls with coins in and by destroying spawners. The sand they find goes in to the timer in teh central room. If you don't leave the dungeon before it runs out, you lose everything
[1:16:49] KayEffCeee: Ah okay, thanks for the explanation!
