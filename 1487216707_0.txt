[0:29:04] F0xyTheFox: @ninopanda i got 4 pumps and i cant supply enough water to it NotLikeThis
[0:29:15] warmwalrus: south vern is super juice NODDERS

[0:35:40] Nexhunter: wait nvm can't open mail in the dungeon KEKW
[0:35:56] itzSimondr98: you can
[0:36:02] Swiper95: you can if you have the aura
[0:36:09] itzSimondr98: through the market NODDERS
[0:36:10] Swiper95: if you have the pet inventory
[0:36:31] ninopanda: np @Felipe_sl15 at 1370+ you should have a 3-3-3-1 for grudge, raid captain, Adrenaline, and esoteric skill enhancement.  in that order for best PvE damage
[0:36:55] warmwalrus: hm valtan 3/3/3 is prob preffered
[0:37:01] itzSimondr98: Dont die, let other do dmg pepeLaugh
[0:37:08] ninopanda: that is for wardancer waffle
[0:37:14] Swiper95: I have 3x3 with lvl 1 heavy armor
[0:37:26] punkgeek: dead DPS is 0 DPS
[0:37:28] ピッザダディ: berserk best class NODDERS
[0:37:39] Mandorake: crisis evasion lvl 1 is awesome
[0:37:47] Swiper95: underrated, just as a random lvl 1 for super cheap
[0:38:13] Venxuri: What i enjoy is that for Valtan a lot of the dmg is avoidable, Argos you just had a ton of unavoidable dmg that chipped you away
[0:38:32] warmwalrus: dont forget your second awakening on your bard
[0:38:38] Nexhunter: just don't get kicked by argos 4Head
[0:38:44] Swiper95: Eh argos is so annoying tho
[0:38:46] Nexhunter: use gold KEKW
[0:38:53] celadriel23: you have 24 million silver its fine
[0:38:55] Swiper95: Buy with gold
[0:38:57] itzSimondr98: you can buy them 10 for 1g in Auction house NODDERS
[0:38:58] Swiper95: so cheap
[0:39:02] Cannonboot: expensive? thats just 2 runs of lopang?
[0:39:10] Swiper95: look it up in market
[0:39:15] Nexhunter: dwjftSuffer imagine having lot of silver
[0:39:18] warmwalrus: 23m silver is huge in this patch KEKW
[0:39:28] itzSimondr98: 1g per 10 pepeLaugh
[0:39:34] Felipe_sl15: @ninopanda yea i'll do that, i'm using ambush master instead of grudge :/
[0:39:37] Mandorake: its cheaper for silver
[0:39:39] sam1390: I wish awakening shards could be used from roster storage
[0:39:42] Nexhunter: that like two collectibles being sold KEKW
[0:39:51] Swiper95: bots
[0:39:52] DeadlyBrother: no its bots
[0:40:06] Nexhunter: yep
[0:40:13] Swiper95: they use their excess silver for gold
[0:40:14] SlyPoooper: fuckin nex
[0:40:17] celadriel23: yeah def bots cuz they dont have use for silver
[0:40:19] Nexhunter: but also thank you bots cause buying the amount of shards in silver fucks me KEKW
[0:40:25] MellowKoNeko: just using it as a way to trade silver for gold
[0:40:41] ninopanda: @Felipe_sl15 if you are already using it, you are good. no need to go out of your way to swap into grudge the difference is 0.03% DPS
[0:41:04] Archelonde: 16%~
[0:41:42] warmwalrus: yea, it's weird you need to kill like 1 mob if youre over a certain percentage
[0:42:28] babyaddalyn: just kill them one by one and count it :P

[2:51:18] veke101: I bet all of the Lost Ark veterans can find the G spot YEP
[2:51:32] sam1390: @CapnHatrick do you feel sad knowing that we got to endgame 15 minutes faster by spamming g? /s

[2:52:41] Neonnimbus: I know the expensive one gets you 2600 blue crysts
[2:52:46] Neonnimbus: crystals

[3:01:33] DaFez_: oh you mean deskaluda
[3:01:33] DexxonGaming: @HostileLogOut lol i aint worried about it, but if i can make some gold, im all about it.
[3:01:40] celadriel23: will it really be 3 weeks before anyone gets any relic gear pieces?
[3:01:42] celadriel23: that doesnt seem right
[3:01:51] Ashurian83: same map as yoho Pog
[3:02:06] celadriel23: like gear not accessories
[3:02:25] celadriel23: like whenever the whales get their relic weapons leapstones gonna double or more in price
[3:02:29] Face_32: wont it take us a bit to overgear it like JP does

[3:07:53] warmwalrus: im lost when they did season 2 shield hero
[3:08:01] OrangeW2: my bet is they'll drop it last week of may
[3:08:34] CapnHatrick: Perfect scenario is they drop a roadmap the describes reaper and scouter release
[3:08:37] Ashurian83: and we cry
[3:08:47] Dagmoo: @ninopanda 64 weeks?!?! wtf
[3:09:18] ninopanda: yup and we got the last 1K until then
[3:09:30] ninopanda: we are looking at redesigning the whole build
[3:09:36] celadriel23: summoner is 100% the next class we're getting
[3:09:43] ninopanda: but that is going to take soo fucking long
[3:09:48] Dagmoo: or time to look for secondary supplier
[3:09:51] celadriel23: they said they want to release them in order of release to the game
[3:09:54] jojoh70: its summoner
[3:09:56] Venxuri: I have a feeling that balance changes a re not going to drop tomorrow
[3:09:57] Proxzyn: LUL
[3:10:05] ninopanda: there is no secondary supplier of the chip
[3:10:10] CapnHatrick: I think I remember summoner being in the beta too

[3:10:17] jojoh70: damn thats an easy free vip
[3:10:18] humanshjake: At my job we have minimum 3 months wait for laptops. Silicon shortage sucks

[3:11:01] Mandorake: Dang thats a good deal
[3:11:03] celadriel23: if its not those 2 its a push then

[3:11:22] emShinagi: i think they will change 2 class at the same time
[3:11:31] Harmar: @meilers its admin without the admin powers so you are exempt from slow mode xD
[3:11:44] celadriel23: thats good cuz i type too much too quickly
[3:11:47] emShinagi: but  skip 1 month
[3:11:48] ninopanda: @humanshjake yeah we are close to that issue as well
[3:12:21] Coulby: i am suprised they didnt add it tot he store tbh, its free money
[3:12:33] celadriel23: roxx did say they are *trying* to have road map by end of month
[3:12:40] Coulby: ye exactly
[3:12:42] celadriel23: so i may get my vip soon :)
[3:12:44] humanshjake: @Zeikoa thats crazy. We've given up on upgrading our wyse 3040 to 5020. Our employees just have to make due with dual monitors and no video calls ^^
[3:12:46] Ashurian83: free money and no p2w complains
[3:12:47] AIex_0: people would cry about p2w even more Jebaited there's no winning
[3:12:48] TheResinger: they can literally just print money but they dont
[3:12:50] TheResinger: and i dont understand it
[3:12:52] Coulby: YEP
[3:12:59] Face_32: i agree, they tried to blue ball too much
[3:13:00] FearYang: people would only buy the skins they want if they put all the skins out there
[3:13:06] jojoh70: well skins i understand you have to stretch them out so every skin feels special and they sell more
[3:13:33] FearYang: cap people but this gentlemen ass skin and no one wants it
[3:13:38] FearYang: bought*
[3:13:44] Dagmoo: yeah i just quit finally too cuz my aura expired and i didnt feel like investing in another month
[3:13:45] Zeikoa: @humanshjake oof wyses, we had those deployed for some time long ago
[3:13:47] Face_32: i would have bought skins early if they had better ones, but now i hardly play the game and dont see myself spending any more money on it
[3:14:10] Coulby: untill this ark pass i didnt like any skin on my paladin, thanks to the ark pass i got a skin i like on my paladin,  was using the armor without skin danDespair
[3:14:12] FearYang: they literally getting money for skins that people wouldnt but if others are available
[3:14:13] Y0kaa: I have 6 different classes, no point in buying skins LUL
[3:14:18] jojoh70: i dont think the casual look will be popular in our release as much as in KOR
[3:14:18] Face_32: you will always see the newest skins right after they release tho
[3:14:20] FearYang: so they making more money this way
[3:14:25] IamWambo_: Are the skins coming out tomorrow all in the shop?
[3:14:43] AIex_0: neria wardrobe
[3:14:49] Coulby: YEP you can mix and match
[3:14:50] Venxuri: they probably want to generate some revenue from less popular skins that don't sell well before releasing the bangers
[3:14:53] Proxzyn: yup, it's all about sexy or casual wear. exact same in FF14. no one goes for the edgy big armor shit LUL
[3:14:54] victish0nor: ResidentSleeper
[3:14:56] IamWambo_: For gold?
[3:15:09] Nexhunter: yes
[3:15:16] Nexhunter: you will be able to sell them for gold
[3:15:19] humanshjake: @Zeikoa Everyone in IT refuses to use them, but we wont let our other collegues use anything else ^^
[3:15:25] Face_32: @Venxuri but if the bangers came out when they had 4x the playerbase they would have sold way more skins in the first couple months imo
[3:15:31] Zeikoa: @humanshjake YEP
[3:15:33] lennon7770: In KR its for royal crystals
[3:15:39] Dagmoo: @fearyang yeah but if they had sold skins to 4x the player base its a tough calculation @venxuri
[3:15:56] Dagmoo: if they released good skins right at launch
[3:15:59] marcus_sundsvall: ralle11HYPE
[3:16:09] FearYang: hard to determine player base with all the bots
[3:16:11] Nexhunter: cause we go through steam
[3:16:16] Nexhunter: not LA directly
[3:16:20] FearYang: plus skins gone bring them back anyways
[3:16:29] TheResinger: the mileage stuff was moved to the crystals you get from prime
[3:16:43] Dagmoo: @fearyang regardless at launch real player base was WAY higher
[3:16:58] Venxuri: @FearYang thats a far strech, I doubt anyone is coming back because of cute skins lol
[3:17:27] FearYang: @Venxuri content in general not a stretch skins and content are released at the same time
[3:17:34] Nexhunter: well Season 2 introduction
[3:17:37] AIex_0: maplestory fucking up was what saved it
[3:17:39] priam__: wow

[3:18:10] Asphoron: Maplestory still big though
[3:18:22] Coulby: they do
[3:18:24] Nexhunter: smilegate is smilegate
[3:18:27] Harmar: Asphoron very
[3:18:34] Coulby: smilegate and lost ark is smilegate rpg
[3:18:36] Nexhunter: smilegate rpg is technically the LA dev
[3:18:43] priam__: if its korean just assume everything is owned by samsung
[3:18:53] Nexhunter: nah they are solely owned @priam__
[3:19:02] Harmar: @priam__ LUL not wrong
[3:19:03] Nexhunter: yes
[3:19:05] BBQ1: very much so
[3:19:07] Harmar: yes
[3:19:13] Nexhunter: samsung is also Korea's weapon manufacturing company KEKW
[3:19:13] priam__: Nexhunter yeah on paper

[3:19:25] Zeikoa: samsung LG hyundai korean
[3:19:32] John222212: VoHiYo
[3:19:44] Nexhunter: that probably someone else
[3:19:44] O0erk0O: they account for like 80% of KR's GDP
[3:19:46] Harmar: there the top of the corpate food chain, there is a bunch but there the biggest
[3:20:16] lurking_2: I don't think that was samsung
[3:20:19] Nexhunter: but if you served in the korean military you had experienced samsung's military division production
[3:20:22] Allmostdone: nuts in a bag on a plate. Turn this bus around
[3:20:42] Venxuri: that cannot be the only reason right, I can't even imagine someone turning around a plane because of that lol
[3:20:42] O0erk0O: that story i believe was the daughter of the CEO of Korean Air iirc
[3:20:45] lurking_2: "Korean Air vice president Heather Cho (Korean name: Cho Hyun-ah), dissatisfied with the way a flight attendant served nuts on the plane, ordered the aircraft to return to the gate before takeoff."
[3:20:50] Venxuri: sounds insane
[3:21:11] Proxzyn: holy ...
[3:21:17] Nexhunter: sounds like her job tbh KEKW
[3:21:31] Vestitude: f yo nuts, gtfo my plane KEKW
[3:21:33] Allmostdone: there you go. Sound like a real problem
[3:21:33] Nexhunter: if the flight crew is shit better not be making a flight pepeLaugh
[3:21:43] Harmar: @lurking_2 never piss off the owners LUL
[3:21:50] Venxuri: ok, before takeoff, that sounds more believable lol I thought its like she asked to turn around in the air
[3:21:51] rNdOrchestra: Hyundai is korean, too.  As is LG.  Not as big as Samsung but there are some other big corps there.
[3:21:54] Ornaate: The sales of macadamia nuts in South Korea rose nearly 250 percent shortly after the incident NotLikeThis
[3:22:46] Allmostdone: do you have people running around with cyberdeck jacking into the corps?
