[2:41:38] hearttune: @CurtisDN_ I see, thanks
[2:41:44] CurtisDN_: the target block is for "bullseye" and the compass is for "country lode take me home"
[2:41:57] autum_mist_101: I thought it was because of a mad scientist who experimented on the villagers. But logically I guess not melting snow makes sense.

[4:14:19] shig_tv: the difference is that they are different types of bastion
[4:14:20] Novamb: where the gold is
[4:14:23] nikitaprivet: @zre_09 they're different
[4:14:23] ChloeFreakinB: I had to dip for a bit how did the last run end?
[4:14:24] CurtisDN_: the 4 bastion types are literally different in structure and where the blocks are placed
[4:14:24] shig_tv: that is an absurd question
[4:14:28] kiley504: @zre_09 their vibe
[4:14:30] CurtisDN_: yea shig
[4:14:33] Clawarae: the key difference is that it's not the same structure
[4:14:41] PacManMVC: thats like asking the difference between a desert village and a plains village
[4:14:41] CurtisDN_: like you have to have 0 game knowledge to not know how different they are
[4:14:56] zre_09: nuh uh
[4:14:56] gloncs: @zre_09 the difference is how nice the piglins are

[4:15:19] CurtisDN_: right but there are ways to learn that you can use google for and ways that you can use chat for
[4:15:22] castlebeki: @shig_tv facts
[4:15:22] gloncs: @Switchpalacecorner one is a stick one is cobblestone... common misconception they're the same
[4:15:24] CurtisDN_: that is a google.com question

[4:16:14] kiley504: forgot to turn the obby drop rat
[4:16:22] PacManMVC: idk if that was exactly your question but there you go
[4:16:22] madsenvy: rat
[4:16:28] shig_tv: yeah there are literally no similarities between them other than the name of the structure
[4:16:33] xanthous7: @isabelcoolaf time to tell them a fake answer
[4:16:35] nikitaprivet: the answer what makes bastions different would be too long for a chat message
[4:16:38] shig_tv: maybe triple chest ramparts too
[4:16:47] rachel__red: Scared

[4:35:04] penguinsandstuff: maybe
[4:35:16] FlaiFlai: You're really good at re-routing, e.g. getting the shipwreck during snowy was neat, because you could overlap iron
[4:35:18] the_mmx: you got great view?

[4:36:29] CurtisDN_: @aric5556 its not 1.17+
[4:36:31] rachel__red: @sh4dle 5Head
[4:36:34] gloncs: do you think it's easier to get a good seed for aa or rsg?
[4:36:44] CurtisDN_: (mojang changed that at some point, i think it was 1.17 but idk for sure)
[4:36:50] CurtisDN_: @gloncs this is rsg

[4:37:33] the_mmx: its not good enough unless you find 4 channeling Clueless
[4:37:51] Clawarae: Are some people catching up on fein's times in aa or not at all?
[4:37:51] Switchpalacecorner: i feel like the fact that you can get sub 2:30 pace every day means that the holy grail "once every 6 months" run is like a 2:15 now
[4:37:57] lompleg: RainbowPls
[4:37:57] Fossabot: RainbowPls
[4:37:58] Switchpalacecorner: sub 2:30 used to be the once every few months pace
[4:37:58] Fossabot: Wanna know when Feinberg is live??? Join the Discord: https://discord.gg/9gV2ZY6fvT
[4:38:10] FlaiFlai: Btw, i feel like a couple months ago Fein went for channeling more during first enchants
[4:38:16] penguinsandstuff: did we have a rare sub 30 end exit?
[4:38:16] joejoesun: hiii chat feinHi
[4:38:17] kot7k: damn already in another mid game, some crazy seeds lately
[4:38:31] FlaiFlai: and now he just high-rolls for temple or later in the run more
[4:38:35] FlaiFlai: but that might be me imagining things
[4:38:48] FlaiFlai: That might shave a whole minute off in the beginning on average
[4:38:49] penguinsandstuff: no you are 100% right flai
[4:38:50] CurtisDN_: first enchant channeling was never the meta
[4:38:58] FlaiFlai: No, I mean when first enchanting
[4:38:58] CurtisDN_: like, never ever lol
[4:39:01] FlaiFlai: i.e. pre fishkill
[4:39:12] penguinsandstuff: he even said "every run should be go for channelling is chest" or something like that
[4:39:13] FlaiFlai: trying to get it as book
[4:39:16] CurtisDN_: like just going for it off the table at this point at all?
[4:39:17] penguinsandstuff: in*
[4:39:17] CurtisDN_: i mean
[4:39:20] CurtisDN_: he looks for it
[4:39:25] gfire133: ur how?
[4:39:26] castlebeki: imagine if we could enchant boats and minecarts so they move faster
[4:39:27] CurtisDN_: but its never correct to force it
[4:39:28] BlookyCookie_: skipping looting 3 GIGACHAD
[4:39:30] gfire133: hoe?
[4:39:34] FlaiFlai: Yeah, but I feel like he's stopped enchanting longer to force it
[4:39:39] penguinsandstuff: @castlebeki penguin + boat Sadge
[4:39:42] CurtisDN_: its way better to roll for it once you have the trident
[4:39:50] CurtisDN_: cause then you can roll 2 things that can get channeling
[4:39:52] FlaiFlai: Yeah, I agree, I think this is a positive change
[4:39:54] CurtisDN_: so you want the levels to do that
[4:39:57] FlaiFlai: if I'm not imagining the change :D
[4:40:25] joejoesun: I enchanted my Honda accord that shit goes crazy when I’m speedrunning to work
[4:40:27] castlebeki: @penguinsandstuff i mean, we still dont know how that would have worked
