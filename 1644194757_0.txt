[1:35:09] Slymph: @Pticrix He'll be waiting long for that one monkaS

[1:42:57] BossHog6295: Hi @Giantwaffle
[1:43:21] Pe4enie: putting unequal amount of chickens while breeding doesn't do anything as only the lower value will be used
[1:43:32] nxusr: Waffle's now a chicken breeder
[1:43:42] NordESA: I've never really played modded Minecraft, how complicated is this one? KEKW
[1:43:44] kovankenobi: hopper pot
[1:43:52] DarkbuilderX: Could make a depot
[1:43:52] DemonicHell3: Could put a botany pot on top as well just for extra passive seeds
[1:43:55] daemonaedryn: @NordESA A lot simpler than most of the packs waffle plays
[1:43:56] Dynamic1237: craft wheat into seeds?
[1:43:59] Bahhman: Can one speed up the whats-the-name (the thing you make seeds in)?
[1:44:16] NordESA: Ok :)
[1:44:20] daemonaedryn: @NordESA A lot of packs add like 30 steps inbetween recipes that are usually easy, this one seems pretty straight forward
[1:44:33] Pe4enie: don't pause?
[1:44:36] Pe4enie: let them breed
[1:44:38] NordESA: I feel like some mods just add stuff to make things take longer for no reason.
[1:44:38] Pe4enie: oh well

[1:47:23] Nickonil: @NordESA well two ways to enjoy games as far as i see it, you either want to enjoy the moment, or you want to build towards moments, and modded minecraft is the latter
