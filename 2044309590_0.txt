[0:12:32] ashnix__: No no not for your health for the fact that you cleaned when you dud
[0:12:36] ashnix__: did*
[0:12:44] SimplyKaren: taxes

[0:14:18] Nfora: @zehqueen I tried robots for the floors. the vacuum is fine, but the mop is useless
[0:14:31] saran040: Yeeeessssss, so true!!
[0:14:39] Ben_Spacevulture: rcdKek
[0:14:45] zehqueen: @Nfora I don't like the rombots. I have too much crap on the floors
[0:14:52] Nfora: TubShroom. it keeps the hair out of the drain. works great.

[0:15:52] Artemis1013_: ours if going right now
[0:16:11] scalabrini29: they are amazing for pet hair
[0:16:19] saran040: Specially for floor with a rugs
[0:16:31] WhiskeyBravoLive: My boss was talking about his roomba this week. Its not really loud but since you generally run them at night when its quiet you hear them bump into everything as they run.
[0:16:31] TrueAnimatorAlt: we had an old rumba at my last placce it took us from sweeping every other day to once a week
[0:16:35] LEGOBOSS31: real
[0:16:35] Nfora: my place is a single floor, so the Roomba works well. it is fairly loud, but then so is a regular vacuum. it can run while I’m at work, so no worries
[0:17:00] jorwayblacknight: I never had a romba before. My mom made sure my siblings and I know how to mop and use a vacuum
[0:17:05] leahhh420: Yo pzhPUMP
[0:17:14] miko_atelo: Rombas are good for it not getting horribe, not good if you got pet that is not housetraines yet
[0:17:17] Eve_play: ask X33N, he used to have one and the poms have long hair
[0:17:18] Nfora: yeah I have to clean the tubshroom every couple of days. it’s better than snaking the drain though.
[0:17:19] SimplyKaren: Do huskies shed? Oh, Pete, you have not seen shedding until you have a nervous husky in a room
[0:17:29] scalabrini29: I am unsure about husky but they work well for labs
[0:17:42] WhiskeyBravoLive: The ghost making noise in the basement.. I get it lol
[0:17:52] SimplyKaren: SOOOO Much
[0:17:53] vibecisco70: I would be scared if I heard somthing bump into wall I would think some one broke in or somthing
[0:18:22] SimplyKaren: We have to sweep rooms between pets, but especially after a nervous shedder (a.k.a. all huskies--they're so dramatic)
[0:18:26] jorwayblacknight: My parents have a lab and a lab/golden mix and both of them shed a ton
[0:18:40] EnnaGirl: Tumbleweeds of fluff
[0:18:51] Zinoba: i manage to do those clumps with my own hair... LUL
[0:19:03] zehqueen: @SimplyKaren my friend had a husky who never met me before. After I left I swear I had a new sweater
[0:19:07] infer_n0: a bit ago
[0:19:21] saran040: The Ghost drives the rent down?! Haha
[0:19:24] WhiskeyBravoLive: Oh same. Mine just for some reason moved the ant trap I had in my kitchen this past week. Still haven't found it. lol

[0:19:56] infer_n0: enhanced was also on mobile
[0:19:59] lynx6008: How u been pete
[0:20:02] jorwayblacknight: @simplykaren my grandparents had a husky mix once and everytime I would visit them i would leave covered in husky fur
[0:20:35] infer_n0: i think the smart shuffle just replaced it
[0:20:51] Snowballover: they also used to have playlist radio which was good
[0:21:13] Tswizzleforlife: have you heard the new song bad omens and poppy released a couple days ago?
[0:21:28] TrueAnimatorAlt: I used to use enhance now i need to go back to people reccomending me music :(
[0:21:37] carcmpr: Google is the KING of that.  Holy crap
[0:21:56] Snowballover: and I would like the DJ feature if it didn't talk every 4 songs
[0:22:06] leahhh420: Recently I've been enjoying the daylist that it makes for you. It changes throughout the day based on your usual listening habits
[0:22:07] TrueAnimatorAlt: OMG im so tired of paying for spotify just to deal with adds in podcasts like yes i can skip them but im so tired of it

[0:24:17] lynx6008: Oooo
[0:24:20] manu_ash: Yoo
[0:24:23] WhiskeyBravoLive: No, they are doing the netflix thing of making people verify their "home" address. The notice was sent in an email and if you didn't respond in 7 days they kicked you from the family plan you were on and prevented you from getting on another family plan for a year.
[0:24:26] lynx6008: That's fast

[0:27:00] saran040: Hey, Just came back from Hbomb’s stream. He’s just starting Palworld, what did i miss.
[0:27:01] TrueAnimatorAlt: Dont be scared you wont notice it for 20 years or so
[0:27:20] infer_n0: it would probably take half a day to get it removed GoatEmotey
[0:27:20] lynx6008: Don't jinx it
[0:27:21] Nfora: that’s a normal feeling
[0:27:27] BradXCo: noooo self fulfilling prophecyyyyyy

[0:27:41] misky90501: misky90501 watched 7 consecutive streams this month and sparked a watch streak! pzhH
[0:28:00] Nfora: also, it absolutely hasn’t been smooth. the asbestos stuff has been a mess and you’ve been lucky it hasn’t been a bigger problem

[0:29:18] ashnix__: I fell into an iron rod and got a couple of stitches
[0:29:20] herefortheheresy: our water heater strung a leak and all the Sheetrock in our basement molded so we had to get it demoed and replace for like $4000
[0:29:28] carcmpr: Did you show kitchen progress, I had to "work" at work for a few minutes.
[0:29:28] TrueAnimatorAlt: wait did you say palworld plusies or am i imagining things while playing pal
[0:29:33] Weponwill: which ones?
[0:29:34] misky90501: The house I used to live in we were told it would take 4 weeks but they found more mold so that 4 week turned to 2and a half months
[0:29:56] zehqueen: Basically I had to get the basement redone and turned into my laundry room. Found out my entire foundation was screwed up and had to basically get a new pad for the house.
[0:30:16] xMrSnapsx: fucking lucky
[0:30:23] Snowballover: my dad when he was fixing our fence hit himself in the face with a sledgehammer and had to get 7 stitches above his eyebrow, it could have been worse tbh
[0:30:25] xMrSnapsx: jeez that sounds like an action movie
[0:30:27] jorwayblacknight: My base in Palwolrd got burned down so I rebuilt it all in stone

[0:31:51] xMrSnapsx: yea missing and sanding can take a while sometimes
[0:31:52] misky90501: We always knew we had mold just not how bad it was not only did it take forever it cost 20 more to fix then we were quoted
[0:31:56] xMrSnapsx: over a couple or few days
[0:32:03] saran040: Gonna*

[0:32:50] oliviabayko: Painting is so much easier before cabinets are in
[0:33:01] misky90501: We were quoted 40k ended up being 60k by the end
[0:33:14] saran040: Holy damn!
[0:33:24] el_guntz: fine hot pink then
[0:33:50] WhiskeyBravoLive: Take it back to the 70s. Color everywhere.

[0:34:11] Alamose: mold is no joke
[0:34:12] TrueAnimatorAlt: just burn the house down at that price
[0:34:18] drizzl2: older homes are so much better than some of these newer homes low key
[0:34:50] DaFluffyManz: yoooo
[0:34:52] el_guntz: the teal or like a blue ish isnt a bad shout

[0:36:01] el_guntz: its kinda funky
[0:36:02] EfilsGod: @RKeyTech I got watermelon to cook my food
[0:36:12] el_guntz: you could do a tile that mimics wood
[0:36:19] xMrSnapsx: I put waterproof hardwood in my father in laws kitchen
[0:36:21] misky90501: It was a 4 bedroom and large living room
[0:36:23] Snowballover: they have really nice vinyl flooring now that feels like wood
[0:36:27] RKeyTech: @efilsgod haha
[0:36:38] oliviabayko: The PVC planking is nice, can recommend
[0:36:46] misky90501: Yeah we sold it
[0:37:21] misky90501: Yeah but I grew up there I miss it my mom also grew up there
[0:38:25] misky90501: I go by it every so often and I have good memories
[0:38:28] saran040: Don't, it ruins a perfect memory
[0:39:06] ashnix__: That sounds sweet, the memory belongs to you and nothing can ruin that
[0:39:53] saran040: Yeah, it was a inconvenience for everyone but for you its a perfect flaw you love.
[0:40:53] saran040: My childhood house got leveled in a earthquake, i still miss it a lot.

[0:47:20] hyruelian: turn it up

[0:59:09] mohamm3d_aslam: I don't know shit about this game
[0:59:41] BlueOrSo: @mohamm3d_aslam its pokemon + ark + guns
[0:59:57] Nfora: on ground or on foundations?
[1:01:33] Shaharavramov12: do you think you should start working on ammo so you have it ready for later when you need it?
[1:01:41] BlueOrSo: uhhh
[1:01:44] BlueOrSo: water?
[1:01:52] el_guntz: good ole spit shine KEKW

[1:02:45] el_guntz: pete get the grapple gun so you can move while encumbered

[1:03:09] chippychops1: what’s your carry weight?
[1:03:29] FierceFireWolf1: CeraVe is just the god of the skincare world
[1:03:38] lynx6008: go with aleo vera, that's really good for skin if u wanna use any
[1:04:07] SammysLogic: CeraVe is so good
[1:04:08] FanIKR: is cerave that good? i'm tempted to buy them
[1:04:34] cistarza: my products are mostly from clinique, the smart repair serum and supercharged concentrate, and a good moisturizer
[1:04:36] SammysLogic: It depends on expenses and needs imo
[1:04:37] daang92: did you watch twitch rivals yesterday?
[1:04:56] TheOtherToby: Gl today Pete, I sleep now gn
[1:05:05] midnight_hail: i feel like skincare is hard to recommend because its so specific to your own skin you have to find what works for you
[1:05:08] mohamm3d_aslam: Will a chest in the sky still count as in the base?
[1:05:12] alyahos: I like neutrogena cause I have sensitive skin
[1:05:58] drak247: but the egs inside :c

[1:09:53] el_guntz: what shifting base location
[1:10:02] mohamm3d_aslam: So why taking down the base?
[1:10:16] Weponwill: low key letting players become team rocket
[1:10:19] Fortha2: Game looks good first time seeing it
[1:10:22] drak247: wait for spehere for capturing other players xd
[1:10:26] GundleTv: gives alot of ark vibes with pvp in the game
[1:10:49] Jundinator: People better mod in Jessie and James outfits
[1:10:52] Jundinator: LUL

[1:12:10] Jundinator: I forgor my Kappa
[1:12:16] j4kefr0mst8f4rm: i thought they shot it down because the guy was charging for it? i could be wrong tho
[1:12:17] bone_bytes: I mean stuff like Infinite fusion has existed forever
[1:12:50] Jundinator: @bone_bytes yeah but that's non-commercial. Nobody's making money off of it
[1:12:51] xNoFl3x: Hey Pete :)
[1:12:59] CSquared_1: one in-game day is how long it takes for nodes to respawn
[1:13:16] Odd1ch: im seeing so much negative opinions on this game. is it actually any good, chat?
[1:13:48] el_guntz: pete what about foundations off the cliffside near the planting plots?
[1:13:56] NTRnightmare35: @odd1ch I've only seen good opinions
[1:14:00] ACE_RC_: ARK acendent when?
[1:14:04] Jundinator: I like it
[1:14:08] Odd1ch: @NTRnightmare35 funny how the algorithm algorithms
[1:14:31] el_guntz: expanding the stone foundation area
[1:14:37] leahhh420: DinoDance
[1:14:37] j4kefr0mst8f4rm: @Odd1ch it is good, a lot of the negative opinions are unjustified
[1:14:56] Odd1ch: @Odd1ch it kinda looks it too. thats the reason im curious
[1:15:03] BO55PL8: another streamer found that making the stairs from the top down makes the pathing work better for the pals, not sure whether worth mentioning
[1:15:08] Nfora: finally. hot water has been out for 3 days and hey just got it restored
[1:15:20] Jundinator: bonsAiRave bonsAiRave bonsAiRave bonsAiRave himiJammer himiJammer himiJammer himiJammer himiJammer himiJammer himiJammer

[1:16:24] Jundinator: So where did everyone else end up putting their bases pete?
[1:16:42] CerealRaid: no doubt i have played games like Ark that isnt in early access with alot more bugs
[1:16:59] Odd1ch: @el_guntz truthing
[1:17:15] PolarJaym: you did
[1:17:17] j4kefr0mst8f4rm: @Odd1ch its not really much like pokemon at all. the only similar thing really is the capturing mechanic. if you like ark im sure u will love this game
[1:17:20] alyahos: you did
[1:17:39] Shaharavramov12: will the wall prevent the ore node from respawning?

[1:25:17] xMrSnapsx: have you tried seeing how much damage he does when he’s in your party and you assign him to it?

[1:25:42] j4kefr0mst8f4rm: perfect timing for this song LUL
[1:25:49] alyahos: song is perfect
[1:26:03] Sinashira: When you carried him I could just see Mario 64 bowser spinning to to trow in the boss fights :D
[1:26:12] mohamm3d_aslam: They should implement a whip In this game
[1:26:23] xMrSnapsx: that’s what I’m saying, it’s weird. because mine will go through it a lot quicker than that
[1:26:45] drak247: maybe the problem is that he wants you to feed him
[1:27:47] j4kefr0mst8f4rm: i think hes bugged tbh. hes doing way to little dmg to that metal
[1:27:53] alyahos: is it bugged ?
[1:28:02] mohamm3d_aslam: He's definitely bugged out
[1:28:08] KluEvo: Is the food not compatible with him or something? this is silly
[1:28:10] Flowerlog: LUL very hard worker i tell you
[1:28:12] kylekst: They are bugged slack had the same problem
[1:28:22] arcanajinx: they only eat to half their hunger bar. so gotta have something more filling in the feeder
[1:28:31] GundleTv: boy in hungry
[1:28:41] GundleTv: is*
[1:29:06] arcanajinx: Beyblade action
[1:29:06] mohamm3d_aslam: One thing I have heard is that the pathing is a bitch in this game
[1:29:52] kylekst: He had better luck with dumud if you have one
[1:30:05] CSquared_1: hand feed the boy by putting him in your party
[1:30:28] arcanajinx: once you unlock the better farms, itll be better
[1:31:07] CSquared_1: eat some chicken
[1:31:26] knifeking2104: knifeking2104 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months! 
[1:31:51] arcanajinx: I think there's a way to power up the Pals work speed as well.
[1:31:55] KluEvo: build a tavern there! or maybe a statue?
[1:32:01] Nfora: you feel sick. we already established that.
[1:32:11] drak247: @arcanajinx in the statue with pall souls right ?
[1:32:14] WheezyWatcher: i was in a call teaching someone how to crochet. hows palworld going?
[1:32:33] arcanajinx: @drak247 I believe so
[1:33:31] kylekst: Try dumud if you have him
[1:34:20] WheezyWatcher: are we moving base?
[1:36:52] mohamm3d_aslam: 3 inches? That's a LOT
[1:37:13] KluEvo: maybe platforms
[1:37:26] CSquared_1: would have to be foundations
[1:38:21] CodeTeemix: hey chat and pete, how's it going. also a question for streamer, have you gotten the grapplehook yet? feel like it'd be a life changer for your style of base specifically
[1:38:45] Nfora: is there an automation for pal fluids?
[1:39:06] el_guntz: breading and killing fuack
[1:39:55] MysticEagle_4: What did I miss why is he moving things
[1:40:10] Nfora: so… to make a cement base, you need to be a mass murderer. ok.
[1:40:37] KluEvo: that looks sick!
[1:41:07] Nfora: it’s fine, we have a new base theme
[1:42:22] Shaharavramov12: is the king of the forest inside?
[1:42:38] xMrSnapsx: the real benefit to having one is that it will still move you even when you are encumbered
[1:43:08] CodeTeemix: basic one has small range and 10sec cooldown, but it is still a lifechanger, especially for moving large amounts of ore,stone,wood ect ect, feels a little cheap to do that but its a major life changer
[1:43:09] KluEvo: nobody needs to know that it got moved :)
[1:43:21] tymac300: tymac300 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 13 months, currently on a 12 month streak! yo!
