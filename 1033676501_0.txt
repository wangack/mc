[0:12:24] StOrMy1100: It wasn't the gearbox tho
[0:12:31] Tebberino: apparently it wasnt a gearbox issue that caused him to retire, not buying it
[0:12:32] sogerr: the gearbox was not the problem, they said even if they changed it it wouldnt have helped because the problem was on left read transmission
[0:12:34] Motomasher: Driveshaft
[0:12:35] Traupick: @giantwaffle what's a grand slam or whatever
[0:12:43] Askjong: drive shaft left side

[0:13:39] StOrMy1100: By changing the gearbox they probably wouldn't have seen the broken left rear drive shaft
[0:13:39] FAUSTnw: If Leclerc wouldn't crash he would lose pole, Max was behind with -0.2 on time

[1:33:51] johnshepherd104: This is a programming pattern you learn in college
[1:33:54] CMCh4se: the characters are unique?
[1:33:54] Opsidill: fun
[1:34:00] johnshepherd104: Good luck
[1:34:03] Chronoes: Python has stdlib implementation for permutations but it's worth to invent it on your own too
[1:34:07] CoolReal: Make this list and then set(list) KEKW
[1:34:19] lazyhot: 2 for loops and done
[1:34:28] Ebonmourn: lol python has a standary library function to generate permutations
[1:34:44] omar_i_: do you want hints on how to resolve it waffle?
[1:34:46] HostileLogOut: wouldnt you just need to compare it? and start with one letter at a time? so start with the first letter then second and so on?
[1:34:52] Opsidill: you just need 2 for loops though
[1:34:52] johnshepherd104: Yeah this is a simply python bash
[1:34:53] CoolReal: I basically solved half the problem
[1:34:57] Ebonmourn: yes
[1:34:58] punkgeek: It's not hard if you use an array of char
[1:35:12] ravi981: or use substrings
[1:35:14] omar_i_: think of stack and traversing the array for each stack item
[1:35:17] Chronoes: itertools.permutations is the function
[1:35:31] Chronoes: ye
[1:35:33] Larklen: yes
[1:35:35] DOOMinion: you can loop through each character in a string so 2 for loops are enough, you can use the index of the char
[1:35:35] johnshepherd104: Use the function, or learn the pattern...
[1:36:12] officialzip: you rang?
[1:36:16] Ebonmourn: yah its the stdlib for all functions to operate on all iterable objects in python
[1:36:17] K4nteh: its gets a relativly easy problems, when u use a recursive function
[1:36:38] PTK9: so dictionary
[1:36:42] i_W4tCH_i: Why dont use a dictionary
[1:36:55] IvanGodlike: first of all, zip returns a generator and not a list :P

[1:37:34] Chronoes: unique keys*
[1:37:39] johnshepherd104: hint: The shortest answer lines of code wise involves using a stack and popping off permutations

[1:38:05] Kohta_Sama: peepoBlonket
[1:38:24] boomerbrown: you could use it to compare time and price

[1:38:42] MrMoneybagMan: @kayle_chips LUL
[1:38:43] johnshepherd104: Linked List is the nicest struct here IMO
[1:38:53] PTK9: tea with honey
[1:39:06] Larklen: mammai mia
[1:39:18] johnshepherd104: This is a introduction to recursion problem btw
[1:39:20] johnshepherd104: Very common
[1:39:28] omar_i_: JohnShepherd104 for one traverse and avoiding repeated results stack is the way to go
[1:39:30] Larklen: I know we still in recovery, but seeing +42% for ETH still feels nice Kreygasm

[1:41:03] Kohta_Sama: monkaHmm
[1:41:06] Quivering_Dreams: ooo blast furnace
[1:41:25] Larklen: I think some of that will be counteracted by hodlers jumping in for cheap ETH but yeah, we'll still see another dip from the people selling. My guess anyways

[1:44:15] Larklen: How is that guy have $1 million in DOGE? Easy, he put in $20 a few weeks ago Kappa
[1:44:16] AquaXV: But I can still cash out original input, so technically I am not down anything
[1:44:18] Mikael_x: It is to many coins, What is polygon for coins
[1:44:50] kenshin2666: then you hold till you want/need

[1:53:50] keittehvan: generating hydrogen is still very inefficient
[1:53:50] punkgeek: Hydrogen power is tough mostly for transporting it around to where people would refuel
[1:53:54] PossibleScam: True. Just another option.

[1:56:02] K3ll06s: Is a tank full of hydrogen worth then a hughe ass battery, that have to be disollved for weeks if it fails
[1:56:05] Helo_KiX: it depends on the pressure in the container but yes I think its gas
[1:56:07] DarkSpooon: Anything energy dense is scary to store. That's the nature of energy
[1:56:12] derwolff85: But to be far, the netherlands already have over 70.000 public charging stations... so we are prepared for EV cars :P

[1:57:15] Quivering_Dreams: i mean if we get fusion working we might be able to MAKE lithum
[1:57:17] QwyIl: Cobalt and nickel are harder atm iirc
[1:57:18] Allmostdone: There are big upcoming battery tech changes they have not made it to market
[1:57:24] Nexhunter: @Giantwaffle to get more lithium mined/extracted we just need to tell the military we need more lithium based bombs timmacLAUGH
[1:57:28] Zoney1: would it be too cumbersome to move your whole base to lost cities/overworld to avoid having to go back and forth?
[1:57:32] NordESA: Happy Monday everyone widepeepoHappy
[1:57:35] Gelil: But, as a side effect, those involved in the accident would have reduced anxiety and depression
[1:57:43] MrAppl3: widepeepoHappy
[1:57:45] Nexhunter: yea like lithium KEKW
[1:57:45] orillion: @Giantwaffle its used for wind turbines Kappa
[1:57:48] pyhispahis: i think you're right yea
[1:57:51] SchroTN: Plutonium is used in the RTGs that power stuff like the Pluto explorer
[1:57:56] Sacratoy: thorium reactors baby
[1:58:10] Quivering_Dreams: plutonium is a product of putting DU in a breeder reactor and bombarding it with neutrons
[1:58:10] Moobot: You can find Waffle's Youtube channel here - https://youtube.com/giantwaffle
[1:58:10] fisering1: Do you think we will se a battery revolution soon? I think that would solve a lot of our environmental issues @giantwaffle
[1:58:15] DarkSpooon: We sacrifice our plutonium stores to the god Pluto. He grants us a sick passive
[1:58:16] NordESA: Tired af after walk and food, probably time to play some Days Gone danHmm
[1:58:27] SchroTN: I live near Oak Ridge and have several friends that work there.  It's right KEKW
[1:58:34] orillion: plutonium-238 i think
[1:58:43] Allmostdone: solid state batteries if they can get it large and mass produced
[1:58:54] dabeda1: had my shot yesterday and felt like i forgot how to sleep all night today, feverdreams and shit KEKW
[1:58:55] somepalegamer: Anyone else get anxiety before going to get a haircut?
[1:59:01] ninopanda: @Giantwaffle i cant wait till wednesday, i get to go camping for 12 days!!
[1:59:17] Nexhunter: we can just use lithium deuteride in our cars Kappa
[1:59:18] johnshepherd104: I use things that dont exist all the time
[1:59:18] Sacratoy: we're more than a decade out
[1:59:23] Quivering_Dreams: the other common one is uranium 238
[1:59:24] Sacratoy: i feel
[1:59:26] CommanderUrsus: pu-239 was an interesting movie
[1:59:27] Sacratoy: i'm no expert though
[1:59:34] Samelie: solid state batteries have been a thing since the 70s
[1:59:40] strawwwwww: toyota will use solid state no?
[1:59:46] somepalegamer: Why not just create a new element like tony stark?
[1:59:55] Allmostdone: They exist just not mass made
[1:59:55] Sacratoy: I'm too old and jaded to get hype about promised tech revolutions
[2:00:20] PossibleScam: There literally are working on this now, with a few comps ones leading the way.
[2:00:22] Gelil: Don't SSB require a constant trickle of current?
[2:00:25] Archelonde: I swear I've been hearing about graphene and solid state batteries for years and nothing comes from it
[2:00:33] Rob_Kebab: The battery market is gonna boom and research will increase to find better tech
[2:00:37] Nexhunter: dendrites mehdiREE
[2:00:38] orillion: @Giantwaffle ideally solid state gets around the cell decay from repeated cycles
[2:00:39] PossibleScam: Correct.
[2:00:40] Hazeeed_: ello ello
[2:00:52] Samelie: i just watched a yt video like 5 mins long explaining the difference and it seemd to be super good for phones compared to what we use now
[2:00:59] Sacratoy: the next big thing is some tech in a corporate or university lab somewhere in early development
[2:01:02] Larklen: KEKW
[2:01:04] PossibleScam: Everyday we get closer and closer to Ghost in the Shell.
[2:01:11] Allmostdone: need a new battery jut cut on off your old one
[2:01:13] Mike190Twitch: Xd
[2:01:15] Quivering_Dreams: aluminum air batteries PepLaugh
[2:01:16] Dylo321: Pepega
[2:01:21] CoolReal: At least you have a lot of trapdoors down
[2:01:33] orillion: @Quivering_Dreams what about potatos Kappa renewable
[2:01:36] Nexhunter: chat we just need to harnass the power of lithium dueterite in our cars and we will be fineeeee Kappa
[2:01:42] DarkSpooon: How long until we can seperate hydrogen and oxygen inside a car and drive around on hydrogen?
[2:01:47] WGG25: what's your power gen look like?
[2:02:06] xLas: Fun fact: The RTG in the voyager probes have gone from 500W generated power to ~300W due to the short half-life of Plutonium 238
[2:02:06] thomasausen: can you set your me system to number of items ?
[2:02:09] orillion: @DarkSpooon you use more energy to make the hydrogen
[2:02:11] 1killersquirrel: So you say that Solid State Batteries will replace Disk Batteries, like they did with Hard Disks? Kappa
[2:02:12] Allmostdone: they can do that now @DarkSpooon
[2:02:18] NemesisXKL: @DarkSpooon wont happen so fast, electrolyses is energy expensive
[2:02:23] podwe: waffle u see Lirik play Powerwash sim yesterday, looks pretty Pog gluPog tewaPog
[2:02:32] Chronoes: power the electrolysis with diesel Kappa
[2:02:37] Sacratoy: the future is mechanical batteries
[2:02:40] orillion: NotLikeThis
[2:02:43] DarkSpooon: Solar powered electoryses Pog
[2:02:56] Apparentthreat: Where are the milk engines at Kappa
[2:02:59] Poochie18: For a long while, Ford was researching and developing an engine that ran off water.
[2:03:06] Allmostdone: we are going back to the Flintstone cars
[2:03:08] CoolReal: Use a Crafting Calculator, it's pretty good
[2:03:10] ruccoa: I think the next major step in battery tech will be ways of recycling them
[2:03:19] Sacratoy: true ruc
[2:03:20] orillion: @DarkSpooon just need "gas" stations with a wind turbine/solar to build up reserves them self on site
[2:03:23] inorganic: @Sacratoy like magnetic flywheels?
[2:03:26] boomerbrown: they got the section stacked @Giantwaffle
[2:03:38] orillion: Kappa
[2:03:46] Apparentthreat: orillion storing electricity long-term is tricky and expensive
[2:03:47] Sacratoy: @inorganic, like gravity batteries
[2:03:49] Allmostdone: flywheels are just anti- graviy tach
[2:03:54] Tabakhase: 1 of 100 gasstations can do that - if even
[2:04:00] Stitched_BoosterYT: No, that's exactly how it works!
[2:04:02] ruccoa: gravity batteries will be useful for that kind of stuff
[2:04:06] orillion: @Apparentthreat hydrogen
[2:04:07] Tabakhase: KEKW
[2:04:10] 1killersquirrel: In a serious note, one of the reasons companies don't invest that much in development of new batteries is because it might be cheaper to just develop the infrastructure for recharging and will serve multiple purposes.
[2:04:21] orillion: @Apparentthreat not electricity :)
[2:04:22] Tabakhase: triACTUALLY vertical turbines
[2:04:24] PossibleScam: I know right. LUL
[2:04:25] Sacratoy: use energy to suspend a weight and draw power from allowing that weight to decend
[2:04:27] quazaka: How far are you away from AE?
[2:04:29] PyromooseTV: @Giantwaffle do you believe in the UFOs they are peddling now, how long until humans have a "new" propulsion system
[2:04:31] DarkSpooon: Less effecient than drilling, pumping, and refining? Maybe right now but in the future we'll look back and laugh at that ineffeciency.
[2:04:34] Allmostdone: Cars that run on wind power?
[2:04:38] SmokyMtnRed: I am trying to find an introduction video for this pack to show someone what it is all about. They are new to MC in general and are not interested in it, but when I talk about this pack they are interested in it. LUL

[2:09:35] Mike190Twitch: 1 Mississippi.. 2 Mississippi
[2:09:37] killerpaul: @obylix the sugar cane is on Snad instead of sand. a redstone signal to the snad increaes the growth speed
[2:09:38] Rob_Kebab: pepeSmoke damn that was my last one Sadge
[2:09:44] SmokyMtnRed: Just feel a 10-15min overview video of this pack would be useful to explain the depth in a brief manner, if possible
[2:09:54] Apparentthreat: Mike190Twitch probably took way longer to type that LUL
[2:10:01] CoolReal: Number of items is the natural order of the universe

[2:16:47] somlic: hi
[2:16:47] Desszo: No, you were there and you haven't bought any KEKW
[2:16:47] Rob_Kebab: Of course
[2:16:47] Gelil: They are both are just going to say "Yes"
[2:16:49] punkgeek: It's only ONE question and you need to get directions
[2:16:53] Stitched_BoosterYT: You just complicated it
[2:16:54] RenegadeWizard: "Which one of you is the liar?"
[2:16:54] mkspgti: whats 1+1
[2:16:55] BaTu016: i wouldnt
[2:16:56] somlic: im zak
[2:16:58] CtrlShiftR: I hate money Kappa
[2:16:59] Desszo: but not everybody did
[2:17:01] Kevincav: yeah, people even brought it up to me and I didn't.  I would have probably sold at like $200 though
[2:17:01] The_Stone_One: Genie's are known to hate technology
[2:17:05] Rsftwin2: only if they knew what happens after
[2:17:06] AquaXV: Why would a genie need money?
[2:17:07] Sentinel1_9: @Giantwaffle one only lies, say your name then ask what your name is KEKW
[2:17:07] somlic: his son
[2:17:09] DarkSpooon: A genie doesn't need money!

[2:17:15] MoopCo: "Does 1+1 equal 2?"
[2:17:18] PxlSauce: you still don't know the right way
[2:17:19] Mazari_: so which road do you go down after that question? LUL
[2:17:27] Berrog: Would you lie to me ?
[2:17:29] Gelil: "How big is my pp?"
[2:17:31] DarkSpooon: Ask the Genie "What's my name"?
[2:17:34] onkelkonkel: But that would change your today life, and you would maybe not be alive anymore.
[2:17:47] podwe: stargate gave 25 btc as prizes in 2009
[2:17:50] JerryLubrano: what would the other genie say is the correct path? and then you take the other one
[2:17:58] punkgeek: ^^^^
[2:18:03] Pine_Noir: Ask one of them which path the other would say to take
[2:18:04] RenegadeWizard: @Giantwaffle "Which one of you is the liar?"
[2:18:07] Retalia2: @Giantwaffle if one can only tell the truth and one can only lie, ask them a question you know the answer to
[2:18:10] SmokyMtnRed: They have horrible attitudes after being in that lamp for such a long time
[2:18:27] kskskskskskskssss: ask like 2+2 ?
[2:18:27] CoolReal: Can't be a subjective question
[2:18:27] pyhispahis: never trust a genie
[2:18:28] punkgeek: If you ask what the other genie would say then you either ask the liar who gives you the wrong path, or you ask the truth teller who would tell you where the liar would go (the wrong path)
[2:18:28] galaxy_berry: samurai jack had this figured out come on man
[2:18:28] MoopCo: its from the film labyrinth lmao
[2:18:30] DarkSpooon: @RenegadeWizard Wouldn't they both point at the other?
[2:18:30] Larklen: @RenegadeWizard that wouldn't lead to anything though monkaHmm the liar would point to the other genie and the one telling the truth would point back to the other one
[2:18:32] LordDynom: Ask them which one of the two is the liar?
[2:18:38] Gelil: Ask a question you know is true.
[2:18:39] parabellum031: you are just as i remember
[2:18:50] DarkSpooon: @giantwaffle Ask the Genie "What's my name"?
[2:18:54] Rsftwin2: @LordDynom "not me"
[2:18:56] CoolReal: Asking who is the liar will lead to both of them saying they aren't
[2:18:57] punkgeek: "Which path would the other genie tell me to take" is the answer
[2:19:04] ThatWeirdoGuy: Guys the riddle only allows you to ask one question
[2:19:09] Helo_KiX: you need to find out what path to take not which one is telling the truth, you only get one question
[2:19:13] Pine_Noir: @Giantwaffle Ask one of them which path the other would say to take
[2:19:13] The_Stone_One: Do you hate having cosmic powers and you're only a glorified road sign?
[2:19:16] hawks_sa: if u had a time machine, bitcoin would be your lowest priority
[2:19:17] punkgeek: If you ask the liar which path the truth telling genie would take it will lie and give you the wrong path
[2:19:22] Nathanc100: how many sides do cubes have?
[2:19:23] Ulikefishsticks: Ask which direction is the correct, they would both point the to correct one, would they not?
[2:19:28] philipkatis: Make a truth table.
[2:19:28] ruccoa: that's the answer yeah
[2:19:29] obylix: and then do oposite
[2:19:30] BaTu016: its a paradox
[2:19:32] punkgeek: If you ask the truth genie they'll tell you which path the lying genie would say, which is also the wrong path
[2:19:35] Larklen: "Is Zero Two the best waifu?"
[2:19:38] MediocreStream: But what if the lying one used reversed psychology?
[2:19:40] Stitched_BoosterYT: @Nathanc100 that's a good one too
[2:19:44] produkteriswf: @Larklen yes
[2:19:44] Rsftwin2: no then he can just say "this one" and your screwed
[2:19:45] DarkSpooon: OH, I thought we were finding who was lying
[2:19:49] kskskskskskskssss: Not sure if i get it, cant you ask a simples question? what is my name, 2+2
[2:19:51] Helo_KiX: @ulikefishsticks You can only ask one of them the question not both
[2:19:51] fanta_x_thomas: Ask them to show you their own door then which ever one they point to is the correct path
[2:19:51] trabadam: you ask if one of them IS a lair . Lair would say "no", which is false
[2:19:56] TelRehiad: basically a nand gate, no?
[2:19:58] punkgeek: It's one question, chat
[2:19:59] Yemtron: When do you plan on playing around with python waffle? :)
[2:20:04] imShnaz: OH I GET IT
[2:20:04] Gelil: Its a discrete math problem.
[2:20:06] MIICUTICO: PepoThink
[2:20:09] Ulikefishsticks: Ah, TnBHelo that makes it much more difficult, thought it was one each haha.
[2:20:11] Tabakhase: csgoskins or bitcoin in 2010 bamThink
[2:20:14] RenegadeWizard: @Giantwaffle @DarkSpooon @Larklen The Liar would point to the Honest one. The honest one would point to themselves. Then you ask the honest one "Which Path?"
[2:20:15] Chronoes: that's the standard answer to the question yes
[2:20:17] podwe: can sum1 explain this, ask Siri "how many weeks until 2021?" and it says 32 weeks! r we still in 2020?
[2:20:17] BasedLemur: It does, they will always tell you the wrong path in that case
[2:20:18] obylix: yea but you have to do the oposite of the answer
[2:20:20] podwe: try it@
[2:20:21] AtchTwoOh: "would the other genie say you always speak the truth", you always have true and a false statement, so you just invert the answer
[2:20:27] BasedLemur: So you just take the path they don't say
[2:20:28] ruccoa: and then you do the opposite
[2:20:29] JerryLubrano: you know the bad one the, and take the other path
[2:20:29] Pine_Noir: yes, but then you have to take the other path
[2:20:31] killerpaul: @kskskskskskskssss that uses up your 1 question and you still dont know which path is correct
[2:20:31] Helo_KiX: both will tell you the wrong path so you take the other one
[2:20:35] MUHFUGGIN: that's it you win waffleH
[2:20:36] Nopeaus: they should both tell you the same path, then u take the opposite one yea
[2:20:37] ZyianDev: this is a classic puzzle there's youtube videos
[2:20:40] WolfKnight85: Haha you wrote patter = Boobs on Danish
[2:20:43] Mapleton: i feel like you are overthinking this
[2:21:00] kiddofdeath: @Mapleton what would u ask?
[2:21:04] hawks_sa: which path is least successful?
[2:21:05] DarkSpooon: @RenegadeWizard Nah, liar would lie and point to the truth. Truth would tell the truth and point to the liar.
[2:21:07] Helo_KiX: @giantwaffle exactly, they will both give you the wrong path, so now you know which one is correct
[2:21:09] Larklen: @RenegadeWizard why would the honest one point to themselves when asked "which one is the liar". The premise is one always lies and one always tells the truth, and there is only one question to be asked.
[2:21:11] BeastboySAW: Your question would have to include your destination. Djinni don’t know where you live.
[2:21:12] Rsftwin2: they'd both reply with "this one"
[2:21:19] Stitched_BoosterYT: This is why you couldn't solve the code yesterday, because you're thinking of it too deep
[2:21:20] RevengeLetsPlay: i would say no, so i dont mess with Space/Time discisions i do in the future of 2010 Kappa
[2:21:22] Mapleton: @Mapleton I would shoot them both and let god sort it out EZ
[2:21:38] Gelil: KKona Mapleton
[2:21:50] Chronoes: if correct path is left, liar will say the other will say right (wrong path). truth guy will say also right, which is wrong
[2:21:52] BasedLemur: The truth genie would say the lying genie tells you to take the wrong path, the lying genie would say the truth genie tells you to take the wrong path as well
[2:21:52] Invalidm_: @Mapleton did you just @ yourself susHmm
[2:22:02] Sacratoy: the liar would say the opposite of what the truthful one would say, and the truthful one would say what the liar would say, so its always the opposite
[2:22:05] Mapleton: @Invalidm_ it's how the reply system works
[2:22:10] Chronoes: I've heard this problem once already, and I remember the answer KEKW
[2:22:11] Traupick: if the path was right the truther would say the other genie would say left and the liar would say he would say left
[2:22:12] Helo_KiX: no I've heard it before many times
[2:22:18] Drunten1337: oooh omnifactory skyblock!!! I've been gone a while and now I come back to a great pack!
[2:22:18] Moobot: You can sub to Waffle by clicking this neat link -> twitch.tv/giantwaffle/subscribe

[2:22:29] omar_i_: quick chat, google: smart
[2:22:32] Sacratoy: i hadn't heard of this one
[2:22:35] AquaXV: If there are 2 living beings I would ask; "Are you alive?"
[2:22:38] Sacratoy: it was fun to think about it
[2:22:42] ak1732: the valorant master tournament is so pg right now. the production is insane
[2:22:42] NordESA: what is google? danDerp
[2:22:46] Helo_KiX: I didn't say anything until someone else gave it away LUL
[2:22:54] Stitched_BoosterYT: You just ask him something you know it's true, cuz otherwise, you'll be stuck with undecissevenes
[2:22:57] Retalia2: @Giantwaffle when asked "which path would the other tell me to take" the one telling the truth would point to the side the liar told you to take (the wrong side) and  the one lying would tell you the opposite of what the true one is (the wrong side) so you go to the opposite side that they tell you
[2:22:59] RenegadeWizard: @Giantwaffle I guess you could just ask them "Are you a Genie?"
[2:23:12] AquaXV: Did crypto explode in Feb 2021?
[2:23:15] kiddofdeath: is crypto still going down
[2:23:16] AtchTwoOh: "would the other genie say investing in bitcoin in 2008 is Pog"?
[2:23:18] PureSpider: have we hit rock bottom? or going lower?
[2:23:19] Chronoes: @RenegadeWizard it wouldn't tell you the correct path though
[2:23:28] kennycraig: @Drunten1337 it's a void world, he teleports to overworld to gather stuff
[2:23:29] Flobu_: nice same weather in your minecraft as for me here in RL
[2:23:40] Pine_Noir: @RenegadeWizard yeah, but you can only ask one question. wouldn't tell you the path to take with that question
[2:23:41] RenegadeWizard: @Chronoes But then you know who to ask that to.
[2:23:42] BasedLemur: You have $40,000 worth of Dogecoin. If you take the path on the left, Elon tweets. If you take the path on the right, he doesn't. Which path do you take?
[2:23:42] vespucchi: @kiddofdeath having a small pullback before another drop
[2:23:49] Zornd: if you had to estimate how much minecraft coal or coal variant over your gaming life, how much would that be?
[2:23:51] DarkSpooon: @RenegadeWizard You're trying to find the correct path not the liar. You only get one question in total.
[2:23:51] bEC69_: what crypto do you keep an eye on on your graphs? @Giantwaffle
[2:24:05] Drunten1337: @KennyCraig I know I just call it a skyblock pack since you play moste of the early game in skyblock
[2:24:11] BaTu016: 5Head
[2:24:12] Chronoes: @RenegadeWizard you only get one question, that's the limit
[2:24:14] Helo_KiX: @renegadewizard you can only ask one of them one question and you need to know the correct path from that one question
[2:24:23] kennycraig: @Drunten1337 ah, right.. true
[2:24:29] punkgeek: It's a single question so you have to get something about the path in there
[2:24:30] BasedLemur: Oh yea, mine was mostly a joke
[2:24:32] Rob_Kebab: What would happen if the truth genie says the right path and the lie genie says the wrong path because he is lying about what the truth genie will choose
[2:24:52] Venxuri: lignite is another type of coal
[2:24:56] hawks_sa: what happened to the roblox stocks? you buy any?
[2:24:58] Tiggaboo: lignite what?
[2:25:01] Kohta_Sama: Lignite more like ligmaite Kappa
[2:25:04] Mike190Twitch: Ligma? Kappa
[2:25:05] PureSpider: ligma?
[2:25:09] punkgeek: Whichever genie you ask, you'll get the wrong path. Truth genie tells you what lie genie says, lie genie lies about what truth genie says.
[2:25:20] The_Holas: ligma coal? Kappa
[2:25:28] WGG25: you can centrifuge charcoal dust to get coal dust
[2:25:31] pupupuputter: it found lignite last time with the rare setting on
[2:25:33] Stitched_BoosterYT: "Gotta mine more coal I guess, wait I have no program called coal mine...oh" #cryptoeffect
[2:25:34] NoisyPlays: what app do you use for crypt
[2:25:34] punkgeek: It dated
[2:25:36] punkgeek: *dared
[2:25:49] WGG25: wait nevermind, it's carbon dust
[2:25:49] Helo_KiX: @rob_kebab You ask them what the other genie will say, they will both give the wrong path as the answer. So you know its the other path.
[2:26:01] SmokyMtnRed: FInally added autosmelt to a diamond hammer in early game this time
[2:26:22] PureSpider: can you not make the miners yet?
[2:26:25] fapohogu: there is a lot of coal ore there
[2:26:59] podwe: ttfn for now oinkLurk buttonLurk rebelSephirothLurk tewaLurk
[2:27:06] Venxuri: did you mine the whole coal vein? you have a huuuge one i remember
[2:27:11] fapohogu: waffle please i know what is coal ;-;
[2:27:17] Kohta_Sama: these are like, 1.18 veins LULW
[2:27:20] Venxuri: if you have lignite
[2:27:23] kennycraig: try the other vein
[2:27:23] Venxuri: you have a coal one
[2:27:32] botmaniac: tah dah!

[2:30:53] Kohta_Sama: imagine being on those platforms
[2:30:55] Kohta_Sama: monkaS
[2:30:56] botmaniac: yeah but the trick is stopping it from moving
[2:31:15] BasedLemur: From what I remember, the people who operate the radios also need to deal with about half a second of lag between speaking and being heard by whoever operates the crane
[2:31:16] Retalia2: @Giantwaffle imagine the last guy just accidentl plays a little jenga
[2:31:19] Samelie: as easy as it is to move with a few people, so too does wind pose a problem^^

[2:52:55] Mapleton: We building a Giant Waffle-Iron as our capitol ship?

[2:53:53] clunkerz_: IRL
[2:53:54] Yumzoi: that's cool
[2:53:57] daemonaedryn: monkaS
[2:53:57] Alamose: I assume thats so the defender has some warning and can prepare
[2:53:58] Bleu_Forge: Toaster shaped capitol ship with waffle shaped ships monkaHmm
[2:54:00] ThatWeirdoGuy: Getting Travian vibes xD
[2:54:13] kenshin2666: some pre-builds
[2:54:13] Larklen: tbh that kinda sounds nice, forces you to explore your system...but we'll see how it actually feels KEKW
[2:54:22] SmokeyElm: What game is this?

[2:54:58] DOOMinion: hell yeah sign me up for designing ships Kreygasm
[2:54:59] lazermage24: WaffleCorp, with its waffle shaped ships and Capital ship that looks like a toaster
[2:55:07] wooodiii: it sounds too good to be true ... like stationeers where it starts to bug alot if you have 6+ players
[2:55:17] Larklen: KEKW
[2:55:18] Bleu_Forge: KEKW biplane
[2:55:19] NemesisXKL: @lazermage24 LUL
[2:55:23] PureHardDancer: Red Baron Kappa

[2:55:29] CreamPillow: this looks like a better Starmade
[2:55:31] Larklen: Space Sounds devCheck
[2:55:33] Stitched_BoosterYT: Lol WW2 planes in action but they have F1 enginesd
[2:55:35] shock95: ok this looks a bit more scuffed ngl
[2:55:37] RodriCraft93: now it looks more real like lego
[2:55:42] Lorilath: the guns look a little lacklustre
[2:55:51] ymelus: i wished they went for a more sci fi aesthetic like eve online Sadge
[2:55:53] HostileLogOut: doubtful lol.
[2:55:53] Lottinius: probably not
[2:55:54] BaTu016: i dont think so
[2:55:59] HostileLogOut: since its voxel based
[2:56:01] Lottinius: its prolly gonna lag with more than 10 LUL
[2:56:01] Yemtron: about 3.50 Kappa
[2:56:02] Alamose: looks like it needs some optimization
[2:56:04] CommanderUrsus: muh space plane
[2:56:05] FlyingVillage: Poor framerate
[2:56:09] Henktank1: can't we just program killer drones?
[2:56:11] ymelus: the cartoony ships really sucks imo
[2:56:13] GuyDefeaten: 20-40 is prob the max
[2:56:20] Stitched_BoosterYT: To me it seems like it will be way worse then Call of Duty Warzone
[2:56:22] StOrMy1100: would an average pc be able to handle those ships
[2:56:23] LayWastedd: 2FPS
[2:56:24] kskskskskskskssss: 100 would already be really good
[2:56:26] Spirevipp: isnt this kinda like avorion or starmade?
[2:56:32] Valentin_PV: Dual Universe is trying to do a similar thing with their game
[2:56:33] lazermage24: This is goin to be easy, cause all these people making floating bricks
[2:56:33] Ummon_: looks  ery space engineers. I'd assume you get similar performance
[2:56:35] Larklen: Is that a wormhole??
[2:56:37] robertkhlarsson: frames per munute
[2:56:39] RamseyRinehaus: there is already stuttering in their trailer, it's gonna be an issue
[2:56:40] robertkhlarsson: minute*
[2:56:41] Sulheim: 60+ sec per frame
[2:56:43] daemonaedryn: Anyone know how much it'll cost on release?
[2:56:45] clunkerz_: the fragmenting ships is going to be the problem above everything else
[2:56:46] shock95: WutFace
[2:57:04] Stoods_: Itll prolly be very cpu heavy
[2:57:06] Hyduss_: SN15?
[2:57:07] Stitched_BoosterYT: Cyberpunk let us down once
[2:57:10] HostileLogOut: @DaemonSzyman prob like 20-30$
[2:57:13] RodriCraft93: too much fighting that looks cartoonish
[2:57:15] Weras57: time to build Red Dwarf
[2:57:18] Naxorian: 10fpminute
[2:57:20] daemonaedryn: @HostileLogOut Not too bad then
[2:57:29] shock95: @DaedalusNine it says 9.99
[2:57:30] Gnepcoyi: the dynamic destruction is so cool but probably takes a lot of performance i'd guess
[2:57:37] Deathstranger: so space shields aren't a thing? deaths65LUL
[2:57:38] MrMoneybagMan: monkaS
[2:57:40] TheTerraner: homeworld type ships would be cool
[2:57:43] daemonaedryn: Ok hear me out... Massively plated battering ram as a ship monkaHmm
[2:57:43] Stitched_BoosterYT: Name you faction The Waffle Order
[2:57:44] HostileLogOut: @shock95 where do you even see that. the price is not out yet
[2:57:46] razborsek: Is this like online space engineers?
[2:57:50] lazermage24: My Frames
[2:57:59] shock95: @DaedalusNine wrong tag
[2:58:00] Mike190Twitch: cant let you do that star fox
[2:58:07] devin420: This game is nuts
[2:58:08] nAZAr1uS: even the music is laggy KEKW
[2:58:11] ipyro0: stuff looks like it's built out of legos kinda
[2:58:11] RodriCraft93: imagin getting resources for 5 days, 5 more to build the ship, for it to get destroyed by a single rocket LUL
[2:58:16] Wetware: it's got a kind of a scuffed Expanse vibe
[2:58:19] jeffrrreee: The let down of this game will be tough to bear
[2:58:19] shock95: @HostileLogOut wait... 9.99 is the soundtrack Pepega mb
[2:58:21] HostileLogOut: well it is Voxel based Pyro
[2:58:22] Deathstranger: no its not @nAZAr1uS
[2:58:35] p3ysgod: p3ysgod subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 46 months! 
[2:58:46] omar_i_: i bet 50$ it will be atlas all over again
[2:58:49] HostileLogOut: i wonder how they plan to making money.
[2:58:51] daemonaedryn: Is there an internal economy?
[2:58:53] nAZAr1uS: @Deathstranger idk, that broken sound is just ticking me off
[2:58:55] ocmerv: it is a bit of a lego game
[2:58:58] Larklen: Loos like it'd be a fun few hours at the very least
[2:59:02] Malkariss1: speaking of space games, ive been playing so much of the hardspace shi[brealer game recently it is way to adictive
[2:59:02] GuyDefeaten: its one of those games where you build hours/days and gets destroyed in 15 minutes
[2:59:03] Grumbagz: space games need to go the way of valheim and put nice gfx aside for awesome gameplay
[2:59:16] Stitched_BoosterYT: Just like the game Forts
[2:59:17] daemonaedryn: All in 2 fps KEKW
[2:59:21] boopbeepshmoop: i agree @Grumbagz
[2:59:25] Hyduss_: Wanna to make a space castle when every one has to stand on the wall and shoot KEKW
[2:59:35] HostileLogOut: @Giantwaffle remember that Game where you had to build a aircraft and fly through like walls of sand ?
[2:59:38] Deathstranger: wonder how their server performance is then
[2:59:45] MrMoneybagMan: watching all at 10fps
[2:59:49] hallis21: Gonna be an FPS eating ship meta KEKW
[3:00:03] daemonaedryn: Im interested to see if there will be an economy to crash
[3:00:03] monosmly: Seismic charge from star wars
[3:00:06] Gnepcoyi: feel the same, the whole industry behind creating the ships will be interesting
[3:00:07] Ender410: Yea If I can play without combat PVP unless I wanted to opt in for it, that would be dope. I'd want to just explore and build
[3:00:12] lazermage24: Nice concept, but its going to have performance issues from the beginning
[3:00:15] Chronoes: Wait, June 17th? that's, yeah, early...
[3:00:18] Mapleton: Right after E3?
[3:00:22] lord__pasqual: DU promised a lot too >.>
[3:00:22] shock95: I hope it's going to be better than Atlas at least
[3:00:34] Valentin_PV: For someone who's as much into space and tech like you are, I'im durprised you're not into Star Citizen at all. I'd think you'd be into their ships especially
[3:00:35] Chronoes: Star Citizen has been in early access too for some time Kappa
[3:00:45] Ummon_: First thing to do, everyone meet at the same system and watch the server melt
[3:00:52] Morlega: GregTech? Haven't seen that since 1.7.10 LUL
[3:00:53] thebodge: Star Made used to be my favorite space ship building game, looks similar!
[3:01:04] lord__pasqual: I still don't get it why CCP dropped their FPS project
[3:01:22] YSm0ke: F1 best team radio is out
[3:01:40] RamseyRinehaus: Star Citizen???  didnt they just start development on that recently? Kappa
[3:01:48] lord__pasqual: @Crunxzu LUL
[3:02:18] daz__boot: cause it exists lol
[3:02:20] kyanpeppaa: elite dangerous adding in that First person mode is dope, been wanting to try it now
[3:02:30] thebodge: Ever hear of Star Made? @Giantwaffle
[3:02:30] Moobot: You can find Waffle's Youtube channel here - https://youtube.com/giantwaffle
[3:02:41] HostileLogOut: new expansion came out ye
[3:02:44] omar_i_: you should try it Waffle
[3:02:46] Zohaas: @kyanshiba Hold off on buying it. It has awful performance right now.
[3:02:47] SmokyMtnRed: SC isnt even a game yet IMO. Yes that is my opinion before I get bashed LUL
[3:02:50] PureSpider: yea, space legs
[3:02:50] gartoks: Elite has MASSIVE performance problems now
[3:03:04] hallis21: i think it is on "Mostly negative" atm?
[3:03:04] SmokyMtnRed: Yes
[3:03:07] SmokyMtnRed: UL
[3:03:08] Dexy2811: at first when i saw starbase i thought it was space engineers
[3:03:09] SmokyMtnRed: LUL
[3:03:10] BlakkW0lff: Yeah, you can now walk around on foot (ED)
[3:03:15] LordDynom: Watch out for the SC fan bois
[3:03:19] thebodge: Maybe I knew about b/c you played Star Made... that one was fun!
[3:03:20] someknown: I know this is a little off topic but @giantwaffle thanks for showing me Dyson sphere been having an absolute BLAST with it
[3:03:24] Valentin_PV: You can say that about a lot of early access games
[3:03:25] Deathstranger: deaths65LUL
[3:03:28] Gnepcoyi: they make too much money to change the way things currently are :D
[3:03:31] SmokyMtnRed: Yes, it is a lifetime beta
[3:03:32] Chronoes: I only put in 30EUR to a promising game so I'm not too pissed
[3:03:33] twitch_Chelsea: I. Leave twitch for a year and waffle grows a hobo beard pepeLaugh
[3:03:37] wsd7: WutFace 30 second unblockable ads
[3:03:38] Mandorake: Every time i see someone streaming it i watch for 2 minutes and realize how horribly buggy and optimized it is and that it'll never make it past just cool ship models
[3:03:49] RodriCraft93: it would be nice to go back to Space engineers with a big server of 50+
[3:03:52] kenshin2666: deff hobo

[3:04:25] kenshin2666: he says on twitch with clips as evidence
[3:04:25] NemesisXKL: @RodriCraft93 yea with better mp performance i would play it more often, single player ( even with pve mods is kinda "lonely"
[3:04:27] lazermage24: Except face id is based on 3 point not facial hair
[3:04:28] Larklen: "That dudes with the exact same people, get him"
[3:04:29] Deathstranger: cause that definitely will work deaths65LUL
[3:04:30] wsd7: 5Head easy part is winning 100 000 a day
[3:04:31] RodriCraft93: sure, cause the face recognition wont detect your nose KEKW
[3:04:34] twitch_Chelsea: I feel like your about to ask for my spare vhange
[3:04:35] someknown: If you can find a table that plays less than three decks
[3:04:36] WoofWoofDude: can i get the name or a link to the video waffle was watching ? was driving and couldn't watch :3
[3:04:36] devin420: Do the saw escape room while in Vegas

[3:10:23] gartoks: Create is amazing. It's what brought me back to minecraft after 5yrs :D

[3:22:50] MUHFUGGIN: my girlfriend just told me she is having trouble differentiating the smell of my poo from the smell of my coffee and I don't know if that means I need to change my diet or my coffee

[3:25:43] Miestro: oh shit, it's still on 8!?!?
[3:25:45] DatoPotatoDato: i doubt hytale will live to the hype
[3:26:10] GuyDefeaten: totally forgot about that game KEKW
[3:26:16] kenshin2666: no mods? peace im out -everyone
[3:26:16] mechoriet: i think you can push whole ui packs on join
[3:26:17] igoddone: minecraft is so chill
[3:26:18] Miestro: no
[3:26:20] Miestro: not any more
[3:26:24] mechoriet: java 8 is EOL
[3:26:28] devin420: It’s not goona be
[3:26:30] mechoriet: java 16 is lts
[3:26:30] Dodara87: Is that the update with world hight thats going to java 16?
[3:26:34] Legopiraat: 11
[3:26:36] Miestro: java 8 was the last LTS that was supportted by oracle rather than OpenJDK
[3:26:39] DigitallyAdmiringHumanity: no modded im out
[3:26:56] Charlesiv: java 9 made a lot of changes that could break some old code, so lots of people havent updated
[3:26:57] Moobot: You can sub to Waffle by clicking this neat link -> twitch.tv/giantwaffle/subscribe
[3:26:57] xfrozev2: whats the diff between java 8 and 16 ?
[3:26:58] Legopiraat: 17 will be the next lts
[3:26:58] ninopanda: yes
[3:27:03] Miestro: it's different
[3:27:08] RamseyRinehaus: yes
[3:27:15] Miestro: but still runs hotspot by default
[3:27:19] Miestro: IIRC
[3:27:19] SmokyMtnRed: If, BIG IF, Hytale is as open to modding as MC. It would be a HUGE hit
[3:27:19] RamseyRinehaus: it's just going to be a fork of openjdk
[3:27:25] DigitallyAdmiringHumanity: @xfrozev2 obv its double waht java 8 is
[3:27:29] xfrozev2: ok
[3:27:42] ninopanda: jdk is a hackers game, openjdk is a little better
[3:27:49] Charlesiv: @xfrozev2 there has been some new features added, such as modules, string blocks, etc
[3:27:54] Miestro: no
[3:27:56] Yemtron: ceezBackHug ceezBackHug ceezBackHug ceezBackHug
[3:27:57] ninopanda: nope
[3:27:58] usernameNull: no
[3:27:59] PureSpider: business support will always use oracle
[3:28:00] Venxuri: considering kobol is still used, nope
[3:28:01] Miestro: hotspot is the standard
[3:28:02] xfrozev2: @Charlesiv i meant whats gonna change in mc
[3:28:07] K3ll06s: Kotlin it is
[3:28:09] mechoriet: microsoft also has there own fork of java
[3:28:15] usernameNull: that is like saying moving away from microsoft windows
[3:28:18] BasedLemur: People still use Cobol, I'm sure Oracle's Java will always be used as well
[3:28:22] Miestro: hotspot was donated to openjdk essentially as the reference impletmeentation
[3:28:35] DatoPotatoDato: why would they move away from oracle java?
[3:28:40] Miestro: does kotlin have it's own JVM?
[3:28:42] fishribs2: Java is like ancient scribe
[3:28:42] Charlesiv: oracle is good for business support if you need it
[3:28:53] PureSpider: businesses will still heavily use oracle's version for the support
[3:28:59] devin420: What is Java? I know you need it for Minecraft that’s about it.
[3:29:00] PureSpider: source: am a java dev
[3:29:02] chaos_jordan: either
[3:29:04] fishribs2: well when Matt made the big jump it was a big job
[3:29:05] Chris_Cross_Crash: Is Java like the specification? And JVM is just an implementation?
[3:29:11] Mandorake: Java will still exist heavily in the corporate world.  For example its what American Airlines back-end is written in
[3:29:14] Edddys1: its java and kotlin for android
[3:29:14] PureSpider: bamKEK
[3:29:21] PureSpider: you can write shit code in any language, is all i will say to that :D
[3:29:23] Soul_Synergy: Hey! whats wrong with being a java dev
[3:29:23] Yemtron: C# for life pepeSmoke
[3:29:23] listikuss: Label it @Giantwaffle
[3:29:24] fishribs2: Mac
[3:29:33] mechoriet: @PureSpider mainly for the support i guess
[3:29:33] Edddys1: yeah
[3:29:39] StOrMy1100: Chat what do you think about the python humble bundle deal for 15 dollar?
[3:29:41] PureSpider: mechoriet yes exactly
[3:29:42] wizzkidnl: elektric Hammer?
[3:29:52] Legopiraat: am a java dev, i hate it fuck spring magic
[3:29:53] Soul_Synergy: I'm a full stack dev. I work with java. I don't think its that bad tbh
[3:29:54] Chronoes: @chris_cross_crash Java is mainly the programming language. JVM is like the engine where the code runs in
[3:29:54] taurenite: I am a java dev, there is nothing wrong with it
[3:29:55] allxrise: What if they make a modding framework for minecraft from java 16? Kappa
[3:29:55] PureSpider: okay then this one is for you, waffle: i love my job and the language i work in
[3:29:55] itsfilipoficial: Most people just use scala these days instead of java itself
[3:29:58] Stoods_: java sucks so much
[3:30:02] fishribs2: wonder how many productivity work for every individual
[3:30:08] WeiQiang: @PureSpider same
[3:30:09] Miestro: that's not true in the slightest @itsfilipoficial
[3:30:11] StOrMy1100: May i link it?
[3:30:13] Gelil: Yes. Been a Java dev a long time. Biggest complaint is how verbose it is
[3:30:13] dstryko: wuffliboiii
[3:30:14] Mapleton: Thats what all devs do, complain LUL
[3:30:16] Chris_Cross_Crash: @Chronoes Ok thanks. I thought it might be like that
[3:30:17] Charlesiv: I like programming in java
[3:30:17] PureSpider: itsfilipoficial lol no
[3:30:17] Weras57: KEKW
[3:30:18] Mandorake: The best thing about Java devs is that they are below Javascript devs in terms of most hated
[3:30:23] Allmostdone: until the world wakes up and realizes Java for the web and industry is bad
[3:30:23] fishribs2: the new Java will work
[3:30:24] PureSpider: Mapleton ssssh MiniK
[3:30:28] Stelmine: being a java dev is still better than being a php dev @Giantwaffle
[3:30:33] Yemtron: I had a PHP for 2 years. it was awful
[3:30:39] PureSpider: my company makes hard realtime software in java, so i dont wanna hear anything about performance igaNo
[3:30:41] RamseyRinehaus: job is in demand cuz like almost all of the major ecomm platforms are java based
[3:30:45] MakingMirrors: yes
[3:30:47] Miestro: ehh, yeah
[3:30:48] Maescool: yeah, half the web is php
[3:30:49] DigitallyAdmiringHumanity: i did some javascript in high school it didn't seem that bad
[3:30:49] BasedLemur: People still use php a ton
[3:30:49] GuyDefeaten: what php is so much better
[3:30:49] itsfilipoficial: Yeah because of wordpress
[3:30:53] Chris_Cross_Crash: It's dying
[3:30:59] PeterZ_97: Dying? It's still alive
[3:31:00] JacobSolo: Rust is my new fav
[3:31:01] sofalord_: sure php is  now on enterprise lvl
[3:31:06] PureSpider: java is to javascript what a car is to a carton igaShrug
[3:31:14] Gelil: Most B2B platforms are running on Java middleware
[3:31:15] GuyDefeaten: I rather use php
[3:31:21] Chronoes: Hey, I develop PHP for a living, I feel attacked
[3:31:23] itsfilipoficial: Cobalt is the language of all banks
[3:31:33] ItsTommySon: They still make us learn MIPs for christ's sake
[3:31:33] Dodara87: I know pascal, kinda LUL
[3:31:34] Stoods_: I mean all code is assembly but no one realistically uses it
[3:31:34] K3ll06s: php gets a new version every year or so, and its one of the default server apps
[3:31:35] Miestro: good, migrate to golang @Chronoes
[3:31:37] PureSpider: it's just hip to hate on java, i guess bamKEK
[3:31:37] Miestro: lol
[3:31:37] Yemtron: Usually you run a lot of other technologies with PHP that aren't associated with microsoft. That's why my company used it
[3:31:46] Stelmine: @Chronoes so do i and i still think java is better
[3:31:51] Yemtron: Now I'm a c# dev lol
[3:31:52] Mandorake: @PureSpider I would say "java is to javascript what a ford is to a tractor"
[3:32:00] PureSpider: Mandorake but that loses the pun :D
[3:32:00] ThomK114: I think its hip to shit on you Pure sketchSip
[3:32:04] Gelil: There are much worse languages and there are better languages
[3:32:10] PureSpider: thom, you can shit on me any day bb boo igaDuck
[3:32:13] allxrise: Why javascript language developers changing syntax every major update?
[3:32:14] Gelil: Pick the tool that matches the job.
[3:32:22] Stoods_: typescript > javascript > java
[3:32:26] PureSpider: allxrise new features
[3:32:33] Allmostdone: ford tractors were sexy
[3:32:37] Mandorake: @Stoods_ but typescript is javascript :P
[3:32:37] madseed15: u have a jetpack whos cares LULW
[3:32:43] Dodara87: you have jetpack its fine
[3:32:45] Yemtron: @Gelil But what if there is a tool that is almost all the way there that is free? lol
[3:32:48] killerpaul: normal rules of minecraft change when you have flight
[3:32:50] PureSpider: Mandorake typescript is a superset, and a really great one
[3:32:53] connor24274: the rules don't apply here
[3:32:54] Miestro: technically it's ecmascript @Mandorake
[3:32:57] Gelil: OpenJDK is free.
[3:33:04] xfrozev2: imagine this pack + projectE
[3:33:11] xfrozev2: speedrun KEKW
[3:33:13] Stoods_: @Mandorake imean its similar but just cause its back compatible doesn't mean its the same
[3:33:14] PureSpider: right, i'll leave this conversation lol, so much unfounded bullshit :D
[3:33:18] gunmage8: can you travel on ladders quickly?
[3:33:19] ninopanda: @Gelil all java is free
[3:33:20] Chronoes: They're not changing any syntax, they're adding features that have been long overdue
[3:33:21] Gelil: It’s the Sun / Oracle rts that are not free
[3:33:32] Xentorph: its updated to 1.16
[3:33:33] Mandorake: 3 different responses all saying different things :P
[3:33:39] ninopanda: yeah they are
[3:33:53] Miestro: licensing is close enough
[3:33:53] Slymph: Anyone got advice how to start with c#? perhaps yt channels or smth widepeepoHappy
[3:33:54] PureSpider: the oracle version comes with extended business support, really nothing hard to understand
[3:33:58] RamseyRinehaus: i mean have you HEARD of Oracle before?
[3:34:01] Chronoes: I mean, someone has to develop new features
[3:34:03] Star579: It's not the version of Java it's the VM
[3:34:16] Slymph: Yeah am doing it with unity basicly
[3:34:18] taurenite: they follow the same spec, just different implementations
[3:34:23] JacobSolo: Javascript is actually still trademarked by Orcale iirc
[3:34:23] Star579: You pay the VM not the java version, that's open source
[3:34:24] Allmostdone: try using oracles database and drivers... if you want  pain
[3:34:25] RamseyRinehaus: Oracle is just the worst and nickel and dimes everyone
[3:34:27] Stoods_: c# is like the good version of java
[3:34:32] Miestro: I've been working with java since it was java 3... and the language has come a LONG way
[3:34:39] fishribs2: have a good day
[3:34:39] jay7tx: what projects did you work on for practice?
[3:34:42] PureSpider: Allmostdone eh, i prefer oracle over most other relational databases igaShrug but their driver licensing is ass :D
[3:34:49] ninopanda: well i guess i have a lifetime license for Oracle Java then. i have never had to pay for it.
[3:34:54] DrifterInChaos: Thought kotlin was the good java
[3:34:59] listikuss: Can you not reload you magnet somehow?
[3:34:59] Moobot: You can find Waffle's Youtube channel here - https://youtube.com/giantwaffle
[3:35:06] jay7tx: yeah C# is microsofts competitor to Java
[3:35:09] allxrise: C# = Java+++ to me
[3:35:11] PureSpider: ninopanda pay is only for commercial use
[3:35:17] Stoods_: c# has operator overloading which is big
[3:35:27] Miestro: ehh, C# has some different things syntactically, but feature wise they're almost identical
[3:35:34] Stoods_: java doesnt
[3:35:39] ThomK114: Started learning c# just a week ago and already got a pretty advanced twitch bot going SeemsGood
[3:35:40] BasedLemur: It's normal, but java doesn't have it
[3:35:40] Chronoes: it's not that normal
[3:35:40] ItsTommySon: java doesn't
[3:35:42] oSmudge: If you know C#, you know Java and viceversa. Assuming you know how to Google
[3:35:43] ItsTommySon: c++ does
[3:35:43] Miestro: java doesn't let you overload operators
[3:35:44] BasedLemur: Yep
[3:35:47] Miestro: you have to use classes
[3:35:47] Yomaice: no miner yet?
[3:35:48] PureSpider: java decided against it on purpose
[3:35:49] Miestro: and methods
[3:35:51] Xentorph: uhh
[3:35:56] chaos_jordan: The biggest difference is naming conventions and syntax
[3:35:58] Mandorake: javascript doesnt use it either
[3:35:58] Xentorph: method overloading is a thing
[3:36:05] Stoods_: "its a feature"
[3:36:05] Soul_Synergy: I've never really had any complaints with java and I've been using it for 5-6 years. I started learning programming on C though
[3:36:05] Nebulous39: Yup. You have to make methods for everything
[3:36:06] Tenkaichi500: what's the friendliest coding lang to first learners? i hear Python a lot when i ask
[3:36:07] WGG25: "x.add(y);" in java KEKW
[3:36:08] Gelil: Use lambda to replace. They have an extension api coming
[3:36:17] OneLickAway: we made rocks think, how crazy is that
[3:36:18] Miestro: javascript isn't an object oriented language though @Mandorake
[3:36:19] Xentorph: in fact my java comp sci class just covered it awhile ago
[3:36:25] noxiiiouse: java is commonly used for server programming
[3:36:27] Miestro: it's a prototypical language
[3:36:43] Mandorake: @Miestro Oh didnt realize we were specifying that.
[3:36:48] madseed15: ??????
[3:36:48] PeterZ_97: Because you join strings
[3:36:49] ThomK114: KEKW
[3:36:50] king_royal_310: king_royal_310 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 8 months! 
[3:36:54] madseed15: OH
[3:36:54] Yemtron: seeing them as strings LUL
[3:36:55] Mandorake: Listen its stupid cause you aren't adding you're concating
[3:36:57] PureSpider: only if one is a string type
[3:37:00] KeplersConjecture: Concat of strings
[3:37:02] dstryko: KEKW
[3:37:03] PureSpider: if both are numbers, it works well
[3:37:03] jay7tx: string concatenation
[3:37:08] Chris_Cross_Crash: '1' + '2' !== 1 + 2
[3:37:12] omar_i_: wait a sec, isn't 1+2 = 12? KEKW
[3:37:12] PeterZ_97: "1" + 2 = 12, but 1 + 2 = 3
[3:37:21] Miestro: it's just like comparing an apple with a pear @Mandorake
[3:37:23] taurenite: javascript is fundamentally bad
[3:37:25] Star579: thats the same in C# tho
[3:37:27] msfWEBdude: 3.0000000001
[3:37:49] WGG25: oh you haven't made a grappling hook (iron hook in jei)? it's amazing in the lost cities
[3:37:50] oSmudge: In JavaScript, "2" + "2" - "2" returns 20
[3:37:55] Miestro: floating point precision @Giantwaffle
[3:37:57] PureSpider: floating point numbers, yep
[3:38:02] Stoods_: yeah its just floating point errors
[3:38:03] Galow13: floating
[3:38:06] Yemtron: It's a floating point rounding error. You should look it up <3
[3:38:06] Nebulous39: Floating point math shenanigans
[3:38:08] PureSpider: because you only have a limitted amount of bits to represent the number
[3:38:08] omar_i_: a bit extra on the house
[3:38:10] K3ll06s: JavaScript isnt fundamentally bad, just because you use c# and are used to it, the background of JS isnt bad, its just another approach
[3:38:12] taurenite: it's approximation
[3:38:17] madseed15: just round it up later?
[3:38:19] punkgeek: force ints, yeah
[3:38:19] TallicDragon: Don't use floats when you need an int
[3:38:25] Mandorake: @K3ll06s good luck convicing people that.  either you get it or you don't it seems.
[3:38:26] jay7tx: declare types always
[3:38:26] PureSpider: keep stuff before and after comma as an int, also called "fixed point"
[3:38:29] Miestro: javascript only has a "number" type rather than most lanugages having floating and non flaoting point types
[3:38:29] LtCol_Carter: Ariane 5 rocket exploded because of floating point error KEKW
[3:38:31] QwyIl: csharp has a decimal datatype that handles it alright.
[3:38:33] Chris_Cross_Crash: almost any language will do that. Try 0.1 + 0.2 and it will give you something funny
[3:38:36] Yemtron: Most of the time it doesnt matter cause you dont need 20 points of precision lol
[3:38:40] Stoods_: its because most decimals in binary are infinite lengths
[3:38:47] taurenite: use dedicated datatypes for numeric/monetary values
[3:38:48] ruccoa: duck typing
[3:38:51] Chris_Cross_Crash: python will do that
[3:39:01] BasedLemur: Doesn't python treat everything as doubles?
[3:39:02] Miestro: yes
[3:39:03] punkgeek: yes
[3:39:06] GTLugo: yes
[3:39:06] Nebulous39: yeah
[3:39:12] LtCol_Carter: Floating point error example - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK_yguLapgA
[3:39:13] quote_me_if_BSJ_wins: wolfram language master race
[3:39:13] Star579: yes, C# also has decimal
[3:39:13] QwyIl: csharp has floats, doubles, and decimals
[3:39:14] LtCol_Carter: KEKW
[3:39:17] Chris_Cross_Crash: try 0.1 + 0.2 in python interpreter. It will give you a funny result
[3:39:17] Yemtron: doubles float decimal
[3:39:19] Yemtron: :)
[3:39:20] oSmudge: Doubles in C# is the preferred way to calculate decimals
[3:39:39] Miestro: that's most languages
[3:39:42] PureSpider: and then immediately it might be inaccurate :D
[3:39:44] taurenite: that's common to most lang
[3:39:46] Miestro: in java if you don't put the f it's a double
[3:39:49] BasedLemur: that's a standard feature in c-like languages as well
[3:39:51] Gelil: Most typed languages allow that
[3:40:00] Miestro: if you put a l it's a long otherwise it's an int
[3:40:08] RamseyRinehaus: you are a pretty decent dev these days, give yourself credit waffle
[3:40:15] McDreamyh: Snow runner today?
[3:40:22] Stoods_: c++ is def the best because pointers can be life savers
[3:40:23] madseed15: @mcdreamyh yes
[3:40:24] jay7tx: @chris_cross_crash loool wtf
[3:40:42] Chris_Cross_Crash: @jaygdn LUL
[3:40:42] Mandorake: Im not kidding im kinda addicted to snowrunner streams
[3:40:50] Bleu_Forge: pepeLaugh
[3:40:50] daemonaedryn: KEKW
[3:40:51] madseed15: LUL
[3:40:55] Nebulous39: LUL
[3:40:55] NordESA: KEKW
[3:40:56] TheNativeDudebrother: not really
[3:40:57] jay7tx: i saw that KEKW
[3:40:57] Maescool: that is scuffed
[3:40:58] Star579: C++ also has user defined literals
[3:40:58] Dangerusss: priorities KEKW
[3:40:59] Hikyy: sex sell
[3:41:00] cheppard: $$$
[3:41:01] kenshin2666: priorities
[3:41:02] taurenite: money talks
[3:41:04] gartoks: They had game dev category for a time, but removed it
[3:41:05] Yemtron: twitch only cares what sells lol
[3:41:06] PossibleScam: i mean they have t/programming?
[3:41:07] Miestro: you can use pointers in python, C# and Java @Stoods_ there's just some hoops oyu need to jump through
[3:41:08] OneLickAway: $ priorities $
[3:41:11] RamseyRinehaus: and pre-LGBT tags... "woke" twitch
[3:41:11] BasedLemur: They use to have a pseudo-category for game development
[3:41:11] iDiezALot: I thought they had a game dev category?
[3:41:11] DatoPotatoDato: theres a game dev category now?
[3:41:13] Stormy860: Coding wont make them money lmao
[3:41:15] grid_space: it was for advertisers
[3:41:16] WGG25: there aren't that many game dev streams though
[3:41:16] thebodge: hot tub dev
[3:41:17] omar_i_: why would i enjoy someone coding? thats work all day long KEKW
[3:41:18] obylix: there is still no general "pokemon" category either  so they tell you if you play a rom hack just play under the most recent released game
[3:41:21] trigol: So what @Giantwaffle is saying, Gamd Dev Hottub Steam next week!
[3:41:24] London_Monarch: Hot tub programming
[3:41:25] ooblies: Game Dev in bikinis will be the hot new category of 2021Q3.  Quote me
[3:41:29] Yemtron: I bet if there were more booms in game dev it would be front page no kappa :)
[3:41:32] Archelonde: I has lasagna
[3:41:33] Dangerusss: do programming in a hot tub Waffle
[3:41:34] PossibleScam: @tech you hearing this?
[3:41:35] Yemtron: boobs*
[3:41:36] Allmostdone: game dev in a hot tub. problem solved
[3:41:37] Linkraye: KEKW
[3:41:38] punkgeek: The devs I watch all end up in "Just Chatting" now :(
[3:41:39] ERiQTENDO: they added #trans hashtag on the same day. but NOT #male or #female.
[3:41:51] Miestro: look up "unsafe code blocks" @Stoods_ it's a keyword in C#, java can use JNI, and python can invoke external libraries
[3:41:51] Melinkie: @Giantwaffle did you try out codeacademy yet or nah?
[3:41:52] ERiQTENDO: Twitch in progressing
[3:41:55] Stoods_: @Miestro ye ik its just alot simpler and cleaner in c++
[3:42:00] ERiQTENDO: *is
[3:42:00] PossibleScam: But also, twitch likes money, and but tubs generate that.
[3:42:03] Zohaas: @Giantwaffle Is there a lot of people asking for a Game Dev section?
[3:42:09] The_Holas: i mean codemiko s hottub game dev KEKW
[3:42:13] Tapeman83: There should be a “Pokemon” directory too. I’ve been watching Ironmon streams, and it’s annoying how they have to use the most-recent game as their label
[3:42:31] TheSmithResidence: VirtualHug bleedPurple
[3:42:35] pengeg: read python crash course @Giantwaffle
[3:42:40] taurenite: pick up a book jeez
[3:42:44] Mandorake: @Giantwaffle i've done online courses and there are a ton of good ones but sometimes you gotta just try a few and see what you like
[3:42:50] Mandorake: Udemy as well
[3:42:54] owl_guardian: data camp
[3:42:54] jay7tx: CodeAcademy and Codio @Giantwaffle
[3:42:57] PossibleScam: udemy one of the best imo.
[3:42:57] Kilowatt31: I like pluralsight for learningthings!
[3:42:58] Star579: aren't most online programming courses super bad?
[3:43:02] Gelil: Georgia Tech has free CS classes.
[3:43:02] jaimycoolman: sololearn
[3:43:02] Moobot: Come join the Waffle House discord https://discord.gg/G5FeeveP3c and chat with the community! Remember to link your Twitch account in the Settings (gear) > Connections for subscriber channels.
[3:43:02] shengdeluo: I'm using mimo
[3:43:05] Melinkie: @Giantwaffle we used codeacademy in my cs principles class as assignments, it helped a lot honestly
[3:43:06] Mandorake: pluralsight is cool
[3:43:06] sofalord_: codeacademy is nice to learn
[3:43:07] RamseyRinehaus: i think you have the rare resource of twitch chat and trial by fire will be very effective for you
[3:43:07] DatoPotatoDato: codeacademy is where i learned most of my python @Giantwaffle
[3:43:08] sogerr: imo online courses and youtube are the same if you dont have a teacher directly talking to you and answering your questions
[3:43:08] dexbits: Don't pay a ton. Udemy, freecodecamp, skillshare... There's tons of options.
[3:43:08] DtDragon417: waffle cant read guys
[3:43:09] Stegmurmulis: Wafffle HeyGuys CHAT HeyGuys
[3:43:10] Tenkaichi500: i was also looking at codeacamedy
[3:43:20] jay7tx: dont pay at alllll
[3:43:22] nAZAr1uS: doing python on Codacedemy, pretty good for a newby, imho
[3:43:26] officialzip: CodeAcademy is pretty good but seems basic
[3:43:30] Chris_Cross_Crash: Reading "Getting Started" in most documentation is really nice usually @Giantwaffle
[3:43:31] DatoPotatoDato: freecodecamp is only good for front end in my experience
[3:43:36] sofalord_: you dont need to pay any thing
[3:43:38] MSPaintEnthusiast: books worked much better for me more structured and takes a to z way better
[3:43:39] daemonaedryn: Everytime you say code academy I think your saying Coke and Ketamine
[3:43:39] Gelil: Udemy and Code academy are nice
[3:43:39] jay7tx: theirs tonnes of free courses
[3:43:40] sofalord_: to learn
[3:43:41] Pc19111: Start a LinkedIn premium trial and do all the LinkedIn learning courses for what you wanna learn, you get certifications as well
[3:43:56] Mandorake: @Giantwaffle the only issue i've had with courses is you can run into dumb version conflicts that the course never tells you about and can hard block your progress but thats pretty specific
[3:43:57] Pc19111: And their resources are crazy
[3:43:57] madseed15: not sponcered LULW
[3:44:00] dexbits: Anything < $100/mo is fine. If it's charging "tuition" or like $1000+ for the whole package, it's probably a scam or at least a really awful deal.
[3:44:19] Archelonde: ask them?
[3:44:21] Archelonde: they might
[3:44:23] Pc19111: But paying the LinkedIn premium is not worth
[3:44:26] xfrozev2: Did u make the pyrolyse oven ? @Giantwaffle
[3:44:42] officialzip: Would you do it on stream?
[3:44:46] jay7tx: BeautifulSoup was so fun to do Pog
[3:44:58] jay7tx: you could build datasets and shit
[3:44:59] Miestro: i loved flask when I was palying with it
[3:45:05] jay7tx: from web data
[3:45:12] daemonaedryn: I remember you used some kind of video or program when you started learning Python, do you rememmber what it was? @Giantwaffle
[3:45:16] Chris_Cross_Crash: There are some really good 10 hour courses on YouTube for free
[3:46:15] Gelil: So a college class
[3:46:32] jay7tx: @Gelil essentially, 1hr a week for 10 weeks KEKW
[3:46:34] Chronoes: Best thing for me was working on stuff I wanted to automate
[3:46:46] tedbody: i'm learning rust atm to develop on solana
[3:46:48] Gelil: Same structure as a college class
[3:46:58] Chronoes: I mean for learning programming KEKW
[3:46:59] tommyfod: think he means for coding lol
[3:47:01] Larklen: KEKW
[3:47:01] DatoPotatoDato: i honestly learned more from courses online than college classes in terms of programming
[3:47:14] jay7tx: yeah not the cost
[3:47:19] jaimycoolman: KEKW
[3:47:24] igoddone: "Automate the Boring Stuff with Python" is a good way to learn python
[3:47:28] xfrozev2: When will there be a super focused day ? KEKW
[3:47:45] GuyDefeaten: this online programming course is sponsored by raid:shadow legends
[3:47:55] Tenkaichi500: Pog
[3:47:56] TallicDragon: Do you have access to storage buses? Could you use those on drawer controllers or crates for storage until disks get easier to make?
[3:47:57] RodriCraft93: KEKW
[3:48:00] madseed15: I had a cs class where you learn from doing the assignment where you gotta learn mostly by urself LULW
[3:48:14] Talon: Hows the Mine of Craft?> :P
[3:48:14] FalleNM3rC: this modpack just feels slow
[3:48:18] LinearLayer: College works because youre betting tons of money on yourself and failing means spending money for no return
[3:48:30] JackVaine: Oh shit, I've been watching the vods up to day 3 so I was super confused and didn't realise this was live lol
[3:48:31] gartoks: The worst part of my uni "career" was when there were no more google results for the stuff I needed
[3:48:37] andthrax: it is slow
[3:48:42] madseed15: @Giantwaffle Advance inscriber
[3:48:47] DatoPotatoDato: i really feel like college is more for buying a degree rather than learning programming
[3:48:50] CoolReal: I have already made 42 cents since the crash :)
[3:48:52] Talon: not bad. Glad to be able to stop by
[3:48:54] NordESA: Pogrunner danP

[3:49:07] madseed15: FeelsBadMan
[3:49:11] Mattmn011: Just an FYI do not enjoy watching snow runners lol
[3:49:19] sogerr: is this the snowrunner waiting room? peepoBlonket
[3:49:23] gartoks: @CoilStraint @jaygdn What are you guys studying? I did physics and CS
[3:49:26] Mike190Twitch: go to college to buy a $50,000+ piece of paper
[3:49:37] Mandorake: thats when you call up a senior dev
[3:49:39] Tenkaichi500: KEKW
[3:49:39] andthrax: direwolf20 took like 4 to 5 months of YouTube videos
[3:49:45] Spawn98c: @Giantwaffle Any plans on trying SevTech Ages of the Sky Modpack?
[3:49:48] Miestro: you hit a point where you don't need to... it's kind of surreal when you look back at it too @Giantwaffle
[3:49:55] Larklen: KEKW
[3:49:56] Chyrion: KEKW
[3:49:58] jaimycoolman: KEKW
[3:50:08] jay7tx: straight CS, a lot of the logic and math isn't readily available
[3:50:08] CoffeeAddikt: What comes to studying IT, school gives you "community" or the people who are interested in same things, and the tools / equipment to do "IT"things.
[3:50:08] Star579: KEKW
[3:50:15] Larklen: Wait I'm a Sr BA... sadKEK
[3:50:19] Miestro: I am the senior dev at this point Sadge
[3:50:20] SmokyMtnRed: That is a wierd thought that would stretch to many issues LUL
[3:50:29] Ardrago: and once you have a problem that even a senior dev cant help you with, you got a real problem on your hands LUL
[3:50:34] Mandorake: @Miestro all rides on your shoulders at this point
[3:50:43] Miestro: yeahhh
[3:50:46] SmokyMtnRed: I would stop several hobbies w/o Google

[4:11:09] RodriCraft93: so you saying I should sell my LoL account
[4:11:11] chuckymax: Yeah it can go fast, usually it was like 20-30 in one go
[4:11:12] devin420: Who plays modded Minecraft like waffle?
[4:11:15] Gelil: Are we talking about Path of Exile?
[4:11:16] DatoPotatoDato: i really dont see the point of cosmetics anymore
[4:11:17] lofffff: J OMEGALUL B
[4:11:38] ajwelcheck: Well, if it actually improves my experience in the game and I play it a lot, sure.
[4:11:45] SmokyMtnRed: The pack is how I unwind every evening when I can
[4:11:50] SmokyMtnRed: This*
[4:12:03] jay7tx: @DatoPotatoGames its a whole business model: make ingame cosmetics shitty and make better looking ones as mtx
[4:12:04] clunkerz_: how often do you use your sim rig nowadays waffle?
[4:12:07] dasmako: D:
[4:12:10] Mapleton: Speaking of snowrunners.....
[4:12:20] bEC69_: looking at you poe pepeLaugh
[4:12:23] bEC69_: ye ye ye pepeLaugh
[4:12:25] Larklen: I'm okay with it since PoE is base free. If the game itself has a cost,,,,eegghhh
[4:12:25] HeyAFrozenZebra: Path of Exile
[4:12:27] paulpkpk: premium tab pepeLaugh
[4:12:29] Kubiboi: yes
[4:12:30] SSP15_: yeah
[4:12:35] K3ll06s: A char boost ist different from a stash tab imho
[4:12:41] NordESA: Even funnier when you realize they nerfed rested XP 6 months ago and will sell a boost to rested xp pepeLaugh
[4:12:44] Mattmn011: I wont pay for QoL but ill pay a fuck ton for skins/loot boxes
[4:12:46] devin420: Good entertainment value
[4:12:47] DrHax_: DoA MMO KEKW
[4:12:49] KeplersConjecture: Amazon will cancel it before it comes out
[4:12:51] BasedLemur: Amazon's making another game?? The first two didn't dissuade them?
[4:12:53] RodriCraft93: the fact that you have to buy the SELL tab in PoE is bs
[4:12:54] botmaniac: why are they all called "micro" when some of them are $30+?
[4:12:58] jay7tx: true
[4:13:00] Rubinix: I pre alpha tested new world. It's kinda cool
[4:13:03] Rubiniaa: It’s Amazon man
[4:13:08] SSP15_: what do you think about the game (New world) will you play it
[4:13:08] ajwelcheck: Right KEKW
[4:13:10] NordESA: Macrotransactions
[4:13:10] Larklen: $700 MTX KEKW
[4:13:11] thebodge: did PoE launch with stash tab purchases? Honestly don't know
[4:13:15] THENZ_: I prefer not to play those games. I feel much better spending money on LoL skins lol.
[4:13:15] paulpkpk: its micro compare to all those whales pepeLaugh
[4:13:16] jay7tx: its a "small" purchase in the game Kappa
[4:13:19] Wagglezzz: poe micro KEKW
[4:13:26] K3ll06s: Yeah, you should pay to skip content you made its stupid, my last hope is aoc and if that fails im done with the "classic" mmos
[4:13:26] ajwelcheck: "micro" transactions more expensive than the game KEKW
[4:13:27] Tenkaichi500: KEKW
[4:13:34] mechoriet: KEKW twice
[4:13:35] ZyianDev: I honestly want to see, character boosts *require* a full leveled character. I want boosts for alts, not for someone who doesn't understand the game
[4:13:36] Chronoes: nothing compared to Scam Citizen's ships KEKW
[4:13:37] radiocabea: 10k ship in star citizen Kapp
[4:13:40] RamseyRinehaus: do you want to play Valheim or do you want to pay for 50% of your level 58 TBCC boost?
[4:13:41] SmokyMtnRed: It has turned into a generic term for sure
[4:13:42] The_Holas: can we start talking about Scam citizen KEKW
[4:13:46] Wagglezzz: correct
[4:13:55] Gelil: Hey. I got my 1200+ hours in PoE
[4:13:57] thebodge: Waffle card
[4:13:58] Miestro: wait... really?
[4:13:58] devin420: I was looking forward to that but idk now
[4:14:00] complexprotein: I think the wait list on that is super long at this point
[4:14:01] Miestro: how do you sign up
[4:14:03] bEC69_: 500$ for a card, 1k$ for uniq @Giantwaffle
[4:14:03] Larklen: Something like that I think, dunno the $$ needed though
[4:14:03] InTheLittlePro: Waffle CARD?!?!?!?
[4:14:04] K3ll06s: You have to buy that seperatly
[4:14:08] bstkr: I think it’s because the transaction is a microservice within the game
[4:14:22] DrHax_: wouldnt be surprised if they raised the price on that
[4:14:45] K3ll06s: For different supporter packs yes, but the diff card is an extra thing. But didnt look to deep into it
[4:15:06] Yemtron: vibuThink vibuThink
[4:15:09] complexprotein: Ziz was last league right? The 10 Alts card?
[4:15:10] Gelil: They add something like 50 div cards per year.
[4:15:18] mostlylaughing: Ziz is making his div card
[4:15:23] kyanpeppaa: it used to be, but there was so many people happened, so they had to change it
[4:15:23] Moobot: Come join the Waffle House discord https://discord.gg/G5FeeveP3c and chat with the community! Remember to link your Twitch account in the Settings (gear) > Connections for subscriber channels.
[4:15:47] K3ll06s: It seems they dont sell it directly, you have to message them
[4:15:49] jay7tx: yeah the dev time adding the div card to the game isn't paid
[4:15:53] NordESA: I wonder how the next PoE league will be
[4:15:53] Harok9: Wafful
[4:15:59] jaimycoolman: just put all items in a chest and swap disks
[4:16:00] Dodara87: IN THE MINE WE GOO!
[4:16:10] NordESA: Yup
[4:16:20] NordESA: I tracked their CCU over a few days
[4:16:21] jay7tx: the nerfs put people off like me Sadge
[4:16:22] Wagglezzz: lots of issues with currently league.. its bery stale compared to previous ones
[4:16:30] BaTu016: Sadge
[4:16:34] Rubinix: I stopped playing after a day, the server issues where fucked
[4:16:34] complexprotein: Yea the initial took a big hit with all the server dcs
[4:16:37] Gelil: People burned out on Ritual and this league paid for it
[4:16:45] K3ll06s: Its a circle league after a circle league, with no new cool endgame stuff and only nerfs soo yeah
[4:16:46] Gelil: But Ritual was fantastic
[4:16:52] Larklen: https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/n8v0d7/week_23_retention_rate_of_recent_leagues/ this one?
[4:16:58] Exerion09: Front page? pepeWide
[4:17:01] NordESA: I play with my beard all the time KEKW
[4:17:05] Kubiboi: the last league I spent a LOT of time with was metamorph
[4:17:16] ThatOnneGuy: I find myself playing with my beard while I drive and I wonder how many people see me doing it and think it's weird
[4:17:41] DigitallyAdmiringHumanity: i play with what little of a beard i do have
[4:17:42] Exerion09: widepeepoHappy
[4:18:23] complexprotein: That's only the 1st week it looks like
[4:18:31] fanta_x_thomas: Like a half life chart?
[4:18:32] LordDynom: First derivative?
[4:19:14] jay7tx: counting the flop at the start its not as bad as you think tho
[4:19:20] NordESA: Interesting, imagine if they didn't have those QOL changes with it.
[4:19:22] SixGun393: if I could ever fight Trialmaster I'd play it more
[4:19:26] Myekos: people getting back to work?
[4:19:30] Exerion09: They gutted the end game for most players
[4:19:37] thebodge: yeah i got bored quicker than usual
[4:19:38] backfire68: lol i play in standard, forget the league rn
[4:19:41] x_Crawley: !uptime
[4:19:42] Moobot: Waffle has been live for 4h 20m
[4:19:48] K3ll06s: The league mechanic is not doable on alot of builds, which is awfull
[4:19:48] omar_i_: monkaHmm
[4:19:54] ThatOnneGuy: this is normal
[4:19:59] Plinko60: This is the first POE league I haven't played for the past 2 years
[4:20:08] DigitallyAdmiringHumanity: whats poe in a nutshell?
[4:20:12] chuckymax: Are we, the chat, crypto ?
[4:20:20] ThatOnneGuy: I've been going outside more lately
[4:20:40] Myekos: I love how Texas Gov Abbott declined the federal unemployment benefit to force people to get back to flipping burgers
[4:20:44] ThatOnneGuy: enjoying the 30C muggy nonsense
[4:20:48] omar_i_: twitch pull/bear and corrections monkaHmm
[4:20:56] Wagglezzz: @dpmarag0ni its an arpg like diablo 3 but has a much more in depth builds/engame/craft system
[4:20:57] 101101101: __KyKy__
[4:21:05] FluoriteDH: abbott is a cuck
[4:21:09] NordESA: He wants them burgers KKona
[4:21:09] complexprotein: Here's the link to the updated images https://imgur.com/a/G4bbCYf for POE Retention
[4:21:25] Myekos: it's no skin off his teeth, he just wants his serfs
[4:21:36] DapHammer: abbots choices always benefit his rich benefactors
[4:21:43] DigitallyAdmiringHumanity: @Wagglezzz ive never played diable 3 so i wouldn't know
[4:21:49] Asellus10: Same vibes as the Iowa governor outlawing mask mandates in schools and businesses
[4:21:58] forgivelol: people can still get benefit but its way lower now
[4:22:00] lazermage24: Charge your magnet
[4:22:08] Wagglezzz: @dpmarag0ni run around, kill shit and get loot to kill more stronger shit
[4:22:18] ThatOnneGuy: Coming from someone that works for a company that pays fairly decent for an entry level job, and we're severely understaffed so we're being overworked... I am in favor of removing the unemployment bump.
[4:22:25] devin420: Facts
[4:22:36] YOUCEP: @giantwaffle flux capacitor?
[4:22:37] daemonaedryn: Like the beginning of Covid looking at the rising death stats
[4:22:41] JackVaine: I've never been as depressed as whenever I followed politics
[4:22:43] Exerion09: Same my company is struggling hard to get entry level people
[4:22:56] TX_Honeybutter: No one wants to work, i think it's good
[4:23:10] SmokyMtnRed: @ThatOnneGuy Same here.
[4:23:25] DapHammer: world was crazy a year ago
[4:23:26] Moobot: Support Waffle by using his Epic creator code: Giantwaffle
[4:23:37] DigitallyAdmiringHumanity: bruh i wish i could get a job, but its hard as hell in cali
[4:23:39] NordESA: So glad I have the job I have atm
[4:23:56] Gnepcoyi: yup, suddenly no food anymore
[4:23:59] DapHammer: it already has lpl
[4:23:59] Mike190Twitch: OFC humans are lazy
[4:24:04] daemonaedryn: Yup, "Oh I wont live to see it" mindset will fuck us hard
[4:24:04] radiocabea: sadly i think it will be what will happen
[4:24:21] Dexy2811: ive noticed it with temps in norway
[4:24:21] Samelie: it already does
[4:24:30] BeastboySAW: Strip clubs in Vegas are giving free lap dance if you get your vaccine on site by a medical pro.  Only in Vegas
[4:24:33] buy_and_hold_bitcoin: They'll just blame the corporations and government and billionaires with conspiracy theories
[4:24:33] jay7tx: scary to think about food Sadge
[4:24:34] Gnepcoyi: only when the cycles are broken do we care about fixing it
[4:24:35] natecatt_: I wish your Infinity Evolved skyblock vods were still up that was by far my favorite pack you’ve played through
[4:24:41] Grumbagz: people complain about immigration now... wait till the whole equator is basically desert
[4:24:43] paulpkpk: A
[4:24:43] Samelie: the amount of "100 year storms/earthquakes/floods" is astounding
[4:24:45] Apparentthreat: hold the f up FBBlock
[4:24:46] DapHammer: guuuraaaaaaaa
[4:24:47] zynithtv: its the boiling frog thing, where when you throw it in hot water it will get out right away but if you slowly heat it up it wont
[4:24:54] Mxylopink: you americans just didn t want to see what covid really was, just like many EU countries
[4:25:02] Shantrix: endurance Stream
[4:25:04] listikuss: What is your note app called?
[4:25:05] zynithtv: oh really?
[4:25:11] UncleRuckas: @dpmarag0ni become a plumber it’s a job for life.. always need clean water and shit to go down hill
[4:25:12] BaTu016: what no shot
[4:25:16] Kubiboi: does this modpack have refined storage?
[4:25:16] DapHammer: @giantwaffle whos your favorite hololive member?
[4:25:17] Apparentthreat: he's using sublime
[4:25:19] Myekos: BeastboySAW I wonder how long until someone OD's to get more lap dances
[4:25:21] DrHax_: lemmings being suicidal is also made up
[4:25:22] Quasky: @listikuss That notepad is Sublime Text
[4:25:30] IamtheJK: What crypto exchange is usually the best?
[4:25:48] DigitallyAdmiringHumanity: @UncleRuckas i couldnt, i have ocd , it would drive me nutz
[4:25:48] DrHax_: yea
[4:25:54] natecatt_: I wish your Infinity Evolved skyblock vods were still up that was by far my favorite pack you’ve played through
[4:26:03] Myekos: they will protect their holdings
[4:26:10] paulpkpk: True
[4:26:23] UkFsG: need to have your bids/seel set before the chaos
[4:26:27] UkFsG: *sells
[4:26:32] LordDynom: The API is usually a lot more stable, use that
[4:26:36] Samelie: @Giantwaffle the one that gets me is the 2 cars collide at 50mph and you say " as if it crashed into a wall at 100 mph" which is false
[4:26:43] Ender410: yea last week when crypto was free fall suddenly all crypto trades were shut down for planned maintenance.
[4:26:53] jay7tx: Miss the FTB Infinity multiplayer server with sevadus and everyone Sadge
[4:26:59] Myekos: coindesk is hiring devs, seeing the postings frequently
[4:27:10] chrixiss: 1/2*m*v^2
[4:27:12] TheRealCiaran: it is like 100km/hr
[4:27:16] dasmako: yea they tested it on mythbusters even its not true
[4:27:18] TheRealCiaran: relative
[4:27:24] chrixiss: because you square velocity
[4:27:30] Exerion09: so should I cash in my 401k to buy crypto?
[4:27:38] Samelie: mythbusters did it and it turned out to be false... i still cant wrap my head around it
[4:27:55] dasmako: equal and opposite force so cancels out
[4:28:06] radiocabea: the 100mph one would be "stronger"
[4:28:14] radiocabea: not the 2x50
[4:28:16] paulpkpk: 100mph has more energy
[4:28:17] buy_and_hold_bitcoin: They probably made assumption to simplify it to make it work
[4:28:29] chrixiss: 100^2 > 50^2
[4:28:34] Tasar_: good god
[4:28:35] Myekos: except at the impact point.  anywhere else along the path of the car it would be less
[4:28:35] K3ll06s: 1000 vs 250 + 250
[4:28:48] shengdeluo: @exerion09 don't ask for financial advise on twitch dude
[4:28:49] Chainboost: Hi @giantwaffle, you make ironing clothes so less boring. Thank you LUL
[4:28:54] InTheLittlePro: 100mph to 0 is 100^2 vs 50 to 0 50^2
[4:28:55] ThatWeirdoGuy: No this seems incorrect. What if one car hit a stationary car at 100mph? That would be the same as both cars driving 50mph as speed is relative...
[4:28:58] mechoriet: KKona our wall
[4:29:08] BaTu016: KKona dont u dare
[4:29:11] LinearLayer: Head on collision 50->0, into wall collision 100->0
[4:29:18] radiocabea: @ThatWeirdoGuy speed is relative but the energy bound to it isnt
[4:29:41] Chronoes: @ThatWeirdoGuy kinetic energy is different from relative speed
[4:29:53] DigitallyAdmiringHumanity: @napdawg should you realy ask for any kind of advice on twitch tbh?
[4:30:04] Apparentthreat: Imma need you to chisel those slabs or something.
[4:30:11] ThatWeirdoGuy: Hmm yea guess you are right, because the comparison would be that the stationary car would move backwards 50mph. My bad
[4:30:21] BaTu016: that seems better
[4:30:35] chrixiss: @dpmarag0ni Just ask for advice and then do the exact opposit, unless chat is right.
[4:30:47] DigitallyAdmiringHumanity: seems about right
[4:30:51] shengdeluo: @dpmarag0ni you'd be surprised, but some topics you could ask advise on.
[4:30:56] lofffff: LULW

[4:31:27] Moobot: You can sub to Waffle by clicking this neat link -> twitch.tv/giantwaffle/subscribe
[4:31:29] Myekos: oh yeah, 2x 50^2 is half of 100^2 :)  neat
[4:31:44] Ebonmourn: need some battery's / buffer lol
[4:31:46] Exerion09: just lower the collection range of the vacuum chest
[4:31:57] BaTu016: yes
[4:32:02] BaTu016: PogChamp
[4:32:33] BaTu016: what do we need for the other terminal t3 somthing ?
[4:32:58] chrixiss: no, thats not exactly it @myekos, its 50^2 vs 100^2, because the wall is stopping you. This means the wall is basicly acting as another car hitting you at 100 as well.
[4:33:15] DigitallyAdmiringHumanity: it triggers me to see anything beside R/F when power is involved
[4:33:26] Mike190Twitch: Chargers are i-Sided if i recall and very smart, it'll only pull out charged items
[4:33:27] shengdeluo: @dpmarag0ni same
[4:33:28] Exerion09: yeah item conduit with import and export filter

[4:34:00] DigitallyAdmiringHumanity: what was even the purpose of making a different unit of power when there alright was one'
[4:34:08] shengdeluo: just divide by four, maybe it'll give you some peace of mind @dpmarag0ni
[4:34:20] Chronoes: That's why I subbed at T2 :)
[4:34:22] ZyianDev: I like my T2 sub
[4:34:24] shengdeluo: diversity
[4:34:28] Apparentthreat: told you it was easy. you could have done that when you were looking at it last time
[4:34:36] ThatWeirdoGuy: You just sounded like Dr. Reid from Criminal Minds LUL
[4:34:41] DigitallyAdmiringHumanity: more like doing it to trigger people
[4:34:41] shengdeluo: why are there kcal and kjoules?
[4:34:47] schnappilekroko: Waffle did you play this is not a game?
[4:34:49] Vizion_TV: waffle, have you tried knockout city yet? the game is so good
[4:34:49] Myekos: chrisvrx just taking the changeable portion out of the rest of the math for simplification.  2x50 = 100, but 2x50^2 != 100^2
[4:34:55] ZyianDev: T3 is too much, but I wanna be extra than T1
[4:35:10] Little_Lady_Lauren: yea, if your going to be extra go all the way
[4:35:19] ピッザダディ: Morning

[7:06:58] BadLa: member the george russel Mercedes race last year KEKW
[7:07:01] Tylerbuell16: Yeah i literally cheer for anyone but mercedes lol its nice to see one of the smaller teams do good
[7:07:03] Urgval: its boring to have same team winning year by year
[7:07:24] bluetip84: @PSYC0N There are a lot of F! fans in the US. but it is a newer sport for the contry.
[7:07:32] L707644: But if you remove Merc, Redbull would dominate..
[7:07:47] Myekos: kind of funny to talk about underdogs with the .01s skill gaps involved
[7:07:49] Verb0sity: Rosberg won it once
[7:07:52] richie385: If you route for bass you need to question yourself a bit
[7:07:52] celadriel23: nico won in 2016 right? so probably since then
[7:07:53] tommyfod: 2018
[7:07:57] ThePyglet: its not about the team per say is more about the hammilton babysitting and "priority" over bottas and everything
[7:08:04] smokndaddy: this cross platform?
[7:08:08] bwofreedom2: verstappen has most points currently?
[7:08:09] Tylerbuell16: Hamilton is going for his 8th championship this year
[7:08:13] PSYC0N: thats great @bluetip84
[7:08:13] Dasperhue: the fact is 95% of f1 is the car. the last 5% is the car. so if u can avoid crashing and doing dumb shit u will allways win if u are in a superior car. unless u ofcourse do ferrari strategis LUL
[7:08:24] Dasperhue: last 5% is driver*
[7:08:32] Verb0sity: @bwofreedom2 yes he has 105 points while ham has 101
[7:08:37] MakerOfThingys: Can you refill the top supply rack?
[7:08:48] cambacunumi: the bigger failure is hamilton and bottas is just covering =D
[7:08:48] AnesthesiaFC: totally disagree
[7:08:49] jedihamster_: @Giantwaffle your beard looks magnificent my dood
[7:08:50] derwolff85: As a dutchy... I love to see Verstappen win the championship.. But... I like the close racing even more.  Though not exiting, i loved that there was a "fresh" podium yesterday.
[7:08:54] Pokesaurus_rex: No its like 70/30 @Giantwaffle
[7:08:54] bwofreedom2: @Verb0sity damn being 7th really put ham behind
[7:09:17] thehawkhawkins: lando is OP
[7:09:19] quatrefake: that how non-web people should feel when I talk about games
[7:09:20] celadriel23: familiarity with the car is super important, perez hasnt adjusted to the RB either
[7:09:22] cambacunumi: riccardo ist new with this car
[7:09:24] Yumzoi: @Giantwaffle the car is tuned more towards Lando's driving style though
[7:09:26] Dasperhue: but thats because lando has driven for mclaren for the last couple of years. riciardo is new to the car still
[7:09:27] PSYC0N: ricciardo nog riccardo :p
[7:09:30] kamilos1667: u think max gonna be the champion?
[7:09:31] PSYC0N: not
[7:09:42] banshay3: if it's true what Ric says about the driving style is completely different than other cars... lando is fucked in any other car
[7:09:47] Archelonde: i mean sainz and perez are new to their cars, came 2nd and 4th
[7:09:49] bluetip84: Ric has said the car does not suit his style of driving
[7:09:49] Beeezzus: Aye, driving is a lot more than 5% imo
[7:09:52] mechoriet: D:
[7:09:54] Stillhawkk_: what truck is he using? Kolob?
[7:09:56] mechoriet: D: WHAAATTT
[7:10:01] Tylerbuell16: you could also say that if alonso had a better car he could be doing a lot better this year
[7:10:12] Slowkill333: What about the guy who subbed into the Merc last year and almost won?  Doesn't that show that it is mostly the car?
[7:10:13] Myekos: are F1 unlimited or do they specs they have to follow?
[7:10:16] sogerr: russel was new to the car and almost won if not for mercedes pit stop, being new to a car is not a excuse when russell proves he can jump in a car and lead the race
[7:10:19] bwofreedom2: @Giantwaffle if haas wins a race, ill put my life savings in Doge
[7:10:23] QuesoBad0nga: tyers management is a Hugh factor
[7:10:23] kamilos1667: u broke my heart now waffle im from amsterdam :(
[7:10:27] thehawkhawkins: @slowkill333 100%
[7:10:28] panic_inducing_citrus: Does this have cockpit view?
[7:10:32] celadriel23: lando third would be awesome
[7:10:35] Tylerbuell16: Alonso is one of the best drivers in the last like 20 years of F1
[7:10:35] Dasperhue: there are superior drivers like max and lewis, but even if u put max and lewis in the haas cars they would end up short
[7:10:37] TallShyGoose: also alot on the appeal about flexi wings
[7:10:46] Stillhawkk_: yes you can drive in first person
[7:10:47] Myekos: plus, Lando is a sub
[7:10:50] banshay3: if you love bottas, why you pronounce his name so weird LUL
[7:11:00] panic_inducing_citrus: @Stillhawkk_ cool thanks
[7:11:22] Mathyper59: I want to see russel in a better car
[7:11:37] celadriel23: dont worry russell will be in a merc next year
[7:11:42] kamilos1667: haas car is terrible to be honest both drivers told that ofc there is mazespin....
[7:11:44] saaz2000: imagine all the people....
[7:11:45] Verb0sity: Mazepin in a merc LUL
[7:11:46] chefskiss_: PogChamp
[7:11:46] SandDanGlot: Magnussen was doing really good laptimes but the car didnt hold a full race
[7:11:47] Pokesaurus_rex: They would initially drive like shit tho because Cars are designed around their drivers @Giantwaffle
[7:11:51] mechoriet: KEKW would never happen
[7:11:51] L707644: @Giantwaffle do you think Lewis with Haas would be in the middle pack?
[7:11:53] Ycrems: next season bottas to RB and george to Mercedes
[7:11:56] aundros: but who would want to win then?
[7:11:57] bwofreedom2: HAM in a haas
[7:11:58] cambacunumi: mezepin would still crush
[7:11:58] MrAppl3: I remember I created a fantasy team with 0 knowledge. Wonder if I am beating you
[7:12:02] Cyber_Star: Or just make all cars equal? Like they do in alot of rally races?
[7:12:05] boatymc_boatface_: easy, have 2 drivers per team and one finishes last
[7:12:05] Tylerbuell16: Merc's cars are built for them to stay in front, once they get out back into the pack and they get the dirty air from other cars mercerdes have a hard time competing
[7:12:06] SandDanGlot: Sorry qualifying
[7:12:07] NemesisXKL: stop smoking weed my man
[7:12:10] Dasperhue: yikes
[7:12:12] schwebels428: take off all markings of the cars, give them random numbers, do a random drawing where each person gets a car based on where that car finished in qualis
[7:12:18] Pokesaurus_rex: WAFW
[7:12:20] Bbluess: @Giantwaffle good point tho like russell in the merc is the best thing happned in the last season
[7:12:21] kamilos1667: oh my just not that
[7:12:22] haavard89: he would find a way do drive offtrack anyways
[7:12:24] TarMonA: i can see off day race for chairty but noo it will never happen
[7:12:29] Yumzoi: Mercedes would be pissed because Mazipin would crash it every other race
[7:12:31] Rankil: rally cars are not equal either haha
[7:12:34] Slowkill333: @Giantwaffle imagine if all of the teams had the same parts and it was up to the engineers to build the car and setup the best they can, then we would see the dirver differece.
[7:12:35] doctercorgi: dirty air wtf crumpLUL
[7:12:37] mimicl: a what if
[7:12:37] schwebels428: i love the chaos
[7:12:43] derwolff85: I'm curious about the sprintrace
[7:12:46] Mathyper59: this will suck
[7:12:51] thehawkhawkins: mazepin might come 19th if he was the a Mercedes
[7:12:51] kamilos1667: @giantwaffle what you think about perez? he will stay?
[7:12:53] Dasperhue: imagine being a merc repairguy and hear the announcement that mazespin has gotten bottas seat for next season LUL
[7:13:05] licdic: sprint races will suck probably
[7:13:05] derwolff85: I can't wait for Zandvoort
[7:13:08] licdic: the rest is ok
[7:13:09] Rankil: there's some road racing that does 2 races. first race finish gives inverse start for next. gridlife does it.
[7:13:10] celadriel23: 20 or 25 i think i read i cant remember
[7:13:12] cambacunumi: imagine quali but without traffic
[7:13:15] Verb0sity: @tarmona Can't see that ever happening. A crash would cost the more instead of the fundraiser
[7:13:15] Tylerbuell16: 100kms i think
[7:13:15] mxuga_: 100km +1lap
[7:13:19] PSYC0N: perez will stay. @Psychopoland
[7:13:20] jornverschueren: max and lando both have belgian nationality as well
[7:13:20] shooternick34: 100km
[7:13:30] MesmerMag: Is there a good use for highway trucks in this game? Just started and it all seems mostly off road
[7:13:33] Rankil: but the f1 qually sprint will be interesting to see
[7:13:43] celadriel23: lando is english
[7:13:46] mechoriet: nope max is belgium :)
[7:13:46] Tylerbuell16: is lando not british?
[7:13:46] Dasperhue: yep
[7:13:51] derwolff85: Drove on zandvoort myself, track is interesting :P
[7:13:51] NemesisXKL: waffle you missed your sh0rtcut

[7:49:34] Jaydepps00: @Giantwaffle it's always day somewhere :)
[7:49:36] banshay3: also transfering it over large distances would be lit
[7:49:37] DrNucleotides: Dyson Sphere, lets go
[7:49:38] Silver_Skeeter: yeah i saw something simmilar for europe
[7:49:38] mechoriet: monkaHmm what if we just put battery banks undergroud ?
[7:49:39] Chronoes: we just need a dyson swarm
[7:49:39] Webvidaddict: solar panels in Wyoming nobody would notice
[7:49:45] stubtail42: run wires to japan an EU and instead of storing it send it there
[7:49:47] daemonaedryn: Hydropower based on tidal ranges is pretty predictable
[7:49:48] ElimDK: liberal logic
[7:49:55] ElimDK: NotLikeThis
[7:49:56] boatymc_boatface_: like pumping water up a mountain and then releasing it again
[7:49:57] banshay3: don't you have Ohio for that?
[7:49:59] schwebels428: use excess electricity to pump water into a holding pond, at night let the pond empty over a hydro generator
[7:50:05] DapHammer: just build a dyson swarm lul
[7:50:08] yildizYUSUF: we don't even have enough hospitals yet dyson sphere
[7:50:27] Beeezzus: Hydro storage looks promising, cool idea at least
[7:50:30] RoninStorm: @Sinasta yea. truth. if i had a choice i wouldn't move to either.  lol. I like where i live. pay is low as shit but so is cost of living. I'm able to afford land in the country with no neighbors... and the climate is lovely
[7:50:31] Myekos: put in wave power generation, use it to protect endangered coastlines, win win
[7:50:32] Orin_The_Sly: Wish we could find a way to amplify the Moons light and transition it into Solar Energy
[7:50:33] mechoriet: monkaSTEER
[7:50:44] TheWonderLlama: Close your eyes and send it
[7:50:54] MisterZero_: A ring of solar panels around the planet, like in DSP
[7:50:57] wardington: Isn’t moon light just reflection from the sun?
[7:51:03] DapHammer: i thought nuclear wa supposed to be promising, but it just has a bad rputation
[7:51:20] banshay3: @wardington to weak probably
[7:51:24] RodriCraft93: we can already use "solar" power at night, its been developed
[7:51:25] R8X2010: We could start by not keeping heavy handicaped people that requires everything just to stay alive... We wont survive by growing kind hearts sadly
[7:51:30] Gelil: Didn’t China or Korea create an artificial sun?
[7:51:31] nick43087: fusion.  ftw
[7:51:33] moonfolly: A giant flywheel is the best idea I've seen so far for storage.
[7:51:35] Tomthegamer: US Nuclear is growing.
[7:51:38] Wazix11: nuclear is super good, but old advertising scared people of them and people are against them
[7:51:44] siickwitit: New Smaller reactors all same design
[7:51:45] NemesisXKL: @wardington yea but the moon doesnt reflect the beams u need for solar i guess
[7:51:46] yildizYUSUF: RMBK = Best reactors Kappa
[7:51:48] mechoriet: also the risk of a meltdown
[7:51:53] davethulhu: so I googled it.  in 2013 the estimate was 22,000 square miles, which is about the size of the mojave desert.  With improvements over the last 8 years, that number is probably closer to 10,000 square miles.
[7:51:55] greiii3: does waflle only play big brain games
[7:51:57] banshay3: yes
[7:51:57] Surf_x: @Tomthegamer getting smaller plants are so old they shuting down
[7:51:57] FalleNM3rC: yes
[7:51:58] RoninStorm: yes
[7:52:01] Pokesaurus_rex: Yes modern reactors yes
[7:52:02] MJ711: @Myekos look it up, it is VERY underpowered to the point that it does not make sense to implement it as only power source
[7:52:02] swarupjoys: what about nuclear waste?
[7:52:09] mobossi: Solar panel falls on you = dead
[7:52:09] SandDanGlot: Thorium reactor looks interesting
[7:52:10] QwyIl: Solar is from falling off tall buildings
[7:52:12] Wazix11: nuclear is extremely safe death wise compared to coal
[7:52:12] Crashnash32: Where to put decaying rods
[7:52:14] vordican: yes they do
[7:52:15] RoboPog1: bird deaths from solar panels lol
[7:52:15] FalleNM3rC: @Giantwaffle theres a kurzg video on it
[7:52:16] Tomthegamer: @Surf_x Some are certainly shutting down.
[7:52:17] CutlasFury: safest non-renewable
[7:52:18] schwebels428: i see a nuclear power plant out my back window. live less than 2 miles away. my family doesn't get the power from it KEKW
[7:52:18] RodriCraft93: Argentina is planning on constructing 2 nuclear plants, one in water
[7:52:21] aritas: until the reactor spills
[7:52:24] daemonaedryn: I wouldnt be surrpised, the more potentially dangerous something is the more regulation there is
[7:52:27] MisterMOONDog: the generation 4 nuclear reactors will be how climate change will be solved
[7:52:27] VeckzanTV: Nuclear power can be recyclable too if you clean the uranium after use, I hear
[7:52:30] Myekos: MJ711 did I say only?
[7:52:35] Tomthegamer: US nuclear is very safe
[7:52:37] siickwitit: It produces Nu waste
[7:52:37] Surge43: Sun reflecting off of solar panels cause a lot of car crashes. very deadly
[7:52:37] ba_nanananananana: they still make waste, and reprocessing is a shitty process but overall still ok especially for global warming
[7:52:38] vordican: it is no where near as bad. and they can use old waste as power. but to say they make no waste is not true at all
[7:52:44] Satyru: waste need to be safely burried. biggest maintance
[7:52:47] Beeerg94: according to Kurtzgesagt, nuclear is the safest
[7:52:52] DrNucleotides: I actually read an article that if you put too many solar panels in 1 area you can actually cause localized climate change.
[7:52:53] bwofreedom2: regulation really stops our progress so much
[7:52:54] Workshops: the current reactor designs were from many years ago
[7:52:54] Tomthegamer: @Satyru Easy.
[7:52:57] Geitenmelker: @giantwaffle solar panels cause fires, burn down houses and businesses
[7:52:57] MJ711: @Myekos didnt you? from the comment is looked like you meant as only source
[7:52:59] RoninStorm: 5 minnutes to hockey! woot
[7:53:04] yildizYUSUF: I also watched some youtube videos which makes me an expert
[7:53:05] banshay3: just send it into the sun KEKW
[7:53:05] Orin_The_Sly: We should launch our Nuclear Waste into the Sun
[7:53:09] schwaammy: We just need to send the waste into space
[7:53:13] streyder: People complaining about renewables killing birds. Car kill 500x (not %) more birds than all renewables combined
[7:53:14] Domnonos: I like the idea of using Nuclear to get rid of Coal and Natural Gas and then phase out Nuclear when we solve the issue of storing power from renewables
[7:53:14] Tomthegamer: @Workshops There is always new research happening
[7:53:15] schwebels428: not the sabres KEKW
[7:53:18] RoninStorm: Penguins v Islanders
[7:53:22] imaginathan: new reactor designs are fail to safe designs now. so if something catasstrophic happens then the reactor is automatically encased and put in a safe configuration
[7:53:23] Bbluess: @Giantwaffle I think the nuclear is like a clenest way to generate elect. in current state of the world.
[7:53:25] Workshops: @Tomthegamer I mean the ones being used now
[7:53:26] Beeezzus: Nuclear waste to space great idea imo, right into the sun
[7:53:27] VeckzanTV: I hear too solar panel is not good the global warming, dont know if its true
[7:53:31] Fressure: yeah let the alien deal with our trash we send to space
[7:53:31] Chronoes: woot? that is one hell of a 2000s word
[7:53:34] RodriCraft93: we should make a dyson sphere around Sun Kappa
[7:53:41] RoboPog1: go jets
[7:53:45] Tomthegamer: @Workshops Well there are new ones but I get what you're saying
[7:53:47] DrNucleotides: @schwebels428 lets go buf.... oh rooFeels
[7:53:51] Surf_x: @Bbluess Nuclear comes in about 6th for cost , solar and wind is cheaper now
[7:53:52] MisterZero_: w00t
[7:53:54] RoninStorm: @Chronoes i'm bringing that shit back. :P
[7:53:54] Silver_Skeeter: lazer EZ
[7:53:55] NemesisXKL: w00ta
[7:53:56] skunkelmusen: totes
[7:53:56] Fressure: I like "clutch"
[7:53:59] schwebels428: @DrNucleotides  :(
[7:54:00] Gelil: Is this Fallout:NV?
[7:54:01] BadLa: no power generation is good, the only way to make the earth better is remove civilization :)
[7:54:01] Webvidaddict: nuclear is the safest people just paranoid from chirnobyl and 3 MI island
[7:54:01] KekPek_: EZ
[7:54:02] NemesisXKL: ftw
[7:54:05] Satyru: i dont get the solar and battery fever. the amount of lithium needed its huge compared to life of baterys and solar (20y max)
[7:54:10] siickwitit: Shenanigans
[7:54:14] bwofreedom2: i have a shirt that just says "RAD" across the front, its one of my favorite shirts tbh
[7:54:14] Valentin_PV: it's from radical, right?
[7:54:14] Orin_The_Sly: Tubular!
[7:54:15] Workshops: @Tomthegamer yeah I'm saying the ones that are currently in use are super old designs compared to what could be used. It just costs alot to build one
[7:54:15] shavinglove: Bummer is still rad
[7:54:15] schwebels428: i say nifty a lot
[7:54:18] Freeday12345: heh. radical bro-skowski!
[7:54:22] Crashnash32: Surfers
[7:54:22] Chronoes: @RoninStorm damn, good luck I guess. I remember I used it too but I have no desire to continue KEKW
[7:54:23] Tylerbuell16: yes lol
[7:54:24] Widdie: I still use bummer alot
[7:54:24] Orin_The_Sly: I do still say bummer
[7:54:25] Bleu_Forge: I saw bummer daily emyyConcern
[7:54:25] Myekos: MJ711 we can't rely on any single renewable, just not consistent enough
[7:54:31] AO_KINGZEUS2424: sometimes
[7:54:31] RoninStorm: lol
[7:54:33] mimicl: boomers
[7:54:38] Pokesaurus_rex: A Rad Boomer who says the word Bummer woot.

[7:54:43] DaChibi: The TMNTs say rad.
[7:54:49] Beeezzus: I say bummer lol
[7:54:50] Tomthegamer: Whoever invents better energy storage is going to be super rich
[7:54:50] Orin_The_Sly: Im not a Boomer DansGame
[7:54:50] mechoriet: @mimicl ok zoomer :)
[7:54:50] MJ711: @Myekos true
[7:54:51] schwebels428: kowabunga dude
[7:54:53] vordican: in the U.S. the regulatory environment makes it super difficult to make new reactors in a cost effective way
[7:54:53] NemesisXKL: inb4 tunnel blcoked and u need 63454 steal beams and 1 wood
[7:54:55] richie385: @bleu_forge on what beach
