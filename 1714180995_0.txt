[0:44:15] zynithtv: tbh i think the main issue is to at least cut costs and not spend money on shit no one wants. If you could chose where your taxes went, i dont think people would have as much of an issue paying them
[0:44:17] Bmatic86: normal
[0:44:27] 0x4273: @SilverSnowFFXIV its not about the debt but having enough money to support social services like medicare and social security
[0:44:32] nick43087: @PureSpider  kinda true.

[0:53:17] mechoriet: unreal 5.1 Kreygasm tho
[0:53:22] 0x4273: unreal has better performance for this scale game
[0:53:31] Tetsomina: unity is probably best for a game like KSP
[0:53:38] OrangeW2: just make your own engine :)
[0:53:48] AtomicDorito97: @0x4273 Source : I made it the fuck up
[0:53:49] Twin5un: I mean it's also a matter of what the team is used to
[0:53:55] OrangeW2: @0x4273 xdd
[0:54:02] rofl1436: xdd gangy
[0:54:02] SailorWS: YEP  fork
[0:54:03] Twin5un: If the team that makes the game knows unity then it's easier
[0:54:04] Ratscapula: same with unreal, its modular
[0:54:07] daedmissica0: 85% chace for rocket labs waffle
[0:54:10] Ranctifier: if only eft can fix the audio issues

[0:55:05] mechoriet: @Venxuri Bedge your gonna tuck tarkov?
[0:55:08] 0x4273: unreal is c++ which is much faster than c# when you focus on performant code
[0:55:12] DKJensen98: I also think each company try out both engines and then go with the one performing the best
[0:55:12] mechoriet: in the back
[0:55:14] Tetsomina: Unity devs are super helpful
[0:55:17] Fyzyqs: Tarkov? Better? LUL

[1:40:51] Code4Coffee: Are you responsible for updating the OS?
[1:40:52] PureSpider: all the typical hosts like creeperhost and nodecraft are considered SaaS
[1:41:00] Stitchez_tv: You have access to the container of the VM but don't need to control it
[1:41:18] PureSpider: most of the hosts you dont have access to the underlying OS

[3:15:59] schwebels428: i was gonna ask why tesla designed tits on a robot....
[3:16:12] hiposlipo_: @Tapeman83 politics are cool ehh?
[3:16:14] PureSpider: tesla is YEARS behind on battery tech by now :D and they're a battery company
[3:16:14] P00nDozer69: They just dropped the price like 9-15% of all vehicles in canada
[3:16:15] Chilz_Dude_7: the goal for tesla did succeed if the others are investing to catch up
[3:16:16] aundros: Wonder why
[3:16:17] davethulhu: the reason is elon
[3:16:17] Nexhunter: tesla is trying to meet that mold KEKW
[3:16:20] daedmissica0: 133.42 usd each
[3:16:24] DX_Plates: Companies that actually know how to make cars are now making good EVs.
[3:16:26] Smileynator: It's all a "get elon off the planet" fund
[3:16:30] dariomtc: This  reminds me of hot tub time machine when Lou reinvented google and called it Lougle OMEGALUL
[3:16:31] DonMerkuzio: Atlas is awesome @Nexhunter

[3:17:04] Nexhunter: that not gonna help their factories KEKW
[3:17:10] Jaydepps00: is there a legitimate alternative for tesla "self-driving"? @Giantwaffle
[3:17:12] Smileynator: to do "human work" in a "human enviornment"
[3:17:16] dariomtc: @coolcake2 Tesla is registered as software company to avoid taxes
[3:17:17] Nexhunter: just use a fucking arm KEKW
[3:17:20] Morlega: Crash dummies for testing Tesla cars Kappa
[3:17:21] Tapeman83: yeah, literally anything else KEKW @Jaydepps00
[3:17:21] Smileynator: stuff you now use humans for, can be replaced
[3:17:24] Rongoel: Just fix it to the floor
[3:17:24] P00nDozer69: just put it on tracks
[3:17:26] InternetPlumber: new flash... almost all manufacturing uses robots already
[3:17:26] Smileynator: a lot of the world is based on humans
[3:17:27] aundros: This sounds more useful for something going to mars
[3:17:28] hiposlipo_: progression
[3:17:30] theszechuanslinger: why not just have plcs and pick and place
[3:17:36] x1xamen: showcase? maybe
[3:17:37] DemonsDawn: for sex appeal
[3:17:37] Kuroiorb: mhm sacrifice the 100% torque all the time for manual powertrain and longer range @Tapeman83
[3:17:38] trisge: the world is desgined for humans. So human like robots are an easier replacement once they work
[3:17:39] philipkatis: They use the factory as a test case.
[3:17:40] PureSpider: @theszechuanslinger yep :D
[3:17:45] Rongoel: The factory robot arm has been pretty much perfected for what we need atm
[3:17:48] upgradecarton: Because it‚Äôs just another grift
[3:17:48] titus124: tesla stock has dropped 50% over the last 6 months

[3:17:56] coolcake2: @coolcake2 why would a car company make something like dojo. makes no sense
[3:17:58] InternetPlumber: we designed a stupid factory so we need robots with legs
[3:17:59] orionebt: i mean it is tesla... this could be a pr stunt
[3:18:00] hatxhh: robots are going to take over the world one day all beacuse of tesla
[3:18:02] Twin5un: Video on robotic arm now ? Kappa
[3:18:03] Redswampfox: robots should be like Praying Mantises

[3:18:28] RussianRainbowTV: xdd

[3:18:33] Nexhunter: they cut major costs on FSD sensors KEKW
[3:18:35] Jh0n_c3na: Remember the semi
[3:18:36] Morowinn: use it for cleaning up nuclear reactors which have melted down, or observing in the most hostile environments
[3:18:36] Jaydepps00: is there a legitimate alternative for "self-driving" cars? @Giantwaffle
[3:18:38] aundros: why can't they make the truck?
[3:18:39] Nexhunter: and that is working out so well pepeLaugh
[3:18:42] Schutter07: semi-truck?

[3:19:09] GGoodGGuy: over-hyped IMO
[3:19:13] hatxhh: looks like his son drew it
[3:19:19] haydcarney: I feel like robots would only be good for extreme/dangerous jobs so we don't risk human life
[3:19:23] Twin5un: Copege
[3:19:25] hisdue: chicken famr

[3:20:01] i_am_davis: it just went to 2 and emptied something is still consuming
[3:20:02] Generic_Gamer: I work for a trucking company - liability is a huge reason why semi's arent automated yet.
[3:20:08] Nexhunter: @TelRehiad coke didn't buy any it all pepsico and pepsico hasn't taken any delivery yet
[3:20:16] TippletonJohn: Pati set up a drilling rig for tons of salt water.

[3:21:14] Smileynator: wait, what was that tool you just useD?
[3:21:42] Morlega: Interface Terminal?
[3:21:43] SailorWS: the interface?
[3:21:43] stormzwest: monitor
[3:21:44] kbigLiar: i think he means the screen
[3:21:46] Gotizie: the interface
[3:21:50] Smileynator: aaah, interface
[3:21:52] Smileynator: thanks
[3:22:03] FoxeVR: interface terminal should be in base AE2
[3:22:08] Smileynator: yeah i might need that in the future :P
[3:22:16] Morlega: I remember it being a thing in vanilla AE2 long ago, but I don't remember the "click this button to highlight the block"
[3:22:30] PureSpider: yea the actual terminal is a lot different
[3:22:30] Moobot: Come join the Waffle House Discord! <# https://discord.gg/fhGFtMuzdS
[3:22:37] Jaydepps00: yeah the block highlighting is addon
[3:22:40] Twin5un: tink tink tink Wokege
[3:22:43] PureSpider: it had a pattern terminal but it's a lot more basic
[3:22:43] Fitmit: I guess it removes needing to rename interfaces?
[3:23:06] Jonataurus: It's funny to me there are "vanilla mods" and "modded mods"
[3:23:10] Snah__: monkaS

[3:23:24] kbigLiar: how many buckets is that?
[3:23:25] PureSpider: different vial
[3:23:26] Gotizie: cause its batwing
[3:23:30] InternetPlumber: export matter into a tank and then push the liquid XP into the machihne
[3:23:32] Snah__: bat is cheaper?
[3:23:33] nesse007: ItIsWhatItIs
[3:23:38] Jaydepps00: ItsWhatIts
[3:23:38] Snah__: ItIsWhatItIs
[3:23:39] PureSpider: because a bat flies

[3:23:46] PureSpider: 7Head
[3:23:47] cmmeth: bats can fly YEP
[3:23:48] Jaydepps00: @PureSpider 5Head
[3:23:49] Snah__: bat farm time ItsWhatIts
[3:23:57] PureSpider: that's their logic, i'm not kidding :D
[3:24:09] FoxeVR: in newer AE2, they have a pattern Access Terminal, however its labeled that way cuz they transfered from using interfaces for patterns to blocks called Pattern Providers
[3:24:12] Moopoop: lol by the time you make you, you could automate bat probably
[3:24:13] Gotizie: bat farm!
[3:24:14] stormzwest: 300 exponential levels
[3:24:20] stormzwest: not absolute
[3:24:20] That0neGeye: Bat is harder to get

[3:24:37] Duke1454: if u use one stack at a time its 30 a clip. The more xp u have the less the xp is valued
[3:24:37] PureSpider: Jaydepps00 if you use the "correct" soul vial, it's cheaper
[3:24:47] TippletonJohn: Bat farm, hype,
[3:24:53] Minelmonia: dont you have 800k of them
[3:24:58] TippletonJohn: seqInsane

[3:25:07] Jaydepps00: KEKW
[3:25:14] PureSpider: Jaydepps00 because it's a flight controller
[3:25:28] Morlega: The XP required going from 300 to 301 is like going from 1 to 100 or something stupid
[3:25:29] TimmyVRC: wait so why not do one level at a time and put it into the machine then
[3:25:32] PureSpider: and i dont think there is a "bee soul vial"?
[3:25:34] RussianRainbowTV: is there infinite storage drives in this pack?
[3:25:35] Duke1454: isnt that just using one stack at a time and empting it
[3:25:36] boogerbomb01: For that XP level cost you should get a TON more than just 1
[3:25:36] ThatOnneGuy: "progression saturday"... has tesla robot youtube videos in his thumbnail. widePepeLaugh

[3:30:09] Morlega: It uses ender pearls as fuel, but only like 1 per teleport, super cheap
[3:30:19] MisterRabbitHead: and you will teleport into space by mistake and die LUL
[3:30:20] PureSpider: metadata
[3:30:21] RussianRainbowTV: I think they balanced it by it needing ender pearls to use but you know, that's kinda power crept in this pack pepeLaugh

[4:05:54] xalorous: Don't you have to go with the Belgians to get 7.5%?
[4:05:58] CurlySC: @DareDeFlug 5% is normal beer volume
[4:06:11] Knightishift: Water is better Then budlight
[4:06:11] MisterRabbitHead: look at all these beer connoseurs in chat KEKW
[4:06:13] xalorous: or a dopplebock or triplebock
[4:06:13] Feist_: @giantwaffle that Brewery is on 290 going to Fredericksburg

[4:12:09] Methanee: chicken farm
[4:12:15] Snah__: üêî
[4:12:25] Vovosunt: count filters too
[4:12:28] Morlega: Buffer chest with blocking mode interface yeah
[4:12:29] stormzwest: should work yeah
[4:12:33] TxMaverick88: D:
[4:12:34] Snah__: oi
[4:12:35] thecodealive_original: oi
[4:12:35] kane1941: See how Pati does with Assembly Lines
[4:12:37] stormzwest: you need to filter the inputs
[4:12:44] stormzwest: or that
[4:12:47] Flobu_: cant you use the same system pati uses on the assembly lines?
[4:12:48] Morlega: Count filter isn't needed if you limit the injectors to 1
[4:12:54] kbigLiar: make a dedicated auto-crafting line?
[4:12:57] kane1941: @Giantwaffle
[4:13:02] Ras2709: and then block inputs on the interface
[4:13:10] chaoskub: round robin
[4:13:20] Morlega: Still need to export to the actual crafter with priority
[4:13:36] stormzwest: wrench it
[4:13:45] stormzwest: point the interface to the crate
[4:13:54] Vovosunt: doesn't matter @stormzwest
[4:13:55] Morlega: Yeah that works, but need to transport the finished product back into the interface
[4:13:58] Morlega: (or ME import bus)
[4:14:07] BronzKneeeCap: wait so what about things that use all 10 injectors?
[4:14:08] Vovosunt: need to filter the main block @Giantwaffle
[4:14:14] x1xamen: no
[4:14:17] Recklessbandit: Recklessbandit subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 49 months! 
[4:14:34] kbigLiar: crafting card it to make things inside the buffer... not to run patterns iirc
[4:14:54] kane1941: but you sometimes use that as input in a different craft
[4:15:11] Morlega: Just setting the crafter to a higher priority insert could work too
[4:15:25] Morlega: without having to filter I think
[4:15:34] Vovosunt: filter is safer
[4:15:46] kane1941: Check how Pati does it with Assembly Lines
[4:16:27] thecodealive_original: it already is
[4:16:39] Vovosunt: crafting card does nothing there
[4:16:41] Morlega: I don't think that's how it works
[4:16:54] Morlega: Crafting card is only for export busses or (just) the export slots in interfaces
[4:16:56] Snah__: Pog
[4:17:01] drsnaki96: also if you use a toggle bus and toggle redstone when an item is in the core rather than just blocking mode is  more robust system
[4:17:13] kbigLiar: now queue like 2 or 3 to see if they work properly with 10 injector inputs
[4:17:17] kane1941: Does it use max tier conduits?
[4:17:19] TechtasticGamer: TechtasticGamer subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 4 months! 
[4:17:43] DX_Plates: It started teh second one
[4:17:43] Snah__: added too much
[4:17:43] GoodOldXijan: that doenst look good
[4:17:44] Jaydepps00: aaand fucked
[4:17:48] RedalousTheRed: extra nether star blocks
[4:17:50] Snah__: too many slots
[4:17:50] officialhunterx: you have to filter
[4:18:03] Morlega: Didn't set it to blocking mode?
[4:18:06] CoolReal: You can make the injectors in single mod
[4:18:07] Flobu_: is it on blicking mode?
[4:18:15] Vovosunt: just remove 2 blocks
[4:18:19] kbigLiar: just dont hook up 10 injectors here
[4:18:20] mahoriiii77: power output rate too low made it slow?
[4:18:21] Vovosunt: the wyvern ones
[4:18:22] drsnaki96: either remove 2 injectors or do a toggle bus system IMO
[4:18:25] TheUnrealOculus: just send one set at a time
[4:18:29] lava4o4: wt is a compressed infused magma blcok?
[4:18:54] officialhunterx: just filter the item conduit
[4:18:55] Morlega: Use a ME subnetwork crafter?
[4:19:06] kbigLiar: blocking mode lost on one thing
[4:19:11] TuxLafitte: How may side quests have we added?
[4:19:14] kbigLiar: err stack mode
[4:19:15] TuxLafitte: danHmm
[4:19:16] Moobot: You can find Waffle's Youtube channel here - https://youtube.com/giantwaffle
[4:19:22] Vovosunt: you enabled stck mode

[4:19:39] DoubleOughtNot: let pati fix
[4:19:39] BiN_LaGGiN: !
[4:19:43] stormzwest: those are leftover items
[4:19:45] Snah__: top left one
[4:19:49] DemonsDawn: is the interface st to blocking
[4:19:54] kbigLiar: the top left injector holds stacks
[4:20:01] Larsen159: did you enable stack mode on the injectors
[4:20:07] saltedCashewz: top left injector is in stack mode

[4:23:12] fbritoferreira: Wait until he uses laserio
[4:23:14] DaddyDiddy: this is my draconic setup waffle if you need any help after pati sets this first one up
[4:23:30] TuxLafitte: I wish someone would take over the project and put it out for the new releases of Ender...  danSad
[4:23:42] TheUnrealOculus: remove the extra energy conduit my ocd rn
[4:23:49] fbritoferreira: @giantwaffle look at laser io
[4:23:50] Andersxa: FeelsDankMan how does it know then
[4:23:51] kitty_cat20: if you shift left click it opens the conduit interface
[4:23:59] Dizz1227: @TuxLafitte The devs are working on it, you can check the progress on their discord
[4:24:00] TuxLafitte: danP
[4:24:04] winulff: 1.18+ ender IO Pog
[4:24:22] JasonDM_: laser io does have a lot of ability, but at the same time it's a bit more annoying to set up
[4:24:24] Morlega: Item Interface is like a phantom facade inventory-wise for all of the inventories connected with lasers? monkaHmm
[4:24:34] kbigLiar: well, you need 8 of them for the recipe you are trying
[4:24:36] HawtBawlZicles: they're skipping 1.18 and only developing for 1.19+
[4:24:41] TuxLafitte: I know it is a big jump and a lot of work since it goes to the whole new updated version of Java... danS
[4:25:01] Proxyiy: 6Billion
[4:25:18] sipatila: There is a cool new I/O mod called Laser I/O, it was inspired by the ender IO conduits
[4:25:26] xDeadBringerx: EnderIO is extremely dependent on the Forge implementation. The original developer had no interest into porting it to Fabric. Forge has a unified Energy implementation, that's why it's so easy to go uI, AE, rF etc. Fabric has none of that.
[4:25:46] TuxLafitte: I love Ender IO as it is like a Tech and Magic mix...
[4:25:52] fbritoferreira: Is made by direwolf too
[4:25:54] GoodOldXijan: copy pasta
[4:26:10] TuxLafitte: It is suitable for all kinds of different modpacks.

[4:26:16] Vovosunt: it's a proxy block?
[4:26:16] Morlega: It doesn't, it just tries to insert it
[4:26:16] brom321: More power
[4:26:31] Proxyiy: its 6 billion
[4:26:34] kane1941: not enough power
[4:26:37] Morlega: the Item Interface doesn't have an actual interface, it's a "virtual" interface that's a combination of all the connected blocks
[4:26:38] winulff: placement order doesnt matter
[4:26:40] Vovosunt: @Giantwaffle it looks like a proxy block
[4:26:46] chaoskub: Add more transcievers
[4:26:51] kane1941: switch to draconic conduit
[4:26:52] saltedCashewz: the order of the crafting is what it uses for putting in

[4:27:42] PureSpider: can't you just replace enderio conduits to upgrade them?
[4:28:15] PureSpider: was meaning to answer Ras2709 :D sorry
[4:28:26] Morlega: KEKW
[4:28:31] Andersxa: FeelsDankMan how does it know
[4:28:37] deviantdeviations: patti smash SMOrc
[4:28:47] weightmaker: change priority for the middle one aswell
[4:28:55] winulff: "last 2"
[4:28:56] kbigLiar: wait, does this mean blocking works for all the extra injectors added too?
[4:29:01] Vovosunt: @Andersxa it has no storage, it looks at all inventories and AE doesn't push till all of them are empty
[4:29:03] saltedCashewz: No you have to prioritize it and the first slot of the craft is top priority
[4:29:10] DaddyDiddy: the priority on the middle core should be +1, and then one on the interface should be -1
[4:29:16] lava4o4: whats the most expensive item in modded minecraft?
[4:29:17] kane1941: not common KEKW
[4:29:19] TuxLafitte: Patti throwing down the knowledge... danP
[4:29:21] DX_Plates: F power
[4:29:24] Morlega: @Giantwaffle it's very dumb. The Item Interface's "inventory" is fake and basically a combination of all the connected inventories, in the order the lasers got connected. Just make sure the main ingredient is first in the pattern for it to go to into the crafter
[4:29:27] Lightning00Blade: Add more power?
[4:29:29] Andersxa: @Vovosunt but how does it differentiate the middle one from the injectors?
[4:29:34] thecodealive_original: please more dimensional transceivers
[4:29:35] Ras2709: just put a tesseract under all of them?
[4:29:36] Zucate: you could always build a bunch of transceivers ;)
[4:29:39] daedmissica0: what i missed was making a tom collins
[4:29:39] HawtBawlZicles: put down another Tesseract? double the power use the glitch
[4:29:40] DX_Plates: 10x6 billion
[4:29:41] Smileynator: power bugs be wild
[4:29:43] winulff: Its gonna be the biggest bottleneck.
[4:29:46] DoubleOughtNot: 20 minutes or so but whatev
[4:29:48] cmmeth: more transceivers
[4:29:49] Vovosunt: @Andersxa hmmm actually good question idk
[4:29:49] winulff: time and power for draconic
[4:29:57] thexvar1able: just put another transceiver
[4:29:59] nighttron: More transivers
[4:30:04] Kwiatkowskiy: only 100 rookie numbers lol
[4:30:11] kbigLiar: put one transciever with a double octa on each injector
[4:30:24] cmmeth: Wokege
[4:30:26] Smileynator: you mean the geiger counter?
[4:30:36] Wynja: Sounds like a chicken farm
[4:30:38] DX_Plates: And this is just the start of the draconic stuff. Doesn't it have trillion RF recipes?
[4:30:39] Flobu_: but how does it know what to put in the middle?
[4:30:41] Sayiber: yeah i hate it aswell
[4:30:46] weightmaker: sides doesnt matter :p
[4:30:55] Lightning00Blade: Get the better capacitors?
[4:30:59] TigerLuv: ours too
[4:31:03] Morlega: Duping more power NODDERS
[4:31:04] WeakenedSoul: why not just direct attach one to each base?
[4:31:13] Smileynator: sides actually do not matter, only 1 output :P
[4:31:30] SmokeyMcPo7: forgot the bottom
[4:31:34] coopsy_: Sides dont matter though
[4:31:48] chaoskub: Undersides aren't connected
[4:32:01] kane1941: switch to double compressed?
[4:32:05] thexvar1able: the bottoms of the side transceivers
[4:32:18] Foobaah: auto send t1 miners
[4:32:22] saltedCashewz: t1 automation
[4:32:25] weightmaker: how close to creative tank -> infinite netherstars?
[4:32:52] brom321: Double compressed Octatic?
[4:33:10] Nolymit: !mc_pack
[4:33:10] Moobot: Waffle is playing Nomifactory (GTCEu Port) | https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/nomi-ceu | Already missing one deadline, will the bois be able to beat it by NYE 2023? Tune in to every stream to find out! pepeLaugh
[4:33:17] Andersxa: some guy said make sure the main component is the first in the pattern
[4:33:53] weightmaker: yeah JEI places the main item first so its good
[4:33:53] Morlega: ^ but he did it right
[4:34:05] Andersxa: SeemsGood chat
[4:34:14] Snah__: sounds alot cooler without the static
[4:34:19] thecodealive_original: but the double compressed did work for 'receiving'
[4:34:19] FoxeVR: how are the transceivers glitched?
[4:34:27] oggec99: music
[4:34:28] Foobaah: can we get a Clap for pati saving the day yet again
[4:34:29] Morlega: @Giantwaffle I found the bug in the code causing it. More receiving transceivers that are getting quickly drained = more "free" power NODDERS
[4:34:36] brom321: Drag a conduit from the core to the infuser
[4:34:42] Snah__: need more t7 miners
[4:34:52] saltedCashewz: well it wasn't important for the glitch but for normal operations it's better
[4:34:53] hisdue: ppL PianoTime Looking
[4:35:05] Peppermint_Wizard: catJAM
[4:35:20] BronzKneeeCap: NotLikeThis waffle

[4:35:40] daedmissica0: see %
[4:35:49] TuxLafitte: Patti has some serious knowledge with this autocrafting...
[4:35:50] Wetware: Did they figure out where the free energy was coming from yesterday when they were hooking up that draconic thing?
[4:35:57] sp4wn999: look at the ball how it is draining
[4:36:03] kbigLiar: automate those teleporter thingies?
[4:36:04] BronzKneeeCap: more committed to this than SE factorio pepeSmoke
[4:36:06] Kuroiorb: there were a lot of games after lost ark
[4:36:12] DaddyDiddy: @TuxLafitte it's my setup i screenshotted for him and sent him an imgur for it
[4:36:18] weightmaker: look into the middle one to see charge %
[4:36:18] lava4o4: so this like late game?
[4:36:20] hisdue: ball draining simulator now pepeLaugh
[4:36:24] kbigLiar: the draconic advanced teleporter thingy
[4:36:31] cmmeth: @sp4wn999, ball doesn't give a fuck. he is limited by how much his transceivers deliver
[4:36:31] Bulltank: @lava4o4 late game starts after the creative fluid tank
[4:36:33] LastSajin: KEKW
[4:36:35] BronzKneeeCap: HUH
[4:36:36] DemonicHell3: Waffle has everything manual automated. KEKW
[4:36:36] Jaydepps00: HandsUp ?

[4:36:40] Tetsomina: Susge Susge Susge
[4:36:43] nick43087: gachiBASS
[4:36:43] Biskit427: Where do the initial basic resources come from to make items? Do you have to mine for them?
[4:36:47] saltedCashewz: can't you move this near the ball and be faster?
[4:36:48] mrsunman: soon Susge ...
[4:36:49] DaddyDiddy: waffle i only have 40 of these setups and all of them chaotic injectors lol @Giantwaffle
[4:36:52] Bulltank: @Biskit427 deep mob learning
[4:36:54] LaroStar007: Blue balling
[4:36:57] lava4o4: @Bulltank how do u make that thing?
[4:37:02] Tetsomina: catJAM this song kind pog
[4:37:09] Bulltank: @lava4o4 takes a looooong time
[4:37:17] Sworgn: why not build this by the core so you can just not use the transceivers
[4:37:19] DrYProtoss: you could run a conduit directly from the core
[4:37:26] Morph_: he will work twice as hard after that Waffle EZ
[4:37:39] Biskit427: @bulltank thanks! I didn‚Äôt know.
[4:37:47] TheUnrealOculus: use laser releys
[4:37:50] kane1941: or p2p it KEKW
[4:37:56] lava4o4: @Bulltank so creative fuel tank is like the end of the modpack, or is it like more of the beginning to the end?
[4:37:57] TheUnrealOculus: they transfer power so much quicker
[4:37:59] FoxeVR: huge W
[4:38:04] winulff: EZ Clap
[4:38:06] cmmeth: waffleSero
[4:38:07] hisdue: Pog Clap
[4:38:10] Morlega: P2P EZ
[4:38:20] weightmaker: really should start cleanerererererr room
[4:38:32] Bulltank: @lava4o4 its the start of "end game"
[4:38:34] Tetsomina: COPIUM
[4:38:36] ItsTommySon: is this modpack spent entirely doing lab stuff like this? where are the raw resources coming from D:
[4:38:38] mrsunman: @Bulltank creative tank gives infinite of every fluid, there's a lot of grind after you unlock it though to make the creative chest/vending upgrade :)
[4:38:43] DaddyDiddy: you only need to run your mk3 fusion reactor for 2 days to get neutronium
[4:38:55] Tetsomina: @ItsTommySon Miners
[4:39:01] kane1941: mk3
[4:39:06] Wonder_Chris: Waffle, what made you decide between playing base nomi or GTCEu port?
[4:39:16] lvyEartman: mk3 fusion
[4:39:17] lava4o4: @Bulltank ahh ok
[4:39:23] FoxeVR: you need UV power to run that thing yikes
[4:39:27] lava4o4: whats like the most expensive item in the game?
[4:39:34] DX_Plates: @ItsTommySon The drones he is talking about are mining drones, they are consumed but return resources.
[4:39:34] Tetsomina: UV LETSGO
[4:39:37] DaddyDiddy: @lava4o4 creative quantum chest
[4:39:39] Bulltank: @lava4o4 the final item of the game is the creative vending upgrade
[4:39:40] Smileynator: so due to the power bug, we technically will never see that giant reactor will we? PepoSad
[4:39:55] DaddyDiddy: waffle you need to make more
[4:39:57] Snah__: which means you need 3 t7s
[4:39:58] hisdue: Waiting TakingNotes
[4:40:00] Tetsomina: monkaMath
[4:40:06] DaddyDiddy: look at the recipe, you need chaotic injectors to make some of those recipes @Giantwaffle
[4:40:18] weightmaker: iirc you need 11 miners for chaos shards
[4:40:24] Tetsomina: holy cow
[4:40:41] Snah__: LOL
[4:40:41] Tetsomina: that ezzzz so expensive
[4:40:44] winulff: KEKW
[4:40:44] cmmeth: KEKW
[4:40:45] TuxLafitte: danD
[4:40:45] FoxeVR: ouch that is 8 t7s alone
[4:40:51] Snah__: which means 11 t7s
[4:40:57] melenejason13: KEKW
[4:41:05] Tetsomina: D:
[4:41:11] DaddyDiddy: and then you will finally finish the tutorial of the game
[4:41:18] fbritoferreira: Sound like time to fully automate it all
[4:41:19] Morlega: Also need an 11th Draconic injector to upgrade?
[4:41:20] FoxeVR: I say make the t3 reactor first
[4:41:30] thexvar1able: btw you need 10 chaotic enjectors
[4:41:39] DaddyDiddy: yeah you need 10 chaotic injectors
[4:41:40] fbritoferreira: Uv assembler
[4:41:49] Tetsomina: UV assembler too
[4:41:53] lava4o4: aight yea modded mc is crazy
[4:41:56] officialhunterx: solar panel
[4:41:59] DaddyDiddy: solar panel
[4:42:00] Tapeman83: oh, you need way more than 10 chaos injectors KEKW
[4:42:08] FoxeVR: ouchhhh
[4:42:10] Snah__: KEKW
[4:42:16] Tetsomina: like 3x 10 injectors
[4:42:16] TuxLafitte: danD
[4:42:19] Tetsomina: for max powaaaa
[4:42:20] DaddyDiddy: no only 1
[4:42:21] fbritoferreira: You need a uv assembler
[4:42:21] TuxLafitte: 13
[4:42:22] melenejason13: It keeps on giving KEKW
[4:42:23] hisdue: NOP when number goes up but bad
[4:42:26] DaddyDiddy: 1 tier 10 gets you creative tank
[4:42:31] cmmeth: why do you even need solar panels? you have bug power YEP
[4:42:32] Tetsomina: UV assembler too
[4:42:46] Foobaah: isn't titen something like boobs in german?
[4:42:48] PureSpider: creative take Copege
[4:42:52] PureSpider: tank*
[4:42:55] PureSpider: @Foobaah yes :D
[4:43:01] Snah__: creative tank = infinite COPIUM
[4:43:04] daedmissica0: so 4 days time
[4:43:10] LaroStar007: is the creative tank data a fluid? @Giantwaffle
[4:43:16] TuxLafitte: We close danCopium
[4:43:19] PureSpider: yea first creative tank is gonna be for unlimitted copium
[4:43:20] hisdue: creative tank monday
[4:43:20] Morph_: the constant complexity is so good, the day you complete this modpack chat will be FeelsWeakMan
[4:43:21] Frankenstain: Make 16 just in case
[4:43:24] Foobaah: you better get 2 titen then
[4:43:25] lava4o4: wait so wt do creative tanks even do?
[4:43:26] Bulltank: @LaroStar007 it doesnt disappear when making a tank, so you can make unlimited tanks
[4:43:29] SailorWS: infinite copium from the creative tank
[4:43:32] SailorWS: Copege
[4:43:35] Tetsomina: Copege
[4:43:38] FoxeVR: I believe once you create the creative tank, there is enough fluid left after the creative tank craft to mass product creative tanks
[4:43:38] Bulltank: @lava4o4 you can smelt any ingot into liquid and get infinite resources
[4:43:38] Moobot: You can find Waffle's Youtube channel here - https://youtube.com/giantwaffle
[4:43:46] Snah__: automate those dislocators
[4:43:49] daedmissica0: not that bad

[4:44:02] Variandra: @giantwaffle look at the power needed it was like 134 bil
[4:44:04] DrYProtoss: just go autocraft it
[4:44:08] Tetsomina: All fusion cores will need to be automated

[4:45:18] xDeadBringerx: @Giantwaffle Do you have apples and spare extraterastial matter? You can create Chorus that way

[5:19:46] lava4o4: how many diamonds do you even have
[5:19:49] lava4o4: thats crazy
[5:20:07] Morlega: I'm sure there are worse ideas
[5:20:09] DaddyDiddy: you only need like 4 million diamonds to complete the pack or something it's not that bad
[5:20:20] G_stav: Might need grass blocks for them to spawn. Not sure if that's a thing in this version or not
[5:20:24] SailorWS: stick a core on it
[5:20:27] Morlega: It's enabled
[5:20:31] kbigLiar: it needs the upgrades
[5:20:32] Ras2709: needs a core
[5:20:39] Morlega: I think the floor is too far
[5:20:44] Frankenstain: Turn Ci's game room into the chicken death room
[5:20:45] fbritoferreira: Read the quest book it‚Äôs all there
[5:20:45] Dvaina: cant spawn on beddrock?
[5:20:51] Tapeman83: building the killing ground next to the bedrock chicken D:
[5:20:52] DaddyDiddy: it has a core, i think there's already too many chickens around that it doesn't spawn
[5:20:53] maimvice13: use wires to kill theme
[5:20:59] G_stav: I think passive mobs might need grass to spawn
[5:21:18] Morlega: Slap a higher tier core on it and it'll bypass requirements
[5:21:22] DrHax_: wait can you really not just pulverize the millions of fish you have for minced meat?
[5:21:25] Morlega: Wyvern core etc
[5:21:28] DaddyDiddy: the draconic tablet
[5:21:32] DaddyDiddy: will tell you
[5:21:32] THEgoodCOW: nether star, better cores
[5:21:33] joshuagames987: @G_stav That's what I was thinking
[5:21:39] IAmBr3tt: the book
[5:21:39] Shadewe: In the tablet?
[5:21:41] Morlega: Wyvern Core, Draconic Core, Chaotic Core
[5:21:45] fbritoferreira: Draconium book
[5:22:17] Yakobro: or a higher core
[5:22:20] Morlega: or use a Draconic core
[5:22:21] DemonsDawn: you can upgrade it to ignore spawn conditions iiirc
[5:22:23] DonMerkuzio: higher core
[5:22:26] DonMerkuzio: and u dont need those
[5:22:32] jmm548: just place dirt and doen the grass spread to them ?
[5:22:58] coopsy_: Place the spawner on the grass?
[5:23:02] Snah__: day 31, iron pickaxe
[5:23:12] JJenson: D: spikes
[5:23:29] DaddyDiddy: you need to tell it to place dirt
[5:23:29] DemonsDawn: i think you need to throw in like a netherstar, and then it will ignore the spawn requirements altogether
[5:23:35] thebroz1: I mean if there are spikes on the grass then the mobs won't spawn?
[5:23:40] Snah__: KEKW
[5:24:04] G_stav: think the grass needs to be higher so the chickens can spawn.
[5:24:08] InternetPlumber: low light?
[5:24:10] deviantdeviations: WutFace
[5:24:10] kbigLiar: the spawner is too highoff the ground?
[5:24:11] TheSparMan: light?
[5:24:12] Danishwiz: Too high?

[5:24:45] Aucium: redstone signal?
[5:25:13] Yakobro: LUL
[5:25:19] Tapeman83: the powered spawner is easier to use imo

[5:26:52] Face_32: will grass grow underground?
[5:26:54] Morlega: I don't think you can do anything with it except slap a chicken soul from Draconic Evolution into it
[5:26:56] fbritoferreira: Read the book on the upgrades
[5:27:01] SubbDogg: player reqs are removed by wyvern+ cores
[5:27:01] RussianRainbowTV: there's a bunch of upgrades you can put into the spawner
[5:27:02] weightmaker: what do you need chickens for?
[5:27:02] Kipe33: lmao my ass off just read about the decision to move the miami grand prix f1 paddock inside the stadium, that's hilarious
[5:27:34] Morlega: It's missing a soul. Breaking the spawner erases the soul
[5:27:34] SeaOfMadness_: make the powered one
[5:27:35] DonMerkuzio: imagine reading the book KEKW
[5:27:38] RussianRainbowTV: where chicken soul

[5:27:43] Rik_s: Just make the powered one
[5:27:49] G_stav: if you break a draconic spawner you need to place a draconic mob soul into it for it to work
[5:28:09] thexvar1able: reaaaaaaaaaad the book
[5:28:11] Zornd: no grass directly underneath it?

[5:29:02] coopsy_: Put the spawner on the ground!
[5:29:07] jmm548: does it need power
[5:29:07] SeaOfMadness_: just make a draconic core to ignore spawn conditions
[5:29:08] G_stav: mob spawner is 1 below 1 above and 4 from the spawner horizontal, so the grass needs to go one up
[5:29:15] oxido1988: @Giantwaffle you can upgrade the spawner with an goldenapple to ignore the spawn conditions
[5:29:19] RPT_Buddy: passive mob cap?
[5:29:21] SailorWS: there may be too many chickens in the area
