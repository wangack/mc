[0:55:31] Firefly6985: Doing good. Procrastinating getting my chores done before my weekend ends.
[0:55:39] Avarri97: Also, missed adding this earlier: NAS is basically “plugging hard drive(s) into your router.” Potentially good for backups / file storage (can do RAID for redundancy across multiple, attached drives)

[0:57:21] TastyRicePilaf: i'm not ready for another monday NOOO
[0:57:49] Avarri97: For RAID arrays, you can buy pre-made enclosures that have one cable that goes to the router. Then you tell it I want “RAID-1” (duping across all drives in the array). then it looks like a regular drive (on the network)
[0:57:49] Firefly6985: NAS probably wouldnt have much value for you. Its better for sharing files on a network between PCs.
[0:57:53] Draxksy: @linkzzey I am named my new axolotl Linkzzey linkzzeyGig linkzzeyGig is this ok ?
[0:58:02] TastyRicePilaf: Always nice to hear linkzzeyBlush

[1:26:50] mrraw619: out of curiosity, why don't you use golden carrots for the higher saturation?

[1:27:06] Amandroid: !porkchops @mrraw619
[1:27:06] Wickednush: @Paisley_the_Midlife_Noob linkzzeyClass linkzzeyHug
[1:27:06] StreamElements: Cooked pork is 0.4 more 🍗 "food points" than golden carrots, which = sprinting 4 blocks, 2 sprint jumps, or digging 80 blocks. If you eat because you can't run, to become full you would need 3 golden carrots but only 2 porkchops, which would save you  1.61 seconds of eating time and 1 food slot linkzzeyNoted Cooked pork is a cheaper villager trade as well linkzzeyClass

[3:07:44] Okie_Dokey_Loki: I've had a beard since I got out of the Military in 2008...  cept for one time I shaved it all off and took pictures of the process KEKW
[3:08:05] Agrippa39: Yeah because you don't AFK, that's the only real way they work
[3:08:30] Okie_Dokey_Loki: I don't look right with a stache...
[3:08:39] Amandroid: dankWish I've always kinda wanted to fully shave my head, just to see what it's like... I just don't wanna deal with the years of regrowth time
[3:09:16] lovely_beez: @Amandroid peepoWish that would be such a commitment
[3:09:22] Okie_Dokey_Loki: @Amandroid Do it.. you can have a fawhawk in the process
[3:09:31] Des_troy_er: depends on how long you want it to grow back
[3:09:34] Brixxii: PepeHands the ugly stages of regrown will be the worst
[3:09:42] Rectifeye: Can't relate  #bald
[3:09:44] Amandroid: @Okie_Dokey_Loki linkzzeyGig I've actually done a pixie cut and an undercut before - just wish I'd done the full thing
[3:09:55] Okie_Dokey_Loki: I'm in a ugly stage of regrowth right now.. Just enough to look like I'm growing a mullet.
[3:09:59] Hunerzzeydaman: aww the warden is playing LUBBERS
[3:10:00] lovely_beez: who knows though, could fall in love with the short hair style though Gladge
[3:10:14] Amandroid: it took about 2 years to get from my pixie cut to where my hair is now, and I want it longer
[3:10:34] Okie_Dokey_Loki: Want it longer but wants to shave it off... Makes sense
[3:10:53] Amandroid: @lovely_beez PepeHands I loved when my hair was short... I just like it long, too - I wish I could go back and forth easily
[3:10:55] Brixxii: dankNotes maybe just buy a few good wigs
[3:11:02] AngryBeavers17: PETTHEBALD

[3:11:55] Amandroid: @Okie_Dokey_Loki linkzzeyGig I'd consider it if I didn't have such RIDICULOUSLY sensitive skin - I've worn a wig before, and they're always just so itchy
[3:12:13] bradydied: i respect people who can rock short hair, my forehead is too big for that linkzzeyGig
[3:12:44] Okie_Dokey_Loki: @Amandroid  do the infamous Skullet where you buzz everything but the mullet KEKW
[3:13:09] lovely_beez: i liked having short hair but i prefer longer hair on me, feels like it fits me better. i regret cutting it Gladge

[3:14:06] lovely_beez: it was to my lower back and i cut it to my shoulders linkzzeyGig
[3:14:13] AngryBeavers17: IASKED

[3:15:24] Amandroid: linkzzeyGig there's a lot of maintenance that goes into keeping a short cut, too
[3:15:25] bradydied: why maintain hair when you can play minecraft instead?
[3:15:37] lovely_beez: @Amandroid so true OMEGALUL
[3:15:44] KylerW: sup

[3:16:06] KylerW: good man how r u
[3:16:06] Amandroid: @lovely_beez PepeHands I don't have it in me to keep going back to the salon - a big reason why I like having my hair longer linkzzeyGig
[3:16:16] RizNyx: i look like a viking with my heard and hair lol
[3:16:20] MrLanny: no it's good, it's funny to me, it's who i am so it was always gonna happen anyway but i looked in the mirror that day and realised how much I'd been missing
[3:16:23] Okie_Dokey_Loki: Yeah it seems to get all those loose ones out pretty good
[3:16:27] Des_troy_er: both can be a lot of maintenance depending on what style of short hair you have.... even with short hair my hair routine to get it where i want it takes almost an hour
