[0:37:47] sam1390: max roll says 20 to 25 on relic weapon is about 206 of the leapstones above greater
[0:37:51] warmwalrus: the more 1370's you have the easier it gets
[0:37:59] TammoNL: true mainly so many alts is draining.. only using rested now
[0:38:00] Neonnimbus: 1370 alts are the best. halting them alts at 1325 is only worth if you don't like playing the class to much
[0:38:10] TammoNL: maining*
[0:38:13] Shinimi: i ignore a lot of stuff on my alts. doing em on rest
[0:38:24] AIex_0: thats why i made more soulfists instead LuL

[0:39:50] jojoh70: surge is super hard but only in end content which we dont have yet KEKW
[0:39:51] priestoh: surge db is just hard if you wanna min max your surge stacks in a legion raid perfectly, ppl over reacting on it
[0:39:57] sindraxx: i guess they didnt mean its hard to play but hard to reach full potential
[0:39:57] Im_Axz: tbh the content in where you define the difficulty of a class is not out yet
