[5:05:49] melinduhh_: this was just a rough draft
[5:05:54] thicctorbelmont: Basalt biome is hell biome
[5:05:56] jazr4: yea in a basalt biome or find a new bastion for the magma spawner
[5:05:56] Ophy: I would say making the farm by the magma cube spawner in the bastion. Seems like it would be the easiest way
[5:05:58] spookydorian: well shit here we go again! 8 months already! i have a bit m.i.a lately but i always gotta make sure i come back and resubscribe dinkLovee
[5:05:59] andreavoories: Chat should I skip my last class of the day? It’s so chilly dinkCozy

[5:09:55] jazr4: those biomes freak me out. the change of colour and sounds are freaky
[5:09:55] kylepraschan: are VODS broken on twitch or have they been taken down. This may be a dumb question, I haven't been able to keep up with streams lately bc of college
[5:10:01] flovaar: cloey you look good today has chat said that today
[5:10:01] HeyItsLupa: was it down a hallway off of the highway?

[5:10:41] abbyingie: this is random but I just saw a tik tok of someone putting edible glitter in their peas. thought y'all should know lol
[5:10:42] DiscountConcrete: Thank you for the advice everyone!!!
[5:10:42] bahannah_peppers: @DiscountConcrete honestly if you need to sleep, you need to sleep. That's what your body is telling you you need right now and that's okay. Going for a short walk may wake you up a bit, finding other little hobbies that keep your hands busy helps, or just practicing cognitive behavioral therapy methods to help your brain work through what it needs to
[5:10:51] IssaSneech: I’m gonna fall asleep if this music keeps playing
[5:10:51] playgrlzarr: just joined !!what’s happening

[5:11:44] enraged_psychopath: slay stream rn
[5:11:50] CloeyBee: Reeeebaa <3 <3
[5:11:53] froggy_20: Is the shaded keeping it from spawning in?
[5:11:53] waywardraven03: this is a great place for a froglight farm
[5:11:56] CloeyBee: NODDERS
[5:11:58] DiscountConcrete: I guess it's just a sticky thing for me cuz I also have ADHD with executive dysfunction so even if I get excited or interested in something I get stuck
[5:12:00] bahannah_peppers: Are there frogs in the nether??? Or are those the things that walk around in the lava that you can ride?
[5:12:02] harls4899: @reeeebaa dinkLovee dinkLovee dinkLovee
[5:12:07] grits_n_greens: Hi chat!! Hows it going?
[5:12:10] IssaSneech: Reeeebaa dinkLov
[5:12:13] dakodasquid: @discountconcrete no SAME it’s so bad
[5:12:14] bausky: i love the name reba
[5:12:15] waywardraven03: over a lava lake is good, its the nether equivalent of an xp farm in the sky or void
[5:12:17] bahannah_peppers: @DiscountConcrete do you have a therapist you go to regularly?
[5:12:17] flovaar: dinkLovee dinkLovee dinkLovee dinkLovee
[5:12:22] kylepraschan: @CloeyBee gotcha! I thought they might go away after some time but I didn't think that recent streams (for example like yesterday) would be taken down quickly. Thank you!
[5:12:22] sierrarumbaugh: hiii unfluffy_bunny_
[5:12:31] locksley_91: @discountconcrete same!!!!! it's so hard isn't it!
[5:12:31] Ophy: @bahannah_peppers He has to bring frogs to the nether but I think he's looking for a good spot for the magama cube mobs
[5:12:35] mayavocado_: dinkLovee dinkLovee dinkLovee dinkLovee dinkLovee dinkLovee dinkLovee dinkLovee dinkLovee dinkLovee dinkLovee dinkLovee dinkLovee dinkLovee dinkLovee dinkLovee dinkLovee dinkLovee dinkLovee dinkLovee dinkLovee dinkLovee dinkLovee dinkLovee dinkLovee dinkLovee dinkLovee dinkLovee dinkLovee dinkLovee dinkLovee dinkLovee dinkLovee dinkLovee dinkLovee

[5:12:49] pootNsnoot: hi julen
[5:12:52] ShortHotMom: @discountconcrete also it’s really good for right before bed because it calms you and can allow you to get quality sleep. I find it much harder to get enough sleep, even sleeping hours extra, if my mind is racing before bed or if I can’t stop thinking about the things I’ve been putting off especially having ADHD. I use a 15 minute one from YouTube and it takes some getting used to but it is super helpful!
[5:13:00] Ophy: @bahannah_peppers You're welcome :D
[5:13:05] citysneaks_: citysneaks_ subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months! 
[5:13:05] aj_hersko: When will this stream be posted on YouTube?
[5:13:08] HeyItsLupa: is the red thing one of those springy boys?
[5:13:09] grits_n_greens: @sierrarumbaugh hiii hope you are having a good day! :)
[5:13:09] Reeeebaa: thanks dink fam dinkLovee dinkLovee
[5:13:15] DiscountConcrete: @bahannah_peppers I used to, but I changed insurance providers and I'm honestly okay when work forces me to get up, but on stints of time off I feel guilty about wasting it, even if I'm just relaxing
[5:13:22] CloeyBee: @kylepraschan Yeah i just tried to look at the vods and i think twitch is tripppinnngg!! <3
[5:13:28] CloeyBee: @unfluffy_bunny_ hello!
[5:13:34] catspionage: @discountconcrete I also struggle with adhd and I find that finding something enjoyable to do with your hands helps with the distraction. like I enjoy knitting, but there’s lots of things like painting or making things out of clay etc. I’ll do it while I watch a show and then I find it easier not to get distracted from either because I’m doing both at once!
[5:13:38] aj_hersko: Can someone explain the frog lights
[5:13:40] juaumkvra: what about te magma spawners inside the bastion?
[5:13:40] StreamElements: this is a safe place for us all to chat but remember we are also here to play video games and hang out <3 if you'd like to discuss current events there is a channel for it in our discord
[5:13:45] locksley_91: @discountconcrete relaxing is not a waste of time xx
[5:13:46] Ophy: Ooh ohh, has anyone ever seen the Minecraft world this one old lady spent 6 years working on and building?
[5:13:49] kylepraschan: @CloeyBee gotcha! glad to know its not just me haha
[5:13:52] Ophy: It's so awesome.
[5:13:57] MollyColdy: Gotta head to work, thank you for the background noise Julen <3 Bye all!

[5:14:11] lizzydorgan: am backkk
[5:14:14] melinduhh_: @kylepraschan twitch did this the other day. check back in like an hour or so
[5:14:18] bahannah_peppers: @DiscountConcrete relaxing is neverrrrrr ever a waste of time. The "hustle culture" that's become prevalent in the last few years has conditioned us to feel guilty when we aren't constantly working towards making money or doing side gigs or whatever. Relaxing is not only okay but it's necessary for your physical, mental, and emotional health.

[5:14:43] thicctorbelmont: @discountconcrete big same. I’m struggling with that now too. One thing that might help is getting some good food. Sometimes eating a delicious meal can help me. Also a big thing is that even though it’s not easy try not to feel too guilty. You’re not alone in these struggles and it’s definitely not your fault.

[6:29:07] reverie897: "Moon phases affect how much damage mobs do, whether they spawn with items and armor, and how much starvation and explosion affect your health. The larger/fuller the Moon, the more Skeletons and Zombies are likely to pick up dropped items. Additionally, they’ll spawn with more enchantments on their armor. In Hard mode, it’s more likely that spiders will spawn with status effects, like Invisibility. And finally, during a Full Moon, 50% of all cats that spawn will be black."

[7:44:14] yannatto: maybe you're too close for them to spawn
[7:44:15] Hawk8y8: I think to spawn magma cubes you'd need to be in the nether and 24 blocks away minimum

[7:48:03] azhiirah: frog headcount check
[7:48:03] tippacanoe: i'm so confused, what is he doing with frogs in the nether?
[7:48:05] EnglandJDM: almost had frog legs for dinner
[7:48:09] harlicorn: Did that thing light a frog on fire
[7:48:11] Ophy: Okay, so space is good and the biome is right
[7:48:12] briiimcfly: OMg wait did your frogs survive ?
[7:48:13] delmi: Gayge modCheck
[7:48:14] MaliaAniston: Lmaooooo
[7:48:17] Hawk8y8: @tippacanoe they eat magma cubes and poop frog lights
[7:48:18] OriahThallium: if you put spikes everywhere else, the magma cubes will spawn here
[7:48:19] s_woods_: @cloeybee the worse part is the school is only 20 min away but they just don’t want to drive the kids so instead they wake up so fricken early
[7:48:25] palmtopcorie: gonna lurk and read hehe
[7:48:30] MayZ98: I got the notification that you were live before my shift and now im home from work AND YOU'RE STILL LIVE LOL love that for me though

[7:48:43] plasticbeech: Does anyone know if the older vods are gone forever? dinkNervous
[7:48:43] MajestiicCasual: who knew frogs were such difficult pets
[7:48:43] Ophy: Ohh, I see why the iron golem. Apparently magma cubes seek out players and golems
[7:48:44] mgnnnn6: do you need to be at a specific height for magma's to spawn????
[7:48:47] saintmaria75: mobs wont spawn within 24 blocks of a player. you can build a platform up in the sky and they should spawn below you
[7:48:53] BrittK: so is this like a little greenhouse for the frogs
[7:48:53] thisbeech__: Ok y’all I’m going to bed, I had so much fun and can’t wait for next stream. Thanks again @bebopbadger for the gift sub! Goodnight fam dinkLovee

[7:49:50] CloeyBee: okie briii! >#
[7:49:51] PlantNerd93: @julien you could search for magmas, chop them up and lure the little ones into the enclosure
[7:49:51] goosewithnoclue: dinkOh

[7:49:58] CloeyBee: thisbeech__ nightt!!
[7:50:02] musicassi: If you spawn proof the nearby area it should help force more mobs to spawn within your box
[7:50:08] PipsKay56: they be Kermit de Frog 🐸 lol
[7:50:11] CoureyPie: @jordisalt I thought they were her kicking but the nurse heard me laughing and came in and said she had the hiccups haha
[7:50:29] hawkmothss: you should change the stream title to frog noises lmao

[7:50:32] Lady_Sadge: There’s a frog stuck in my house rn and I can’t get it out and I thought I imagined hearing a frog
[7:50:38] Ophy: Torches

[7:50:45] waywardraven03: buttons or slabs
[7:50:46] CoureyPie: @hawkmothss -ribbit ribbit-
[7:50:49] OriahThallium: torches, spikes, and carpets
[7:50:53] sarahthestego: we can try to hunt for a spawner. Magma cube spawners generate in the treasure room of bastions.
[7:50:55] not_sequoia: lure it in!
[7:50:56] OriahThallium: or buttons and slabs
[7:50:57] Torchee_: Place slabs on everything lol
[7:51:00] musicassi: Buttons are a cheap way to spawn proof
[7:51:01] CoureyPie: @bebopbadger I never felt them with my first so it was really cool to experience!!!
[7:51:09] Ophy: torches prevent hostile mob spawns within 7 blocks in each direction. So placing out torches will prevent mobs from spawning in that area
[7:51:09] PipsKay56: Gollum: what is it precious, it is tasty?
[7:51:11] BreHive: Bottom half slabs, buttons, pressure plates. Different stuff mobs can’t spawn on
[7:51:24] Goode1000: can he see through glass?
[7:51:34] lizzydorgan: it was a twitch bug the vods weren't showing for some reason

[8:03:53] musicassi: @halomars Same! Pixl is a legend
[8:03:54] Ophy: You cannot break it or move it. You can't craft it. You would HAVE to build the farm there

[8:04:07] chickpealuvr17: i thought we broke the spawners tho

[8:04:16] kamikazekay_9: ooo a tunnel would work
[8:04:19] quibmellow_: silk touch??
[8:04:19] sirenaren: dinkHello
[8:04:20] freckledkush: dont you have silk ttouch
[8:04:21] teareptile: can you steal the spawner w silk touch ?
[8:04:27] chelseag13: You can with silk touch!
[8:04:28] sarahthestego: yeah i thought you could if you have silk touch
[8:04:28] blake7798: Silk touch
[8:04:29] EnglandJDM: yeah a tunnel!!
[8:04:29] Hawk8y8: I think this will work, you just have to be nearby in the nether for them to spawn naturally
[8:04:30] OriahThallium: no you cant silk touch it
[8:04:33] Bugga1213: can't silk touch spawners
[8:04:34] DarKrow_: Are you on the latest version
[8:04:37] TeoAsh94: nope cant silk touch spawner, but u could use these frogs to breed more. if u take two over that should be good
[8:04:37] bebopbadger: ooh good call @teareptile silk touch!
[8:04:38] wednesdayshawty: make a tunnel with a rail system from the spawner to the farm
[8:04:42] dest_tinycat: Can you grab a spawner with silk?
[8:04:42] BreHive: I don’t think you can get spawners anymore
[8:04:43] melinduhh_: it doesn't work anymore. they nerfed it
[8:04:44] bebopbadger: damn
[8:04:45] carmens: delm fdghs slaying for #bebrave and ingame ones fair fair NODDERS
[8:04:46] lorithevirgo: Also to get different color frogs they have to grow up somewhere other than the cold biome
[8:04:49] carolinemrdn: ayo rt wednesday
[8:04:50] bebopbadger: IT GOT NERFED? CMON
[8:04:52] Ophy: I mentioned using the spawner when you were talking about where to make the farm and someone said you and will busted the magma spawner in the bastion place you guys found earlier so I don't know if that one is still there or not
[8:04:53] sarahthestego: oh that must be an old thing. i haven’t played a recent update
[8:05:00] triopop: A frog leash?
[8:05:03] SaucyEL: BRO how do i just miss the entire streams
[8:05:06] Nena_00001: dinkHello
[8:05:08] Keeb33: You can only pick up spawners in bedrock i believe
[8:05:11] LaikaFromSpace: it must be tough to put a frog on a leash
[8:05:12] tayloralva: hey nena
[8:05:14] Hawk8y8: it's slipper weather
[8:05:18] jazr4: u just need to find the way magma spawn on their own! you dont need a spawner necessarily papa
[8:05:26] bebopbadger: hey besties joining dinkDance spiggFlower
[8:05:29] PaperMoniker: youve got thissss
[8:05:30] Nena_00001: Hi just checking dinkLov dinkLov
[8:05:31] sm0kybritt: is this the in game music
[8:05:34] wednesdayshawty: a magma cube will sit in a minecart. transport them with a rail system
[8:05:34] pagyun: this biome is terrible to travel in lol
[8:05:34] hiddensquidstv: brain power
[8:05:47] bebopbadger: i was supposed to sleep hours ago i’m too hooked on FrogGate
[8:05:50] morgan_gibbs_: I just got here, is this juliens personal world?
[8:05:53] OriahThallium: if you prevent them from spawning other places with buttons, they will spawn in the chamber dellyHeart
[8:06:08] SaucyEL: @OriahThalia youre so true
[8:06:10] triopop: you should make a frog cage a put them all in there
[8:06:13] mamacarmina: I have a coworker so deathly afraid of frogs she’ll cry
[8:06:19] sarahthestego: ok reddit says that u can’t take spawners anymore like you use to
[8:06:21] CoureyPie: @morgan_gibbs_ it's the one he has with will
[8:06:24] bebopbadger: @morgan_gibbs_ yep! regular world and we’re in the nether today dinkDance
[8:06:28] HaloMars: fascinating how ice stays solid over a pool of lava loll
[8:06:30] not_sequoia: just do the opening you have with trap doors
[8:06:43] CoureyPie: @halomars right?! in a place water evaporates lol
[8:06:47] SaucyEL: @HaloMars its not just ice its PACKED ice
[8:06:52] morgan_gibbs_: Thanks guys!!!
[8:07:00] wednesdayshawty: @HaloMars it's packed ice, different from regular.
[8:07:02] musicassi: You can put buttons around the general area to spawn proof it
[8:07:05] bebopbadger: yeah i agree with @not_sequoia trap doors at the top will work. u can hop in and out and spawns can’t
[8:07:13] lanaoakles: If u put cobble slabs in the surrounding area it should limit where they can spawn but big big job
[8:07:17] jennythebeannn: can you make a spawner?
[8:07:30] waywardraven03: most froglight farms are on the nether roof, are you opposed to going up there?
[8:07:33] itchycar: trap doors and spawn proof the area?
[8:07:34] TeoAsh94: @jennythebeann unfortunately dinkNaur
[8:07:36] not_sequoia: the luring is the only thing I can think of besides a spawner…
[8:07:38] CoureyPie: @jennythebeann I don't think you can
[8:07:40] JordiSalt: My ear hole hurts
[8:07:46] HaloMars: @saucyel @wednesdayshawty oh thank you lol but STILL
[8:07:54] CoureyPie: @jordisalt that's unfortunate I'm sorry
[8:07:58] mamacarmina: @jordisalt catKISS mwah feel better
[8:07:58] planet_cafe: hes a lil shy
[8:08:04] jennythebeannn: hm bummer
[8:08:12] StoneyxBones: watching this for so long, i genuinely wanna get back into minecraft now dinkYes
[8:08:12] bebopbadger: u got this!
[8:08:21] wednesdayshawty: you have to glitch through to get up there, but it's part of the game. not an exploit, imo
[8:08:24] caseymeowmeowmeow: have you done an ancient city yet? :o
[8:08:24] sherlock_norris: hang on, I just joined, but IS THAT TERL IN YOUR LEFT HAND??
[8:08:29] bebopbadger: @triplllesiiix do it bestie join us muahaha vodkas7Jam
[8:08:30] BreHive: It used to be a glitch but they decided to make it a feature after a while, you’re allowed to do it but you have to use different ways to get through it
[8:08:38] sarahthestego: i love puzzles let’s go
[8:08:38] OriahThallium: if you prevent them from spawning other places with buttons, they will spawn in the chamber dellyHeart plus buttons are cheap
[8:08:38] Hawk8y8: it's certainly not supposed to be accessed, but the devs have known and haven't patched it
[8:08:42] mamacarmina: Holy shit that is terl isn’t it?
[8:08:42] CoureyPie: @sherlock_norris yes it's a terl totem!
[8:08:49] CloeyBee: carmina it is!!
[8:08:50] bebopbadger: @sherlock_norris HE HAS A TERL TOTEM MOD YESS

[8:09:24] waywardraven03: instead of trap doors, do vertical chains, so only the small ones fall in there. You can have an iron golem at the top to kill the big ones after
[8:09:26] LexLuthor2196: "take a picture it will last longer"
[8:09:27] wednesdayshawty: he friend

[8:09:36] bebopbadger: @kats_pajamas_ sleep well bestie!! spiggFlower
[8:09:38] sarahthestego: i think if we find the spawner and make a tunnel so there’s no where else they can go it could work
[8:09:39] itchycar: @waywardraven03 super smart
[8:09:48] not_sequoia: good thinking @waywardraven03
[8:09:49] EnglandJDM: @waywardraven03 biggggg brain
[8:09:49] lsplitz33: can you try just chilling like 40 blocks above the farm? the mobs may not be spawning there because you are too close
[8:09:51] SaucyEL: who wants a gift sub lol
[8:09:51] jazr4: julen sspawn proof the surrounding areas with carpet. magma should be spawning in the area where the frogs are

[8:15:12] haleyihardlyknowher: Why not just completely close off the roof & put a door to get in & out
[8:15:12] bebopbadger: yeah can u lower the ceiling itself or would that make it unbalanced?
[8:15:15] CoureyPie: will they not spawn if the roof is closed 100%?
[8:15:15] SaucyEL: @marc_with_a_k_ omg rip

[8:15:45] itsCaprise: Thanks for streaming so long Julen, it's been so fun
[8:15:46] itsnotgrace: will the frogs despawn if you leave? that would be a bummer
[8:15:47] sophsch15: Close the roof except for one block? haha
[8:15:49] assphyxiati0n: You can place pillars in sections of the room, leaving 1 block height enough room for the little ones to spawn?
[8:15:52] ktlovespurple: Can you make a reserve frog zoo somewhere safe pls
[8:15:56] mamacarmina: What colors do they have?
[8:15:56] bebopbadger: vodkas7Jam vodkas7Jam
[8:15:58] quesamiaa: maybe the opening is too big?
[8:16:00] not_sequoia: you’re literally doing so well julien
[8:16:02] sarahthestego: let’s see if it will hurt the frog and be on stand by
[8:16:06] bebopbadger: turn the friggin frogs gay
[8:16:10] nottneb: @mexiass22, he doesn't have a po box
[8:16:11] she_wumbo: if you get the other colors does it give different colored lights?
[8:16:14] bebopbadger: dinkDance

[8:16:28] CoureyPie: @she_wumbo yes!
[8:16:29] pagyun: you need hoppers to pick up the lights dont you
[8:16:31] bebopbadger: my dude this is going so well! no frets
[8:16:31] mimi__l: What if the roof entrance is more then 8 high the rest of the roof is short?
[8:16:34] LexLuthor2196: i'm not sure this is ethical research dinkKek
[8:16:39] NickyNicole21: i just googled it and didnt see anything about the big ones killing the frogs
[8:16:40] z_mbiegamer: it’s kinda funny that slime and magma hop like frogs do
[8:16:40] Chronic802: he thicc
[8:16:46] sarahthestego: omg
[8:16:48] haleyihardlyknowher: He too thicc

[8:17:08] Bugga1213: bigger hole
[8:17:10] CoureyPie: @sarahthestego lmaoooo
[8:17:10] HaloMars: will it follow if you go down ?
[8:17:11] haleyihardlyknowher: Can you just fall through the roof for sciene
[8:17:11] wednesdayshawty: smack him in j
[8:17:13] sarahmstache: SARAh HAhah
[8:17:13] delmi: get in the hole sir peepoRiot
[8:17:13] not_sequoia: he’s a little husky
[8:17:18] Ophy: I know how you can do this, but I don't know if it will work the same way because of not having a spawner. I don't know if the snow would prevent them from spawning at all
[8:17:19] morganz23: when you.. when you
[8:17:22] PlantNerd93: @julien it seems like you can just mature tadpoles in the different temperature biomes. so get tadpoles, go to biomes and mature them there
[8:17:25] nottneb: 🤨
[8:17:25] mamacarmina: Hole in one
[8:17:26] ktlovespurple: You have to jump in
[8:17:32] mexiass22: Gg
[8:17:34] rubylover: a bby
[8:17:35] woodsia: i don't think he gives af about the frogs
[8:17:36] kaekale: @delmi ?
[8:17:38] glitchWitch666: shoot him
[8:17:43] bebopbadger: HES JUST VIBING
[8:17:45] not_sequoia: I’m pretty sure he only will agro you right?
[8:17:46] theancientginger: AN ENDERMAN STOLE A DIRT BLOCK AND ALL MY CHICKENS GOT OUT dinkOmegalul dinkGasm dinkRage
[8:17:47] delmi: FeelsDankMan
[8:17:50] PipsKay56: I love the purple
[8:17:53] jazr4: theres gotta be a way to do damage to the magma
[8:17:55] murrrose: I just got back how are the froggies
[8:18:00] LexLuthor2196: peepoClap
[8:18:01] cathyduv: they're just vibing and hopping together
[8:18:02] eykru: @theancientginger pain
[8:18:03] nottneb: hi kae! pokiWave
[8:18:05] sarahthestego: unlead one and see?
[8:18:08] HaloMars: dinkOno
[8:18:10] HeyItsLupa: but hes also not a chompible size
[8:18:10] hannahgenie: dude I want to play mc so bad right now
[8:18:12] CatCraftter: it needs to be the tiny magma cubes
[8:18:12] haleyihardlyknowher: I think he likes them
[8:18:12] quesamiaa: try off leash too just in case
[8:18:13] Ophy: They do not attack the frogs
[8:18:17] kaekale: hi ben! himboHey
[8:18:17] bebopbadger: @theancientginger NOO THE NERVE OMG DID U FIND THEM SAFELY
[8:18:18] Ophy: Packed snow
[8:18:19] PaperMoniker: They seem safe
[8:18:20] wednesdayshawty: they don't.
[8:18:22] jenburnett: Will he if they’re off leads?
[8:18:26] lorithevirgo: Take them off leash to really see
[8:18:26] sumtimreh: fall damage?
[8:18:34] PaperMoniker: Yeah maybe fall damage like the xp farms
[8:18:34] sophsch15: someone earlier said maybe an iron gollum up top and the littles falls down?
[8:18:37] HaloMars: spike bushes?
[8:18:40] caseymeowmeowmeow: iron golem?
[8:18:42] calelytra: iron golems
[8:18:43] wednesdayshawty: small magmas don't spawn naturally, only large/medium.
[8:18:44] EvieDink: eatin good
[8:18:48] LexLuthor2196: hungry for short kings got it Chatting
[8:18:48] bebopbadger: any forms of food u can give them
[8:18:51] caseymeowmeowmeow: ohhh oop
[8:18:53] SaucyEL: i dont think they take fll damage
[8:18:58] BreHive: I don’t think they take fall damage
[8:18:59] SaucyEL: fall**
[8:18:59] theancientginger: @bebopbadger I’m trying to corral them with seeds rn rip 😭
[8:19:02] itsCaprise: You could build a series of arrow shooters and collectors using hoppers
[8:19:03] mexiass22: Omg they’re so cute
[8:19:03] PaperMoniker: Hm…then golems
[8:19:04] Ophy: Snooooow
[8:19:07] HeyItsLupa: maybe golum in a larger area with an short space for small ones to escape over to the frogs
[8:19:11] muchoparty: A night sensor?
[8:19:13] hikeliketheverb: what if you made holes big enough that the small ones fall through but big ones and iron golum dont
[8:19:16] assphyxiati0n: Build pillars coming down from the ceiling leaving only enough room for the smaller ones to spawn and move
[8:19:18] snowylaur: powdered snow
[8:19:18] sumtimreh: low ceiling so only littles spawn ?
[8:19:19] muchoparty: Hight*
[8:19:20] SaucyEL: @Ophy does snow hurt them
[8:19:20] caitlinj1596: What if you corner the iron golem in
[8:19:21] ranemoon04: @ophy yes!
[8:19:25] rachh555: i think the roof bein 1 block may actually work bc they only spawn to. fit their enviroment?
[8:19:29] caitlinj1596: So he can only kill what’s close to him
[8:19:31] mogzbogz: Cage the iron golems legs so he can’t reach the little ones to kill
[8:19:33] sofiaisthecoolest: leash the froggggg
[8:19:33] whatrhymeswithsam: someone before said something about vertical chains so only the little ones fall through and you can have the golem on top
[8:19:37] Lorien_Nicole: What if the golems could only reach the big ones, like higher up.
[8:19:37] waywardraven03: vertical chain roof, littles will fall through. Iron golem on roof killing bigs
[8:19:37] Ophy: The powdered snow one block off the floor
[8:19:39] EnglandJDM: this might be wild but if you put in a golem and unleash the frogs could they get to the baby magmas before the golem?
[8:19:41] mamacarmina: Gonna rest up for tomorrows exciting stream hypeE byebye! Bedge
[8:19:42] momorganplease: DRIPTSTONE SPIKES
[8:19:42] BreHive: Iron bars or chains so the bigger sizes stay on top of it but the small ones fall through?
[8:19:43] cc_rode: cc_rode subscribed at Tier 2. They've subscribed for 54 months! I'm turning 30 next week!! Any advice? Much love ❤️
[8:19:43] SaucyEL: @rachh555 they dont spawn unless theres enough room for the biggest ones
[8:19:46] Djvalpal: Can you do some weird stuff with pistons??
[8:19:52] SaucyEL: @momorganplease okkk big brain
[8:19:52] Lorien_Nicole: like platform the golems.
[8:19:53] CatCraftter: i have it so that i have packed snow a block above the floor, killing the medium and big magmas but leaving the smaller ones for the frogs
[8:19:56] CloeyBee: 54 POGSPIN
[8:19:56] shortwonderland: if you made the roof all fences, would the little ones fall through?
[8:20:00] rachh555: @rachh555 rats
[8:20:00] HeyItsLupa: you'll lose some of the small ones who dont escape, but hopefully if the golum space is small enough they will kind of be forced to the other area
[8:20:01] waywardraven03: The little ones will try to attack the iron golem
[8:20:03] chopsie_tb: Buy a ton of asprin
[8:20:04] momorganplease: If they fall on dripstone I think they take damage. The regular slimes do
[8:20:06] songbird1618: oh its a Julen. Hi Julen
[8:20:10] Yum_Yum_DuH: Hi hotties!! I finished my placement for study and only have 3 weeks left I’m so pumped
[8:20:13] PlantNerd93: @julien maybe use automated pistons with pressure plates, so when the magmas trigger the pistons they get pushed into the roof and take damage?
[8:20:19] dest_tinycat: What hurts them? Water? Could you use that to get them small
[8:20:21] seeestar: make a small spawn room above and have it funnel into tall frog groom
[8:20:23] ginamarissa: pressure plates that connect to a dispenser with arrows?
[8:20:23] jazr4: yea that would be the move! the gollem has to be locked up but be able to reach the bigger magma
[8:20:24] SaucyEL: @Yum_Yum_DuH omg congrats
[8:20:25] HeyItsLupa: for real @waywardraven03?
[8:20:26] bebopbadger: @theancientginger i hope u find them all omg i would sob 😭 an ender got my cat 2 weeks ago as i was hiding in water, go hunt that mf down!! REVENGE FOR THE CHICKIES 🐥 dinkRage dinkCry
[8:20:30] CoureyPie: @dest_tinycat you can't have water in the nether
[8:20:36] SaucyEL: @dest_tinycat u cant places water
[8:20:42] chopsie_tb: Is there anything like a dart trap?
[8:20:52] Ophy: >.>
[8:20:54] BreHive: If you make a way for the small ones to fall in a pit but keep the big ones above it?
[8:20:54] General4Skn: Powdered snow for freeze damage passively to the magmas
[8:20:56] LionheartWorthy: dispenser with arrows only tall enough to hit the cubes?
[8:21:01] PlantNerd93: true but with their size I don't think they take damage
[8:21:05] shortwonderland: would little slimes fit through a roof made of fences?
[8:21:08] CoureyPie: @catcraftter had a suggestion for what worked for them!!!
[8:21:10] Yvonne1137: the snow you fall through with one block of air underneath?
[8:21:19] JordiSalt: Trip wire near the hole that pushes them?
[8:21:21] Kenzibeth: trying to get the frog lights?
[8:21:22] louisesuger: arent there any vids on how to make a frog light farm??
[8:21:27] bebopbadger: yeah could you fence him like railings
[8:21:28] WhoIsThis_07: what if you did something with trip wire and dispensers with arrows
[8:21:29] HeyItsLupa: someone said the small magmas will attack the gollum
[8:21:30] lycanlesbian: i think snow is probably the best way
[8:21:31] muchoparty: Maybe try a sensor that shoots arrows to anything bigger than 1 block
[8:21:34] jazr4: maybe closed trapdoors , he has to be able to reach the other side
[8:21:36] CoureyPie: @freddylovesyou yes he doesn't want to watch a video he wants to find it out himself
[8:21:39] carmens: hiii kenzi Hugs
[8:21:44] Kenzibeth: hihi
[8:21:44] EvieDink: kenziiii kenzibLovejam
[8:21:45] bebopbadger: can we make him little zig zag pathway that barriers the bebes?
[8:21:51] Djvalpal: Do a grid pattern with slabs above so little guys can fall but golem can’t
[8:21:52] mothboyzrule: dinkOld
[8:21:57] PipsKay56: what can you do with frogs
[8:21:58] delmi: kae did u hear what puma's doing
[8:21:58] Kenzibeth: hi evie!!
[8:22:00] sarahthestego: maybe there’s a way the golem can kill the big ones only. like one they are small can they fall thru a crack?
[8:22:02] dest_tinycat: I forgot about no water in the nether 🥲😅 big dumb
[8:22:02] LexLuthor2196: could you make like a magma filter? like make a small ceiling and keep the glass ceiling to keep the height? I have no idea if that would work
[8:22:04] HeyItsLupa: oh ok, so they wont kill the gollum, then?
[8:22:05] louisesuger: @CoureyPie oooh okay, mustve missed that. ty :D
[8:22:08] CloeyBee: hey kenzi!!
[8:22:09] tayylorwest: put fences as floor on top, have golem and big cubes on it, when the golem kills the big ones the little one fall through holes maybe
[8:22:09] Ophy: There's only one way to do this efficiently
[8:22:10] kaekale: whats pumas? :O
[8:22:10] bebopbadger: leash the golem?
[8:22:12] mikslayaa: Gonna do some yoga poses dinkLov dinkLov dinkLov
[8:22:13] Kenzibeth: does it have to be magma cubes or can it be regular slimes?
[8:22:14] irenemvalomas: submerging in water somehow might kill them so some kind of water farm ?
[8:22:15] mothboyzrule: dinkOh dinkOh dinkOh dinkOh
[8:22:16] deannashy: lower the ceiling
[8:22:16] haileyrrose: @philly_budknight wait arrow dispensers is REALLY smart
[8:22:18] rubylover: or that the frogs can jump
[8:22:19] NeciaHeda: i love the brain power and problem solving for this lol
[8:22:20] bebopbadger: leash and tie him?
[8:22:23] delmi: puma bawls in SHOWMEYOURBALLS something!
[8:22:23] CoureyPie: @freddylovesyou ofc! dinkLovee
[8:22:26] Kenzibeth: ahh damn
[8:22:28] punkpixiee: julen out here doing Big Science and im still just trippin over the fact that you can fly in minecraft now
[8:22:33] sumtimreh: littles fall to one block high area
[8:22:35] CatCraftter: sorry to highlight the message but may i suggest powered snow a block above the floor, it kills the big and medium guys but leaves the small ones to be killed by the frogs
[8:22:35] rebeccaalynnn: is this gonna be on YouTube?
[8:22:36] she_wumbo: @irenemvalomas cant have water there
[8:22:38] LexLuthor2196: SHOWMEYOURBALLS
[8:22:39] kaekale: yesss puma balls in wilma!!!
[8:22:39] nottneb: peepoClap get her!
[8:22:41] enbyautie: water doesn't work in the nether
[8:22:41] PipsKay56: @cloeybee Gollum who wanted The One Ring lol
[8:22:41] PlantNerd93: look at us scientists!! THIS IS SPICY
[8:22:41] EnglandJDM: man this is a puzzle and a half
[8:22:45] CoureyPie: @irenemvalomas water can't exist in the nether
[8:22:48] third_fig: did you re-leash the frogs
[8:22:49] delmi: HUH leave her alone!
[8:22:58] kaekale: modCheck
[8:23:02] Yvonne1137: i've mostly seen people use the snow
[8:23:04] BreHive: It’d make it so the golem can’t get to the small guys, you wanna keep the big ones up a platform with holes for the small ones to fall through but the big ones stay up with the golem
[8:23:11] TaylorNicol_e: Coups you made a separate enclosure to spawn then and then lead them over?
[8:23:13] CloeyBee: @PipsKay56 lol!
[8:23:13] EvieDink: hi kale gorgis catKISS
[8:23:18] boosloth: see CatCrafter's highlighted message!
[8:23:19] NeciaHeda: i think the arrows is probably the best bet
[8:23:20] PipsKay56: @cloeybee haha
[8:23:23] kaekale: hi evie gorgiser catKISS
[8:23:28] EvieDink: peepoShy
[8:23:33] dakotabeeech: have you tried asking the golum to kill the little ones
[8:23:34] SaucyEL: @BreHive okayy good ideas
[8:23:35] kaekale: peepoShy
[8:23:36] mogzbogz: Is there anything you could put on the ceiling that would damage the big cubes
[8:23:37] CoureyPie: see highlighted message! dinkLovee dinkLovee
[8:23:37] EnglandJDM: i keep seeing snow?
[8:23:41] StreamElements: this is a safe place for us all to chat but remember we are also here to play video games and hang out <3 if you'd like to discuss current events there is a channel for it in our discord
[8:23:43] waywardraven03: If you make a roof out of vertical chains the littles will fall through, have a golem on top of the roof to kill the big ones
[8:23:43] crisssstin: Why don’t you try and make the roof lower… than test it
[8:23:44] wednesdayshawty: powdered
[8:23:49] Mimi_Novelo: dinkHello
[8:23:49] PaperMoniker: Powdered snow
[8:23:52] bri_bee69: can you make like floors to the area? bottom is frogs middle is small cubes top is golum and big cubes
[8:23:55] wetpizza17: Could you make towers that are in a grid style inside the farm  to block any big and medium to spawn??
[8:23:57] wishingsapphire: wishingsapphire subscribed at Tier 3. They've subscribed for 46 months! ayo ayo ayo
[8:23:59] EnglandJDM: powderedyes
[8:24:01] bebopbadger: is there a way you could make a fence with a gap underneath around them for the littles to escape but the medium/large can’t get away
[8:24:01] bausky: my pen broke in my dryer ink all over my clothes :(
[8:24:01] Mimi_Novelo: ariClose
[8:24:02] kaekale: 46 POGSPIN
[8:24:02] tymac300: Powdered snow one placed one block apart a block above the floor will kill the big magmas
[8:24:04] nottneb: 46 POGSPIN
[8:24:04] jazr4: like a snow carpet?
[8:24:07] PaperMoniker: That’s a great idea
[8:24:08] CloeyBee: 46 PogBones
[8:24:08] caseymeowmeowmeow: what about a snow golem, do snowballs do damage to them?
[8:24:09] LexLuthor2196: POGSPIN
[8:24:09] cHIPPYcHIRPER21: yeah like leave a block gap!
[8:24:09] waywardraven03: powdered snow works too
[8:24:11] tayloralva: @bausky rippp
[8:24:12] lycanlesbian: NODDERS
[8:24:14] CloeyBee: * oop POGSPIN
[8:24:14] RadBadTad: if the frogs are off the leads, can they get to the small ones and eat them before the golum can kill them all?
[8:24:20] Yvonne1137: like an air gap
[8:24:22] jenburnett: If the frogs are off lead could they potentially get to the smaller guys before the golem aggros all of them? You’d lose some but maybe still get a few?
[8:24:24] wednesdayshawty: the littles will be too short to take damage from the snow
[8:24:25] Ophy: The issue with the powdered snow is the fact that you're taking up spawn space so I don't know if they would actually spawn in there anymore with the snow.
[8:24:26] lsplitz33: they get stuck and freeze like you do
[8:24:28] bausky: @tayloralva ikkkk
[8:24:28] SaucyEL: @caseymeowmeowmeow oooo
[8:24:30] CoureyPie: @radbadtad no he tried that and golum killed them all quick
[8:24:31] not_sequoia: Julien, maybe lock up the golem on the roof and make a section of the roof vertical chains so only the small magma blocks can fall through to the frogs? Idk if that will work but it’s a suggestion
[8:24:32] PlantNerd93: the little ones would fall through right?
[8:24:39] bebopbadger: make a fence with a gap of snow underneath around them for the littles to escape but the medium/large can’t get away
[8:24:39] anibnani: make 2 levels, one with darts and use timed trap doors to drop them down
[8:24:41] wetpizza17: could you place block towers inside the farm blocking any large ones from spawning in?
[8:24:45] Ophy: That's why it works best with the magma spawner
[8:24:45] callmemolls: If you build a second layer where the golem lives and the floor is like a colander that keeps the big guys and the golem up, would the little ones fall through?
[8:24:49] bebopbadger: oh shit yeah
[8:24:50] CoureyPie: @ophy the person suggesting it uses that method
[8:24:51] samwise7: Julien is there anything in Minecraft that can like automatically swipe across an area and deal damage? For example if a saw blade could pass through a 2 block height then once the big guys are broken the saw would miss them and leave them for the frogs
[8:24:55] irenemvalomas: iron golem + wither roses
[8:24:57] lycanlesbian: im sure if you space it out tho it would still work
[8:24:59] rebeccaalynnn: Is this gonna be on YouTube?
[8:25:00] sydneynotcyndee: i like the colander idea
[8:25:05] Ophy: The magma spawner + powdered snow is the way to go
[8:25:09] jazr4: yeah but magma only spawn like 3-4 at the time though, it should be fine
[8:25:10] itsCaprise: can you afk farm anything in the nether? i thought to farm something it had to be in the spawn chunk
[8:25:10] squibney: limit spawn area to raised square holes in floor? put golem on top of floor. smaller ones will reduce to under floor and frogs can live down there?
[8:25:15] jenburnett: If the frogs are off lead could they potentially get to the smaller guys before the golem aggros all of them? You’d lose some but maybe still get a few?
[8:25:16] CatCraftter: @Ophy ^^
[8:25:19] Ophy: You neeeed the spawner to work with the snow
[8:25:20] Oopster37: If the frogs are free reign, couldn’t they eat the little guys as the golem is smashing the big ones?
[8:25:20] greciaco: ApuApustaja
[8:25:20] hikeliketheverb: i was going to suggest water but LOL NVM
[8:25:21] LexLuthor2196: I've heard that asking them rudely to get small also works peepoGiggle
[8:25:27] morgan_gibbs_: I love seeing all of these different ideas!! The dink fam is so smart
[8:25:29] Lorien_Nicole: what about snow golems? do they only attack hostiles?
[8:25:30] yannatto: could cacti work?
[8:25:30] Kenzibeth: magma spawner in the bastion
[8:25:31] Hawk8y8: outta my depth here tbh
[8:25:32] bebopbadger: what ophy said!
[8:25:33] kaekale: hii grec peepoHappy
[8:25:38] lilmango2: You could use a floating cactus?
[8:25:41] WanderingShroomz: Finally made it to a live stream!!
[8:25:43] wednesdayshawty: try a snow golem, they're slower.
[8:25:44] greciaco: alooo kae peepoHappy
[8:25:48] she_wumbo: try it all if you have the time see what works best :)
[8:25:51] PaperMoniker: What the heck piggiesss
[8:25:54] sydneynotcyndee: @WanderingShroomz Welcome!
[8:25:58] z_mbiegamer: theys a bunch of bitches lmao
[8:25:59] Hawk8y8: they run away from zombie piglins
[8:26:04] hikeliketheverb: wait can you somehow bring them into the overworld?
[8:26:08] not_sequoia: Julien, maybe lock up the golem on the roof and make a section of the roof vertical chains so only the small magma blocks can fall through to the frogs? Idk if that will work and it may only work if the magma spawns on the roof close to the golem
[8:26:09] momorganplease: Tall room way above that tunnels down to a low ceiling room with frogs. Can have dripstone in the top room in a checkerboard pattern with holes in the floor for the little magmas to fall through
[8:26:09] Waywarddaughter_Morg: The colander idea would be interesting. Having holes for the small ones to pass through
[8:26:09] bri_bee69: unfortunately i don’t know shit about minecraft but i am supporting you BisexualPride
[8:26:12] waywardraven03: A roof of vertical chains, with an iron golem on top of the chains will work too. the little ones would fall through the roof.
[8:26:12] lizzydorgan: this is using alot of brains FOR REALLLLLLLLLL
[8:26:14] jazr4: lets find solutions without the spawner, we dont have one nearby. it is possible to make the farm without it, it just need a little bit more thinking
[8:26:14] ZestBrew: @wanderingshroomz welcome dinkLov
[8:26:18] sarahthestego: so i thin the frog room needs to be small and above it needs to be a big room for the cubes to spawn
[8:26:22] itsCaprise: an 8.5 hour stream? you're a BAMF Julie
[8:26:23] guitar_hiro: hey dinks! HeyGays dinkLove
[8:26:24] wednesdayshawty: no
[8:26:24] unp0tat0: omg i was gone for class how r u still pplaying
[8:26:24] jazr4: the only spawner on the bastion is gone
[8:26:29] kelsbd: me boy you are still live???
[8:26:29] Kenzibeth: no its not unfortunately :(
[8:26:31] pauley13: Looks really epic from top down
[8:26:34] greciaco: hi hiro! HeyGays
[8:26:36] nottneb: hey hiro! HeyGays
[8:26:37] bebopbadger: oh god i’ve been sat on wooden floor for 2 hours i can’t sit up rip my legs LUL
[8:26:37] delmi: aloo hiro fruitL HeyGays
[8:26:42] wednesdayshawty: it's gone homie /:
[8:26:43] hykanari: hiro!! widepeepoHappy
[8:26:44] CloeyBee: hiro hirooo! <3
[8:26:44] kaekale: hi hiro!! HeyGays
[8:26:45] waywardraven03: A roof of vertical chains, with an iron golem on top of the chains will work too. the little ones would fall through the roof.
[8:26:48] ebriff24: hi hiro! you look good today!
[8:26:48] Kenzibeth: i mean im glad i came in at this time cause i would have broken it too

[8:26:55] CoureyPie: hi hiro!!
[8:26:56] guitar_hiro: hi grecia hi ben hi delmi hi aral hi cloey hi kae hi ebriff! HeyGays
[8:26:58] sydneynotcyndee: @bebopbadger ouch
[8:26:59] MissRitaBook420: thats meta
[8:27:01] guitar_hiro: hi lex hi courey!
[8:27:02] Hawk8y8: hi hiro! PrideWave
[8:27:02] Lorien_Nicole: @waywardraven03 Thats a good idea
[8:27:04] bebopbadger: HI HIIROO <3 <3
[8:27:06] Ophy: If you do the spawner with snow, you line the floor with hoppers. Magma spawns, powdered snow kills the big and medium cubes but the small cubes are too far from it so they don't die from the snow and it doesn't hurt the frogs
[8:27:06] guitar_hiro: hey hawk!
[8:27:10] guitar_hiro: hi bebop!
[8:27:11] Ophy: It's a nonstop farm.
[8:27:13] GalaxieFart: are we still here?
[8:27:16] jennythebeannn: we can close our eyes while you pull a spawner from creative
[8:27:19] MissRitaBook420: hi hiro
[8:27:21] guitar_hiro: hey julen o7
[8:27:23] katkarwi: Gonna lurk and draw for a bit.  have a good rest of stream friends! Hugs
[8:27:24] TaylorNicol_e: The chains idea sounds interesting
[8:27:24] physicsphuntime: this song is gorgeous! anyone know what it is so I can look it up on youtube?
[8:27:25] lycanlesbian: i feel like the snow would be fine without the spawner bc you have a lot of space and they spawn in small sections, but thats just me
[8:27:26] beccas_beans: HIIIII YALL
[8:27:27] bebopbadger: @guitar_hiro hope you’ve had a lovely day so far, we love u!! spiggFlower
[8:27:28] CatCraftter: bastion huntin time??
[8:27:28] dest_tinycat: Make another level for big bois with iron golem to hurt them floor has small holes for the small ones to fall down to frogs ? Sorry if that doesn’t make sense
[8:27:33] guitar_hiro: @MissRitaBook420 hi!
[8:27:33] jazr4: its ok julen! lets think the farm without the spawner, is possible
[8:27:35] bebopbadger: PETTHEMODS
[8:27:38] Djvalpal: There are some tutorials on YT. Not sure if you are just wanting to figure it out in your own tho
[8:27:43] kelsbd: stop Julen you look so sad omg
[8:27:56] waywardraven03: Spawner is actually known as one of the slowest and worst ways
[8:27:57] guitar_hiro: @bebopbadger tysm, hope you had a great day too PatPat <3
[8:27:59] sarahthestego: friends remember he’s trying to figure it out by himself with our help. don’t send the farm video ideas
[8:28:02] Ophy: @grrldyln It's very possible but the rate would be incredibly low and I don't know how well they would spawn if you're not directly in the area without a spawner
[8:28:04] Kenzibeth: i think the spawner would only be at the bottom yeah
[8:28:09] bebopbadger: i’m so sorry that it wasn’t what i hoped :(
[8:28:10] Kenzibeth: and only in the one type of bastion
[8:28:14] bebopbadger: *u hopef
[8:28:18] not_sequoia: just try out some vertical chains real quick to see if the small cubes fall through
[8:28:19] wednesdayshawty: please consider @waywardraven03 's ideas in their highlighted messages
[8:28:20] caseymeowmeowmeow: DoritosChip DoritosChip DoritosChip
[8:28:20] Waywarddaughter_Morg: The idea waywarddraven had may be interesting
[8:28:22] bebopbadger: typos omg
[8:28:23] Lorien_Nicole: You got this Julen.
[8:28:24] louisesuger: BibleThump
[8:28:24] yannatto: im thinking if cacti could work the same as powdered snow
[8:28:25] Ophy: Magma spawner, from what google said, will ALWAYS be in the bottom of the bastion
[8:28:26] PaperMoniker: They didn’t spawn in there again!
[8:28:31] itsCaprise: GG thank you for the stream, goodnight fam
[8:28:31] sarahthestego: not useless! you got a bunch of lights
[8:28:32] wishingsapphire: would probably be difficult to find the same type of bastian
[8:28:35] CoureyPie: not useless! just not functioning to our preference!
[8:28:35] jazr4: nononono its not useless julen u got this!
[8:28:37] bebopbadger: im sorry papa 😭
[8:28:38] TaylorNicol_e: It works if you’re there and it’s so cool!! Lights are cool
[8:28:38] waywardraven03: A roof of vertical chains, with an iron golem on top of the chains will work too. the little ones would fall through the roof.
[8:28:38] beccas_beans: Julen, I told you last week that I was proposing and now I'm engaged!! It finally happened, thanks for all the love
[8:28:40] greciaco: could u turn it into something else Smoge
[8:28:40] ginger_goth: can silk touch grab a spawner? can you bring it back to this farm?

[8:29:26] bebopbadger: @clownapologist CONGRATULATIONS BESTIE SO HAPPY FOR YOU 😭 dinkLovee dinkLovee
[8:29:26] jenburnett: If the frogs are off lead could they potentially get to the smaller guys before the golem aggros all of them? You’d lose some but maybe still get a few?
[8:29:26] wednesdayshawty: the blocks surrounding the iron golem's prison would be chains, the rest would be basalt.
[8:29:28] Djvalpal: What if you do a grid of snow
[8:29:30] rachh555: its a "mob spawner" but chains in the middle so only the small ones get in
[8:29:31] waywardraven03: You dont need the vertical chain part to be that large, only like a 7x7 or something
[8:29:34] beccas_beans: dinkLovee dinkLovee dinkLovee  still craftin and mining huh chrismelLFGD chrismelLFGD

[8:29:55] TaylorNicol_e: Maybe something like the ender farm design where they spawn and fall to the chains?

[8:31:41] sarahthestego: does water or snow kill the magmas?
[8:31:47] wednesdayshawty: maybe try snow golem cause they do much less damage? so the frogs will have an opportunity to get at the small ones
[8:31:49] NickyNicole21: hmmmm feels similar to just letting the big magmas spawn in there and killing them when u tend to it?
[8:31:53] howdyrio: don't know anything about minecraft but i love watching you stream it anyway
