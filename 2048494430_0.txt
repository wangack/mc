[0:17:47] TheRealvek_: weren't people using stretch macros for BT?
[0:17:59] its_ceso: i thought u didnt use it bc u dont always have a boat in aa
[0:18:00] Jonathinater: @sh4dle <redacted> 13:56
[0:18:01] AntVenom: og subpixel is more visually satisfying
[0:18:05] skywalker31415: what does the boat have to do with it?

[0:18:26] tattedweelamb: never knew that! learned something new today
[0:18:31] kingcontaria: what about using unfullscreening to get that resolution, are you okay with that?
[0:18:31] blobserr: @skywalker31415 optimal boat eye use zoom macro
[0:18:32] PacManMVC: lol
[0:18:38] blobserr: which stretch ur game
[0:19:00] kot7k: not bad books pog
[0:19:03] skywalker31415: the boat just positions you better or something?
[0:19:26] PacManMVC: +0 PagMan
[0:19:29] raycompenjoyer: im ngl i still dont get it how you can calc where the strong hold is without triangulating
[0:19:29] TheRealvek_: Why is stretch macro worse than your zoom macro?
[0:19:33] autum_mist_101: RainbowPls RainbowPls
[0:19:33] Fossabot: RainbowPls
[0:19:40] blobserr: @TheRealvek_ its not a zoom macro its just obs
[0:19:48] Jonathinater: @therealvek_ bc his zoom isn‚Äôt a macro it‚Äôs just an overlay
[0:19:53] TheRealvek_: oh
[0:19:53] reconEriador: he1ianHappi

[0:20:13] blobserr: pog
[0:20:18] sh4dle: jonathin ngl idk who redacted is
[0:20:21] ymmit3: is that the same loophole that allows for the tall screen for mapless or is that something else
[0:20:23] callacallisto: Fishinge
[0:20:24] Fossabot: @callacallisto You just fished a Raw Cod! üêü (51%)
[0:20:24] kot7k: 4 gp and a dream
[0:20:27] callacallisto: alas
[0:20:37] adhd74000: boat eye needs a macro?
[0:20:41] blobserr: no
[0:20:44] kingcontaria: well but in that part of the run (on wall), macros are still allowed
[0:20:57] shig_tv: surely 12 rockets is enough Clueless
[0:21:02] Tabspacecrafting: What if Redlime just removed f3 C from ranked
[0:21:03] happymortal999: do you ever use zero cycle in aa runs?
[0:21:09] blobserr: @happymortal999 no
[0:21:17] g4nd4lf0_: breathe
[0:21:30] n0t_eddie: yo feinberg
[0:21:33] blobserr: @tabspacecrafting there is an option for that in private lobbies
[0:21:33] raycompenjoyer: ez 4 bed inc
[0:21:40] Jonathinater: @sh4dle you don‚Äôt have to, that run had a mod that was 100% disallowed at the time of the run and was given a pass when any run other than wr would‚Äôve been rejected
[0:21:42] orlixee: @happymortal999 He  needs to hit the dragon
[0:22:01] Tabspacecrafting: I know blobserr but what if it just became standard
[0:22:03] blobserr: u can zero in aa he just doesnt find it that time saving

[0:22:25] Suixam: Drake
[0:22:31] happymortal999: @blobserr ty, never seen him do it, just wondered why
[0:22:33] lokigoddessofdaggers: Gg
[0:22:33] blobserr: @skywalker31415 crossbow right before final bed
[0:22:33] TheRealvek_: Which is more offensive: stretch macros during game, or calc being allowed?
[0:22:38] shig_tv: yeah sky but it‚Äôs hard as fuck
[0:22:39] skywalker31415: ah
[0:22:52] blobserr: its not that hard as long as yk zero
[0:22:52] kingcontaria: yea i get why the old rules that only allowed one extra resolution / fullscreen were in place, not sure what the debate was that led to the new rule change
[0:22:56] PacManMVC: crossbow before last bad is not hard
[0:23:12] shig_tv: shut up pac man mvc
[0:23:14] shig_tv: it‚Äôs hard for me to
[0:23:19] Suixam: üò≠
[0:23:20] blobserr: pac needed tas to do it
[0:23:22] blobserr: dont listen to him
[0:23:25] shig_tv: OMEGA
[0:23:27] PacManMVC: i can crossbow zero
[0:23:32] PacManMVC: the aa zero is completely different
[0:23:34] notevenmars: hi chat hi feinberg
[0:23:39] shig_tv: mars Peepi
[0:23:43] PacManMVC: because fucking mint
[0:23:45] notevenmars: hiiii catKISS
[0:23:51] spidyttv: What version are you playing on?
[0:23:51] Fossabot: @spidyttv 1.16.1 feinNom
[0:23:53] Abbence: for calc you could possibly pause game and work out maths in whatever pace
[0:23:54] rekrap22: when the first walls came out did it cause controversy like boat eye and calc?
[0:24:02] Jonathinater: crossbow cycle I see can be good as zero not so much
[0:24:02] shig_tv: yes
[0:24:02] blobserr: no
[0:24:05] autum_mist_101: Hi notevenmars! feinHi
[0:24:09] blobserr: maybe for like a day
[0:24:27] Jonathinater: the first ‚Äúwall‚Äù someone just had 4 Minecraft‚Äôs open and reset them manually OMEGALUL
[0:24:32] notevenmars: hi autumn mist 101 feinHeart
[0:24:34] blobserr: the hamazon wall
[0:24:37] TheRealvek_: I remember FinestPidgeon being an early wall user
[0:24:40] Jonathinater: yeh hamazon
[0:24:40] E510: bro think he is Feinberg
[0:24:41] TheRealZimmShady: there was a hardware argument but there's no real argument against it because its just running multiple valid versions of minecraft
[0:24:54] Logogurke: woud u use boot macro for any% beacuse 15 sek is a lot in this catogary?
[0:24:55] kingcontaria: it was very gradual so there wasnt that many people against it (there were a few including me but it just kinda happened)
[0:25:03] shig_tv: !specs
[0:25:03] Fossabot: ryzen 5900x, 3080, 64gb ram, 1tb ssd 4tb hdd
[0:25:07] big_bule: I got a new PC specifically for wall lol
[0:25:07] shig_tv: yeah okay this guy is rich
[0:25:11] shig_tv: feinRich
[0:25:12] Thanoscope: how does wall actually work?
[0:25:22] PacManMVC: !wall
[0:25:22] Fossabot: there are 15 instances total, watch the 6 instances in the top. if an instance gets locked it moves to the bottom, if an instance gets reset it moves to the right side.
[0:25:28] TheRealZimmShady: wasn't world preview allowed during the wall debate because people were mad about hardware?
[0:25:31] TheRealvek_: @Thanoscope literally every wr since brentilda used wall lol
[0:25:45] skyward_14: the bad hardware makes ranked so good
[0:25:55] rekrap22: oh yeah sometimes I forget world preview isn't like normal xD
[0:25:55] Fossabot: xD üòÇ ü§£ üòπ üòÜ
[0:26:44] TheRealvek_: WP and Setspawn are explicitly non-vanilla lol
[0:26:48] shig_tv: can you see kelp on WP
[0:26:54] blobserr: no
[0:26:54] shig_tv: it has to like float up no?
[0:26:55] skywalker31415: it feels very non-vanilla
[0:26:56] Jonathinater: setspawn is a good thing tho
[0:27:00] PacManMVC: you can see it in the water placed down
[0:27:05] PacManMVC: you can't see the entity floating
[0:27:09] kingcontaria: worldpreview and setspawn optimize what macros were allowed to do prior
[0:27:10] shig_tv: NOTED
[0:27:11] PacManMVC: which i'm assuming is what you mean
[0:27:13] lobito695: but you calud also manually pause when the world loads and get the same preview
[0:27:15] shig_tv: yeah
[0:27:16] lobito695: could
[0:27:23] Logogurke: is speedrun.com making the rules?
[0:27:23] AceRPx_: you cant see entities at all on preview
[0:27:30] kingcontaria: the controversial part shouldve been allowing macros to do those things in the first place
[0:27:33] shig_tv: like you can see the lava pool and also the shipwreck
[0:27:35] Jonathinater: bc people were already using macros to get setspawn and it doesn‚Äôt affect ANYTHING in the timed segment
[0:27:51] Thanoscope: so you are cherry picking seeds from the top 6 are putting them in a sort of queue to play?
[0:27:51] TheRealvek_: Go back to Japanese rues: No mods, no f3, RTA timing!
[0:27:59] PacManMVC: @Thanoscope yeah
[0:28:10] orlixee: Well like the kill elder guardian and things like that they used to sit for 30 seconds just switching between F5 modes before they even start and it's wr
[0:28:27] Thanoscope: damn that's such an advantage over bad hardware, insane
[0:28:56] shig_tv: if you have bad hardware as a MCSR runner
[0:28:59] shig_tv: unlucky i guess
[0:29:03] shig_tv: skill issue
[0:29:09] PacManMVC: get your grind up
[0:29:11] orlixee: Well there is still some people who only run one instance, obviously not top runners but they want to make it playable for the beginners
[0:29:23] sh4dle: i have shit hardware so i just play ranked
[0:29:33] TheRealvek_: That's why I think it should be legal to go into spectator mode during a run. I mean it would save a lot of time!
[0:29:35] shig_tv: dude the invention of ranked is so fucking cool
[0:29:41] shig_tv: and the fact that it‚Äôs so accessible
[0:29:44] shig_tv: thanks redlime
[0:29:48] sh4dle: theres just no way that resetting normaly is viable or fun on bad hardware
[0:29:51] PacManMVC: dinner time
[0:29:52] kingcontaria: yea ranked is awesome
[0:29:54] orlixee: Why is /gamemode creative not allowed? It's vanilla
[0:29:54] its__cj_: @orlixee but bad hardware does not equal beginner necessarily at least it *shouldn't*
[0:29:57] shig_tv: feinNom
[0:29:58] maximumpower18: !mads
[0:29:58] Fossabot: you have a bony ass
[0:29:59] blobserr: enjoy food pac
[0:30:02] xanthous7: i wouldnt know how to speedrun at all if it wasnt for ranked
[0:30:08] xanthous7: Fishinge
[0:30:19] dor0203: Fishinge
[0:30:33] ice_wyve: i would play ranked but i have no experience so i feel like i would get destroyed constantly
[0:30:36] de_dopstra: Ranked is amazing and im so thankful for the whole mod and events
[0:30:39] big_bule: ranked definitely differentiates the top runners better than their RSG time IMO
[0:30:39] sh4dle: fsg is also fun on bad hardware
[0:30:42] xanthous7: what is this new portal
[0:30:43] shig_tv: just play it regardless ice
[0:30:46] shig_tv: that‚Äôs how you get better
[0:30:46] de_dopstra: @ice_wyve I just started out its okay
[0:30:50] shig_tv: by getting destroyed
[0:30:51] AceRPx_: will paceman lbs ever be more valued than src? if not already
[0:30:52] blobserr: @ice_wyve u get matched up wit ppl on ur skill level so as long as yk something abt speedrunnin then ur fine
[0:30:54] orlixee: Being a beginner and bad hardware are both contributors to not using wall. Didn't mean they were the same
[0:30:56] skylewl: @big_bule clueless
[0:30:57] lobito695: that portal was insane
[0:30:57] TheRealvek_: Is that chad portal actually faster than the cscuile portal?
[0:30:59] lobito695: all for that
[0:30:59] Loch32_: LUL
[0:30:59] shig_tv: YEOWCH
[0:31:03] getgottatertot: KERSPLAT
[0:31:05] kingcontaria: @big_bule not really, ranked and rsg are very different in skill
[0:31:11] MultiFandomSyndrome14: rip
[0:31:19] AceRPx_: true
[0:31:22] Zizasta: why don‚Äôt they make a separate category of ranked with AA runs
[0:31:22] kingcontaria: playstyle in rsg is just very different from ranked
[0:31:32] Jonathinater: fein do you remember that stat that was like out of the 900 games below 600 elo like 3 ended with the dragon dead or smth like that?
[0:31:35] Thanoscope: aa ranked letsgo
[0:31:35] dor0203: @Zizasta nobody gonna play it
[0:31:39] big_bule: Well like yeah but not that much
[0:31:41] blobserr: @Zizasta cuz at max 3 ppl would play it
[0:31:42] sh4dle: @Zizasta 3 hour RNG dependent runs arnt that fun
[0:31:48] sh4dle: for ranked i mean
[0:32:03] shig_tv: the skill is endurance
[0:32:06] shig_tv: like genuinely
[0:32:14] joey____the_wall: Anyone else get the falling sensation when falling in minecraft?
[0:32:24] rcoleee: day 6 YIPPEE
[0:32:30] AceRPx_: i hit 2.5 mil resets today FeelsOkayMan
[0:32:31] ice_wyve: does the ranked mod have a like, offline play thing?
[0:32:34] xanthous7: @Jonathinater i think ive only killed the dragon like 5-6 times in ranked matches
[0:32:37] x3n0rs: hey everyone peepoHey
[0:32:39] RubixBeaver1: thoughts on 0 eye always in ranked
[0:32:41] xanthous7: and im 1k elo
[0:32:43] sh4dle: pog ace
[0:32:53] skyward_14: oh hi xan
[0:32:54] BaphometSP: what about getting the most % of advancements in a set amount of time ranked?
[0:32:55] samm35_: it's almost like ranked is just competetive any%
[0:32:56] de_dopstra: and I think ranked is way better to learn cuz you dont spend half your time resetting
[0:32:58] samm35_: NOWAY
[0:33:00] kingcontaria: mechanically its similar but i think the decision making is noticeably different
[0:33:03] dor0203: @RubixBeaver1 why not award risky players?
[0:33:05] Loch32_: absolDance absolDance absolDance absolDance absolDance
[0:33:10] Logogurke: coud they just split the catogary. one "classic" and one without any lophole shit.
[0:33:10] rekrap22: do spiders agro off lightlevels or actual daytime?
[0:33:14] maximumpower18: DinoDance DinoDance DinoDance
[0:33:16] sh4dle: it would also kill like 70% of seeds
[0:33:17] superiorv_: fein you planning to come back for a day or two for the new hoplite season?
[0:33:18] sh4dle: which is bad
[0:33:24] nischhelm: @rekrap22 light
[0:33:24] The_Kind_idiot: DinoDance DinoDance DinoDance
[0:33:25] its__cj_: i think k4 has argued minute differences in bastion routing but likely nearly trivial unless you're trying for wr ?

[0:33:32] Bees_Nation: @rekrap22 sky light + time
[0:33:32] getgottatertot: gunpowder pog

[0:34:39] raycompenjoyer: @happymortal999 trueing
[0:34:41] kingcontaria: the code calls for light level at the spiders eye coords
[0:34:42] blobserr: @maximumpower18 new updates suck
[0:34:45] RubixBeaver1: @DrunknPilot its fun
[0:34:50] TheRealvek_: Dandannyboy proved that knowing bucketless is usefull for ranked!
[0:34:55] hazemetoo: is there a reason you ‚Äúretired‚Äù from hoplite of did you just find it less fun after a while?
[0:35:01] maximumpower18: @blobserr ty
[0:35:02] AceRPx_: you can base decisions off of opponent info too
[0:35:06] skyward_14: just ban resetting OMEGA
[0:35:10] skylewl: i disagree, rsg and ranked is very different
[0:35:11] KrunkeG: holy lava man

[0:35:41] joey____the_wall: Who do you think will be the first inductee into the MCSR hall of fame?
[0:35:42] skylewl: i think youre wrong because youre forced to finish seeds in ranked, so you play very differently
[0:35:44] blobserr: pog

[0:36:29] efekean: yo fein gl
[0:36:40] dor0203: play more risk for more reward
[0:36:43] treymonty: there are ranked overworlds that top any% runners would reset or not even tab into
[0:36:47] Jonathinater: like golem always drop 4 is such a small thing
[0:36:47] blobserr: u dont force 20 or home portal in normal any% yeah
[0:36:51] aservant_: leaving on 5 rods is as complicated as zero cycle
[0:36:54] omommomo: You play way more accurately in a technical perspective
[0:36:55] ice_wyve: but how many people can really make those decisions and it matter? like 10 or less actually compete for rsg wr?
[0:36:56] kingcontaria: i think a riskier playstyle is just much more rewarding in rsg, like in the finals hax got a sub8 but priffins playstyle allowed him to more consistently finish seeds
[0:36:58] canoflobsters: @turbosoldier that sounds like a new copypasta to me
[0:37:09] scrambIedegg6: I bought this game... played for like an hour, build a house and survived the zombies, and never played it again. I dont understand how someone enjoys this lol
[0:37:12] xanthous7: might just be me but in any% i dig down for lava on villages but i dont in ranked
[0:37:23] ice_wyve: @scrambledegg666 unluck
[0:37:25] Turbosoldier: @canoflobsters I must be playing it wrong, but it was easy and now my kid plays it...
[0:37:27] Bizarctic: I bought this game... played for like an hour, build a house and survived the zombies, and never played it again. I dont understand how someone enjoys this lol
[0:37:39] blobserr: no
[0:37:49] blobserr: we are not copypastaing
[0:37:53] omommomo: decision could be to play it safe in case the other person died
[0:37:59] kingcontaria: people choose slower, more consistent endfights in ranked based on their opponents progress
[0:37:59] scrambIedegg6: ok blob sorry
[0:38:06] splendided: splendided subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 16 months, currently on a 15 month streak! The difference between ranked and any% is that you're good at ranked Clueless

[0:38:20] rekrap22: you would force 20 for anypercent?
[0:38:20] splendided: OMEGALUL
[0:38:23] Jonathinater: stuff like golem always drops 4, lava pool/ ravine in 10 chunks and there always being obi in the bastion are all pretty small stuff
[0:38:27] splendided: hi blob feinBlop luvv
[0:38:28] rekrap22: I guess probably depending on time like you said

[0:39:30] skyward_14: home portal at spawner
[0:39:34] CliffordDog: doesnt it just come down to in ranked youre trying to beat one player in the context of one seed at a time, and in rsg youre trying to beat the whole world every seed?
[0:39:37] xanthous7: 150 150 blind
[0:39:47] adhd74000: what do you use too load so many minecrafts at once?

[0:41:52] aservant_: how much did you get back?
[0:41:53] blobserr: half of it yeah
[0:41:55] skyward_14: @aservant_ he makes that in half an hour anyways
[0:41:56] DimeOvaNickel: catJAMJAM
[0:41:56] TheRealvek_: Is that $6k an investment, or a charitable donation?
[0:41:58] AwtimalTwitch: if you added up all of the money from birthdays and my summer job you wouldnt get 7k LOL
[0:42:03] blobserr: it was 2.5k then anon dono another 2.5k
[0:42:04] AceRPx_: @chanman929 you dont need one
[0:42:07] shig_tv: GIGACHAD
[0:42:07] Thanoscope: how are you putting money into ranked?

[0:42:09] DimeOvaNickel: FrogDance
[0:42:13] raycompenjoyer: my rust player brain thought you were talking about hours for a sec
[0:42:19] rekrap22: do you know how speedrun.com is organized? like it's just an independent company hosting a leaderboard right? kinda just like ranked if you think about it like that. no connection to mojang. unless i'm mistaken
[0:42:27] shig_tv: that‚Äôs so cool man
[0:42:29] 1Lightspeed: hai

[0:42:53] JanLive01: @chanman929 It's more about the knowledge. Learn to use the pie for everything, learn your bastions well, double travel, that's it
[0:42:53] 1Lightspeed: to say mojang is uninvolved with anything is a massive understatement
[0:42:55] abbyshewrote: I watched your latest wr run with a girl I like over discord and she's new to AA so I explained everything to her during the whole run..... Thank u for the rizz feinCute feinWICKED
[0:42:56] ice_wyve: its kinda crazy to think how uninvolved mojang is with the community

[0:43:06] Fossabot: mods are so horrible and rude
[0:43:11] AntVenom: @rekrap22, speedrun.com was founded by Pac. Idk how directly involved he is these days, but I've seen a few interviews. He just made the web infastructure for individual speedrun communities to thrive.
[0:43:11] QuasiStellar_o: @raycompenjoyer aaah makes sense
[0:43:13] sh4dle: ranked is so pog and cool
[0:43:17] AwtimalTwitch: imma go clean my deskmat and by the time i get back i hope to see you flying in the end at 16 minutes ;D
[0:43:17] TheRealvek_: How is it an investment? What are you getting out of it financially?
[0:43:17] Thanoscope: when you say you put money into it do you mean like funding its management and stuff?
[0:43:27] skitanater: would playoffs ever consider being double elim?

[0:44:19] omommomo: It doesn‚Äòt really determine the best player if not everyone plays though
[0:44:42] k33I3y: ur lookin at her GIGACHAD
[0:44:42] splendided: everyone has the opportunity to play right

[0:44:57] madsenvy: Jammies
[0:44:59] AceRPx_: tbh im not a fan of the new way of qualifying for ranked playoffs, i dont have nearly enough time to grind for top 12 and also trying to get in top 4 instead of top 8 is just so much harder
[0:45:00] lobito695: nah you are

[0:50:00] EvenOrOdds: Like changing the game as in seeds/average rates etc

[2:37:53] Candypat: Interesting thing to unmute the stream too MHM
[2:37:53] FNTooCrafty: under 30
[2:37:55] PacManMVC: but like that doesn't seem right
[2:37:58] Nerfoxingaround: 20 is the rule of thumb
[2:38:07] CharizardPepperoni: 20 is what i've heard
[2:38:08] Nerfoxingaround: or at least used to be
[2:38:10] sh4dle: 20 is fucking crazy
[2:38:11] CoconutTiim: I‚Äôd say late 20s is probably average for married with kids
[2:38:15] lion4202: I thought 25 was the rule of thumb
[2:38:26] sh4dle: 20 might be average in the congo
[2:38:31] castlebeki: about 25 yeah
[2:38:32] pdxb3: 25 is pretty close anyway.  I'm very early millennial
[2:38:32] 19hun: gotta be 25
[2:38:34] elisadyoo: !faq
[2:38:34] Fossabot: Hi! I'm Feinberg - I play Minecraft and a lot of other games pretty well :) I aim to bring you guys very high quality gameplay with a side of comedy and entertainment when I stream. Thanks for stopping by!
[2:38:35] PacManMVC: google says 20-30 yeah
[2:38:35] westy_eeyoo: I‚Äôve got 2 kids, been a gamer for since 1986!
[2:38:40] happymortal999: generations are 20, been that way forever
[2:38:41] Daniel_H212: 25 is probably a better measure
[2:38:42] rucaa_: the difference between 19 and 20 years old is an ABYSSSSS
[2:38:44] Raptur: 20 is good for historic generations, not modern one
[2:38:49] Daniel_H212: @happymortal999 yeah but people are having kids later now
[2:38:52] Nmc0123: You don't think kids born today are a different generation than you?
[2:38:52] PacManMVC: YEP
[2:38:53] Daniel_H212: so its probably 25 nowadays
[2:38:55] liquidfyre_: YEP
[2:38:57] PacManMVC: this is why we use mean
[2:39:00] PacManMVC: fuck
[2:39:00] CharizardPepperoni: pregnant at 45 NODDERS
[2:39:00] Insidious_Apple: probably 20-25 cause theres also overlap

[2:39:02] PacManMVC: YEP
[2:39:05] SAMS300FOXES: I feel like the average is going up; used to be ~20 maybe a hundred years ago
[2:39:06] Insidious_Apple: like all of this is arbitrary anyways
[2:39:08] castlebeki: depends what you mean by generation though
[2:39:11] PacManMVC: big stats guy
[2:39:14] AtrioxMinecraft: my mum is 32 and has 5 kids
[2:39:16] pdxb3: kids got me into MC, they grew up and quit playing.  i still play/watch

[2:39:39] Bla_De: My son loves creative mode in Minecraft
[2:39:41] FNTooCrafty: My wife said we had to have all our kids at 30.... limits the options
[2:39:43] castlebeki: like, parents - children generation has to be 25 but social generation are shorter I think?
[2:39:47] PacManMVC: do you see ages on your stats? or just countries

[3:50:08] spicypengin: @PacManMVC i ws just wondering why run 1.16.1 then, is it just because its the rsg standard?
[3:50:08] Jonathinater: don‚Äôt say that word around mime pac
[3:50:10] Novamb: magma ravine aa paus
[3:50:20] pheerg_: @spicypengin its just fastest
[3:50:21] PacManMVC: 1.16.1 over 1.16.5 because bartering
[3:50:23] Switchpalacecorner: the any% split sucks and is annoying in every other version
[3:50:26] FearMeIAmLagPoker: pog Û†ÄÄ
[3:50:29] PacManMVC: just a pain in other versions
[3:50:32] Switchpalacecorner: and you have to do it at the beginning of any run even for aa
[3:50:33] galoomba_: pog
[3:50:34] spicypengin: @PacManMVC yeah but why not like 1.15
[3:50:36] Alittar: dong
[3:50:39] lobito695: 1.16.1 no brutes
[3:50:39] zurtleTiff: zurtleBoat
[3:50:40] KindPlays: @PacManMVC and cause brutes are annoying as hell
[3:50:43] PacManMVC: well nobody wants to do 1.15 aa
[3:50:44] spicypengin: just cause?
[3:50:50] PacManMVC: yeah just cause nobody does it
[3:50:51] rachel__red: help
[3:50:56] spicypengin: fair enough i suppose
[3:50:56] Jonathinater: 1.15 aa you have to make a cat farm
[3:50:57] pheerg_: @spicypengin nether update 1.16 bruh
[3:50:59] Switchpalacecorner: @spicypengin because any% sucks in every other version
[3:51:00] KindPlays: @PacManMVC 1.15 one of the cats is bugged so you need to get it to spawn
[3:51:03] Switchpalacecorner: :)
[3:51:07] CurtisDN_: 1.16 is the first version with bastions, which makes the any% portion of aa way better than previous versions
[3:51:10] Switchpalacecorner: and you have to play any% as part of an AA run
[3:51:13] o_rtho: did someone say 1.15
[3:51:21] PacManMVC: yes
[3:51:24] CurtisDN_: and 1.16.1 is the last version that has the most pigs in bastions and the best bartering trades
[3:51:30] CurtisDN_: so thats why 1.16.1 is the best for aa
[3:51:34] o_rtho: don‚Äôt play it
[3:51:35] CurtisDN_: and speedrunning generally
[3:51:37] KindPlays: 1.12 is a pretty fast version
[3:51:39] WordSmith123: The time it saves is more than the time for advancements
[3:51:40] o_rtho: 1.12 better
[3:51:41] whenyouwalking1: hoping for a viable midgame Prayge
[3:51:44] PacManMVC: 1.6 aach is pretty fast

[3:51:54] galoomba_: 1.19 sounds fun but 1.20 is dumb with the smithing templates
[3:51:57] Jonathinater: aight let‚Äôs go through all the other ones to say why they‚Äôre bad: 1.12 any% is slow, 1.13 the game runs shit, 1.14 is boring, 1.15 the cat is broken, 1.16.2+ any% sucks too
[3:52:10] zurtleTiff: catJAM
[3:52:12] HyDroident: RaveTime AlienPls3
[3:52:14] WordSmith123: AAAV when
[3:52:16] CurtisDN_: @galoomba_ that just sounds like a dub for 1.19 honestly, idk why 1.20 being shit would make 1.19 shit lol
[3:52:25] Jonathinater: also like 1.18+ performance is bad aswell
