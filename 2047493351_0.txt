[0:58:52] CurtisDN_: @arjun1913 if the goal is to be fast, you need a temple, village, lava pool, playable nether, and playable outer end
[0:58:54] grifferthrydwy: 100,000 mcchickens PagBounce
[0:59:08] zhatai: he spent it on a dollar bill
[0:59:10] catcatmegan: Hi Ezra widepeepoHappy
[0:59:12] Zizasta: ngl it was kinda messed up for fruit and das to team up against you considering what’s at stake
[0:59:19] AwtimalTwitch: @grifferthrydwy NO, they uped the price  ;-; they like almopst 2$ now D:
[0:59:21] byugoi_: @dectifi ive heard from other people that 12 eye seeds cannot be randomly genetated so
[0:59:25] grifferthrydwy: me when i dont know when to shut up
[0:59:28] grifferthrydwy: @AwtimalTwitch WHAT
[0:59:30] FlaiFlai: @arjun1913 there are many ways you can play, but this is the fastest we found that has some selmblance of being reliable
[0:59:32] AwtimalTwitch: YEAH
[0:59:33] 0LLI1770: you need gunpowder and paper for outer end and then any% materials to get to the outer end
[0:59:35] dor0203: dude spent it all on fortnite skins
[0:59:43] Candypat: @grifferthrydwy idk about you mcchickens are like 3.30 for me
[0:59:46] dectifi: @byugoi_ both the seesds are 12 eye seeds?
[0:59:59] AwtimalTwitch: @grifferthrydwy 1.79 for my mcdonalds
[1:00:00] diex2074: !playlist
[1:00:01] Fossabot: https://tinyurl.com/feinbergenergy3 !edmlist !debrislist
[1:00:02] CurtisDN_: you also need a way to get gunpowder after the outer end, which means you need more temples
[1:00:04] byugoi_: idk abt the aa set seed
[1:00:05] SirIronOW2: over there
[1:00:12] arinaconfetti: !debrislist
[1:00:12] Fossabot: https://open.spotify.com/playlist/7jxyoy8iwcpMLMRaTHiGjc
[1:00:13] dectifi: bc i kbnow that 12 eye seeds cant be generated but like i find it hard to beleive that they use 12 eye seedsd for any and aa
[1:00:24] PacManMVC: @dectifi the answer is no
[1:00:25] CurtisDN_: well they dont use a 12 eye seed in aa
[1:00:32] kompuke: why do u only take 1 bed?
[1:00:44] 0LLI1770: he can craft the rest later
[1:00:46] dectifi: @PacManMVC ok thx
[1:00:48] CurtisDN_: theres no seed that exists with 12 eyes that also has everything you need for aa in close proximity to spawn
[1:00:59] ActualLadybug: oiy
[1:01:00] PacManMVC: that's not true curtis
[1:01:00] dectifi: yea tahts what i thought curtis
[1:01:05] zCooper: :33
[1:01:06] dectifi: oh shit i was wronfg
[1:01:09] PacManMVC: there are a few
[1:01:11] FlaiFlai: @byugoi_ So, only 2^43 (iirc) seeds can be rolled when you click "generate new world" without entering a seed. In total, there's 2^64 seeds, which is the vast majority
[1:01:12] kompuke: alr ty
[1:01:16] PacManMVC: but the black cat seed is just faster
[1:01:19] Suixam: jamm
[1:01:20] grifferthrydwy: 2^48
[1:01:21] Odyssey1337x: !aa
[1:01:21] PacManMVC: and is not a 12 eye
[1:01:21] Fossabot: All Advancements | WR & PB: 2:26:29 FeelsStrongMan | !tracker !progress !coopaa !aaguide
[1:01:23] Nhaed: inb4 no string trades
[1:01:23] grifferthrydwy: not 43
[1:01:28] FlaiFlai: ah, yeah
[1:01:29] Odyssey1337x: !guide
[1:01:31] PacManMVC: but to say that no 12 eye with aa stuff at spawn exists is wrong
[1:01:40] FlaiFlai: anyway, all the 12 eyes are outside the the rollable range
[1:01:44] CurtisDN_: wait thats crazy that thats not the ssg seed then
[1:01:48] byugoi_: @flaiflai thats interesting but how do we know all 12 eye seeds are not in that 2^43 set of seeds?
[1:01:50] Odyssey1337x: @PacManMVC 12 eye seeds arenot generatable by rsg because they arent in the seed filter afaik
[1:01:50] CurtisDN_: thats wild that its not fast enough
[1:01:53] kompuke: wait so bastions are more important than fortresses in all advancements?
[1:02:08] thunderstorming79: feinNom
[1:02:08] FlaiFlai: @byugoi_ We've checked every single one :P (Well, the structure seed part)
[1:02:08] CurtisDN_: @kompuke no? you need both
[1:02:14] Nhaed: jamm
[1:02:14] DuolingoTM: is the 1 hour time possible?
[1:02:15] byugoi_: oh lol
[1:02:19] dor0203: ever heard of bastionless?
[1:02:20] CurtisDN_: you physically cant finish the run without a bastion and a fortress
[1:02:23] krobsy: her head bops so well to this song
[1:02:30] dectifi: i knew that the 12 eye seeds are out of rotation, didnt know abt the others, thx chat
[1:02:37] DuolingoTM: LMAO

[1:03:08] byugoi_: CHECKING
[1:03:21] eponumos: weird seed man
[1:03:24] dectifi: now im not gopnna spend my life trying to roll the aa seed and end upi getting lightning in order to drop wr peepoHAPPY
[1:03:24] PacManMVC: Clueless
[1:03:32] FlaiFlai: btw, for reference, 2^48 seeds vs. 2^64 seeds sounds like it's a big chunk, but only ~0.00153% of seeds are in the random pool

[1:07:23] EzraManning: apparently the new hoplite update is good… though I haven’t played it
[1:07:25] dectifi: @kompuke so basicallly it lowers where your looking and he loojks right away for high entity count bc of bastion havcing alot of mobs, then he looks on pi chart for spawners (specialty block pi chart) in order to very likely find a bastion

[1:18:26] mineben256__: @FlaiFlai yeah but agi is impossible. it'll just be drones and stuff that are worrying
[1:18:29] FlaiFlai: @weilowz actually not unlikely! Tere were some some experiments with gpt-4 playing minecraft, and gpt-4 did perform better than other minecraft AIs (was a bit tricky). Didn't quite manage to beat it, but got further than any AI before IIRC. With the multimodal stuff getting better, it's possible!
