[0:22:39] sugaredpeaches: there shouldn't have been any punishment. that was a dev issue
[0:22:39] killm_good: chat bad HmmNotes
[0:22:42] haggleslag: that has to be on purpose by the organizers cause they wanted to see fruit wreak havoc on the poor bottom players
[0:22:42] anactualrobot: Kekoa got bullied even more than usual
[0:22:44] kekoa50: Susge streamelements

[0:22:59] PresidentAdeana: @anactualrobot rightfully so /j
[0:23:09] kekoa50: oh for sure KEKW
[0:23:19] mysticwayfinder: it was a sad set of jojo streams because i couldn't redeem bonk
[0:23:19] anactualrobot: screaming silently rn @presidentadeana
[0:23:33] mysticwayfinder: still can't nohoho
[0:23:34] haggleslag: YEP

[0:23:40] anactualrobot: we were talkin abt this last night a lil bit, the chat was So bad
[0:23:47] RizzoWL: and then they found feinberg as well
[0:23:50] orgapumpkin: And then they got fein too
[0:23:55] dolphinman_rl: i didnt get to see much cause of school but were teams fully chosen by the players?
[0:23:59] haggleslag: they almost died a couple of times tbf
[0:24:04] killm_good: jojers what did i miss in TR chat that made timeouts
[0:24:06] CaptainJasshands: the top 10 was clear before it even started, but it was still amazing to watch
[0:24:16] mysticwayfinder: i swear, i was rooting for the nonspeedrunners
[0:24:17] b8nj0: imagine that team in MCC üíÄüíÄüíÄ
[0:24:19] kekoa50: NODDERS
[0:24:33] RizzoWL: dasnerth had fein as his bounty in day 4 which is how he found him
[0:24:35] pickle_spears: i think we ALL know
[0:24:36] mysticwayfinder: @b8nj0 no thank you
[0:24:43] kekoa50: josoCHATTING
[0:24:45] sugaredpeaches: it isn't. das had feinberg as bounty
[0:24:46] anactualrobot: @killm_good literally nothing, the mods were behaving
[0:25:08] mysticwayfinder: i think hannah was the only one  actually take out one of the speedrunners
[0:25:09] orgapumpkin: Yeah
[0:25:14] anactualrobot: (for the Jods at least) the rest were pretty toxic
[0:25:27] theevilbearage: that or they look at peoples vods
[0:25:29] kekoa50: yeah Hmm
[0:25:35] mysticwayfinder: yup
[0:25:37] aggressivegingers: whaaat? what you on about Clueless  /s
[0:25:43] kynapple: ok hi im back
[0:25:47] kekoa50: wb ky
[0:25:48] kynapple: actually done now
[0:25:58] its_jack_phoenix: @kynapple josoWAVE
[0:26:03] haggleslag: the worst english speaking player was still a really good player NODDERS
[0:26:04] anactualrobot: hot take; twitch rivals does not understand actual Competitive balancing at all; they keep making these mistakes
[0:26:09] botsolos: Check out my new YouTube video! josoHYPERS "The Most OP Enchant in Minecraft Battle Royale..." https://youtu.be/mlg5DNcJRw0
[0:26:11] theevilbearage: fruit in the sudden death thing was so unfair
[0:26:21] kayyylaaa___: i was devastated watching the sapnap/shadoune moment...i wanted shadoune to get revenge
[0:26:27] killm_good: @anactualrobot at least they can complete and score a MC event now
[0:26:49] anactualrobot: as someone who does collaborative game building, this was not actually set up to encourage balancing
[0:26:57] mysticwayfinder: only the mc tr for me
[0:26:59] its_jack_phoenix: i watch none tbf
[0:27:00] kynapple: i dont watch other.
[0:27:01] kekoa50: monkaHmm
[0:27:03] haggleslag: YEP
[0:27:09] botsolos: Tone is hard to get across in text, look at this to help express what you really mean https://toneindicators.carrd.co/
[0:27:18] killm_good: esports at that level has more training and collab
[0:27:19] FearingToast: that‚Äôs why i love mine draft <3
[0:27:20] aggressivegingers: e-sport is a thing?
[0:27:28] PresidentAdeana: "i want to be the very best, the best there ever wasss"
[0:27:34] dolphinman_rl: mc can not be related to any esports sadly. it just doesnt have a scene for teams or indiv to even develop
[0:27:57] dolphinman_rl: wow targetted
[0:28:07] sugaredpeaches: @dolphinman_rl MCSR ranked is probably the closest i think. great comp
[0:28:09] botsolos: Merch has been rereleased with two new colors! Get it now at jojosolos-shop.fourthwall.com
[0:28:13] haggleslag: they shoulda asked jerma to play
[0:28:14] anactualrobot: Ok, that‚Äôs fair- but if you have the ability to control the teams and game structure, you have to think about prioritising very different skill sets in the same game. MCC is unironically a really good example, because NoxCrew and Scott clearly thought through different skill sets & how to incorporate them
[0:28:27] mysticwayfinder: yea
[0:28:30] beeboo909: Honestly MCSR ranked is best mc esport
[0:28:30] killm_good: NODDERS
[0:28:31] dolphinman_rl: @sugaredpeaches yeah i agree. but nothing else really has been made yet
[0:28:33] anactualrobot: (this is my Career I‚Äôm sorry for the block)
[0:28:45] orgapumpkin: I think the problem is that Minecraft is a sandbox game and a lot of the big creators just don't focus on pvp
[0:28:54] kekoa50: josoAWARE
[0:28:57] anactualrobot: gen x
[0:28:59] haggleslag: thats gen X KEKW
[0:29:09] sugaredpeaches: @sugaredpeaches still relatively new, but the downside is that it's a niche area
[0:29:11] Heart123_: boomer is like 60+
[0:29:11] kynapple: boomer is like 60+?
[0:29:14] anactualrobot: KEKW
[0:29:15] kayyylaaa___: and old millennials

[0:29:41] kekoa50: peepoBye rylee
[0:29:52] anactualrobot: Oh yeah, it‚Äôs absolutely an issue from an administrative organization functioning thing
[0:30:00] haggleslag: ugh now im missing MCC üò© still at least two months away
[0:30:02] dolphinman_rl: 100k on the line makes it impossible to balance year
[0:30:18] theevilbearage: hell remember mcc live the prize pool was split 10 ways for each team
[0:30:19] Silverpoplar: josoWAVE

[0:31:32] kekoa50: josoLAUGH sponsors running this mf

[0:32:56] kayyylaaa___: and then got fucked over
[0:32:56] sugaredpeaches: fruit was like 3-5k yesterday. Peak was 14-15k
[0:32:58] kekoa50: it truly is NODDERS
[0:32:59] anactualrobot: Wow
[0:33:05] anactualrobot: I want to see these stats now

[0:33:48] kekoa50: ye they are a huge streamer NODDERS
[0:33:49] dolphinman_rl: yeah he broke the record by a LOT
[0:33:50] CosmicJD27: Hi Jojo
[0:33:53] greencrayon_: jesus
[0:33:53] mysticwayfinder: oh... oh no
[0:33:54] kayyylaaa___: that number isnt real in my head
[0:33:58] anactualrobot: I cannot type the amount of shock
[0:33:58] theevilbearage: fruit should have been punished in another way
[0:34:09] mysticwayfinder: that is not good
[0:34:14] its_jack_phoenix: 150 viewers semms like a lot to me KEKW
[0:34:14] CaptainJasshands: 3m wth?!?
[0:34:18] its_jack_phoenix: *seems
[0:34:29] kekoa50: dejj
[0:34:36] kayyylaaa___: nodd agree
[0:34:39] dolphinman_rl: its so sad cause fruit HAD to do that
[0:34:43] kekoa50: he literally was too KEKW
[0:34:46] theevilbearage: i didnt even know twitch could have millions
[0:34:49] dolphinman_rl: grefg
[0:34:51] YouAreLookingFabulous: you are looking fabulous
[0:34:51] sugaredpeaches: @theevilbearage should not have been punished imo. it was a dev issue. instead the victims should have been granted extra stars or some sort of extra perks.
[0:35:01] b8nj0: he's called thegrefg
[0:35:08] kayyylaaa___: boooo
[0:35:11] mj_sunshine: YEP
[0:35:12] haggleslag: @theevilbearage im so sure the organizers put fruit in there for the lulz cause they know he'd destroy. the fact that they let go of a gigantic streamer because of that is Deadge
[0:35:13] anactualrobot: Ohk another hot take. If TR wants to do this sort of thing they either have to choose to accept mild riggery and keep the numbers they need, or it‚Äôs gonna keep going like this
[0:35:17] kekoa50: hiii mj
[0:35:25] mj_sunshine: also hii
[0:35:27] mysticwayfinder: i feel like squid craft 2 had a better selection of english speakers because there less sweats
[0:35:32] mj_sunshine: hi kekoa luvv
[0:35:40] kayyylaaa___: mj!! MMEOWDY
[0:35:46] kekoa50: def messed up
[0:35:50] mj_sunshine: kaylaaa luvv
[0:35:50] dolphinman_rl: i saw it but idk the context
[0:35:53] mysticwayfinder: it's on mcc vault
[0:35:54] anactualrobot: no I havent
[0:35:56] RizzoWL: I don't think he realized it would affect people as much as it did
[0:36:00] sugaredpeaches: it's sad because had he known you were suppose to walk to the next area, he wouldn't have done it.
[0:36:09] botsolos: Check out my new YouTube video! josoHYPERS "The Most OP Enchant in Minecraft Battle Royale..." https://youtu.be/mlg5DNcJRw0
[0:36:10] theevilbearage: the mez i think had it
[0:36:12] sugaredpeaches: people are normally teleported to the next event.
[0:36:27] mysticwayfinder: this was so messed up
[0:36:29] haggleslag: bro was drinking silly juice that day KEKW
[0:36:33] partyathina: heyyyy
[0:36:34] mj_sunshine: Bro goofy ahh
[0:36:37] anactualrobot: oh dear
[0:36:41] dolphinman_rl: wait so what was the context?
[0:36:50] mysticwayfinder: i think he boxed one of the only people to stand up to him deathmatch too
[0:36:51] kynapple: im confused
[0:36:52] kynapple: lol
[0:36:54] sugaredpeaches: also it was the last like 30 seconds of practice
[0:36:58] mj_sunshine: how would he know lol
[0:37:06] anactualrobot: amusing content, poor sportsmanship for a troll
[0:37:08] mj_sunshine: there's a good yt video that explains it basically
[0:37:14] RizzoWL: why would they give players blocks but no way to mine them
[0:37:25] sugaredpeaches: mj! what's the youtube video?
[0:37:42] kekoa50: I think there was a craft for a pickaxe Hmm
[0:37:58] mj_sunshine: @sugaredpeaches I'll whisper you!

[0:38:27] sugaredpeaches: thanks mj!!
[0:38:31] sugaredpeaches: <3
[0:38:44] dolphinman_rl: oh... so they just could then never learn the crafting
[0:38:51] marinettez: that‚Äôs messed up mannnnn
[0:39:03] RizzoWL: what do you feel should have been done to fruit instead of deathmatch?
[0:39:06] kekoa50: yeah it makes them lose the 30 seconds they had left
[0:39:14] kynapple: oh
[0:39:18] theevilbearage: they could break throw for ages
[0:39:20] bill_nye24: are you going to go to streamer awards?
[0:39:25] theevilbearage: couldnt
[0:39:45] kekoa50: they were NODDERS
[0:40:04] kekoa50: dejj
[0:40:04] hhthekk: Onion
[0:40:17] qingBee: the punishment was kinda meh, so they put the guy who got like 90stars with the guys who got like 15
[0:40:17] sugaredpeaches: but it wasn't well known you have to walk to the next level. Most events you're TP'd there.
[0:40:24] kayyylaaa___: i just straight bitched to my dad about this whole thing and this gen x man agreed that it's bullshit
[0:41:06] kekoa50: monkaW
[0:41:24] anactualrobot: relevant question: i presume so, but was this made clear to everyone before it started??
[0:41:29] haggleslag: coughing baby vs hydrogen bomb Deadge
[0:41:31] theevilbearage: imagine smantmom (no offence) vs fruit
[0:41:37] 2PhoneLi: like why didn‚Äôt they give fruit minus points??
[0:42:00] anactualrobot: corporate mindset, sigh
[0:42:03] Katiest: toastergoMOW
[0:42:05] kayyylaaa___: weird dog!
[0:42:06] sugaredpeaches: that's why it's a tester/dev issue.
[0:42:06] mj_sunshine: they doomed everyone else
[0:42:07] aggressivegingers: meow
[0:42:14] anactualrobot: I do think a fractional penalty would make more sense
[0:42:17] 2PhoneLi: aww
[0:42:24] RizzoWL: points didn't matter after the first day
[0:42:31] mj_sunshine: they did not contact him to explain the situation at all üíÄ
[0:42:32] anactualrobot: Like. 20% off your stars minimum
[0:42:33] kekoa50: they had a meeting I think going over the rules and such in spanish but idk if they did in english Hmm

[0:44:11] mj_sunshine: toaster has a cone BLUBBERS
[0:44:18] ara_plane: itd be the principle honestly
[0:44:32] RizzoWL: I honestly think just giving him a warning would have been fine
[0:44:50] sugaredpeaches: @RizzoWL agreed
[0:44:50] thegreattimelord: beyond taking his points, they should've given the points he won to the people he boxed
[0:44:53] kekoa50: oo shoot monkaW
[0:45:07] haggleslag: weed's not legal in texas Susge
[0:45:08] qingBee: i wonder if there was a way to give him a disatvantage on the start of day two
[0:45:10] anactualrobot: fruit isn‚Äôt very toxic fwik so definitely a Clear Warning after that & a punishment starting the next day would have probably been better
[0:45:38] mj_sunshine: these people couldn't participate for like 1-2 min of the next thing Hmm

[0:46:29] mj_sunshine: he do like a little bit of trolling doesn't he
[0:46:31] anactualrobot: also this is something I personally account for: you should always consider a mild, serious, and severe consequence for rule breaking or ill conduct that don‚Äôt force someone out of the game
[0:46:37] communist_uwu: like i watch fruit a lot, and he is a little troll
