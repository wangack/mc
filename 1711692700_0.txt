[2:14:19] Honeybadger3: yea thats the one thing i dislike about seeburg. i love seeburg but its annoying when it hangs up
[2:14:20] BethFreemanArtist: @roboblake the time is nigh
[2:14:21] shadowedzero: I have seeburg in the background for work now, and yeah, it has been messing up all the time now
[2:14:23] AltraWolf: curseforge is just nexusmods manager in a sense
[2:14:28] GwhoisJ: can I fund it?
[2:14:28] neceros: @Voidheim nice name
[2:14:33] Sarutobaee: @GassyMexican so curse forge, you have to make a profile on curse forge, then add all the mods that you want to the profile to have that as your "mod pack"
[2:14:34] Voidheim: @Voidheim Thanks!
[2:14:38] oaktree3: no
[2:14:39] Voidheim: voidheBlush

[2:14:55] CapnSlipp: Personally, I just visit CurseForge website, download the mods, and drop them in the right directory.
[2:15:03] MrPeabodyLive: @GassyMexican you log into to curce and find the modpack you want to download and on the web page for that pack and it should have a serve file for you to downkload
[2:15:05] neceros: Most server managers just allow yo to install a modpack innately
[2:15:08] CastawayGuy619: ketsukLurk
[2:15:10] CapnSlipp: NO, you do not need CurseForge software.
[2:15:14] BethFreemanArtist: Guys when we move ima have a big beanbag in max’s room with a mic so I can hang out

[2:16:29] MrPeabodyLive: @GassyMexican surch the mod pack at the top
[2:16:31] Darkaros: *warning: I have not set up a server myself :P
[2:16:33] Darkaros: Yep
[2:16:36] Darkaros: that's it
[2:16:42] TechJunk1e: If he is renting a server from a host it might not be as simple
[2:16:53] Honeybadger3: i would assume so
[2:16:58] Darkaros: Yes. Because you allowed content management. You can double check
[2:17:05] Honeybadger3: mc is good
[2:17:20] Noma____: small community minecraft modded servers with a couple mods is super easy to setup and run its the bigger ones with like 200+ mods that are a pain
[2:17:23] kagericebowl: You can make your own modpack with the mods.
[2:17:28] oaktree3: Doesnt this mean Mex will have to keep his PC on xD

[2:25:59] CapnSlipp: Fabric is an alternative to the stock Mojang server program (which nobody uses).
[2:26:05] TrystnS: Woops
[2:26:11] GwhoisJ: this hurts my brain
[2:26:24] SplatterDoll: NotLikeThis
[2:26:25] PSfanatic: @PSfanatic NODDERS And changes so much its hard to follow if your not involved constantly LUL
[2:26:25] CapnSlipp: If you’re currently using Fabric, that’s a Fabric modpack, so things should work fine with that.
[2:26:26] neceros: yeah this is not my realm of knowledge. I am just paxyPop right now
[2:26:37] BethFreemanArtist: I have no idea about this stuff KEKW

[2:28:10] woodlaphroaig: F3 is just debug info and it should not have anything sensitive
[2:28:19] Tubbs51: But will Max fall for the ol' Alt+F4 trick??? KEKW
[2:28:21] Honeybadger3: @Crona_Steingate cutie! wdingHug
[2:28:32] tapatochips: im a novice dev and alot of tech still puzzles me lmao, my family thinks i know everything though KEKW
[2:28:49] XiliaVield: so you need to instal fabric and then add the mod pack
[2:28:57] GwhoisJ: @tapatochips that is ever dev lol
[2:28:59] Darkaros: no1HUH
[2:29:03] knocklessmonster: @tapatochips that's why even companies focused on dev still have IT
[2:29:17] Honeybadger3: I use F3 for knowing where my home is
[2:29:33] tapatochips: @GwhoisJ facts lol
[2:29:36] Voidheim: As a Systems Administrator, I can literally work for any company. They always need my skillset.
[2:29:41] neceros: Recommend going to mcprohost and seeing if they have the medieval plugin already set up
[2:29:45] tapatochips: @knocklessmonster also true
[2:29:48] XiliaVield: as I said, I've done quite a few a modding for minecraft but only for my own pc hosted server
[2:29:57] slayer78456: MC prohost looks like it requires an extra subscription for putting modpacks in
[2:30:21] RoboBlake: so many mods
[2:30:48] BethFreemanArtist: I just learnt what a pot luck is and it sounds like the best tine

[2:35:23] Zadwanaa: Do eet!
[2:35:25] SplatterDoll: Kill it!
[2:35:26] Zadwanaa: Its a learning experience
[2:35:27] TrystnS: It is way simpler than messing with fabric, Mcprohost has an article on setting mods on your server on their knowlesgebase
[2:35:28] Honeybadger3: go for it
[2:35:32] XiliaVield: you gonna need to restart the server either
[2:35:35] CapnSlipp: It’s a bit involved, yeah.  Definitely back up your existing world first.
[2:35:36] XiliaVield: way*
[2:36:01] BigJuicy4U: D:
[2:36:12] neviation: full send it
[2:36:14] CapnSlipp: @trystns You have a link?  Is there an easier approach?
[2:36:20] Honeybadger3: Max is big brain
[2:36:30] XiliaVield: correct
[2:36:46] neceros: so like, if you install fabric and run the game it will be vanilla by default, like forge.
[2:36:52] neceros: It's just like forge
[2:36:54] TrystnS: @CapnSlipp Yeah its just adding mods through the FTP server to the server mods folder
[2:36:56] Darkaros: You FTP'd it in
[2:36:59] MrPeabodyLive: the line right below it @GassyMexican
[2:37:01] XiliaVield: then there is another page for adding mods in it :3
[2:37:02] Sarutobaee: you drag and drop the mod pack you just installed into the mods folder
[2:37:09] Sarutobaee: then you launch the modpack via forge
[2:37:18] slayer78456: You just need to drag the config and mods folders to the server after uploading the fabric jar
[2:37:26] Honeybadger3: gassySIP
[2:37:27] FreshBrew: you put the wolf thing on your server. you pull then download the server version on your server
[2:37:42] CapnSlipp: @trystns I mean, he’ll need a Forge-based or Fabric-based server to run mods, since Mojang’s Vanilla server doesn’t have mod support, right?  That’s the point of Forge, Fabric, and the dozen or so derivatives— mods.
[2:38:02] MrPeabodyLive: @GassyMexican the line that says fabric API mos ar installed like forge mods right there were it says this guid
[2:38:06] SplatterDoll: toasterSip
[2:38:16] Darkaros: you already have the server pack downloaded. Other server hosts (like Shockbyte) just needs that jar file
[2:38:44] TrystnS: You need Forge on your server, i sent Sekh the link for their guide
[2:38:48] CapnSlipp: Correct.  Fabric mods + a Fabric or Fabric-derived server and everything should work.
[2:38:50] Darkaros: i.e. no need for Curseforge for sure
[2:38:57] Honeybadger3: KEKBye
[2:38:58] Sarutobaee: no, curse forge or whatever the fabric api thing is should be the medium in which you launch the game after you get the mods in the right folder.
[2:38:59] MrPeabodyLive: @GassyMexican the last line in the guid tells tyou how to add the mods
[2:39:03] Honeybadger3: KEKW
[2:39:06] PSfanatic: NotLikeThis
[2:39:07] slayer78456: He doesn't need forge aureyLOL
[2:39:14] TrystnS: Ok am bowin out sorry
[2:39:14] XiliaVield: they say forge, but it's fabric when you use fabric
[2:39:17] CapnSlipp: @trystns Forge if using Forge mods.  Fabric if using Fabric mods.
[2:39:26] CapnSlipp: Forge != CurseForge.  It’s confusing.
[2:39:32] slayer78456: @GassyMexican once you set up fabric all you need to do is take the mods and config folders from the server pack you downloaded and upload them to the server
[2:39:54] CapnSlipp: Forge is one of the most popular Minecraft server programs.  Fabric is the other.
[2:39:54] SombrerBOT: MAX IS BACK IN DND ROLEPLAY!! Max is joining Dodger, and djWHEAT on an adventure DM'd by ThatBronzeGirl! Catch them here on Wednesdays at 12pm CST! For more info and a FAQ, go here! https://lastcallforadventure.com/

[2:40:45] mogrenscones: i believe in u
[2:40:46] yammosk5: transparency
[2:41:00] Honeybadger3: if it doesnt work then we beat it until it works NODDERS BOP
[2:41:18] CapnSlipp: Yup.
[2:41:22] BigJuicy4U: murder the server
[2:41:26] knocklessmonster: kill means "do it now," stop asks politely
[2:41:28] Darkaros: Kill closes it
[2:41:32] CapnSlipp: You’re going to be replacing the server’s .jar
[2:41:42] voidnn: hard shut like power loss vs stopping properly
[2:41:43] Darkaros: I'd kill unless you're like "uhhh idk if it's safe". You said oyu don't care about the server atm
[2:41:44] CapnSlipp: Kill = Force Quit = End Process
[2:41:44] Xanderan_Madman: kill sounds worse
[2:41:46] WDForty: it's the difference between existing your game vs alt+f4
[2:41:53] knocklessmonster: #yolo
[2:42:04] Honeybadger3: murdur!
[2:42:06] Water_Cat1: you murderer!
[2:42:11] XiliaVield: kill stops the server without saving... Stop, saves and stop it
[2:42:29] Xanderan_Madman: sounds about right
[2:42:31] WDForty: when you alt+f4 a program it risks doing damage to the save, but since you're wiping it out wouldn't really matter
[2:42:41] Darkaros: NODDERS
[2:43:02] Honeybadger3: yes i assume so

[2:43:17] MojoAI: as long as the modpack supports it
[2:43:41] Darkaros: Medieval MC isn't on .3
[2:43:41] Sarutobaee: version depends on how updated the mods are, you can have a less up to date version depending on when they update the mods
[2:43:46] ItsNoxid: Is gassy playing a new modpack? Or the same one?
[2:43:51] MojoAI: the Medieval MC Server Pack is currently 1.19.2
[2:43:52] WDForty: modpacks are usually a minor point back cause it takes time
[2:44:08] Darkaros: ItsNoxid starting community server of same modpack with lootr an voice chat
[2:44:14] XiliaVield: you want the server one !
[2:44:17] ItsNoxid: Oh nice
[2:44:22] Honeybadger3: im already proud
[2:44:41] MojoAI: I would assume latest version for loader, but I'm just assuming

[2:53:12] Darkaros: I think so. MCProHost has an article for Whitelisting too
[2:53:29] slayer78456: Most likely. I'm not sure if MCProhost will autorecognize the start file
[2:53:29] CapnSlipp: Basically you just need to point it at the right jar file

[2:54:35] nasty_n8_dog: @sjors_23 yes he will be
[2:54:51] Darkaros: Most serverhosts recommend changing it to "customjar" so you don't have to type the full name

[2:57:44] SplatterDoll: the learning . . . it hurts! PepeHands
[2:57:44] Honeybadger3: old minecraft was hell to mod XD
[2:57:53] sventyard: Yeah I used to fumble so much trying to get a modded game to run.
[2:57:56] slayer78456: @GassyMexican before you start the server for the first time check the mod folder and make sure lootr and the other mods you added are in there.
[2:58:02] voidnn: yeah you didn't build a linux box and setup java and then put a minecraft server on it haha
[2:58:13] MojoAI: long ago, installing minecraft mods and creating servers were FAR too complicated and scarier and general lol
[2:58:36] CapnSlipp: @slayer78456 Not sure your skill level, but I recently spun up one with itzg/minecraft-server Docker image and it was _really_ slick.  One env var to choose between Forge, Fabric, Quilt, Bukkit, Paper, Pufferfish, Purpur, Magma, Mohist, Catserver, Loliserver, Canyon, Spongevanilla, Limbo, Crucible, or FtB.  Such power, wow.
[2:58:38] Sekhcellent: @MojoAI its why I only played vanilla lol
[2:58:44] Darkaros: gassyLURK might mess about yeh. Also ya i can join you and test it out
[2:58:47] tapatochips: KEKW
[2:58:52] MojoAI: @MojoAI same KEKW
[2:59:01] Darkaros: I go through periods of MC madness ijpONO where I play for like a month
[2:59:07] slayer78456: @CapnSlipp If you pay for the extra options in servers it's super easy
[2:59:09] CervumKnight: Cervum_Knight subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 16 months! 
[2:59:26] Honeybadger3: Sek, ur smart. i think you could figure it out with a bit of tim
[2:59:28] slayer78456: it might matter you should be able to open that folder now and move everything out
[2:59:29] MstresVampy: I use curse forge
[2:59:35] Xanderan_Madman: gassyHYPE gassyHYPE gassyHYPE gassyBRODANCE gassyBRODANCE gassyBRODANCE
[2:59:40] Honeybadger3: *time KEKW
[2:59:42] CapnSlipp: @slayer78456 Makes sense.  I just use Linode hosting, nothing Minecraft-specific.
[2:59:43] ThatGunsFoHire: With a bit of tim? Who is Tim?
[2:59:45] slayer78456: move at the top
[3:00:11] Sekhcellent: oh probably @Honeybadger3 I don't have the knoledge base Max does, so I'd need more basic stuff
[3:00:12] TechJunk1e: move to //
[3:00:12] Honeybadger3: @ThatGunsFoHire sush, you saw nothing KEKW
[3:00:17] slayer78456: Yeah should be
[3:00:33] slayer78456: Yep
[3:00:39] Voidheim: Clappy
[3:00:42] Voidheim: finameClap
[3:00:44] Honeybadger3: YAY!
[3:00:45] Sekhcellent: peepoClap
[3:00:55] JustCaffeinated: mods NODDERS
[3:01:07] MojoAI: Is there gonna be a quiz after this?
[3:01:12] CapnSlipp: Now point the control panel to fabric-server-launcher jar and cross your fingers.
[3:01:13] Voidheim: @MojoAI no
[3:01:16] Honeybadger3: im proud of you Max. this is a accomplishment
[3:01:31] Voidheim: Doesn't look like it has Lootr or Voice Chat yet
[3:01:33] kagericebowl: You can add mods to the folder you're looking at.
[3:01:33] Billi__39: @MojoAI yup
[3:01:39] slayer78456: It doesn't look like it does it's easy enough to grab them.
[3:01:40] JustCaffeinated: @MojoAI shiiit i didnt take notes
[3:01:41] ThatGunsFoHire: There's always a quiz
[3:01:44] kagericebowl: You can download the mods as a jar.
[3:01:48] CapnSlipp: Gotcha.  Are those server mods or client-side mods?
[3:01:57] MojoAI: KEKW
[3:01:59] tapatochips: @ThatGunsFoHire NOTED
[3:02:04] slayer78456: Go back to curse forge and in the top right click open folder go to the mods folder and copy them from there
[3:02:19] ThatGunsFoHire: Half your grade comes from signing your name
[3:02:26] slayer78456: It downloads the default server
[3:02:35] slayer78456: instances
[3:02:41] CapnSlipp: Gotcha.  So yeah, download the Fabric versions of those mods and upload them to that mods dir.
[3:02:45] kagericebowl: What you downloaded was the official modpack. You have to put in the extra stuff yourself.
[3:02:56] Honeybadger3: @ThatGunsFoHire im forked then, my scribble is unreadable lol
[3:03:14] slayer78456: just need to copy that and upload to the mods folder in the server
[3:03:17] ThatGunsFoHire: gassyFP
[3:03:32] Darkaros: NODDERS yeh I figured they'd be there cuz you made a profile. Enjoy the pain of updating the server pack if it ever comes up lol
[3:04:01] CapnSlipp: Rich Presense?  Is that the mod that adds audio echo effects?
[3:04:04] slayer78456: Some of the extra things downloaded might be dependencies
[3:04:16] TechJunk1e: you just removed voice from you mod folder
[3:04:18] kagericebowl: Rich Presence lets people on Discord know what you're doing in game.
[3:04:26] Darkaros: Discord Rich Presence means if your Discord detects you're playing MC, it'll be more specific and be like "you're on the main menu" "you're in the nether" etc
[3:04:41] TechJunk1e: you dragged the last one
[3:04:51] S1syphus: S1syphus is gifting 5 Tier 1 Subs to GassyMexican's community! They've gifted a total of 30 in the channel! 
[3:04:51] S1syphus: S1syphus gifted a Tier 1 sub to LazyPixelman! 
[3:04:51] S1syphus: S1syphus gifted a Tier 1 sub to smash1995!

[3:04:54] slayer78456: You can just take the entire mod folder and overwrite yeah
[3:05:00] BigJuicy4U: monkaS
[3:05:02] Honeybadger3: lol

[3:05:10] slayer78456: probably the safest
[3:05:20] Voidheim: double check you didn't move out the voicechat mod. I think you "moved" it instead of copied
[3:05:24] TechJunk1e: some of the mods might be specifc to clients and not servers
[3:05:26] CapnSlipp: DiscordRichPresence says it also requires the Erdbeerbaer’s GUI Library mod
[3:05:28] Billi__39: gassyHEART gassyHEART gassyHEART
[3:05:31] Xanderan_Madman: gassyBRODANCE gassyBRODANCE gassyBRODANCE gassyBRODANCE gassyBRODANCE gassyBRODANCE
[3:05:44] Remishiro: so i stepped out for a bit, what is even going on?
[3:05:46] Voidheim: Yay!
[3:05:52] Voidheim: prevented an issue
[3:06:05] slayer78456: Yeah
[3:06:09] Sekhcellent: @Remishiro JP broke server, Max starting own server and learnign how on stream
[3:06:34] CapnSlipp: Delete?  Am I missing something?  Aren’t all those mods the Medieval stuff?
[3:06:55] slayer78456: @CapnSlipp They are being replaced by the ones in his local install just to be safe
[3:07:51] EddieTheYeti: crreamNote crreamNote crreamNote crreamNote
[3:08:00] EddieTheYeti: paxyYes
[3:08:11] CapnSlipp: Okay, I’m not following completely because client mods != server mods, but I’ll trust you’re uploading the right things.
[3:08:12] orncaex: sounds like it should work
[3:08:17] slayer78456: I believe you also need to port forward a port for simple voice chat but it looks like mcprohosting has a guide for how to do that
[3:08:17] Honeybadger3: KEKHeim
[3:08:17] MojoAI: basically none
[3:08:18] omniikilla: I left to go watch Tyler1's last LOL game of the night and I'm back and you guys are still figuring this out lmao
[3:08:21] ThatGunsFoHire: You lost me 10 minutes ago
[3:08:21] feenux212: almost none
[3:08:30] rowanx0: I joined as you started this xd
[3:08:33] Rabidrhino1240: whats goin on i missed what happened
[3:08:35] slayer78456: @CapnSlipp most mods are client and server there are very few that aren't both
[3:08:37] MrSlagle: whats going on? I just finished beating Jedi Fallen Order...
[3:08:42] Sekhcellent: PeepoJuice
[3:08:43] JustCaffeinated: it interesting, i like this stuff
[3:08:52] MojoAI: I wanna see this shiz pay off LUL
[3:08:53] orncaex: As long as its an external server i dont see it  being too weird
[3:08:56] HappyPxl: People here for you, not the game ^^
[3:09:01] happyvampire23: I'm learning because I want to do this on my server lol
[3:09:08] happyvampire23: Max teaching us new things
[3:09:17] CapnSlipp: @slayer78456 Huh.  I’ve always downloaded them specifically for the client or server.  Optifine: client.  Dynmap: server
[3:09:19] CapnSlipp: But okay
[3:09:35] slayer78456: Some mods are client or server only but they aren't different between the two
[3:09:38] Remishiro: @Sekhcellent Thank you for the summary!
[3:09:42] Sekhcellent: gassyAD soon
[3:09:54] SombrerBOT: MAX IS BACK IN DND ROLEPLAY!! Max is joining Dodger, and djWHEAT on an adventure DM'd by ThatBronzeGirl! Catch them here on Wednesdays at 12pm CST! For more info and a FAQ, go here! https://lastcallforadventure.com/
[3:09:59] Honeybadger3: i mean, if there evere was a time to do all of this, this is it yea?
[3:10:06] slayer78456: They have to be the same because single player minecraft still runs a server it's how you can open to LAN play
[3:10:29] slayer78456: Yeah it should be fine
[3:10:29] CapnSlipp: That’s true.  If you have a server mod in the client’s mod directory, it just spits out a warning on server startup.  But doesn’t break.
[3:10:50] slayer78456: I've done this exact thing several times. It's how I used to set up servers before hosts got fancy aureyLOL
[3:11:00] Sekhcellent: antisipspspspsp
[3:11:05] BigJuicy4U: hypeE
[3:11:07] Water_Cat1: all mods should have coding to not activate gui stuffs when running on a server. ive only found 3 mods to crash a forge server because they are clientside only
[3:11:14] Honeybadger3: slip & slayer out here with the big brain and im over here like minikaneDerp
[3:11:18] chadica12345: only thing i know is some client side modes dont like being on a server but usually the mod pack creator makes a serverside pack
[3:11:40] slayer78456: Yep
[3:11:42] Darkaros: Hell, Crafting Tweaks for example is bi-optional and is downloaded as client or server only depending on context.
[3:11:43] Sekhcellent: peepoClap

[3:15:25] BigJuicy4U: adios turd nuggets

[3:16:46] DJLexx42: ziggyHi oh no are we having a chat troubleshooting sesh
[3:16:53] CapnSlipp: Do you have to “Install” custom jar (green button) before you can configure it?

[3:26:21] CapnSlipp: @xiliavield I mean, the MCProHosting support page told us to do exactly that— download to computer, then upload via FTP and select that jar.  So what you’re saying can’t be done is what their knowledge base says can.
[3:26:31] RoboBlake: Scmods? "State County Municipal Offender Data System"

[3:35:46] CapnSlipp: @slayer78456 Shouldn’t it be port 24454 for both source & dest ports?
[3:35:53] Darkaros: Barry's asleep and server dies for us no1GUN
[3:35:55] AnAudioEngineer: oh shii
[3:36:11] voidnn: source should be a wild card
[3:36:13] slayer78456: @CapnSlipp The guide doesn't say it's necessary so I'm not sure
[3:36:21] sventyard: sventyard subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 7 months! Nerd. <3
[3:36:25] slayer78456: Yeah it's just voip
[3:36:31] Honeybadger3: i prefer port wine sauces
[3:36:37] Darkaros: the clientside VOIP mod will have an obnoxious disconnected cord icon if it's broken
[3:36:45] Honeybadger3: or a nice port chop
[3:36:58] hollywood_8: What up Max!!!?!!!!
[3:37:09] slayer78456: The pack has an obnoxious first start up crash so I'm hoping it's just that
[3:37:11] ItsNoxid: Server might take a bit to boot
[3:37:14] CapnSlipp: Server may be a bit laggy on first launch— it’ll be generating the world and stuff, so that’s normal.
[3:37:14] Linvxx: Should just be destination port
[3:37:22] BigJuicy4U: D:
[3:37:24] Sekhcellent: uhoh
[3:37:27] ByteHammer: JP BROKE OUR SERVER

[3:37:54] Xanderan_Madman: Didn't you kill it earlier?

[3:39:48] voidnn: mod isnt compatable with your version. all over the top
[3:39:48] slayer78456: it needs the newer fabric jar
[3:39:54] SombrerBOT: MAX IS BACK IN DND ROLEPLAY!! Max is joining Dodger, and djWHEAT on an adventure DM'd by ThatBronzeGirl! Catch them here on Wednesdays at 12pm CST! For more info and a FAQ, go here! https://lastcallforadventure.com/

[3:40:10] Crona_Steingate: Jammies
[3:40:11] Honeybadger3: how do?
[3:40:12] slayer78456: go back to where you installed the modpack from
[3:40:18] CapnSlipp: Yeah, how did this happen?  How did we get mismatched jar versions?
[3:40:20] RoboBlake: what a nice woife you got there @GassyMexican
[3:40:21] Honeybadger3: @ThaProfessor11 i saw that too KEKW
[3:40:32] slayer78456: On the server where you picked the JARs
[3:40:38] Darkaros: weird how you got the older fabric jar. cuz you needed the newer one to even play it clientside. and one you DL'd from MCProHost shoulda had the newer one too stripHmm
[3:40:56] MojoAI: Cookie Jar or Pickle Jar?
[3:40:58] slayer78456: MCprohost probably hasn't updated the pack yet
[3:41:08] slayer78456: search fabric
[3:41:13] XiliaVield: @MojoAI why not both ? :P
[3:41:16] ItsNoxid: Mcprohost might of not updated since it’s new
[3:41:28] slayer78456: click the drop down
[3:41:31] Agressor42: No
[3:41:38] CapnSlipp: Nope.  Medieval pack is only updated for 1.19.2
[3:41:40] slayer78456: 1.19.2
[3:41:41] Darkaros: It's kinda bad if MCProHost hasn't updated Medieval Minecraft on its pack installer. Cuz ya the update is "only" 2-3 days old. But that means you're gonna have to do slayer's mthod of uploading
[3:41:46] CapnSlipp: So everything else needs to match 1.19.2
[3:41:49] RoboBlake: god i wish i knew
[3:41:50] slayer78456: yes
[3:41:57] slayer78456: don't delete anything
[3:42:06] voidnn: uncheck mods right
[3:42:09] Honeybadger3: i agree with whatever Slayer said
[3:42:12] cmdr_shepard_: cmdr_shepard_ subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 64 months! 
[3:42:15] slayer78456: just uncheck the boxes and it won't delete
[3:42:16] Morderalptraum: @RoboBlake take notes NOTED
[3:42:22] slayer78456: uncheck it all
[3:42:33] slayer78456: then install
[3:42:40] hollywood_8: How is your 2023 going for you so far????
[3:42:42] RoboBlake: you take notes! @Morderalptraum you're here more than i am!
[3:42:43] CapnSlipp: But is this going to be an older version of the Medieval mod?  We had the 1.19.2 version of Medieval on the desktop, but I have no idea what the MCProHost control panel installed for us.
[3:42:49] Honeybadger3: KEKW
[3:42:53] BigJuicy4U: lol
[3:42:55] Morderalptraum: @RoboBlake fair point

[3:43:23] ItsNoxid: gassyPOGGY
[3:43:34] FreshBrew: i was kidding do not ddos gassy
[3:43:41] Kerjakk: ipconfig is a beautiful thing
[3:43:55] hollywood_8: How is your 2023 going for you so far???!
[3:44:13] CapnSlipp: @slayer78456 If you say so.  I lost track of what’s been uploaded or installed on top of what at this point.
[3:44:33] Agressor42: Don't forget it may still crash the first time with the correct version now installed.

[3:44:56] Crona_Steingate: the fabric had moths
[3:44:58] issalga: I think it was chats fault
[3:45:02] RoboBlake: rocking
[3:45:04] CapnSlipp: Right.  But a modpack mod for Minecraft 1.19.1 may not run on a 1.19.2 server.
[3:45:04] Rangerftw1: @GassyMexican hey gassy do you know how i would get ahold of a twitch staff about some shady stuff going  in another channel??

[3:45:25] issalga: RoboBlake zekeLOVE
[3:45:30] Darkaros: @CapnSlipp This is a non-concern. The updated pack we know about and the past update were both on 1.19.2
[3:45:31] CapnSlipp: Hey, that’s good then.
[3:45:32] slayer78456: @CapnSlipp the modpack is 1.19.2
[3:45:37] YojanTreble: If it's running we need to catch it Bro
[3:45:44] Rangerftw1: thanks and thats kinda demoralizing haha
[3:45:46] CapnSlipp: @darkaros Ah, okay.

[3:54:40] slayer78456: Is the server set to a whitelist by default?
[3:54:59] Linvxx: Do you have to change the port at the end of the IP address if the server is starting on port 244***?
[3:55:02] RoboBlake: weird and wacky stuff
[3:55:02] blarrkan: You connected on dns when you showed us. Connect to the ip instead, that you got from the host.
[3:55:52] RedDogMT: gassy, can you connect via IP?
[3:55:52] Darkaros: MCProHost knowledge base: "By default, your server is not whitelisted."
[3:56:03] XiliaVield: he connected on the link, what he shown wasn't a DNS or IP
[3:56:07] ReefaReb: it should look like ...-...-...- something like that

[3:57:50] CapnSlipp: We don’t need to set up port forwarding for port 25565 (normal Minecraft server port), do we?
[3:57:51] WDForty: alright, getting late for me, good luck with the server and nite everyone
[3:57:54] MojoAI: are you talking about the IPv4 address after typing 'ipconfig' in cmd console?
[3:57:58] Darkaros: Gassy has to set up whitelist separately, MCProHost says by default it's not whitelisted
[3:57:59] RoboBlake: gassyCHEERS @DJLexx42

[4:05:53] Darkaros: @RedDogMT added Lootr and Simple Voice Chat
[4:05:57] CapnSlipp: So is there no error that shows up in this log when you fail to connect?
[4:06:04] issalga: have you tried asking the server nicely to not crash?
[4:06:07] RENNmae: could just be a mc error
[4:06:11] Billi__39: there is a forge version of medieval
[4:06:26] slayer78456: Connection timeout is usually firewall or packet size issues but I don't see how it's suddenly an issue when you connected fine to JP's
[4:06:31] RoboBlake: you so popular @VexedCheese I'm kinda vexed about that

[4:10:29] slayer78456: It's possible the subdomain didn't update with a refreshed IP when you did a reinstall
[4:10:33] Darkaros: MCProHost says the subdomain should work just as well as server address. But also "if you set up your subdomain within the last 24 hrs your ISP hasnt updated their DNS records yet / most do every 24 hrs"

[4:13:49] Remishiro: not well but still
[4:13:57] voidnn: @rstat1 in this case yeah, don't think the subdomain was in global dns yet
[4:14:01] CapnSlipp: @gassymexican Now for the most important rule in beginner server admin: Once it’s working, never ever change anything ever again.
[4:14:04] Agressor42: Better find that copper lol

[4:15:07] dellsdragon13: Been lurking for the stream happy to see you got things rumming
[4:15:07] RoboBlake: i had faith
[4:15:11] Darkaros: Sent it. You might have to add friend depending on privacy settings. I might be a random red dot in your friends list :p
[4:15:20] bakedsourpanda: @GassyMexican think you need to give a reward to Darkaros helping ya 2 days in a row
[4:15:27] CapnSlipp: This seems to be how everything works with following instructions to set up computer stuff: There’s 3 different ways to do it, but you somehow end up doing a combinations of ways that doesn’t work.
[4:15:36] Remishiro: @bakedsourpanda NODDERS
[4:15:43] RoboBlake: so many names
[4:15:50] RoboBlake: so many people
[4:16:01] atomizedkitsune: @RoboBlake Ty :D
[4:16:07] slayer78456: I blame mcprohost not listing the modpack on it's supported pack page or we could have had it done much sooner aureyLOL
[4:16:10] ShaiHulud66: Danger Pete sounds like an NPC in a space cowboy game
[4:16:24] bakedsourpanda: i didnt wake up early to catch D&D stream
[4:16:29] Darkaros: I mean we can also blame McProHost not instantly updating the modpack's 3 day update so we had to change jar :p
[4:16:30] Raphiezar: Oh, he was able to do a similar server to JP's.
[4:16:33] Agressor42: The first words typed in the server lol
[4:16:51] CapnSlipp: @slayer78456 Also, their instructions for custom upload kind of sucked (are probably outdated).
[4:16:55] Darkaros: i havent picked origin yet lol
[4:17:03] yammosk5: um
[4:17:06] tapatochips: WeirdPeepo

[4:17:17] RedDogMT: sky dungeon
[4:17:17] ShaiHulud66: is this a new server from yesterdays stream?
[4:17:23] emmy_sophia: Darkaros lookin kinda S U S
[4:17:23] RoboBlake: and we fishin
[4:17:29] RoboBlake: LUL
[4:17:32] Crona_Steingate: Sussy
[4:17:36] ODedonlife: rooSus
[4:17:40] Raphiezar: Sussy
[4:17:55] ShaiHulud66: sus
[4:17:57] RedDogMT: try voip again..maybe you needed another player online
[4:18:02] CapnSlipp: @shaihulud66 This is a new server we just set up and started for the 1st time in the past hour, with the same modpack as the previous stream (different server).
[4:18:07] Crona_Steingate: SPOTTED A PANDA rooGun
[4:18:14] slayer78456: It's the same starting gear for everyone
[4:18:17] bakedsourpanda: The first time you spawned last time it gave you a bow
[4:18:17] ShaiHulud66: @CapnSlipp gotcha!! thanks :)
[4:18:30] Darkaros: ya voice chat aint working for the server. should be easy to fix with ports like slayers' mentioned
[4:18:31] Agressor42: You can't use basic MC bows, mod bows are another entity I guess
[4:18:46] kitycatpanther4: maybe your a knight rnager class if you have combos
[4:18:50] CapnSlipp: I’m thinking the VOIP issue is the source & dest ports.  Usually on servers, the src & dest are identical.
[4:19:04] Rinzler_XeroGaming: i just started singing BIG BIG BACHUNGAS right when you did a emote lol
[4:19:07] LDRich: I played and arachnid and it starts you with bread I can't eat. the mods weird lol
[4:19:08] MojoAI: might as well lol
[4:19:09] Rinzler_XeroGaming: thanks max lol
[4:19:13] Remishiro: go the whole distance NODDERS
[4:19:18] RoboBlake: setting up for the future
[4:19:19] 大綿津見神: Aye it works! Good job!
[4:19:29] ShaiHulud66: in it to win it, risk it for the biscuit
[4:19:50] RoboBlake: this music is a bit ominous
[4:19:56] ShaiHulud66: spoopy music
[4:19:57] MojoAI: Gassy, your first quest is to find the big chungus disc LUL for celebratory reasons
[4:20:04] 大綿津見神: Oh voip still not working. So close.
[4:20:08] ShaiHulud66: @MojoAI i support this quest
[4:20:17] slayer78456: It's just a registry error because we manually updated the server
[4:20:20] Darkaros: ijpHMM
[4:20:23] ceraeno95: gassyS  hitchcockian nightmare vibes are cool
[4:20:53] RoboBlake: !seeburg
[4:20:54] SombrerBOT: The background music you're hearing is from https://seeburg1000.com/
[4:20:56] ItsNoxid: gassyRECORD
[4:21:02] RoboBlake: THANK YOU
[4:21:25] slayer78456: source to same as destination
[4:21:31] CapnSlipp: Umm… I think it was change the source to be same as dest.
[4:21:33] Darkaros: Also Gassy you still have the giant Discord message I made for setup right? You can just ship that + the ImmediatelyFast downgrade to peeps now and get them playing like, right now if ya wanted NODDERS you've done 99% of the hard part
[4:21:36] RoboBlake: not seeburg but so much better
[4:21:39] RoboBlake: thanks
[4:21:40] CapnSlipp: @slayer78456 What was the port number again?
[4:21:57] slayer78456: Yeah both should be that
[4:22:04] CapnSlipp: Yup
[4:22:32] CapnSlipp: Can you set both if you delete that mapping and add a new one?
[4:22:34] slayer78456: You can change that and then update the config
[4:22:56] CapnSlipp: Ugg
[4:23:03] RedDogMT: isnt the provider just forwarding port1 to port2?
[4:23:08] slayer78456: You can pick the port for the mod in server configs
[4:23:31] slayer78456: Yeah in FTP there is a configs folder
[4:23:52] slayer78456: I don't know if it will randomize the source port each time it launches though
[4:23:55] Athior: wait what's going on?
[4:23:59] ItsNoxid: gassyS
[4:24:00] thatguyth0ugh: system32 coxSteven
[4:24:10] RoboBlake: LETS DO THIS
[4:24:16] RoboBlake: do it live
[4:24:22] RedDogMT: I doubt it will randomize the port since it is public facing
[4:24:22] RoboBlake: DAMNIT
[4:24:23] Remishiro: but if you launch it again, you can check if it randomized it again
[4:24:38] Athior: I'm confused what were you trying to do @gassymexican
[4:24:42] ladymac1970: play it
[4:24:54] SombrerBOT: Did you know Max has a new video up? Go check it out here! SCPs Are Scary! (SCP: Secret Laboratory Shenanigans) https://youtu.be/_K5TGfNzP4U
[4:25:00] Darkaros: Gassy's trying to do the final step: getting Simple Voice Chat to work for the server. Requires port forwarding.
[4:25:06] CapnSlipp: I think you can’t change the port because it’s shared hosting?  You don’t have a whole server to yourself, so you can’t use lower-number portss.
[4:25:15] Darkaros: forwarding? That might not be the right term ijpONO port-management
[4:25:17] RoboBlake: ahh @Darkaros i get it now
[4:25:24] CapnSlipp: It’s a server thing.  Not sure how to explain it.
[4:25:47] RoboBlake: if i can hear your dulcet tones @Darkaros  i will wait
[4:26:01] slayer78456: I don't have a lot of experience with the voice mod itself so it might be best to poke Barry when he's awake since he set it up for JPs
[4:26:02] LordDooblay: As long as the destination port can be changed locally, it shouldn't matter right, or am I missing something?
[4:26:28] grod2011: The face of concentration!!! It’s like he’s decoding a deadly disease and find formulas in order to solve the pandemic LUL LUL
[4:26:29] CapnSlipp: @lorddooblay Yep, that’s probably the solution.  He just wants to play.
[4:26:38] Agressor42: Btw Gassy there's an add-on mod for Origins that's just an umbrella for the ones weak to sunlight/rain in case you or JP might be interested for your servers.
[4:26:40] Darkaros: coxOmg can get all yo mods to play without having to ping barry in his slumber nao
[4:26:43] RoboBlake: poor barry
[4:26:45] LordDooblay: Yeah, tomorrow problem LUL
[4:26:55] RoboBlake: god i feel for barry
[4:26:58] Athior: were you trying to setup proximity voice chat?
[4:27:00] Remishiro: the goal line was so close! but its better than going back to square one gassyLUL
[4:27:20] Morderalptraum: @RoboBlake NODDERS
[4:27:31] Athior: ahh ok
[4:27:49] RoboBlake: if i had the means @Darkaros in a heart beat
[4:27:50] MojoAI: big chungus here we come
[4:27:53] RedDogMT: perhaps you need to message support for port editing
[4:27:57] ShaiHulud66: i mean in the end you can just use ingame messaging
[4:28:20] Darkaros: Beginning of yesterday's stream you could see me and Barry trying to debug why I kept crashing and it turned out to be what caused JP to crash at the end of the strim LUL
[4:28:34] ItsNoxid: Lol
[4:28:49] Remishiro: does that mean it can happen to gassy?
[4:29:01] Remishiro: or is it essentially resolved?
[4:29:04] RedDogMT: Not really. The random port is probably randomized once. It sounds like it hides the actual port from being puiblc. Sure it cuts down on DDOSing.
[4:29:16] voidnn: most network apps have random source port, so you use a wildcard (any) and the destination port is what is important. Client connects to destination.
[4:29:22] Darkaros: @Remishiro resolved, requires a client-side mod downgrade ijpSUFFER but i sent out the info to everyone this morning
[4:29:34] Remishiro: ah okay, nice!
[4:29:42] Remishiro: gassyNICE
[4:30:01] Athior: whats the main mod you're using if you don't mine my asking.

[4:46:17] MojoAI: "When a player carrying [a Charm of Life] would normally take lethal damage, the charm will activate, preventing the damage, healing the player, and consuming the charm. The charm comes in two varieties. The Charm of Life I (the one you have) will heal the player back to 4 hearts, and bestow a weak regeneration effect for the next 10 seconds."
[4:46:26] MojoAI: "The Charm of Life II will heal the player fully, and activate several powerful regeneration and protection effects for the next 30 seconds. You can combine 4 level I charms to produce a level II charm in the crafting grid."

[5:11:06] TomatenPleb: server, I OWN YOU
[5:11:09] Athior: ohhh yeah that's a setting you need to fix. I had that on my server. you need to enable it manually
[5:11:09] bluedragon_52: LUL
[5:11:10] Randon_Tain: you might need to edit your server properties to enable flying
[5:11:24] shinyjewell: weren't you already flying?

[5:12:07] Darkaros: slayer went to bed so google's your friend
[5:12:09] Athior: as I mentioned you need to manually change it in the server config files
[5:12:21] Randon_Tain: not that I know of, it's in the server properties config file
[5:12:30] Noma____: if you move to fast is registers as "flying" to prevent hackers it doesnt take into account for mods that give flying
[5:12:34] JustCaffeinated: venaAd
[5:12:47] rowanx0: I think it occurs when youre loading in new chunks
[5:13:16] FreshBrew: quick googling says you gotta change it in config files
[5:13:27] DJLexx42: wait...lvl 14? his bird is lvl 14?!
[5:13:39] Xanderan_Madman: apparently
[5:13:57] Athior: @rowanx0 every server created by a hosting service auto has it set to where flying isn't permitted on servers. you need to change it on the server file configs.
[5:14:25] Darkaros: @DJLexx42 the latest update changed mob levels so that it scales harder with dist from spawn but... ya idk why this at-spawn birb's 14

[5:35:57] CapnSlipp: @gassymexican Oh hey, Classy earlier was talking about interest in playing the Medieval Minecraft server.  He didn’t want to impose on JP and specifically said not to tell Gassy he wanted to play on JP’s server— but now that you have your own server, that’s a different sitch.
[5:36:22] DJLexx42: gassy goes straight to mining and darkeros goes straight to looting
[5:36:44] CapnSlipp: TL;DR Classy will probably want play on your new server.
