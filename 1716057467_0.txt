[2:08:48] RafaLorenzo: last time I shower? oh in 2022
[2:08:49] Biskit427: My gf uses silk pillow cases and she says it helps your skin too.
[2:08:51] therarecobra: ...walks away slowly
[2:08:51] Hitoearth: -3 health it is
[2:08:51] BroCreed1: I truly do need to wash my pillows… But I don’t have bad skin either

[2:09:23] 1StClassAlcoholic: Freezer yea
[2:09:26] FishhNado: who told u that? patti?
[2:09:28] ThatOnneGuy: only if you have actual dirt and shit on your jeans you wash them

[2:09:40] Biskit427: Just throwing a couple pairs of jeans on the grill. Straight out of the freezer.
[2:09:43] SailorWS: ever
[2:09:43] Nostromo6467: yup
[2:09:44] LsTheRoberto: I wore jeans for the first time yesterday in like 3 months
[2:09:45] kinglouisxvii: i wear joggers that look like normal pants all the time
[2:09:45] Stormflare: i was my jeans once a week or so

[2:10:20] rooskie89: crisscross in my wranglers
[2:10:22] Spike1302: ReallyMad
[2:10:22] Apparentthreat: that doesn't disprove him
[2:10:23] Apparentthreat: you realize
[2:10:25] Kjoelby: Sport shorts at home even in winter here
[2:10:25] Morlega: but not forever
[2:10:25] maccabeus: yeah, to slow the bacteria that you then cook off
[2:10:26] maimvice13: i work in the food industrie
[2:10:26] Foooks: susge
[2:10:26] Al_Kappaccino: it does slow it down
[2:10:27] TheRackster: Wait untill he finds out how supermarkets store their food
[2:10:28] iQuantumFlux: Lulu pants are heaven
[2:10:32] mrleonehart: @Giantwaffle Wait till he hears about Dry aging lol
[2:10:34] sneakyHoovy: it wont kill it anyway
[2:10:34] Apparentthreat: you didn't prove a point
[2:10:35] Sxe_Ben: cold does not kill germs lol
[2:10:35] UnrealUndead: Yes, to slow it down
[2:10:36] LinearLayer: it slows
[2:10:42] elric689: he is correct
[2:10:43] sneakyHoovy: Pepega
[2:10:45] Morlega: Ice cream in the freezer has an expiration date...
[2:10:46] BroCreed1: I used to wear joggers to the office, but then someone complained and HR had to clarify the dress code. :(
[2:10:50] Hitoearth: It still gets the blody moldy
[2:10:56] Harmar: KEKW
[2:10:56] xDeadBringerx: Freezing kills parasites, but not germa
[2:10:56] Wazepas: Brain rot 2 hours in Sadge
[2:10:58] Aldizzert: Freezing kills parasites. It merely puts most pathogens to sleep
[2:11:01] Larklen: Just put it in the oven to make the bacteria work faster NODDERS
[2:11:14] ThatOnneGuy: I didn't do anything peepoSip
[2:11:20] LinearLayer: it has to be really really cold to kill, they blast freeze fish to make it sushi grade
[2:11:22] FinnYellowbelly: @Kamendrias finaoliveMyman
[2:11:23] mrleonehart: @Giantwaffle Cold does not kill germs just makes them dormant and slow.
[2:11:27] FiIthy_Rat: Freeze the germs, then burn the germs
[2:11:27] sneakyHoovy: Pepega just eat ice
[2:11:27] Scullzyy: I beat my jeans with my fist to kill germs
[2:11:31] Pati: we are making the wires just not the cables fast enough
[2:11:34] dollar_cave: If it did, you could take out sealed frozen meat and it would shelf-stable at room temperature forever after LUL
[2:11:38] BroCreed1: Can confirm, I work as a Food Safety Coordinator. Cold does not kill bacterial pathogens. It only prevents growth.
[2:11:41] 112nuno112: @Larklen ifyou do it at about 35 C, then yes
[2:11:42] J0hanAndersson: @PiratePati pirate28Love
[2:11:43] shavinglove: Just wash them!
[2:11:44] Apparentthreat: "never frozen" beef would seem way more gross if freezing had any actual benefit other than making it last longer / delay decomposition
[2:11:49] Maximus439: i light my jeans on fire for a minute to clean them YEP
[2:12:02] maimvice13: 70+c to kill it
[2:12:04] Harmar: prutymuch
[2:12:11] RussianRainbowTV: its where DNA starts to break apart right?
[2:12:11] LinearLayer: 170F or so
[2:12:12] Larklen: @112nuno112 what kinda fancy ass oven you got that can go that low pepeLaugh
[2:12:18] Matt11711: no its like 165f
[2:12:18] Aldizzert: In meat, 160 is considered to kill bacteria instantly
[2:12:21] The_Stone_One: Tin wires
[2:12:22] ChromaCym: Time range also matters. Low and slow can be just as effective as hot and quick
[2:12:25] CurbSerpent: above 60 C bacterial growth is inhibited
[2:12:25] Jeebs92: Heats kills it that is why our bodies give us a fever when we get sick
[2:12:26] Biskit427: I think most meats are ok at 165D
[2:12:27] Biskit427: F
[2:12:28] EpicTitan232: 165 f is the magic number for most industries
[2:12:28] FiIthy_Rat: Why pizza goes in the oven for 450
[2:12:30] Hurtwolf: quickly, get sodepop
[2:12:31] SailorWS: getting up earlier == early brain rot
[2:12:31] 1StClassAlcoholic: Oven baked jeans Pog
[2:12:32] Apparentthreat: @Giantwaffle you started 30 min early. that's why YEP
[2:12:32] Shantrix: did you ever set the rotten flesh system back to Iron ?
[2:12:32] Fufcia: 165/170F same temperature as to cook meat
[2:12:33] kinglouisxvii: have you thought of takin nootropics
[2:12:35] Malvaxen: !mc_pack
[2:12:35] Moobot: Waffle is playing Nomifactory (GTCEu Port) | https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/nomi-ceu | Already missing one deadline, will the bois be able to beat it by NYE 2023? Tune in to every stream to find out! pepeLaugh

[2:12:42] Tetsomina: Is Pâti getting on today?
[2:12:45] Maximus439: time for some C4 to cure the brainrot
[2:12:47] SmokyMtnRed: Sody sounds good
[2:12:48] 112nuno112: there is no "golden temperature",. each microorganism has its own graph curve of death over temeperature
[2:12:49] FiIthy_Rat: Really 900? My job is 450 for 10min
[2:12:54] PureSpider: "cook" pizza?
[2:12:56] PureSpider: DansGame
[2:13:00] maimvice13: we make pasteurized milk and nee 72 c for 10 sec to kill the bacteria
[2:13:00] dollar_cave: yeah the hotter the better
[2:13:00] DX_Plates: @Tetsomina Pati did a late night stream last night
[2:13:02] Morlega: HV
[2:13:05] Aldizzert: But there' is a USDA Time/Temperatue curve. You can cook to an internal temperature of 145 for ~45 minutes and still be safe
[2:13:06] Daryl_Kay: 170 is the temp for turkey
[2:13:06] GameDadel: tin should me made in the me?
[2:13:09] dollar_cave: (well, probably 5000K would be too hot)
[2:13:12] stickman_02: Pati has a multiblock for wires now
[2:13:17] dadmanandy: Can't you just upgrade voltage?
[2:13:18] Lola_: bro, there are bacteria in volcano geyser @Giantwaffle they wont die in owen
[2:13:19] maccabeus: NODDERS napoleon style is my favorite
[2:13:20] PureSpider: proper stone oven pozza YEP
[2:13:26] Harmar: @Maximus439 time to Q the CI to blow something up or set a reactor meltdown YEP that will kill it
[2:13:29] itsIffy: YEP any pizza
[2:13:29] hippiedude212: time to upgrade machines
[2:13:32] Pati: Time to upgrade to zpm or make the multiblock : )
[2:13:34] FishhNado: i put my pizzas in my elite assembling machine III
[2:13:34] Butterwhales: proper pizza YEP
[2:13:35] BroCreed1: Well time and temp both play a factor. Most pathogens have a chart that shows what temp at what time will kill it. There are some bacteria that form protective layers that are not phased until 300+ F
[2:13:35] maccabeus: Kappa
[2:13:36] maimvice13: @Giantwaffle we make pasteurized milk and nee 72 c for 10 sec to kill the bacteria
[2:13:39] Morlega: Multi-block the coating YEP
[2:13:39] jmm548: can u make a EV or somethign assembling machine ?

[2:14:09] Pati: blind
[2:14:16] Tetsomina: Upgrade all machines!
[2:14:29] fraenklyn: @Giantwaffle  it's pronounced 'darmstad-zee-um', was discovered at the gsi in wixhausen. there is a smaller older cern and they developed shooting fast ions at cancer cells
[2:14:29] jmm548: wow
[2:14:31] ImposterArchitect: just make a higher voltage one.
[2:14:33] maccabeus: @PureSpider what do you have against authentic french pizza?
[2:14:36] Morlega: That'll do the trick LUL
[2:14:36] Furiak: neat

[2:15:11] Pati: Ill probably work on that anyway
[2:15:27] FiIthy_Rat: @J0hanAndersson We have generic pizzas at PJ

[2:26:39] PureSpider: @DecoyOcelot surely you can't turn everything into a liquid form?
[2:27:11] SailorWS: its the perfect diamonds that are the issue
[2:27:12] DecoyOcelot: most everything can be made from liquid into a solidifier
[2:27:16] DecoyOcelot: but not everything
[2:27:21] rektumtv: 12k perfect diamonds
[2:27:23] FiIthy_Rat: sand?

[2:27:38] maimvice13: you don't have all the componets calculated for netherstar
[2:27:41] Morlega: There's a miner recipe that produces 64+32 perfect diamonds instead of just 64 iirc
[2:27:41] PureSpider: @DecoyOcelot i'm talking about the other way around

[2:28:38] DecoyOcelot: @DecoyOcelot if it can be made into an ingot or sheet or whatever, it can be made into a liquid
[2:28:39] deadgolfer: ZPM
[2:28:40] BlazedOak: Jesus, I'm old.
[2:28:42] tomey36: I think it’s just the 2k of pumps mortars arms ect taking all the titanium

[2:29:00] ImposterArchitect: MultiBlock
[2:29:02] deadgolfer: you made the system so you could swap out machines and power, might as well
[2:29:02] xCutie: monkaHmm

[2:29:05] tomey36: Pati made a zpm line for titanium
[2:29:13] Flobu_: primo_qwe what is the advantage?
[2:29:21] primo_qwe: cheaper and faster to craft
[2:29:29] Duke1454: completely off-topic but its finally snowing in NY. It hasn't snowed at all this year
[2:29:55] deadgolfer: upgrade it to ZPM machines
[2:29:55] DecoyOcelot: imagine the entire polyethylene line replaced with one tank lol
[2:30:07] GameDadel: upgrade
[2:30:10] Morlega: Time for another multiblock YEP
[2:30:12] LurkerNr5: the big assembling machine might fix it :)
[2:30:13] primo_qwe: like at this point you should have other SMDs and use them cause they are cheaper
[2:30:14] Jimanjim: do the multiblock thingy
[2:30:21] mechoriet: multiblock assembler for the smd's

[2:36:11] GameDadel: ontop?
[2:36:13] Larklen: @Rozz161 as it should be NODDERS

[2:41:44] Moobot: You can sub to Waffle by clicking this neat link -> twitch.tv/giantwaffle/subscribe SUBprise

[2:42:05] knowledge_within: dont those need them to make foils etc
[2:42:13] PureSpider: @Morlega this would work, yea
[2:42:34] deadgolfer: request some
[2:42:35] DecoyOcelot: those crafting cards only work for requested items, not for patterns
[2:42:38] Noamwild: it finished already
[2:42:49] Morlega: Are you importing the finished products already?
[2:42:50] Pati: Wrong recipe
[2:42:51] mechoriet: susHmm
[2:42:58] PureSpider: crafting cards need to go where the product is consumed, not where it's made
[2:43:18] Pati: theres 4 and we are using the one that makes more iirc
[2:43:23] PureSpider: crafting cards request the craft from the interface
[2:43:28] deadgolfer: these recipes need to make stuff too, need in both locations
[2:43:33] Locohobo: you would want crafting cards here anyways for the foils
[2:43:33] Pati: PVC
[2:43:34] DX_Plates: Pati lives
[2:43:39] ih_shevtsov: it is not yours
[2:43:49] PureSpider: crafting cards go in the interface or export bus that provides/exports the SMD stuff
[2:44:27] Morlega: Export bus without crafting card = export whatever's available in storage. Export bus with crafting card = craft if not available in storage
[2:44:29] matori666: wherever you use the smd you need a crafting card
[2:44:34] PureSpider: wtf i've never seen that message before seqKEK
[2:44:36] GameDadel: crafting cards?
[2:44:40] PureSpider: @matori666 this
[2:44:54] primo_qwe: craft on demand some electrum wire?
[2:44:58] mage178: yes
[2:44:59] deadgolfer: yes
[2:45:01] Kunja: maybe your input busses are too small for the quantities you requested?
[2:45:02] PureSpider: yes
[2:45:05] mechoriet: make pattern for it xdd
[2:45:11] deadgolfer: you need in both locations
[2:45:12] zynithtv: do what i do and put crafting cards in everything Kappa
[2:45:13] PureSpider: correct, yes
[2:45:14] ih_shevtsov: no
[2:45:14] mage178: corrrect
[2:45:16] Morlega: Only if you use export buses or interfaces to provide the SMD
[2:45:17] Jimanjim: put the crafting card to every ME interface on the inputs
[2:45:20] matori666: you have it in most places already because of the wires anyways
[2:45:27] PureSpider: you're right
[2:45:27] Locohobo: you want the card here and where its being used
[2:45:36] ih_shevtsov: why? the system will craft everything by request
[2:45:40] matori666: pati forgot those
[2:45:44] Sn00zr: Add crafting cards to the machine right beside you. Pati removed them I believe. @Giantwaffle
[2:45:44] PureSpider: if you want THIS craft to request the fine wires to be crafted, it needs a crafting card, so it's correct
[2:45:44] thecodealive_original: crafting card is only neccesary in export busses and interfaces when used as export bus
[2:45:45] b0ltz12: if the fine electrum wire is a crafted item via a pattern, then you need a crafting card to ask the system to craft it. If the wire is passively made then you don't need the crafting card
[2:45:46] Pati: i forgor
[2:45:48] Morlega: I'm pretty sure crafting cards in interfaces don't get used by the patterns in it
[2:45:51] fapohogu: just remembering that this is day 32 of this modpack
[2:45:52] Spirevipp: you need crafting card when you use interface to "hold" teh items
[2:45:53] MisterRabbitHead: 💀
[2:46:00] matori666: for fine you need, for normal wires you dont
[2:46:02] Timiderxbox: Remove it and look, it works
[2:46:06] PureSpider: yes
[2:46:18] mage178: it needs the crafting card
[2:46:19] SailorWS: i think that error is bc your fire wire isnt a pattern its the machine into a drawer
[2:46:21] Morlega: Crafting cards in interfaces should only affect the stock slots at the top, not the patterns
[2:46:24] RogueLightning_: I thought crafting cards were for the config
[2:46:24] primo_qwe: @Giantwaffle crafting card only looks at "Config" section not patterns section
[2:46:31] PureSpider: SMD needs fine wire, which is requests because IT has a crafting card, fine wire needs wire which then IT requests because it also has a crafting card
[2:46:34] matori666: because the fine needs to request the normal one, but normal wires have the ingots already
[2:46:41] deadgolfer: thats so fast
[2:46:53] PureSpider: @matori666 this
[2:46:59] Bernd135: The Card is only needed if you want the Item to be autocrafted if is not already there if you provide this item inside a interface or export bus. The recipes themselves always request the needed items and therefore for themselve do not need crafting cards
[2:47:23] DonMerkuzio: DonMerkuzio subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 18 months! Finally I can resub, I wait every month for that special moment :D
[2:47:32] SailorWS: the fine wires dont have a pattern
[2:47:33] deadgolfer: no harm to have them in there, leave them
[2:47:34] KritterIsBack: FeelsDankMan I just like the colors
[2:47:41] banana_assasin: Crafting cards are used to request a craft, if you are only using patterns then the craft was requested by whatever asked the pattern to run
[2:47:42] ih_shevtsov: it is chain of crafting, not just passive storage
[2:47:42] primo_qwe: Patterns doesnt matter, it looks at Stored Items
[2:47:43] matori666: but they should
[2:47:44] Morlega: @Giantwaffle Crafting Card only affects export busses and the "stock" slots in the top of the interface. Patterns in interfaces are unaffected
[2:47:45] Purecrew: Just put a crafting card in everything
[2:47:47] Tro95: The initiator (player or machine) needs the crafting card
[2:47:49] SushiInHell: just throw it in.. becouse it dosnt harm the system
[2:47:56] MisterRabbitHead: rooIsee
[2:47:59] Wingy_: pattern crafts are recursive, if you wanted it to keep an item in the interface you would need a crafting card
[2:48:06] silv: trackmania 2020 is coming to steam Kreygasm
[2:48:08] Morlega: correct
[2:48:08] Mojoillumini: I haven't watched waffle in so long love to see you still playing minecraft
[2:48:08] TelRehiad: correct. no need for crafting card
[2:48:10] ih_shevtsov: so system will decide what to craft on request

[2:50:08] MisterRabbitHead: @sankhazo just google eartrumpet and thank me later
[2:50:20] deadgolfer: use one interface per item "type"? So like all  the SMD stuff in one, and then do coated wires in the next
[2:50:28] masonthicks: Neat is a mod by Vaskii
[2:50:28] SimonSez: eartrumpet is great for that @sankhazo It brings back the old volume controls
[2:50:32] dylan0806: One has 48
[2:50:47] matori666: when you add the crafting cards wherever you use the components
[2:50:48] knowledge_within: isnt fluid different?
[2:50:48] mage178: the machines using them will need crafting cards right?
[2:50:57] kane1941: You need Gallium Arsenide for them right?
[2:51:00] Morlega: Yeah, but if you have any interfaces or export busses that provide these "passively", they need a crafting card
[2:51:12] RussianRainbowTV: HUH
[2:51:15] PureSpider: OhSteph oh you're that special kinda dumb, got it

[2:52:36] gray_neko: gray_neko subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 28 months! waffleHey waffleHey
[2:52:37] PureSpider: manual crafting requests always figure out the entire tree right there, crafting cards are only needed for passive crafts
[2:52:42] fapohogu: villagerWaffle
[2:52:50] ih_shevtsov: you wil not have passive storage
[2:52:54] ih_shevtsov: just add receipts
[2:52:57] ih_shevtsov: and thats all
[2:52:58] PureSpider: should Copege
[2:52:59] Morlega: Yeah that works too. If everything is on-demand, there's no need for crafter cards
[2:53:03] PureSpider: it will work if you manually request the crafts
[2:53:06] ih_shevtsov: you even don't need that storage
[2:53:17] fapohogu: @ih_shevtsov you buying something?
[2:53:19] ih_shevtsov: request everything on demand with suck kind of speed
[2:53:23] Morlega: Crafting cards are only needed if you got a 24/7 crafter that has on-demand ingredients
[2:53:35] MisterRabbitHead: Bedge my jam
[2:53:46] jessemccartney2022: you make me nervous you don't answer me SoonerLater

[2:55:02] Morlega: Yes
[2:55:03] TelRehiad: yes
[2:55:04] MagnesiumOxide: yup
[2:55:06] matori666: correct
[2:55:19] kane1941: increase buffers inside interfaces
[2:55:23] deadgolfer: coated cables?
[2:55:23] Wolfven1: @PiratePati also Hi Pati! chibidokiLove chibidokiLove
[2:55:26] Pati: gaming
[2:55:26] Morlega: Yes. Interface will then autocraft if it doesn't find any in storage
[2:55:51] kane1941: it also needs pigs
[2:56:08] PureSpider: is there no fast multiblock circuit assembler?
[2:56:08] Wallie86: how you feeling today @giantwaffle
[2:56:15] Pati: Id make the circuit assembler for the normal circuits to HV
[2:56:26] GameDadel: multiblock time?
[2:56:33] PureSpider: multiblock time PeepoClap
[2:56:34] Pati: the ones that dont need a cleanroom
[2:56:38] jessemccartney2022: eh..... shut the game down
[2:56:43] deadgolfer: non-cleanroom
[2:56:47] Yakobro: nanocircuit is the final hv one

[2:56:53] PureSpider: how expensive is that?
[2:56:59] Morlega: That one said "Requires a cleanroom"
[2:57:15] Fitmit: Does that mean the outside is the dirty room?
[2:57:18] Asissen: @PiratePati there is alos the filtering maintance hatch that allows them to get cleanroom
[2:57:26] Pati: true but it needs UV
[2:57:35] deadgolfer: progress, you can smell the COPIUM
[2:57:36] Morlega: If they're base ingredients for everything else, seems smart to do these first LUL
[2:57:38] Yakobro: you should make the final tiers that do need a cleanroom, they're cheap with the SoC's no?
[2:57:48] Pati: to not have to use a cleanroom
[2:57:49] Moobot: You can find Waffle's Youtube channel here - https://youtube.com/giantwaffle
[2:57:52] Pati: the filtration block
[2:58:07] GGoodGGuy: what is clean room?

[2:58:33] CommanderUrsus: mooolti block
[2:58:36] 19rhys: MEGA SIDEQUEST
[2:58:38] PureSpider: yea multiblock everything seems like the next step up
[2:58:42] deadgolfer: you should have room in the cleanroom one, you could probably do them all in a single multiblock in the cleanroom. Saves the need to make 2
[2:58:59] Locohobo: this is making it so the main quest is possible

[3:14:32] HawtBawlZicles: @Experiment_B  waffleUndo
[3:14:36] Morlega: Would adding a clean block to the factory remove the need for a clean room?
[3:14:44] PureSpider: @Morlega yes
[3:14:45] richiepat: you didnt make the 64 paralell block
[3:14:47] Face_32: @inforv I will check it out. thanks a ton
[3:14:52] richiepat: its not auto craftable
[3:16:05] richiepat: what did you do to ci new breakroom?
[3:16:19] SailorWS: nope
[3:16:19] Saytos1: yes
[3:16:25] lukasalbert: casual 128 double compressed octa caps
[3:16:43] PureSpider: that was a month ago
[3:16:43] Blitzonite: a while ago
[3:16:44] TallicDragon: that's a few weeks ago
[3:16:46] RussianRainbowTV: talking about orbital bombardment?
[3:16:49] d3vrand0m: telephone pole sized steel rods
[3:16:56] MisterRabbitHead: didn't electroboom shocked himself with those?
[3:16:57] SailorWS: from space?
[3:16:58] RussianRainbowTV: like telephone pole tungsten rods from space
[3:17:00] snurre: came out a month ago
[3:17:01] J0hanAndersson: its 1 month old video NODDERS
[3:17:02] PureSpider: yea that's from a month ago
[3:17:03] RussianRainbowTV: the THOR project was insane
[3:17:04] b0ltz12: he came out with a new vide 30 minutes ago, but that rods video was a month ago
[3:17:06] Morlega: oh typical orbital bombardment
[3:17:07] Wetware: I don't see how you could be accurate with them?
[3:17:08] Saytos1: @SailorWS yes 󠀀
[3:17:14] DemonsDawn: the good ol' Rod from God
[3:17:18] PureSpider: with adam savage! igaPog
[3:17:20] Enigmaticb: chat link for video?
[3:17:39] Gabflamme11: It was hella dangerous
[3:17:41] toolos: he uploaded a new video like 26 minutes ago. It was sth about gecko skin
[3:17:41] d3vrand0m: Scott Manley did a vid on it then recreated it in kerbal
[3:17:46] Flobu_: too much wind
[3:17:50] SimonSez: The army did that 50 years ago
[3:18:03] W84M3: oh snap missed waffle's reaction to  Ci's new gaming house :|
[3:18:05] mrkaszkeit: So like mythbasters but whithout problem solving?
[3:18:07] arcticae: something like that would need orbital speeds to work, not just gravity
[3:18:19] PureSpider: would've been a lot better with fins, they said
[3:18:37] suvati68: Geez
[3:18:38] PureSpider: no they didnt do the kilometer high experiment
[3:18:45] PureSpider: was only a few hundred meters
[3:18:49] daedmissica0: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_n1FZaKzF8&t=1330shttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_n1FZaKzF8&t=1330s
[3:18:50] RussianRainbowTV: yeah this is why the US was planning to drop them from space
[3:18:56] Flobu_: and it was completely buried jin the ground
[3:18:58] CommanderUrsus: wiley coyote droppin anvils
[3:18:59] PureSpider: but yea, completely uncontrollable
[3:19:01] daedmissica0: rod of god
[3:19:14] RussianRainbowTV: thats why you just make the blast yield high enough to not care xdd
[3:19:18] DemonsDawn: with enough speed, they dont need guidance
[3:19:21] sorefingers: literally dropping science anvils hahaha
[3:19:30] PureSpider: yea they were initially meant as ICBM defense seqKEK
[3:19:32] tomey36: Not ICBM but maybe a city
[3:19:34] SimonSez: ACME anvils
[3:19:45] Morlega: With guidance and very good prediction, sure, but difficult
[3:19:47] Salerodis: I mean, the THEROY is there.. just not the execution lmao
[3:19:48] daedmissica0: Veritasium new video is good The Stickiest Non-Sticky Substance
[3:19:48] GummiKu: Well if you build a complete carpet around the earth, you can release anywhere
[3:19:58] Gabflamme11: Imagine if they have killed someone because yolo… we need a video so drop it
[3:20:11] RussianRainbowTV: it was anti nuclear missile bunker destruction, being able to punch hundreds of meters underground
[3:20:12] PureSpider: which for ICBM defense you'd need a massively large network of sattelites that can even launch those rods to cover nearly enough ground
[3:20:16] Soul12eaver: how crazy do you have to get the timing right to hit a moving target with a spike from space....
[3:20:26] Blitzonite: the thing was that if you scale them incredibly large, the drag they accrue as they traverse the atmosphere vs the mass of the object is much lessenned, which may make them end up work
[3:20:51] PureSpider: the video is good, go watch it if you haven't :D
[3:21:17] PureSpider: it's beyond impractical :D
[3:21:32] SeriousPotatoBot: Copege Oh shitty unsafe clickbait video failed because the real thing did
[3:21:33] officialhunterx: plus reloading
[3:21:35] Shantrix: what if all starlink has one monkaS
[3:21:38] GummiKu: Multiple tens of thousends you would need
[3:21:41] DemonsDawn: just build a quick support space elevator
[3:21:42] PureSpider: and to defy it all, you just launch two ICBMs instead of one PrideShrug
[3:21:54] Morlega: Every starlink is a rod of god if you use it well enough EZ
[3:21:56] MetalBBA: they would also need to be in super low orbit so maintenance would be hell
[3:21:57] Moobot: You can find Waffle's Youtube channel here - https://youtube.com/giantwaffle
[3:22:07] SeriousPotatoBot: monkaX
[3:22:08] PureSpider: yea you could literally build a death ray :D
[3:22:18] SacroLeeds: Jousting is fine
[3:22:28] FinnYellowbelly: LASERS
[3:22:29] PureSpider: space jousting carvemYay
[3:22:32] DemonsDawn: time for spacebound bioweapons
[3:22:32] Knightishift: so a death star is oki
[3:22:35] daweedmonkey: gotta future proof the business endevaors of the space wars
[3:22:36] Cooper_XX: soon oribtal strike inc
[3:22:38] tomey36: 100% we have put some kind of weapon is space
[3:22:39] bobolpwnz: low orbit ion cannon?
[3:22:39] Switcharoo: hand of god javelin is ok though
[3:22:40] CommanderUrsus: space wars was a 70's thing
[3:22:42] Allmostdone: It was about the big scare
[3:22:43] sorefingers: putting a huge parabol mirror to laser your enemies 😂
[3:22:46] CommanderUrsus: nixon era I think
[3:22:51] FireForEffekt: how do nuclear weapons even work in space? isn't it just radiation atr this point? a expensive EMP weapon?
[3:23:08] Morlega: pepeLaugh
[3:23:09] Allmostdone: might be the
[3:23:11] Darth_Eisenherz: is kenetic projektiles a thing?
[3:23:11] M1k3D3l7a: Morning Waffle peepoPat
[3:23:18] sorefingers: muffler?
[3:23:18] deadgolfer: Liquid input?
[3:23:35] akmazero: @FireForEffekt more space platforms to drop them from orbit than using them in orbit
[3:23:38] xaviermanifest: Dimensions?
[3:23:44] ItzJord: item output or input
[3:23:45] SeriousPotatoBot: @FireForEffekt No, you LAUNCH the nukes from space down to earth monkaCrash
[3:23:48] Bernd135: Mantainence
[3:23:49] tomey36: Maintenance?
[3:23:51] FireForEffekt: ah i see
[3:24:07] daedmissica0: ulv
[3:24:11] TheRiehlDeal: Looks like the whole thing isn't long enough?
[3:24:15] TuxLafitte: The race to Creative Tank is on! danHype
[3:24:17] Traverus98: have the parallel block face out
[3:24:36] Pati: probably only in one position
[3:24:46] Deamp: too many input busses?
[3:24:49] Allmostdone: Kennedy era starting with the Cuba issue
[3:24:53] Blitzonite: @FireForEffekt you could make them rain down fallout over an area, but other than that, if far enough from earth, its relatively inert
[3:25:05] TheWonderLlama: First try! \o/
[3:25:18] Wazepas: ItsWhatIts
[3:25:20] Morlega: Try placing the input bus down again to test
[3:25:22] HiroOfTime: Sure TM
[3:25:22] TheWonderLlama: Might not check to see if complete when that part is used last?
[3:25:23] Pati: ItsWhatIts
[3:25:24] Morlega: otherwise ItIsWhatItIs
[3:25:26] Mounolatris: maybe the last block placed needs to be a casing?
[3:25:27] PureSpider: ItIsWhatItIs
[3:25:29] Deamp: there is a minimum of normal casings
[3:25:43] PureSpider: it iiiiiis
[3:25:45] PureSpider: what it iiiiiis
[3:26:08] mr_funkylicious: use the ME Interfaces from the old machines
[3:26:10] PureSpider: i think you can use the cleaner block to not need a clean room, waffle
[3:26:21] b0ltz12: do you actually need all them, or just the cheapest versions of of the LV, MV, and HV circuits?
[3:26:24] stefan150: whats the next main goal?
[3:26:43] slyscaz: whats the goal for the day and week?
[3:26:50] PureSpider: oh sheesh
[3:27:08] PureSpider: ItIsWhatItIs
[3:27:16] stefan150: goal?
[3:27:21] PureSpider: @stefan150 no
[3:27:26] stefan150: @stefan150 yes
[3:27:29] stefan150: goal
[3:27:31] Pati: we have both
[3:27:33] maimvice13: theye are bookmarked
[3:27:34] PureSpider: ait sick, goal
[3:27:39] ItsOnMax: yes Kappa
[3:27:47] Morlega: There's a button on the left to disable auto-focusing the input field
[3:27:49] stefan150: only goal
[3:27:53] Pati: time it
[3:28:14] Pati: not enough green smds
[3:28:17] Bernd135: soldering is better because is uses less therefore parallezing it is easier
[3:28:25] Deamp: input hatches can be a limiter when using tin isntead of soldering
[3:28:26] kane1941: make them do stack at a time
[3:28:28] 3DExtended: @giantwaffle you missed toggling back on the auto output of the yellow circuit in the blue room
[3:28:29] stefan150: @PiratePati jaki jest następny cel
[3:28:30] Pati: NotLikeThis
[3:28:42] Pati: its a stack of both smds
[3:28:44] Morlega: You can just copy the stack
[3:28:49] Pati: nevermind
[3:28:52] Pati: i need caffine
[3:29:02] PureSpider: @PiratePati ItIsWhatItIs
[3:29:05] Timiderxbox: Do you need all the varians of circuits? Shouldnt you do only one of each tier?
[3:29:06] Morlega: You can x2 again but just copy the stack
[3:29:06] Pati: ItsWhatIts
[3:29:15] J0hanAndersson: ItsWhatIts
[3:29:16] Zenque4K: !mc_pack
[3:29:16] Moobot: Waffle is playing Nomifactory (GTCEu Port) | https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/nomi-ceu | Already missing one deadline, will the bois be able to beat it by NYE 2023? Tune in to every stream to find out! pepeLaugh
[3:29:17] TippletonJohn: seqNeck
[3:29:22] gikei: You have all of those in your favorites at top left
[3:29:22] TheGrumpieGnome: ItsWhatIts
[3:29:28] WARHERO322: You dont set a liquid in this terminal
[3:29:40] Morlega: Neither, you don't set a liquid in these patterns
[3:29:52] DarkKnghtt58: past waffle is helping present waffle, they are in your top left
[3:29:54] stefan150: @PiratePati wow pati
[3:29:57] MagnesiumOxide: one of them requires cleanrooms
[3:29:57] Morlega: You can do it "dynamically" and just pump into the assembler what you have available
[3:29:57] Moobot: You can sub to Waffle by clicking this neat link -> twitch.tv/giantwaffle/subscribe SUBprise
[3:30:02] Wazepas: SoC needs a cleanroom
[3:30:03] maimvice13: 1 needs cleanroom
[3:30:03] J0hanAndersson: monkaHmm
[3:30:07] Morlega: I imagine if you pump in the soldering first, it'll prioritize soldering
[3:30:47] mainG__: NaM chips?
[3:30:58] aundros: Sorry if I missed it, but why only do 48?
[3:30:58] Morlega: You know you can "double" a stack of 48 by just having a stack of 64 and of 32?
[3:31:51] stefan150: @aundros i think you cant do a clean 64, its eityher over or under
[3:32:08] maimvice13: yust make the best of each tear that's what saves some crafting
[3:32:14] aundros: oh strange
[3:32:32] deadgolfer: one of them is only 8
[3:32:41] Morlega: Input soldering first
[3:32:42] Purecrew: You need crafting cards here
[3:32:59] Morlega: I imagine the factory will prioritize the liquid in the first slot, so import what you want it to use first
[3:33:00] deadgolfer: expansion cards
[3:33:01] Flobu_: why are there multiple types of the same tier circuit?
[3:33:02] stickman_02: No you don’t
[3:33:02] Noamwild: you do not
[3:33:06] b0ltz12: no you don't need crafting cards
[3:33:09] Morlega: That one guy is wrong
[3:33:10] Nexhunter: where the oneguy emote
[3:33:11] TelRehiad: you are correct
[3:33:21] thomasausen: you dont need them
[3:33:33] lvyEartman: dont you need the other ingredients which are cdrafted on this assembly line as well?
[3:33:39] primo_qwe: you should use fluid interface instead of export bus its better
[3:33:43] Mraav: what do you use ofr your todos
[3:33:45] Mraav: the applicatiojn
[3:33:57] PureSpider: tin is like the most basic shit lol
[3:34:00] stefan150: so whats the next main goal?
[3:34:09] Morlega: @Giantwaffle if you want the machine to prioritize soldering, you might want to import soldering first (so it takes up the 1st slot in the hatch). I imagine the machine prioritizes the 1st slot
[3:34:25] PureSpider: that's insane seqKEK
[3:34:31] ih_shevtsov: enable blocked mode
[3:34:32] stefan150: Sadge
[3:34:33] b357: If the recipe on the interface need to craft an on demand matirial you need crafting cards
[3:34:42] kakiewakie_: not impressed :)
[3:34:48] stefan150: unimpressive
[3:34:53] MisterRabbitHead: just knowing you waited probably hours for those to craft...
[3:34:56] Twin5un: cool :)
[3:34:56] MagnesiumOxide: now would be the time to try not blocking mode. See if it breaks or not
[3:34:58] MisterRabbitHead: its insane
[3:35:00] Moopoop: Progress!
[3:35:02] maccabeus: Waiting
[3:35:02] matori666: 5 minutes at HV maybe
[3:35:07] PureSpider: 10s each, or 64 in 5s or whatever seqKEK
[3:35:11] stefan150: unless its < 0.1 secs, its slow
[3:35:20] maimvice13: power saving
[3:35:21] PureSpider: stupid
[3:35:30] PureSpider: yep
[3:35:38] Tiggaboo: they would already have
[3:35:43] JERICHOLOLO: why cant u leave them for buffer
[3:35:43] R1Rider01: but the drawer will still be active?  or where do the new items get stored?
[3:35:47] kane1941: Also Cleaner Room
[3:35:52] Timiderxbox: Spread the lv, mv and hv over the 3 interfaces. Should make it faster with the blokking mode on
[3:35:56] stefan150: does literally any one know what the next goal is KEKW
[3:36:05] Morlega: @Giantwaffle adding crafter cards would be best, but you could configure an auto-stock (level emitter onto export bus into drawer)
[3:36:21] BlackNocturne: @stefan150 The next tier microverse miners
[3:36:26] Tiggaboo: 2nd from right wasnt outputting
[3:36:28] stefan150: @stefan150 thnx bud
[3:36:28] Tiggaboo: left*
[3:36:30] matori666: second one not outputing
[3:36:30] b0ltz12: auto export was turned off in that one circuit assembler
[3:36:32] MrSlagle: @stefan150 have titanium crreamKek
[3:36:35] b357: Just build a clean room around your assembler
[3:36:44] Hegberr: 2. from left
[3:36:46] DaddyDiddy: need to upgrade to IV cutting machines for wafers and stuff
[3:36:47] Tiggaboo: it was 2nd from left my bad
[3:36:49] Sarktastik: Pig in the clean room lol
[3:36:52] kane1941: 2nd from glass
[3:36:56] RationalLies: @stefan150 next milestone is like 22 t7 and t8 miners to make creative liquid
[3:36:56] Dagmoo: 2nd from left
[3:37:00] maccabeus: @Sarktastik he's the janitor, don't worry about it
[3:37:20] DarkKnghtt58: @Giantwaffle should nametag the pig with the name Roomba <3
[3:37:21] Sfblaze12: What is a “clean room”
[3:37:25] Timiderxbox: Spread the lv, mv and hv over the 3 interfaces. Should make it faster with the blokking mode on
[3:37:31] kane1941: always waiting for the boards
[3:37:35] snyperwolfz: pig chewing on the cords
[3:37:51] goodguy_z: what options for powergeneration do you have in this pack?
[3:37:55] microshizzel: Why does it look like it crafts faster than all items are in the inventory?
[3:38:02] maccabeus: @Sfblaze12 it's a room made of special blocks that improves the efficiency of circuit-makers
[3:38:02] Moobot: Come join the Waffle House Discord! <# https://discord.gg/fhGFtMuzdS
[3:38:10] Moopoop: TBH increasing the amount of stuff you output is my fav part about these modpacks. Its so satisfying going from making something every 10 seconds to making 64 of the things every 10 seconds
[3:38:13] Morlega: It'll be faster for batch crafts but not a big deal
[3:38:19] Moopoop: this is fun
[3:38:24] matori666: re-enable the boules? they are gonna run out, no?
[3:38:35] zynithtv: going to need to up epoxy gen i think
[3:38:48] Nexhunter: had tons
[3:38:54] Narodigg: I started this pack last week.  What is a clean room?  Sounds daunting.
[3:38:55] kane1941: @PiratePati sodium dinkdonk
[3:38:55] b357: Salt water
[3:38:55] GracelessDonkey: Feed the line

[3:38:59] TippletonJohn: He did.
[3:39:00] Generic_Gamer: "Sounds like a problem for future waffle"
[3:39:02] Tapeman83: you might be out of salt
[3:39:03] Wazepas: ItIsWhatItIs
[3:39:10] kpl4n: saltwater down in lane
[3:39:12] GracelessDonkey: You use the dust/power and put it in the line
[3:39:14] matori666: need to move the rig maybe?
[3:39:18] Yomaice: you stopped the salt water since he used gast tears
[3:39:18] kitofmaadnes: you have like 50k dust just need to liwqifi it
[3:39:19] DaddyDiddy: he went north and placed a pump down somewhere, it might have ran out
[3:39:23] kane1941: pati is live dont worry the fix is coming
[3:39:38] Morph_: buying the product for salt weeks ago :D
[3:39:44] Moopoop: I think he was tshooting this last night too lol
[3:39:57] deadgolfer: export into the one downstairs
[3:40:02] deadgolfer: thats what he did before
[3:40:03] zonizyde: waffelypoo, youre such a miner crafter guy
[3:40:05] ih_shevtsov: borrow the line
[3:40:11] Swocoom: doesn't the line do that?
[3:40:12] matori666: shitton KEKW pati ran through 500k last night
[3:40:27] kpl4n: put it in the line
[3:40:31] Narodigg: What a clean room? That was being referenced.
[3:40:32] Timiderxbox: Look at the recipe for iron3 sulfate, that may be an upgarded version for the boards aswell
[3:40:34] Bernd135: Use the line it should be finished with all of it in a minute or so
[3:40:44] matori666: the multiblock downstairs
[3:40:55] TippletonJohn: Is there an electrolyzer running it right now?
[3:40:58] TippletonJohn: Can it be upgraded?
[3:41:14] programmingsnek: Hi, sorry for the noob question, but I got just started on this pack. Can you take a minute to quickly show how you do the setup for your machines with the drawers and the ME interfaces (not how to make them, just how you configure them for a space efficient setup
[3:41:15] WARHERO322: Isnt there a big Electorlizer room
[3:41:26] CommanderUrsus: peepoPat
[3:41:34] psycho917: yed
[3:41:42] maccabeus: peepoPati
[3:41:54] Reksel_: Why do most of your auto craft recipes make for a stack?
[3:41:54] kane1941: pati elp NODDERS
[3:42:12] Morlega: That search thing is multiple terms to allow looking for e.g. "iron redstone"

[4:09:33] knowledge_within: arent there coprocessors for ME "parallel crafting"
[4:09:34] dylan0806: Ah you can’t do steps of a crafting receipts parallel?
[4:09:53] PureSpider: @thecodealive_original i thought so as well
[4:09:55] Morlega: @knowledge_within yes but you still need the extra machines (i.e. molecular assemblers)
[4:10:02] hiposlipo_: how is your fps doing with all these machines?
[4:10:35] knowledge_within: @Morlega but for nether stars it should speed it up
[4:10:48] maccabeus: you can save some frames by sealing the roof of the machine rooms. daylight updates have a surprising impact

[4:10:59] maimvice13: waffer ingraving alsow need a cleanroom leater
[4:11:11] Morlega: @knowledge_within I don't think so, Waffle made the mistake of putting all nether star related recipes into a single interface so it's limited to the 4 connected assemblers. I think ME was already doing 4 at once

[4:17:22] thecodealive_original: isn't there also multiblock upgrades to remove cleanroom requirement?

[4:31:22] TheWonderLlama: Prison Architect is 7.50, kinda old, but still $30 when not on sale
[4:31:24] sorefingers: Have you seen Love, Death & Robots on Netflix? Dyson sphere programm always reminds me of one episode with the intergalactic artist robot @giantwaffle

[4:33:14] rickthe_punk: not gonna hurt you on the long run but imeditly
[4:33:19] PureSpider: yea, parallel it?
[4:33:19] b357: Its what its
[4:33:20] kane1941: use cover versions of interfaces to access the blocks
[4:33:28] Morlega: @Giantwaffle if you're gonna tightly pack another multiblock there, might want to use the bus-version of the interfaces instead of the block version
[4:33:28] mrleonehart: Liquid interface
[4:33:43] PureSpider: for now Copege

[4:34:51] Moobot: You can find Waffle's Youtube channel here - https://youtube.com/giantwaffle
[4:34:54] TippletonJohn: Can you share ZPM power from a single transcever, different face?
[4:35:01] derTezo: is it still necessary to make these expensive recipes in the end game? with the machine frames... I thought you will be able to exchange them with cheaper circuits later. I think I might stop playing the pack :D
[4:35:08] kane1941: use cover versions of interfaces to  be able to access the hatches
[4:35:21] daedmissica0: ok this is 1000% i waffle game https://store.steampowered.com/app/1318740/Farlanders/
[4:35:25] KnightofObv: So what if you wanna craft something with the circuit as a recipe?
[4:35:37] iloveplants: if SMH means shaking my head, what does SMD stand for?
[4:35:40] lvyEartman: doesnt the mainframe need the workstations, so it needs a crafting card to make the mainframe?
[4:35:41] atlanticpandas: atlanticpandas subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 2 months, currently on a 2 month streak! 
[4:35:45] thecodealive_original: pati smh
[4:35:59] forsc1: steam base builder fest on, bye wallet
[4:36:03] PureSpider: blocking?
[4:36:10] deadgolfer: you can import more than 1 reciepe in an EV input bus, so you could increase the stack size more
[4:36:12] TheIrishGuy: 1 expansion
[4:36:17] PureSpider: nice nice
[4:36:24] Morlega: Soldering iron or liquid tin?
[4:36:34] PureSpider: it's probably in some interface somewhere
[4:36:39] b357: Because you need a crafting card
[4:36:42] Morlega: It found the Electrum Wire, then it got used before you pressed Start
[4:36:44] mrleonehart: Do you have electrum wire?
[4:36:55] LsTheRoberto: Can you up the Prio on the machine you want to use?
[4:36:58] Purecrew: Maybe its looking at the drawers or interfaces instead of crafting what its missing
[4:36:59] InternetPlumber: some of the stock is in an interface
[4:37:08] mrleonehart: @Giantwaffle Are they being used in another active recipe?
[4:37:08] inforv: Being used in an interface
[4:37:20] Timiderxbox: Remove the old storage system
[4:37:22] Morlega: @Giantwaffle when it calculated the recipe it found 40, but by the time you pressed Start enough got used up that there's less than 40 in storage
[4:37:39] i_am_davis: isn't this why you need a crafting card?
[4:37:42] primo_qwe: it doesnt count interface inventory, its happening because the moment you click craft its getting consumed by other machines hence they are not there @Giantwaffle
[4:37:46] PureSpider: holy fuck
[4:37:48] craigory_mammalton: craigory_mammalton subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 66 months! 
[4:37:53] i_am_davis: so this system can request the smds?
[4:37:54] KrunkleDunk: suck my dick processors
[4:37:57] b357: A simple crafting card will fix that
[4:38:06] primo_qwe: crafting card will not fix that
[4:38:06] Foooks: diode?
[4:38:14] VikashPindoria: cpu capacity or something ?
[4:38:15] b357: Nope
[4:38:19] Morlega: Yeah between the time it calculated the recipe and the time you pressed Start, they got used
[4:38:28] primo_qwe: Its happening because the items are getting consumed before you click craft
[4:38:30] deadgolfer: lol
[4:38:32] b357: I am sure
[4:38:34] Intohimos: KEKW
[4:38:36] mainG__: KEKW
[4:38:36] PureSpider: the crafting card makes no difference
[4:38:38] Moopoop: KEKW
[4:38:39] InternetPlumber: crafting cards tell the interface to request a craft if there isn't any in stock
[4:38:41] Schutter07: pure coincidence
[4:38:44] Morlega: Crafting card makes no difference
[4:38:45] banutzul: ready to be proven wrong but wont accept it
[4:38:48] PureSpider: yea sheer coincidence
[4:38:52] ecnerw4l: try it again
[4:38:55] ecnerw4l: make another 64 xD
[4:38:56] mrleonehart: ItisWhatis
[4:38:58] b357: the interface need a crafting card for the components that are crafted on demand
[4:38:58] Tiggaboo: NOTED crafting cards, got it
[4:38:58] Morlega: It was just coincidence
[4:39:00] deadgolfer: i think they may be correct
[4:39:12] mrleonehart: ItsWhatIts  ItsWhatIts  ItsWhatIts  ItsWhatIts  ItsWhatIts  ItsWhatIts  ItsWhatIts
[4:39:12] DecoyOcelot: AE will already schedule a craft if it is missing stuff and knows the pattern.
[4:39:13] primo_qwe: @b357 No, they dont
[4:39:19] miliske: then do it again without crafting card Kappa
[4:39:20] Purecrew: To counter act this conclusion lets just put crafting cards in everything
[4:39:21] PureSpider: that's just not what crafting cards do lol
[4:39:24] Vangelis716: remove the crafting card and see if it works?
[4:39:31] DecoyOcelot: chat being gaslit
[4:39:35] Morlega: @Giantwaffle the real "bug" is that when you open the autocrafting UI, ME sees e.g. 100 SMDs. Then between that moment and the moment you press Start, enough get used up that there's less than 100 in storage

[5:02:39] B0N37ESS: videos on youtube have it too now
[5:02:39] Linkitch: The glow effect goes over the edge of the actual block
[5:02:40] calastius: but it's not lighting the blocks around it....
[5:02:44] mrleonehart: We just wish it could be turned down not off.
[5:02:50] mrleonehart: Bloom is useful but too much hurts

[5:10:29] Experiment_B: you do need zpm it's slow otherwise
[5:10:30] WARHERO322: We needed ZPM because it could not keep up with making all the ingots at once

[5:57:54] AftermathGam3r: AftermathGam3r subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 29 months! pog

[5:58:57] Purecrew: Sometimes im smart sometimes Im dumb
[5:58:57] Vovosunt: you can also just manually put more wire into the recip to make more of them at once

[6:31:13] kane1941: bus*
[6:31:40] Morlega: You need separate input busses I think
[6:31:53] dylan0806: Don’t you need a input per lens?
[6:32:04] Morlega: The engraver doesn't know which recipe ME wants from it
[6:32:16] Asissen: you need a new input for every lens
[6:32:19] DaFez_: you can't use blocking mode if you have an item sitting in the input bus though, can you?
[6:32:22] KAS_Sprmcy: Dijon, how's GTNH coming on? You played much lately or you been distracted by other shiny new games?!
[6:32:25] Morlega: There's a max on input busses, no?
[6:32:31] RexActa: signs on the interfaces for which lens?
[6:32:36] Asissen: @DaFez_ yes
[6:32:52] Morlega: LUL
[6:33:06] Morlega: And the pattern needs to match the lense in the input bus too
[6:33:08] Kunja: Aren't those LV input busses too small ?
[6:33:14] mechoriet: use small interfaces so you still can access the busses
[6:33:19] sogerr: starship getting frosty, wdr soon™
[6:33:20] Flobu_: and it needs to be the correct one in each
[6:33:20] PrivateDijon: @KAS_Sprmcy Still grinding away, 730 hours in, however Nomi is tempting as it seems a little easier than GTNH

[6:34:35] Swocoom: plonk a color of something on the side - easier than a sign

[6:40:53] Tiggaboo: LOL

[6:41:12] DecoyOcelot: remove the output interface and see what show up

[7:17:05] b0ltz12: won't the crafted dust be thrown into the crafting storage rather than actual storage?
[7:17:09] b357: you need a drawer system with highest priority that can hold important dust and ingots wit small amount for recipes like that

[7:18:09] Morlega: @Giantwaffle if you have a recipe that creates 64 dust even though the smelter only requested 1, 63 will end up in storage and be useable by export buses / interface slots though

[8:10:16] Nexhunter: @PureSpider idk why im concerned about the language being wrong from my perspective cause I would win in MA courts KEKW
[8:10:20] DrYProtoss: distinct buses
[8:10:22] Morlega: Distinct busses might help
[8:10:23] PureSpider: coolcake2 yea you could, but a lot of it is not answered by precedent, so you dont really have a lot of "good" data to train on
[8:10:23] NapsAreAwesomeSometimes: i think waffle may finish the mod pack today
