[2:29:39] DeePick: Cheer200 Pal world, they were able to make the game that Nintendo/Pokemon have said for years they would never make.  An MMO style survival PC game and the success Pal world is having is the exact success Nintendo could or would have had if they just got off their high horses.
[2:29:39] lamnotdrunk729: Guys what is your favorite 1990 games
[2:29:42] somelucky_: paku-paku man

[2:31:56] DeePick: they've been doing great with patches so far
[2:31:56] MrSelenix: swoochie i think its because theres nothing they can actually sue for. palworld technically hasnt breached and trademarks or copyrights
[2:31:57] m1jordanallen: Im enjoying single player just fine.
[2:32:00] infxmhc2: Probably not LUL
[2:32:02] filmnoir62: I'd say Castlevania for the NES is very original in its execution.  Based on Brahm Stoker's Dracula, ofc, but you'd be hard-pressed to find a chain-weapon wielding vampire killer anywhere else.
[2:32:03] Krat_Arona: They have 4 games in Early Access since 2020. They finish nothing
[2:32:11] FSIT: They have a track record of abandoning games

[2:33:36] swoochie: @MrSelenix yeah i was trying to say it wasn't a copy of anything, if nintendo actually thought palworld copied them they'd have sued by now

[2:35:11] doodlebop16: If they chill out with microtransactioms they will do better
[2:35:11] filmnoir62: I think Diablo and Torchlight stopped being good after their second entries.
