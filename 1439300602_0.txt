[0:52:23] Beufff: China locking down Shanghai i guess
[0:52:25] bm01: @Akaihon spirit abs is almost mandatory for shock scrapper, but many classes use it according to korea stats
[0:52:26] Tamerlain: Stare
[0:52:31] ForgottenTime: Sun emotes are pay to win too Kappa
[0:52:33] Nexhunter: your gonna have streamer p2w once you open your mail pepeLaugh
[0:52:35] ForgottenTime: Sub
[0:52:36] babyaddalyn: you where about to swipe to reach 1370 :D
[0:52:40] Rhonox: i got to 1000 ilvl as F2P completely

[0:52:50] titus124: @Beufff what really?

[0:52:50] rofl1436: pepeLaugh
[0:52:54] skybird6735: it's was true for korea but in NA it's 100% pay to win
[0:53:01] Speedglass: Lost Car Park story of my life
[0:53:07] zombietaint: i hit 1370 yesterday and it felt pretty good to beat argos without a credit card
[0:53:09] bandani: the boss is a bug yes
[0:53:11] Fufcia: is your skin colored just pure white?
[0:53:16] Harmar: we just dont have alot of the "p2w" features KR has but its still very p2w if you know how lol
[0:53:22] Akaihon: @bm01 many classes use it in KR because they can do 33333 ... most ppl here are 331 so they dont use Spirit abs that much yet
[0:53:28] whyando: I stopped playing lost ark, looking at spreadsheets and doing the same thing every day felt like a job
[0:53:28] Kryllyk: I still don't think it's Pay 2 Win, I think it is Pay 2 Progress, it depends on if you consider progression winning imo
[0:53:32] tavcar: i got to 1400 this week only buying bronze pack
[0:53:34] schwebels428: i wonder if some compaines consider pay to win under a certain dollar level (probably like 2.5k)
[0:53:38] JVM91: Define p2w, imo its not as bad as many people feel
[0:53:46] Warkless: Saintone told horror storys of the "dark age" monkaS it was horrible monkaS
[0:53:47] NuovaHD: i think the p2w aspect is kind of whatever, it doesn't matter to me that a whale is 1490 and im just hitting 1370 as f2p.
[0:54:01] Landrodron: if you whale right now you are just stupid widePepeLaugh
[0:54:09] Harmar: @JVM91 pay to get items ONLY you can get by paying thats my definition
[0:54:11] Artoosa: Then their gear will be outclassed in later updated so the payin gthey did was worthless
[0:54:11] Vosy1984: dunno what streamers you watch, but I watch 1400 streamers that only pay for the founders pack LUL
[0:54:23] Cheese_Pasta: I thought the term "pay to win" came from PvP games that you could litertally pay to win
[0:54:29] titus124: the speed of updates is way too very
[0:54:30] Purecrew: Im buying every single card pack I can find no matter what.
[0:54:30] Fufcia: I only bought plat founders pack and i'm 1360 ilvl without even playing every day. Dont feel like i need to swipe to do anything
[0:54:30] Yogithebaer: My biggest issue is the classes I want for alts are probably going to be added next year
[0:54:36] Bambooyah_: And they have no job ^^
[0:54:44] AIex_0: its the ones with the most optics who whale
[0:54:45] skybird6735: getting to 1400 as a stream is easy cause it's ur job to play the game LUL
[0:54:47] nathrizen: paying to progress in the game *is* pay to win in my books
[0:54:49] the_lyp: shroud anyone? xD
[0:54:53] daemonaedryn: ...
[0:55:06] Warkless: i have 4 hours for the daily stuff
[0:55:11] Kryllyk: Yeah that is the main difference, DatModz is playing like 10+ hours per day and is F2P over 1400, but yeah that is a lot of time
[0:55:12] Vosy1984: how is your collectible collection?
[0:55:17] tavcar: i think you have a good chance to get voltan week 1 or week 2
[0:55:18] Tamerlain: same as i was when RU client launched just burnt out of game
[0:55:27] NuovaHD: i think its all about creating goals for yourself in game
[0:55:30] gnomeseleven: pepeLaugh
[0:55:38] Apparentthreat: you sure
[0:55:42] Vosy1984: some collectibles have some very nice puzzles
[0:55:45] Landrodron: collectibles are literally filler content outside of skill points
[0:55:49] isfil: @Giantwaffle i only pay the 14$ founder pack and i'm 1370 and chilling collecting mats
[0:55:52] PTK9: well u have adventure tome/giant hearts etc to make ur character better, if u dont like it u will never like this game i feel @Giantwaffle
[0:56:02] skybird6735: bro fx ur inventory pls
[0:56:04] PTK9: that is a big part of this game, collectibles
[0:56:33] PTK9: i wonder if people will require u to have lik 400 skill points to party up with them on some endgame :D
[0:56:33] atlntel: do u own a rari
[0:56:35] stevelkenevel: challenging raid content where you see your group prog is the exciting part, but knowing its once a week can feel off putting
[0:56:48] stevelkenevel: finishing Argos p2 this week was a blast
[0:56:57] Apparentthreat: @ninopanda, those emotes shall never be used together. I've written it into law
[0:57:17] Astrophysics288: i feel like all i do is daily and wait for thursdays
[0:57:29] Kryllyk: I've gotten two chars to T3 now and I just stopped honing them after 1325, I'm happy
[0:57:35] wooshysir: will you get the pvp emblem for the last equipable slot?
[0:57:37] ninopanda: COCKA critroleTraveler is just as good as lickR critroleTraveler lickL
[0:57:38] tavcar: do you prefer to raid blind or do you do your homework? @Giantwaffle

[1:03:16] BlackAngel96: Hey waffle where do you live now just curious which country you chose
[1:03:18] Runic2584: after 1355, all my successful honing attempts were the pity attempts
[1:03:23] resku89: I hit 1370 today and Argos is kicking my ass.
[1:03:33] lennon7770: But when you get 1370 gear u go to 60% hone again
[1:04:28] Landrodron: 1370 to 86 is pretty easy
[1:04:29] RamseyRinehaus: waffle lives in italy, cant you see the ferrari flag Kappa

[1:05:05] thunderdan11: i kinda wonder if you can try to fail hones of t1-2 stuff to try to boost a t3 hone chance
[1:05:29] lennon7770: @Runic2584 oh damn
[1:05:39] Nexhunter: @thunderdan11 the artistan energy is per item
[1:05:40] Celnoc: wouldn't it be worth using some extra enhancement mats to try to get argos p1 this week to get first pieces of your set, gold and loot

[1:17:37] SaltyLuigiKart8: Valtal looks so much fun Sadge
[1:17:42] ayaya_prime: The bots have totally fucked up the economy, it's all over the place
[1:17:43] SaltyLuigiKart8: Valtan*
[1:17:45] rangerMudd: @DmtryZhkv just need to wait til next reset
[1:17:46] Qwerkie: I feel like those fire waves hit me no matter where i stand
[1:17:48] yfeah: as after work f2p player, I'm still grinding towards 1370
[1:17:48] SmoothBlizzard: @Fufcia do you have your card sets?
[1:17:59] imTymp: oh i ping my heals all the time in pugs
[1:18:02] booth8604: Where did u get that skin?
[1:18:19] Mortimmer: f2p Kappa
[1:18:20] Fufcia: @SmoothBlizzard i use 10% 8% 8% dark damage reduction. dont have full set
[1:18:20] BigOhNotation: NOPERS you're way ahead
[1:18:24] rangerMudd: bro no way. i bet less than 10% of players are above 1350
[1:18:26] Kryllyk: You are ahead
[1:18:28] DexxonGaming: how many hours
[1:18:28] DmtryZhkv: rangerMudd and when would that be?
[1:18:34] rangerMudd: thursday
[1:18:37] Fufcia: I only bought plat founders pack and I'm 1360 without alts
[1:18:43] wan33x: 100 dollars is casual ?
[1:18:45] imTymp: i swiped $20 for actual upgrades the other bit was for skins
[1:18:48] Kaedonshi: gg
[1:18:49] Kryllyk: I did Silver Founder pack and 1355 currently and I am high
[1:18:52] dierks_: @booth8604 we got them 3 days ago in an event. You should have the chest in your mail
[1:18:53] Venxuri: I got 1390 yesterday and I feel even 1400 is so fucking far away
[1:18:58] Nexhunter: dwjftSuffer i want to hone so much but i can't cause silver needs to be saved for argos gear transfer dwjftSuffer
[1:18:58] Landrodron: i hit 1385 last week as full f2p with 2alts
[1:18:58] imTymp: no i take that back with founder packs a little more
[1:18:59] RamseyRinehaus: the starter w/e blue crystals pack is worth the swipe
[1:19:07] Purecrew: I swipe to buy cards and rapport when I need it
[1:19:09] rangerMudd: nah ur in a bubble man. most people are f2p 10)%
[1:19:11] Kaedonshi: Silver + plat gave me a decent boostr
[1:19:22] Vosy1984: @Giantwaffle 500k players had different type of founders packs, we know that from the steam charts before the launch
[1:19:27] rangerMudd: in terms of STREAMERS? sure $100 is pretty casual
[1:19:27] Celnoc: wouldn't it be worth using some extra enhancement mats to try to get argos p1 + oreha hard this week to get first pieces of your set, gold and loot. You will be missing one piece of armor first week at 1370
[1:19:30] omar_i_: am F2P at 1362, unlocked Astray and just got Mokoko transformation. Am i a no lifer?
[1:19:35] DexxonGaming: how many hours do you have @Giantwaffle

[1:20:20] mahoraz: i hate how they made founder packs only redeemable once and only on one server
[1:20:21] Vosy1984: the hoverboard is better than the 3 headed wolf LUL
[1:20:26] MellowKoNeko: the broken thing from the plat pack is the stronghold structure u guys got
[1:20:39] DexxonGaming: @Vosy1984 definitely not
[1:20:42] MellowKoNeko: 4% crit craft chance -_- i want
[1:20:42] wan33x: balancing mounts LUL
[1:20:50] steedashawn: what gear score are you at right now?
[1:20:54] yfeah: I kind of prefer to have some unreached content as a f2p since there's something currently in the game to aspire to
[1:20:55] Vosy1984: DexxonGaming have you seen the dash with the hoverboard? off-screen
[1:20:58] Landrodron: we already haver all mounts are the same speed

[1:21:41] Warkless: i use disrespect NODDERS
[1:21:54] Fufcia: I dont like honing every day. When you just fail 3 days in a row it feels bad. I prefer to do it before reset and actually get some upgrades on top of all the fails
[1:21:58] Nexhunter: if someone is always juicing they are cray
[1:21:59] wan33x: stuck at 1355 Sadge
[1:22:11] Jonniboy: Why not Increase honning rates, instead of just giving us more mats.. Prime you to keep honning  ?
[1:22:23] imTymp: i have like 3k untradable blues so im sending waffle my extra tradable ones as an updown KEKW
[1:22:30] omar_i_: call me crazy but I think better not to hone in weekends. noticed higher failure rate
[1:22:38] Nexhunter: @Jonniboy cause they can suck silver and gold out of the game by giving honing materials
[1:22:41] MellowKoNeko: im still sitting on my gold till mats drop to 1g lol
[1:22:41] Sieglarm: people need to work on their masterpiece is what I hear

[1:22:58] Xev_00: But we want to see you do Argos and Velganos :D
[1:23:01] Jonniboy: @Nexhunter so another thing to get people swiping  ?
[1:23:11] Warkless: Ahh yes NODDERS

[2:59:52] Jibbur: 1.18 isn't ready yet if you ask me
[2:59:54] qkkn: 8 is on 1.8 yeah
[2:59:56] dobie: 8 is in very early stages still i think
[3:00:12] qkkn: So 6 is recommended?
[3:00:26] Papi_Geo_: ok thanks!
[3:00:39] jayrickson87: definitely one of the best currently
[3:00:40] TexxLive: any mod giving me permission to link the PoE development video? danHmm
[3:00:46] Venxuri: I hate this modpack for too much creepy shit going on
[3:00:47] pandaofch5os: how bad is endgame compared to po3?
[3:01:12] TheWonderLlama: We made this :)
[3:01:20] 3ven: Tinkers is by far one of the most enjoyable progression mods imo
[3:01:21] drebisdavid: Did you play enigmatica expert 2?
[3:01:26] CultOfNeurisis: its comfy gameplay :)
[3:01:31] pakamccormick: There different types of expert. PO3 is grind for grind. E6E is meant to be  complicated but not grindy
[3:01:33] jayrickson87: that's the best way to approach it
[3:01:38] pakamccormick: they're*
[3:02:00] DX_Plates: @Papi_Geo_ Just a heads up, if you don't know, he is playing on Expert Mode which adds extra gates and grind (makes recipes much harder). It isn't nearly as bad in normal mode.

[3:03:47] richie385: l
[3:03:47] braaedy: @F0xyTheFox I don't know. Check the books in game, they have the recipes. I'm playing enigmatica 8 so maybe the TC version there has three levels and 6 doesn't
[3:03:54] jayrickson87: yes
[3:03:55] GFQPR1882: try
[3:03:56] dobie: havent tried it but dnt see why not
[3:04:00] officialzip: @Chat what we working on?
[3:04:04] Zapper_777: i would do that.
[3:04:04] Qbertman: i just made the tinkers smelter. interesting work around in expert mode
[3:04:14] Jibbur: Spawner in the undergarden does work
[3:04:16] Monkeman18: I brought in a vanilla Zombie spawner and it worked fine
[3:04:24] dobie: i ended up setting up my blood altar in one of the dungeons in there surrounded by 4 spawners
[3:04:26] dobie: got a bit hectic
[3:04:29] Jibbur: Boats/Ships are really easy places
[3:04:29] CultOfNeurisis: you have spider spawners in the tower waypoint thing

[3:05:31] Joeball_: pretty sure there was one in the tower you got the skeleton spawner at
[3:05:42] Platemate: Spawners from the Magic Worlds ? :D
[3:05:54] Qbertman: do u need silk touch for spawners?
[3:05:55] CultOfNeurisis: this mod does a good job at motivating exploration on the surface. There's so much stuff and it's pretty.
[3:06:18] coolcake2: @Qbertman well yes.
[3:06:23] Ebtanta2: You can silk touch spawners

[3:07:23] officialzip: @natsu130 Tes
[3:07:23] Jibbur: doesn't matter really, anything works. I like the skeleton spawners on boats as they tend to be very health and I think that helps with getting more blood
[3:07:34] officialzip: yes*
[3:07:45] coolcake2: is mob grinding utils in the pack or no?
[3:07:45] Ebtanta2: you can get a capturing enchantment that gives you a chance for spawn eggs

[3:39:28] 3ven: is that a Brass bee
[3:39:29] TheWonderLlama: Thats what I do, only use EGS for the free games, its like I am stealing money from their pockets

[3:43:30] Mishoroo: PogChamp
[3:43:33] premalonetv: Pog the animation
[3:43:33] YuYuYuna: @Stroopwafel41 only if it benefits from steam's services like workshop or multiplayer stuff. That's pretty much the only reason to care if it's on steam.
[3:43:36] Face_32: yeah create has great tutorials
[3:43:42] CultOfNeurisis: create is such a good mod

[4:00:34] Nincy1986: blood moon = crazy mob spawns and you cant sleep it away and they ignore light lvls
[4:00:35] GhostRider_1o1: i believe there is a blood moon and its not like what you think it is. It gives you a buff. like bad owmen.

[4:07:11] wooodiii: won't forget playing FTB Infinity Evolved using IC2 Reactors and automating swapping depleted rods with new ones -> fu*d up a filter and pulled out everything except the rods -> whole base goes boom
[4:07:12] Archelonde: one went for 2k in mine
[4:07:14] Face_32: for lego maps?

[4:08:22] Carl0M00N: grinding -> washing
[4:08:24] Jibbur: Grind then wash
[4:08:36] Jibbur: washing crushed gives you 10+ nugets
[4:08:42] DeadPine: Grind then wash nets a few nuggets
[4:08:44] WhomstAmYous: how come you chose E6 over the newer E8 pack @Giantwaffle
[4:08:44] Chronoes: grinding -> washing to get nuggets, then you compress them to ingots
[4:08:46] brymstax: always wash before you grind if ya get what i mean
[4:08:51] Carl0M00N: Yep
[4:09:00] kyanpeppaa: ca you press the nuggets ?
[4:09:08] Chronoes: just use a press
[4:09:09] Carl0M00N: press into nuggets with press
[4:09:20] ZyianDev: go in reverse, recipe on ingot
[4:09:22] Myekos: @LiveType yup.  hate those pc build tariffs, they only hurt consumers
[4:09:24] dobie: crushing wheels then wash is p much ore tripling i think
[4:09:29] Face_32: isnt creat autocrafting super slow early game automation?
[4:09:30] kyanpeppaa: yeah just the press no?
[4:09:33] Carl0M00N: not crafters but press
[4:09:37] Tholse: is there builders wand in this pack?.
[4:09:38] Chronoes: use a press, not crafter
[4:10:13] Cotton09: no compacting drawers?
[4:10:17] Chronoes: you don't need it, the packer will work if there's 9+ nuggets in the basin
[4:10:24] Face_32: i thought steel had to be made by an alloy?
[4:10:26] Chronoes: and then you can filter the ingots
[4:10:40] LiveType: Is there something like steve's factory manager in this for managing that compacting?
[4:10:47] BurnedAether: but if there are 12 nuggets then the packer gets clogged right?
[4:10:55] palmagranet: stairs
[4:10:56] nxusr: glass perhaps?
[4:10:57] fejitsu: compacting drawers might be easier for getting the ingots
[4:11:00] lennon7770: Do you have time in a bottle? Nice to get early to stack time
[4:11:00] Chronoes: @BurnedAether nope, the 3 just remain there
[4:11:08] nxusr: yeah
[4:11:12] dobie: yeah, think you need to have 9 diff types of metal per basin otherwise the belt can clog
[4:11:24] TheOnlyGremlin: can allways use stairs there
[4:11:27] BurnedAether: I mean if you are packing iron nuggets and want to pack copper after you need the packer to be cleared
[4:11:28] Stillglade: or a railing around the stairs down and no wall
[4:11:42] BurnedAether: of have a different one for each I got type

[4:17:30] Slymph: They obviously never jammed to sea shanty susHmm
[4:17:32] CommanderRudolph: I like the Minecraft muisc, but need something running in the background for my tinnitus - and the "sudden" music in MC annoys me.
[4:17:41] SirT0ad: I usually mute it cause I usually watch things while I play

[4:19:07] Humphr3y: you can modify spawners
[4:19:10] Face_32: might be able to use that in a mob grinder or something
[4:19:11] VERTi_TV: You can change spawners to slime spawner
[4:19:25] lennon7770: You can get spawn eggs with capturing enchant
[4:19:30] Cannonboot: is shit cool?
[4:19:37] Face_32: some mods make each egg spawn a certian amount of that mob from the spawner
[4:19:40] IronGajeel: or you can just find slime island LUL
[4:19:43] Sevrene: Do slimes count for blood points?

[4:53:19] noxiiiouse: @Giantwaffle the most expansive is the battery i think
[4:53:24] Purecrew: I have a Tesla Tile roof getting installed right now, Its taken over a 8 months so far and they dont have a backup switch or Battery installed yet.
[4:53:28] Dagmoo: panels definitely cheaper and probably more efficient
[4:53:30] Ranctifier: bro i want a mini sun powering my shit
[4:53:31] Wolfieguns: could it be a business expense?
[4:53:33] LiveType: Solar is ~3.5-4k USD/kW installed

[4:53:45] Allmostdone: and the return on a solar roof is what 5 to 10 years?
[4:53:48] panic_inducing_citrus: You could get a line of credit from your home equity instead of a straight loan
[4:53:59] PassiveRaen: Have you looked at companies that own the panels
[4:54:02] CorSPACE: anyone in your hoa have solar?
[4:54:03] Face_32: @Slymph oh no, that would be funny bad. just hope the bots dont start using it
[4:54:06] broseph_larz: If you have it on the yard, then you could have the panels rotate towards the sun when it moves.
[4:54:06] Ciube11: that's what vegas is for
[4:54:19] Myekos: not a fear in Austin
[4:54:22] 00_Falcon_00: panels are cheaper, and more efficient than ever,ATM

[4:55:08] VoylRL: leased solar energy
[4:55:10] Slymph: @Face_32 i think the area chat is broken cuz of this, atleast ppl talk about it like it is the reasoning
[4:55:11] VoylRL: hmmm
[4:55:17] LiveType: If possible always avoid leased solar. It is 100% a scam to extract money out of people
[4:55:20] Face_32: leased anything is a scam isnt it? but its normally a second option for people
[4:55:22] lateknighthero: just get a 30-port usb hub and a bunch of alibaba usb solar chargers 5Head
[4:55:27] DewDragon: @kyanshiba thanks! 11 to go!
[4:55:27] Tabakhase: solar panels dont break "ever"

[4:55:40] DewDragon: @Kaylome97 thanks! almost to my goal!
[4:55:41] Dagmoo: 100% DO NOT lease solar
[4:55:43] VoylRL: hmm
[4:55:48] PassiveRaen: Their is companies that will put panels on your roof in exchange for any profits. No risk on your part
[4:55:49] Tabakhase: efficency drops, but that marginal as the current lookout is
[4:55:50] quicksplit14: we almost bought a house with leased equipment and it was brutal trying to work with the company to get it transfered over, total scam
[4:55:54] Humphr3y: they should last 25 to 30 years
[4:56:02] lateknighthero: monkaS
[4:56:11] K3ll06s: @Giantwaffle  everytime you buy solarpanels they are outdated within a year, because the efficency is still so low, that even 1% is sooo much better

[4:56:41] Apparentthreat: just do what nasa did and cover up the old panels EZ
[4:56:45] Vangelis716: 10 solarpanels with about 375Watt max output, including transformers and installation cost about 6000 euro here
[4:56:48] Tabakhase: "very inefficent" is kinda ????? when its fucking free^^
[4:56:48] 00_Falcon_00: what does it matter, if they proved the pwoer you need?
[4:56:51] maguschala: But who cares if you're meeting your power demands
[4:56:53] Ataiu: Just do solar for heating on your roof and for electricity in your garden
[4:56:54] orillion: PauseChamp guess im buying mirrors instead
[4:56:56] Strider1515: Texas energy is so cheap that its nearly never break even with the lifespan of the panels.
[4:57:05] VoylRL: @apparentthreat Just put new panels over the old ones 4Head
[4:57:18] Tabakhase: 10y you have guaranteed on todays panels anyhow
[4:57:18] 0omkins: and in 10 years that 30k has become 60k.
[4:57:20] Mick_: make sure buy your solar system. DO NOT lease one. leasing is a scam.
[4:57:31] flapjack2195: Solar power is not free lmao
[4:57:32] ReindeerPolice: But in that 10 years waiting you're still probably a net loss than if you just bought solar
[4:57:32] panic_inducing_citrus: You could also double that 30k in 10 years
[4:57:33] Larklen: just take a note from crypto DCA'ing and buy 1 solar panel a year Kappa
[4:57:33] 00_Falcon_00: from what I understand they cant get a whole lot more efficient, without large cost increases
[4:57:33] flapjack2195: Nothing free

[4:57:34] dylan0806: @giantwaffle Do you replace your pc every generation?
[4:57:38] Niller2005: What if you wait 20 years then?
[4:57:42] FlammAlpha: also "free" is only half - you can sell the exess so you earn more with higher output
[4:57:45] Niller2005: You can keep waiting
[4:57:55] orillion: monkaHmm spend pannel money on crypto sell in 10 years NODDERS
[4:57:56] Grimstar_: So initial investments aren't worth it?
[4:58:01] LiveType: Manufacturing costs are not the main costs. Solar panels are hilariously cheap nowadays. Labor is primary cost in residential solar installation.
[4:58:03] 0omkins: Solar right now is a terrible financial decision vs. investing etc.
[4:58:03] Kaylome97: @DewDragon Just wait until you hit your goal, gonna feel amazing
[4:58:13] Humphr3y: my friend took 8 years to break even
[4:58:14] 00_Falcon_00: like the per cell efficiency is sort of aproaching physical limits, but they layer them for more efficiency
[4:58:17] Tabakhase: the Q is not about ROI, its about "after" - so if your 80% panel turned into 61% in 20 years, who cares, its free 🤷
[4:58:18] Grimstar_: bc you're looking 40k like you say...
[4:58:19] VoylRL: Solar powered Crypto farm 5Head

[4:58:37] Niller2005: How do you know tho?
[4:58:43] MrAppl3: but what if you wait 15 years
[4:58:44] brenner1265: Wait, we are buying all the planets Kappa
[4:58:51] panic_inducing_citrus: broken logic. Electricity will also get more expensive
[4:58:54] spudas2k: What else u got up ther?
[4:58:55] DX_Plates: Thats forever the fact though.
[4:59:00] LiveType: ROI of 7 years are unheard of nowadays. It's 10 years plus for residential
[4:59:02] fisken5000: you also gotta discount the money
[4:59:08] Ras2709: Pull more out monkaSTEER
[4:59:17] Farkie01249: I wana buy a Solar system, but not the milky way
[4:59:29] 00_Falcon_00: the real kick in the butt is if they give a better tax credit in the future
[4:59:36] Yomaice: @giantwaffle are you looking forward to r/place going again?
[4:59:36] extrasaulty: but the environment!
[4:59:37] brenner1265: Use the same logic you use for stocks, Time in the market is better than timing the market @Giantwaffle
[4:59:40] Grimstar_: What about installing onto real estate, then go further with that
[4:59:42] Tabakhase: note that the "issue" there is what YOU get paid for power --- for "self use" those ROIs are all much much much quicker
[4:59:42] Allmostdone: I thought it was pretty high
[4:59:46] Triz08: all this work for the same end goal of powering your pc Kappa
[4:59:48] CorSPACE: have you plugged your info into tesla calculator>
[4:59:51] Dagmoo: yeah i just decided i wanted to do it and wasnt so concerned about the ROI
[4:59:52] Tabakhase: so electric car or such can easy kick you to 5y and below
[4:59:52] CorSPACE: tesla's
[4:59:58] TLV_TV: in sweden where there isn´t much sun it´s about 8 years ROI for systems right now
[5:00:01] DewDragon: why not just use hamster wheels?
[5:00:06] Ranctifier: imagine if you're someone that has student loans still and then decided to invest in panels
[5:00:13] orillion: electric bike PogChamp
[5:00:17] Kaylome97: what car do you have
[5:00:25] BloodPainting: water powered car when?
[5:00:30] jmm548: alot dont
[5:00:31] Tabakhase: the money you get from powercompanies is neglectable
[5:00:32] TheMeowstardCat: Electric cars are garbage when they barely go 400 Miles without needing a recharge....
[5:00:34] free_zebras: Google's Project Solar will tell you your break-even for buy/loan/lease
[5:00:35] Tabakhase: its all about self use
[5:00:39] broseph_larz: Hydrogen cars
[5:00:43] Renny_S: why wouldnt they allow it O_o
[5:00:44] Larklen: and whether its creditted at regular or wholesale rate KEKW
[5:00:46] AmidAiz: in eu i think you can sell it back to the state
[5:00:52] Humphr3y: @renny_s money
[5:00:53] Vargh: they are required by law to take it here
[5:00:53] Mick_: if you get solar also get batteries
[5:00:57] kyanpeppaa: ah mine does that, we sell to the grid and it knocks off my gas bill
[5:00:58] Vangelis716: HOA's are just horrible KEKW
[5:01:04] free_zebras: @Renny_S Creates a nightmare for accounting + capacity planning
[5:01:05] LiveType: Most US electric providers work on a credit system.
[5:01:06] ZukotsuKiD: Texas doesn't seem like the state to allow that
[5:01:07] BBQ1: weird
[5:01:09] t3kn0ir: t3kn0ir subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 4 months! 
[5:01:10] Allmostdone: use to be a law that they had to buy back. But that went a while ago
[5:01:11] ZyianDev: don't you get a discount?
[5:01:11] Nuuf: i would use all the solar power i make for myself
[5:01:12] Kenanja293: @AmidAiz and you're losing money on it, so you also need batteries
[5:01:16] skignas: its how it works in Lithuania atm
[5:01:17] MrAppl3: that is normal I think
[5:01:20] Grimstar_: It's what your household is using
[5:01:22] BlainL: germany cant do it. it was built to take energy back into the grit KEKW
[5:01:26] xhadoww: its how it works in Brazil
[5:01:29] JoxerTheM1ghty: They dont want anyone to be independent of the grid
[5:01:30] MorboSmash: Tesla Powerwall
[5:01:30] ZyianDev: wtf then what's the point

[5:01:44] lateknighthero: Tesla PowerWall
[5:01:55] skignas: in Lithuania you pay extra for company so they 'save' your energy for winter for example
[5:02:03] bensmcc: Paul's Hardware maybe?
[5:02:04] Zapper_777: Cant you make a clock block to activate the flute and a hopper to catch the product?
[5:02:14] jmm548: true

[5:02:23] Apparentthreat: ptsd
[5:02:25] lateknighthero: theres still time pepeLaugh
[5:02:26] DX_Plates: DIY Demand was probably too high.
[5:02:36] free_zebras: Would really recommend checking your address with Google's Project Sunroof, it'll flat-out tell you whether it's economical for you
[5:02:37] spiderpig_: Are you in Texas?
[5:02:47] junglejoe76: I’m in Arizona, paid 30K for panels and only save 100$ a month
[5:02:51] Dagmoo: the worst bullshit is in California where the power company lobbied for legislation to eliminate the ability to get paid for selling power to the grid, but everyone up to now built assuming that ability to sell back to the grid  would stay
[5:02:52] DX_Plates: @free_zebras That site is sooooo out of date.
[5:02:52] Apparentthreat: yeah; he's in central tx
[5:02:54] NetAssetz: Just rewatched the F1 race - wow that was action packed for such a garbage track!
[5:03:04] AnAsianDoug: hey, for this mod pack is there a specific quest line to follow? it seems all over the place tbh
[5:03:18] MonkeyOnDonkey: Having a big ass military but cant have Power in winter. lol. USA best country.
[5:03:20] ReindeerPolice: I'd never buy solar in the UK
[5:03:21] Tamerlain: can u add 2 more speed modules for storage ?
[5:03:29] Sevrene: Knowing Waffle's luck a month after he invests in solar the Sun will go out
[5:03:29] Kenanja293: and germany has to sell excess power to france at under-production cost, then buy it back for much more when the green production is low
[5:03:35] Apparentthreat: i got a shaft for you

[5:04:26] Grimstar_: In create there is a recipe where you place a grinder into a grinder for some catalyst or ion; neat stuff
[5:04:32] Kenanja293: also fun fact: in germany the tax write-off for solar panels is categorized as hobbyist

[5:19:18] Vovosunt: can you use a handcrank?
[5:19:26] Grimstar_: thought it takes 2 water wheels for the 21 mechanical crafter setup
[5:19:35] daemonaedryn: Not enough power with the handcrank, only like 256 su
[5:19:56] Vovosunt: windmills > waterwheels

[5:20:19] Ras2709: windmill with 128 sails is max :)
[5:20:22] daemonaedryn: Windmill max is 8k, waterwheel is like 256, but it takes waaaay less space

[5:21:36] Grimstar_: oh that's derpy then lmao
[5:21:38] CorSPACE: windmills are super broken in many ways
[5:21:44] Humphr3y: I think they removed shafts using SU
[5:21:47] Deadfox74: What? Do they need sky access at all? LUL
[5:21:50] philip0524: Imagine forge using DirectStorage
[5:21:51] RedDiablos: I hang my windmills like ceiling fans
[5:21:53] TheodenArratay: you dont even need to make proper sails, you can just have a square LUL
[5:21:56] daemonaedryn: I remember in the create server me and maple made a few underground windmills for all our power
[5:22:04] Jibbur: Windmills with the adjustable speed gearshift thing
[5:22:09] CorSPACE: you can use windmill frames for propulsion for auto farms
[5:22:22] Jibbur: the rotation speed controller is great.
[5:22:30] Tabakhase: upside down hellmills 🤘
[5:22:48] shrooney: if you use soul sand and get the bubble column you can get up to 320 per wheel
[5:22:51] daemonaedryn: Its chill, then suddenly you get one shot by a random mob called Biggus Dickus the third
[5:23:06] CocoScruff: i love minecraft so much LUL it's so chill
[5:23:07] Tenkaichi500: just copy other streamers and do variety YEP

[5:23:19] CorSPACE: lego star wars comes out in couple days

[5:23:29] daemonaedryn: Did you see deadpine is doing this modpack in hardcore? Last I saw he'd already lost three worlds. Cant imagine that
[5:23:35] tandazo03: And the game drought is bad right now no one knows what to play
[5:23:38] Grimstar_: not sure if I'd want to buy Elden Ring; not interested in alt f4ing every other night
[5:23:52] Jibbur: First world was to crashing bugs... second two were death
[5:24:07] tandazo03: When does farming sim come out?
[5:24:15] kyanpeppaa: im playing vaulthunters which iskall made and man its been fun
[5:24:18] Tenkaichi500: just water on every front face
[5:24:27] Humphr3y: I been enjoying the cycle game. the game thats a tarkov lite game
[5:24:36] Grimstar_: sounds cool!
[5:24:37] Ebtanta2: You can speed up the waterwheels with soulsand
[5:24:44] ThatOnneGuy: no mans
[5:24:46] Tabakhase: no mans land
[5:24:48] Tabakhase: FailFish
[5:25:02] Apparentthreat: is that where you abused mowing?
[5:25:04] drafty_games: No Man's Land $0 challenge
[5:25:06] Mraav: use soulsand on the west side of the waterwheell and thats it water on top of that
[5:25:10] Humphr3y: oh yeah soul sand can add extra SU to the water wheels
[5:25:18] Mraav: dont block it on the other side!
[5:25:20] Humphr3y: with a bubble elevator
[5:25:22] daemonaedryn: Didnt you have a farmer waffle emote?
[5:25:41] Mraav: its not ideal
[5:25:41] amxlink: 2 days of chopping trees here we come!
[5:25:44] bcdmonkey: That was the Vegas fund wafflePoint
[5:25:46] DeadeyeWolff: You want the blocks under the wheel removed
[5:25:49] Kaylome97: you did so many contracts last time on 0 starting money lmao
[5:25:52] RemkoTheBeast: no glass? for nice look tru
[5:25:53] Filikeu: No glass :(
[5:25:54] Tabakhase: worst waterwheel ive seen in a while YEP
[5:26:02] RedDiablos: There is a boss fly in my world named Benjamin, he killed me once and now hovers above my base menacingly
[5:26:05] TheWonderLlama: 🪰
[5:26:07] Mraav: thats legit aweful
[5:26:33] Mraav: but making it optimal now isnt hard
[5:26:37] daemonaedryn: Its made of marble chat, thats atleast 10k NODDERS
[5:26:40] HQuinnch_tv: no glass makes it perform worse. @Giantwaffle
[5:26:42] laidher: pepeLaugh
[5:26:45] Grimstar_: it's close to a dozen small projects
[5:26:51] Grimstar_: much work
[5:26:51] brotatowin: what happen to storage?
[5:26:53] LiveType: Automate faster!
[5:26:59] DrWiz_rd: I need a new chill pc game. Any recommendations?
[5:26:59] Mraav: just do better Kappa
[5:27:02] Vovosunt: literally takes 15 min LUL
[5:27:13] Mraav: hahahaa
[5:27:14] daemonaedryn: Overstressed
[5:27:16] Tabakhase: YEP
[5:27:22] lcePops: Need more water
[5:27:23] Wwonka27: LUL
[5:27:24] Baromir: KEKW
[5:27:29] Mraav: you didnt put lube
[5:27:29] Canelupo97: KEKW
[5:27:31] DeadeyeWolff: remove the one row of blocks
[5:27:32] daemonaedryn: They were going in different directions i think
[5:27:34] Jibbur: I think it breaks when some are spinning and others aren't
[5:27:37] ajman225: waffleT3
[5:27:38] lcePops: Need more water!
[5:27:40] Mraav: you have to spit on it Kappa
[5:27:58] Jibbur: that or different directions, when water is being poured/picked up they often break
[5:28:02] daemonaedryn: That would be less efficient
[5:28:06] RedDiablos: I dont know, mine are separated by a shaft between each. No clue what the requirement is.
[5:28:14] lcePops: You need to put water everywhere
[5:28:16] lcePops: not one block
[5:28:17] daemonaedryn: It does theres just too much load currently on the system
[5:28:20] DeadeyeWolff: move the water all the way back
[5:28:30] Spirevipp: disconnect the crafter when u place water?
[5:28:30] Moobot: You can sub to Waffle by clicking this neat link -> twitch.tv/giantwaffle/subscribe
[5:28:30] Borlaq: disconnect it from the crafter
[5:28:32] Mraav: disconnect it
[5:28:33] Grimstar_: with further create wheels, soul sand I believe allows for faster rotational speeds
[5:28:40] LordOfthePingu: push back 1 block
[5:28:41] DeadeyeWolff: run completely over the top
[5:28:44] JoxerTheM1ghty: There is also a place where you can put soulsand to increase the speed
[5:28:49] Scopes64: make infinite soruce near it for now if u can
[5:28:54] drsnaki96: there's also a soul sand trick for more SU if you want to try and figure out
[5:28:59] Humphr3y: 20
[5:29:05] LiveType: 20 minute cycle
[5:29:08] CorSPACE: 20 min cycle
[5:29:11] CocoScruff: you broke the sleeping seal LUL
[5:29:22] LiveType: So sleep every 10 mins

[5:29:31] Kaylome97: 100%
[5:29:32] jmm548: yeah
[5:29:40] muddogjake51: It’s real
[5:29:41] Humphr3y: placebo effect
[5:29:42] DrWiz_rd: not a chance
[5:29:43] Apparentthreat: i mean, even if it's psychological it's still real
[5:29:44] Applesgosh_: i believe
[5:29:46] Bambooyah_: seal?
[5:29:46] HQuinnch_tv: of course seals are real... they like snow and stuff.
[5:29:47] TenpoQt: !modpack
[5:29:48] AmidAiz: seal? explain pls
[5:29:48] Moobot: Waffle is playing Enigmatica 6 Expert mode! You can get it at curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/enigmatica6expert
[5:29:48] HQuinnch_tv: duh
[5:29:48] PapaDskillzZz: You can get more SU from waterwheels by putting soulsand bubble column behind the waterwheel
[5:30:00] ThatOnneGuy: I broke the seal on my butthole earlier after eating taco bell
[5:30:06] daemonaedryn: https://create.fandom.com/wiki/Water_Wheel
[5:30:10] Grimstar_: true
[5:30:11] daemonaedryn: If you want ideal conditions
[5:30:11] Deadfox74: I mean... if you don't pee right away I imagine your bladder probably swells and then over time you'll be able to hold your pee longer
[5:30:12] Apparentthreat: AmidAiz you're drinking and haven't peed in a while. as soon as you pee the first time you'll have to pee more often
[5:30:14] orillion: @Bambooyah_ when you go and then need to go alot more regularly while drinking
[5:30:30] Bambooyah_: Ah ok yes i see thanks :)
[5:30:33] Mraav: see and thats optimal
[5:30:33] HappyLilToast: Has anyone connected via Plaid on Gemini? Or should I just do my bank manually 😬
[5:30:42] Mraav: water is two up from soulsand
[5:30:43] PxlSauce: 2 source blocks
[5:30:48] Tabakhase: "Water wheels can also be powered by Lava and Chocolate " - you know what todo YEP
[5:30:49] Vovosunt: windmills are so much simpler LUL
[5:30:50] Stillglade: two rows of source blocks
[5:30:53] PxlSauce: yes
[5:30:53] DX_Plates: @Deadfox74 I'm pretty sure that is the opposite of how it works, plus UTIs
[5:30:56] CorSPACE: the blocks above the soil are source
[5:31:00] Jibbur: Place all the water then the waterwheels
[5:31:00] noxiiiouse: wrong direction
[5:31:01] daemonaedryn: Opposite directions
[5:31:04] Jibbur: They are spinning backwards
[5:31:07] DeadeyeWolff: you have to have a source block for each wheel
[5:31:10] Mraav: not two source blocks, 2 blocks up from the soulsand
[5:31:12] daemonaedryn: Hes a man with a plan chat
[5:31:20] Deadfox74: @dx_plates LUL you may be right and yea I personally don’t subscribe to that idea. I pee when I gotta pee
[5:31:22] CorSPACE: the bubbles require source
[5:31:25] Tenkaichi500: the simple waterwheels have become a mission
[5:31:40] Kryllyk: 3 Minecraft days later :P
[5:31:58] Mraav: 2 UP
[5:31:59] Apparentthreat: you need something like a main power area with shafts going everywhere
[5:32:05] daemonaedryn: Enchant it with infinity :)
[5:32:07] Zohonde: those exist
[5:32:09] Vovosunt: there is one
[5:32:11] daemonaedryn: Check the recipe for a sink Kappa
[5:32:16] ZyianDev: make a source right next to you
[5:32:17] AleXanDreMau: just make one !
[5:32:18] Tabakhase: duping water D:
[5:32:19] Apparentthreat: sink
[5:32:20] shrooney: its mlg something
[5:32:21] HQuinnch_tv: just engineer a bottomless bucket.
[5:32:21] Opsidill: Make a pool right outside the water wheel
[5:32:24] daemonaedryn: A bucket enchanted with infinity does that
[5:32:25] Zohonde: water
[5:32:25] LiveType: chalice?
[5:32:26] Mraav: there is one rune from blood magic
[5:32:29] laidher: sink
[5:32:29] Mortimmer: can you make wand from Botania ?
[5:32:31] Tenkaichi500: water wheel will be complete by the time stream ends
[5:32:31] SimpleXfa: kitchen sink?
[5:32:32] N4RCO5: is there a keg?
[5:32:36] Smileynator: a sink though
[5:32:37] Vovosunt: it's from artifacts I think
[5:32:38] LiveType: oh yeah, the sink
[5:32:46] Zohonde: chalice from cyclic
[5:32:47] Mraav: check the rune from blood magic
[5:32:51] daemonaedryn: Oh yeah that was good
[5:32:55] Humphr3y: you can enchant a bucket with infinity
[5:32:58] Ras2709: still there
[5:33:04] Bow_Shock: Extra utility?
[5:33:06] LiveType: workhorse mod
[5:33:08] Smileynator: that was fucking great
[5:33:19] Zohonde: ender io resevoire
[5:33:22] undeniablyrexer: isn't it in enigmatic 6?
[5:33:23] CeeDreamer: There is an enchanted bucket that I’ve seen I don’t remember the name
[5:33:24] TheNobody005: its in E6, no?
[5:33:32] Tabakhase: never heard of ender-bucket - but ender tanks do have indeed a "bucket mode"
[5:33:35] undeniablyrexer: ender tank
[5:34:04] daemonaedryn: Ender tank is in this pack. You probably cant make it atm
[5:34:14] Humphr3y: different ender storage mod in this pack
[5:34:15] Frag_Magnet_: use that with Ranged Pumps for Power gen, OP
[5:34:21] Zohonde: the chalice from cyclic is an infinite bucket
[5:34:22] Enryu14: it was the ender utilities mod i think
[5:34:30] daemonaedryn: 320 each PogChamp
[5:34:34] babyaddalyn: no
[5:34:37] Jibbur: 320 per
[5:34:38] babyaddalyn: each
[5:34:38] shrooney: each
[5:34:41] drebisdavid: each
[5:34:45] Ras2709: look at the gear LUL
[5:34:52] samuraijac: i might have pitied my last +15 but im 1370 as a f2p
[5:34:55] DeadeyeWolff: look at end of shaft
[5:34:57] Smileynator: glass side for it pretty please? :P
[5:35:01] Obsidian_Vanir: Plus it's 320 at that speed, step it up and it becomes much higher
[5:35:09] JoxerTheM1ghty: You can make crazy windmills with create too
[5:35:10] Humphr3y: 320 per water wheels
[5:35:16] daemonaedryn: You can make a stressometer to see overall system capacity
[5:35:19] theflyingamerican74: Pog
[5:35:22] Rocknsugar: Pog
[5:35:27] Smileynator: ok that is neat as fuck

[5:35:32] Surge43: so cool
[5:35:33] Enryu14: Pog
[5:35:35] Mortimmer: Dude
[5:35:35] laidher: Clap
[5:35:37] LsTheRoberto: This mod did some pretty genius things
[5:35:38] Grimstar_: so the grinder ground into the gringer ^^
[5:35:40] Zohonde: waffle just jizzed a litte
[5:35:43] TheWonderLlama: We made a lag machine \o/
[5:35:43] BasedLemur: Reminds me of SpaceChem
[5:35:45] Smileynator: what mod is that? i need to know
[5:35:50] daemonaedryn: @Smileynator Create
[5:35:52] Troupster: I made that one chart for all your ender tanks back in the day https://troupster.com/waffle/colorizalator/colorizalator.swf you have to download now that flash is gone :(
[5:35:57] daemonaedryn: Yes
[5:36:02] Humphr3y: I love create
[5:36:04] Smileynator: @DaemonSzyman Is it all this cool?
[5:36:12] Myekos: make aluminum foil
[5:36:17] Zohonde: you can lay them down and send a belt uner them
[5:36:18] destroyerx97: including you
[5:36:23] Grimstar_: plus your bonuses
[5:36:25] daemonaedryn: @Smileynator Most of it yeah, its purely kinetic based machinery so all moving parts.
[5:36:26] Humphr3y: you can put the crushing wheels sideways faci
[5:36:32] Humphr3y: facing the floor
[5:36:33] Moobot: You can find Waffle's Youtube channel here - https://youtube.com/giantwaffle
[5:36:42] Smileynator: @DaemonSzyman that is really pog, i wanne try that sometime
[5:36:45] Carl0M00N: one press can do all
[5:36:49] poppyg15: is the sub server still a thing ?
[5:36:50] dobie: yeah the crushing wheels lying flat means you can run a belt through them
[5:36:51] daemonaedryn: Check tunnels
[5:36:57] Obsidian_Vanir: You can instead of washing, just go straight to cooking first with a Lava fan
[5:36:58] CorSPACE: you just need to filter 9 nuggets
[5:36:58] Carl0M00N: just filter output
[5:37:03] waffleslapps: not all at once
[5:37:10] Grimstar_: arboreal collector and fluid pipes with copper based items provides lava source
[5:37:11] waffleslapps: one ore type per time
[5:37:12] dmaya: !modpack
[5:37:12] Moobot: Waffle is playing Enigmatica 6 Expert mode! You can get it at curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/enigmatica6expert
[5:37:14] Grimstar_: with the hellbark
[5:37:15] Humphr3y: compacting machines
[5:37:27] daemonaedryn: Look at Brass Tunnels, it can split one belt into several
[5:37:34] CommanderUrsus: compact claustraphobia PTSD
[5:37:35] Carl0M00N: or 63nuggies for efficency
[5:37:40] Humphr3y: compact drawers to compress the nuggets
[5:37:49] daemonaedryn: KEKW
[5:37:51] Apparentthreat: put a shaft under
[5:37:52] theflyingamerican74: KEKW
[5:37:53] Apparentthreat: it's easier
[5:37:55] Grimstar_: looking vertically down
[5:37:56] dobie: place it from "above" i think
[5:37:58] RedDiablos: look down
[5:38:07] daemonaedryn: SUSSY
[5:38:13] Kaylome97: Looks Sus
[5:38:13] Apparentthreat: don't sussy that
[5:38:15] Humphr3y: shift click
[5:38:17] daemonaedryn: Yes
[5:38:19] premalonetv: Yep
[5:38:20] Ras2709: yes
[5:38:21] Stragmol: OSHA inc
[5:38:22] daemonaedryn: The belt needs to be super slow
[5:38:26] Apparentthreat: just have a few fans
[5:38:31] daemonaedryn: Yes multiple fans also works
[5:38:40] Jibbur: more per stack requires more time
[5:38:40] Apparentthreat: or point a fan downstream to the belt and turn at the end
[5:38:41] pontus_hockey: what mod is the pipes?
[5:38:45] waffleslapps: why did you guys get roller blades?
[5:38:45] Carl0M00N: 1 fan, belt speed is not that important
[5:38:47] dobie: nah you just have a tunnel by the washing machine, which only lets nuggets through
[5:38:49] Obsidian_Vanir: Or just cook with Lava fans until you have the washing/filtering done
[5:38:55] Jibbur: If you keep the stacks to a specific max size you can get it so it always works but keep a decent speed
[5:38:59] dobie: fast as poss
[5:39:01] Carl0M00N: fast
[5:39:08] Apparentthreat: the wheels do take time
[5:39:15] Humphr3y: you need more fans to wash faster more SI doesn't make Washing faster
[5:39:17] daemonaedryn: Grinding wheel goes at whatever speed you input
[5:39:17] lcePops: you only need one belt line
[5:39:22] Humphr3y: SU
[5:39:53] babyaddalyn: correct
[5:39:58] Carl0M00N: max speed grinding wheel can take 2048 SU each
[5:40:02] BloodPainting: sus
[5:40:16] undeniablyrexer: pressure plate
[5:40:22] daemonaedryn: KEKW
[5:40:23] CorSPACE: the water block can be on the conveyor
[5:40:25] Humphr3y: why not use compact drawers to compress nuggets to ingots
[5:40:25] Apparentthreat: @Giantwaffle put the fan at the end and point it at the belt. don't have to worry about speed as much
[5:40:25] Vovosunt: 2kSU is super easy with windmill
[5:40:37] daemonaedryn: ^^
[5:40:39] Carl0M00N: iron bars let through
[5:40:42] Carl0M00N: also just W
[5:40:43] kkotoro: signs?
[5:40:45] Humphr3y: slabs
[5:40:49] CommanderUrsus: trapdoor
[5:40:50] HengeDraws: I hope you play this more often!!!
[5:41:04] daemonaedryn: KEKW
[5:41:04] HengeDraws: Love the create mod
[5:41:09] Apparentthreat: HengeDraws he should be playing daily mostly. after he does lost ark in the morning (for him)
[5:41:10] meanhattermeanderer: Multicable fans will dry them faster
[5:41:14] waffleslapps: or have 2 water fans after each other to increase the time the ore is being washed without needing to slow down the belt
[5:41:15] Apparentthreat: DaemonSzyman NotLikeThis
[5:41:16] lilviper: Don't you have a Create winmill still outside doing nothing
[5:41:19] DeadeyeWolff: you can power the fan with a lava block
[5:41:21] HengeDraws: @apparentthreat Nice!
[5:41:29] DeadeyeWolff: behind it
[5:41:31] dobie: ye this works
[5:41:33] daemonaedryn: @Apparentthreat what peepoHmm
[5:41:47] MrBlueSky_729: !modpack
[5:41:47] Moobot: Waffle is playing Enigmatica 6 Expert mode! You can get it at curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/enigmatica6expert
[5:41:49] Vovosunt: just have it block till it's washed
[5:41:49] PapaDskillzZz: The items can go under the fan if you put the fan on the belt and you get a longer washing time
[5:41:56] dobie: nah all fast is fine, you just need a brass tunnel thing by the washing to filter nuggets only
[5:42:07] Ras2709: i would make a turn so it wan wash for a longer peiod of time
[5:42:07] Zohonde: depoy with tunnels filtered
[5:42:10] Carl0M00N: check create ingame explanation for fan
[5:42:20] Apparentthreat: ye
[5:42:29] dobie: just have the end of the belt go into a brass tunnel, and have an advanced filter on it that has athe forge nuggets only tag
[5:42:31] Vovosunt: @Giantwaffle ponder brass tunnels
[5:42:46] Grimstar_: to make things more derpy, the rotational speed can from the belts can be transferred directly from an adjacent belt
[5:42:47] Apparentthreat: ponder deez nuts
[5:42:49] daemonaedryn: Also Brass Funnels
