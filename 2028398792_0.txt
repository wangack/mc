[1:22:14] Roll_It_Twice: It's so wholesome to see Iskall make sure you guys have fun with the modpack with helping only when you need it
[1:22:15] apelsinaisupienu: You "learn" something everyday
[1:22:20] dia__hi: Removing vaults?
[1:22:21] therealtolazytothink: Axes are good for using routers to kill mobs.

[1:22:38] ansh26: Ooooo neuu

[1:23:03] HauntedKnight_: Why would you need vaults in Vault Hunters anyway?
[1:23:12] med_51: Did u hear they're changing cake vaults?
[1:23:25] 3milton: No, axes are the best
[1:23:26] TruePat: You need to roll the gear
[1:23:27] spellver: the resistance might make that one better
[1:23:27] misterstaal: @med_51 what?!!
[1:23:28] Zarey_z: resistance is really good
[1:23:31] ansh26: You will have to reroll
[1:23:33] Matkimble: it changes at lvl45
[1:23:35] PhantomNoir: Start making your own?
[1:23:36] ColdfireSerge: 14 velocity?

[1:23:49] LunaticGoneMad: you are suppose to change the modifiers
[1:23:51] Weizeh: more mana, nice
[1:23:54] The_magpie_777: yes
[1:23:57] Wako110: the mana so nice
[1:23:59] Lich_Kirby: You definitely need a new chest, maybe take a decent one and roll it a bit
[1:24:07] 440stainless: Higher velocity.  But lose a prefix
[1:24:11] misterstaal: @med_51 why hasn’t anyone said anything about this before now ;p
[1:24:15] mercalat0r_: I know VH has been overwhelming, there's a ton of back seat gamers and you're always busy anyway, but I hope you're enjoying yourself and might even consider a second VH series, maybe with the SkizzleBop
[1:24:16] xentraz: yes :D
[1:24:24] SuiteSunrise: you can enchant unbreaking right?
[1:24:26] Wako110: transmogrification
[1:24:31] AppleBlossom63: modular routers is how you make the delooter you wanted. and will make your ispawners a lot easier to automate
[1:24:34] Fred_the_Seagull: read joes message
[1:24:34] 440stainless: Lose 1 hp gain 3 armor.
[1:24:39] TypicalBuild3r: with emeralds you can make the new pants unbreaking!

[1:24:46] Fred_the_Seagull: joe in chat

[1:24:52] luv2ski8389: luv2ski8389 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 27 months! 💛
[1:24:54] LunaticGoneMad: you wont end up gettings good gear if you only hope to directly find gear with good modifiers you need to change them your self and get what you want

[1:25:18] mercalat0r_: @fossil160 how would a N&S VH go? I love them both so I'm very curious
[1:25:22] Roll_It_Twice: Iskall says it's the same Hp and Armor, just more visual with hearts
[1:25:24] w00kiet0sser: w00kiet0sser subscribed with Prime. 
[1:25:39] Lich_Kirby: Scrappy -can- be good
[1:25:43] Weizeh: around 2 rows of hearts seem like a safe amount of them, after that they seem pointless to me so armor/resistance start becoming a lot better
[1:25:50] NakeZast: Oh damn Impulse getting into Create?
[1:25:56] sharkie137: HypeLUL HypeLUL HypeLUL
[1:25:57] Lich_Kirby: o7

[1:26:23] Pineapple0nPizza: Just saying, Iskall is afk for the next 15-20 mins if you want to mess with him :D
[1:26:34] ExplodinEmeraldsLIVE: How's it going?

[1:27:04] TAxels: Evokers?
[1:27:04] mercalat0r_: Oh yeah! Iskall is making a sandwich if you felt like a prank! Maybe with the in-game camera?

[1:27:11] TruePat: Do you have Vindicator egg?

[1:27:39] TobyButt89: correct
[1:27:40] dan_and_d: Not both
[1:27:47] tangerinedoro: totems appear in the altar!
[1:27:48] LadyDW: Don't vaults have special totems?
[1:27:49] Ribery931: correct

[1:28:08] looking4art: is the emerald rate for evokers better than vindicators ? anybody in chat know?
[1:28:13] mossycomet: stats of the one you clicked in on accident: raratity =common armour = 10 crit hit resitance = 9% item rarity = 13% and healing eff +15% (other rolls were durability)
[1:28:17] Roll_It_Twice: You need to make a new vial
[1:28:18] Pineapple0nPizza: @LadyDW think they've been removed now
[1:28:18] TruePat: Yes
[1:28:20] EvilNotion: definitely
[1:28:20] upsidedownmeloncake: look at emeralds in JEI, it tells you sources
[1:28:20] LunaticGoneMad: they use to have special totems but now in this version
[1:28:22] ExplodinEmeraldsLIVE: I'm here now so you don't have to worry Emeralds now.....

[1:28:34] Nanthno: !song
[1:28:36] LadyDW: Oh definitely a vault heist song
[1:28:40] NJCoffeeJunkie: impulse, have you ever played a pretzel station and had the music just stop without advancing to the next track?
[1:28:45] gingervitis5: this song makes me think of little big planet/sacboy
[1:28:48] Soulless0120: 45 copi is magic though
[1:28:48] the_iron_cupcake: Thanks SteamElements.  LOL!
[1:28:51] Nanthno: What song is this?
[1:28:52] kattenbrokken: Not worth
[1:28:56] automattus: nope

[1:29:09] mindofme_: was it a used magnet?
[1:29:11] SuiteSunrise: not new
[1:29:13] therealtolazytothink: probably had junk on the side so it wouldn't fit
[1:29:17] fossil160: Probably had scrap on the outfeed.

[1:29:52] lilz3bra: not new. you just need to clear the output spaces
[1:29:53] kattenbrokken: If you get good suffix might be worth
[1:29:56] quirkyship28698: Add attack damage to it

[1:30:28] BulletxEnkeli: CD is only good when is high, said Iskall
[1:30:28] zeus_o9o2: are you heavy dependent on abilities
[1:30:34] looking4art: cdr is good if you rely on abilities

[1:30:47] LunaticGoneMad: well atleast at your level
[1:30:51] BigPoppaHouse: Xisuma said something about a client side mod that showed all the differences between gear pieces in terms of listing each thing added or removed with a new piece. Don’t know what it’s called though.
[1:30:57] libraven: Are there going to be more vaults with Iskall?
[1:31:12] LadyDW: Same.
[1:31:15] mercalat0r_: Understandable!
[1:31:16] WorkScorpio: @libraven Iskall is just taking a short break

[1:31:28] NurseLucy: Did you hear? You need to be level 100 to enter the herald vault?
[1:31:30] notTheRealHelmis: nobody does the math - they do it by feel and press h HAHA
[1:31:32] EvilNotion: Did you just say "maths" ? You've been hanging out with too many people from outside the US. ;)
[1:31:35] evesteroo: If you press H and look at your stats, it shows it a lot more clearly. You can try gear and see what numbers change
[1:31:39] zeus_o9o2: there is a mod or something xisuma has that compares your armour idk the name tho
[1:31:46] mercalat0r_: I get decision paralysis lol
[1:31:46] LunaticGoneMad: at some point you do have to do it as you will need a proper set for later vaults
[1:31:46] mrlgrose: maths > math
[1:31:53] MargusGoon: Says the guy who does villager trades for enchanted books
[1:32:00] BigPoppaHouse: Xisuma said something about a client side mod that showed all the differences between gear pieces in terms of listing each thing added or removed with a new piece. Don’t know what it’s called though.

[1:32:11] RohanaDArilin: I like the games that provide the info in the form of little arrows up or down, or + and - signs, when you compare to your equipped gear

[2:11:52] AppleBlossom63: vector pates are easy and you can use the modular router to send all the items to the drawers or the RS system
[2:11:57] lilliebets: Yess Lisa Frank trapper keepers. Elite
[2:11:58] therealtolazytothink: It's not in the pack. routers are the best killer in VH.  Player damage plate is the other option, but no looting.

[3:09:40] darktyping: Agreed. Scavs in co-op are ok, I'm not the type to enjoy them solo.
[3:09:41] KyokudaiZero: KyokudaiZero subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 18 months!
