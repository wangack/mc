[0:30:28] onceandalways: Hi @bobsens37 ! This is Vault Hunters, a very epic roguelike modpack developed by Iskall and his team. The hermits are playing :D
[0:30:29] mitsuki1678: make auto crystals

[0:30:45] nomadshelp: how did you complete alter
[0:30:46] mukul_25: Hi
[0:30:48] vhblast: i say first cake vault should be with etho
[0:30:49] P3pp3rF1y: Iskall selling his soul in black market
[0:30:50] briscolan: no way!! they changed the cake vaults???
[0:30:54] Taigacha: You can't ascend a cake vault right? That would be op just bailing out after one cake to build an ascention stack
[0:31:03] hito4_4: I'm going to make a giant construction that looks like Jenna Ortega soon
[0:31:04] mahik750: I am curious about the brazier objective. Apart from dying or deliberately leaving, you will always complete, no? Just run through the vault, click the braziers and done? Maybe I misunderstood something
[0:31:05] bshugks: Oh my iskall, he did it
[0:31:10] mukul_25: Can anyone tell me what did I miss ??

[0:31:58] the_unbalanced: GET TO THE XAKE!!
[0:32:03] flintmaster25: Should you make it so that the soul flame can work a few levels lower than you in case you burger up a level
[0:32:03] onceandalways: @taigacha I doubt it? That’d be a bug, soul flames can’t be added to modified crystals, and make the crystal unmodifiable after being applied
[0:32:17] sivzzz: 17% copiously?? isnt that big?
[0:32:19] NakeZast: you had a really good magnet during Etho 3rd treasure chest session... and you scrapped it XD

[0:49:12] TheImmortaldonut: I think the whole point is the looting
[0:49:16] MunchNL: is bartering now OP? due to the vendoors?
[0:49:19] GrimBirb: @sleepysalp89 Seeing as they have barely any days left (less than a month) until they reach day 100... Probably not going to happen imo
[0:49:24] graegrove: the chests are so juicy
[0:49:28] Ferdster02: Well, seeing how you've just spend 15 minutes of the vault to get this far and the mobs being this much stronger makes it seem pretty balanced, but we'll see when we get the total chest count

[0:51:44] gaymersalsa: @JustusIsOnline OMEGALOOL
[0:51:44] ravenwiley: No understand sportsball reference
[0:51:45] flintmaster25: hockey is the best sport
[0:51:46] sivzzz: thats actually a great metaphor wdym
[0:51:52] Lizerdman87: new cake vaults look so fun. I love this
[0:51:53] lordsfave: you should change teh full crake number, seems to high with new looting
[0:51:53] lavacandy1: hugeee
[0:51:54] kinghingle: !release
[0:51:54] Nightbot: Vault Hunters update 13 is live on the Hermitcraft Vault Hunters server for testing! Public release will likely be out on Sunday the 14th. Check out iskall's video on the changes: https://youtu.be/CrAUh0SOGY0?si=Qw4iZq7S3-Kis9sv
[0:51:59] ThaSavageRogue: !patch
[0:52:00] Nightbot: Waiting on patch 13 notes, will be on the VH site once they're ready! For now, patch notes for 12.4 and below can be found on https://vaulthunters.gg/patch-notes
[0:52:01] stefono4: @gaymersalsa sports ball talk
[0:52:01] JashinFanatic: my backpacks nooo
[0:52:01] pendelluft: It’s so refreshing to not have to listen to baseball metaphors
[0:52:03] xlett_: iskall will nerf this before sunday mark my words
[0:52:07] Therank2100: Like this i can forsee this being the new loot meta, especially for high-end POIs like that...people will definitely spend their oranges on this cault type for that room and the like
[0:52:13] Ferdster02: @z_e_ns true, we just have to wait I think. These chests look insane, but also, mobs are stronger and that will eat up even more time so hard to say if its balanced
[0:52:14] stefono4: Also hallo!
[0:52:15] acg94: cake vault loot looks juicy now
[0:52:16] trashgamer300: 19 cakes in 7 minutes, cope
[0:52:16] notTheRealHelmis: i think people will find their optimum amount which make it better than regular vaults
[0:52:19] cineeleo: Cake pedestal in every room now?
[0:52:20] zaharozoe: @xlett_ lol
[0:52:20] GrimBirb: LUL
[0:52:20] lavacandy1: truuu
[0:52:25] aaka41: Crake needs to be scaled differently because the gameplay/meta changed?
[0:52:26] adadorik: So the tactic would be ignore all loot until you get an omega room in which point you would have gotten a lot of cakes and the loot would be insane
[0:52:27] sleepysalp89: @cineeleo yep
[0:52:29] jenn_jennnn: oh i see, so you dont get IQ and IR just get more chests?
[0:52:35] Benayman: MIssing the twist, that makes cake-vaults non-OP compared to normal vaults. Isn't it too good?
[0:52:36] gaymersalsa: @jenn_jennnn both
[0:52:45] lavacandy1: you revealed your CT
[0:52:46] BooBooFastCat: when iskall gets 70 cakes in a cake vault he will have to veinmine to get in as the room will be full of chests and coins
[0:52:46] lavacandy1: lol
[0:52:52] thiccmilkguy: My stupid brain would mistakely click the pedestal but thats just me not a game design flaw
[0:52:53] S3l33ngrab: weee finally manage to catch a stream :D
[0:52:54] z_e_ns: @Ferdster02 yeye I'm with you on this, only time and more testers will tell
[0:52:55] RMZing: Ascention, Cake, Divine Paradox... Late game is now WILD
[0:53:00] kinghingle: i think the worry was good, but the variance was too high on it
[0:53:01] strandberggg: I mean, u cant fail the objective
[0:53:01] cineeleo: Imagine speedrunning this for omage rooms
[0:53:03] EpicEgon: no danger after 23 cakes? tell that to False LUL
[0:53:03] Kasszi_: it was lame imo
[0:53:04] gaymersalsa: as long as bonne adds less pedestals in their mod... Chadding
[0:53:04] notTheRealHelmis: just start cake vaults with less loot and weaker mobs hryBillian
[0:53:05] strandberggg: Which is bad
[0:53:08] Iron_the_Beast: Iron_the_Beast subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 5 months! Hallo iskHeart , what is your favorite thing about vault hunters if i may ask smile
[0:53:10] ItzElixsis: @thiccmilkguy same
[0:53:13] jenn_jennnn: i think the cake pedestal should be every 3 rooms instead of every room
[0:53:15] gaymersalsa: @notTheRealHelmis PepeiskallDoingaGaslight
[0:53:24] enruko2: Maybe make it 50 50 to get a pedestal
[0:53:26] notTheRealHelmis: @gaymersalsa KEKVV
[0:53:27] MathanW: having the pedestal reocurring will help risk averse players to enjoy the content
[0:53:27] ace3473: i think there is already the challenge to find the cake so there being a cake ped in every room is great
[0:53:30] lizerich: What keyboard/switch is iskall using?
[0:53:31] MathanW: since they'll be inclined to progress further
[0:53:37] itsJL137: I think the pedestals were too rare before
[0:53:37] ItzElixsis: Block chance seems higher?
[0:53:43] Miss_Didi: Is it not redundant to have the cake at the top middle of the screen showing how many you have collected, and it also to show how many cake layers in the bottom right hand corner?
[0:53:46] jchiledred98: cake vaults are now a greeders dream
[0:53:48] Nero918: I'd say maybe every 5th room, but make it so multiple players can use it?
[0:53:48] Zarey_z: can definitely see the increased frequency of altars too
[0:53:48] Lizerdman87: if the pedestals weren’t in every room then I wouldn’t start looting til I found one. and that means the game is determining when I loot, not me. and that’s not good I think
[0:53:50] polkmer: @iskall85 is the new meta going to be run cakes, get at least 20 or so and hope for omegas to super loot?
[0:53:50] autumspog: such disrepect for the mobs, ill just poke you with my sword and keep running xD
[0:53:54] graegrove: imagine running this in coop iskFine iskTroll
[0:53:57] gaymersalsa: iskall shows how dangerous it is by taking of all his armour Chadge
[0:54:00] SuiteSunrise: i don't think anyone is gonna speed run this
[0:54:06] rektarina1594: What do you think about the current state of mega jump? @iskall85
[0:54:08] lcecreamkev: lcecreamkev subscribed with Prime. 
[0:54:09] GhoulHunter811: ello!
[0:54:15] TobyButt89: @jenn_jennnn ye I agree a 30-50% chance might be better, but only time will tell
[0:54:19] michellewilson707: Cake vault looks so much more fun now.  The old style made me so stressed, trying to read and understand all the modifiers as they came up on screen and worrying about the pedestals as well.  Can't wait to play myself now
[0:54:19] ItzElixsis: @lizerdman87 I see what u mean. And I agree.
[0:54:23] spurlucke: Would you make it that cake vaults would be harder if it's coop?
[0:54:23] Meena4578: it makes it easier for multiplayer to finish the vault. cause we can’t interact the same or at least it wasn’t the case when i played with my friend
[0:54:29] JashinFanatic: I feel like 50% crakes would be great, it would still add the feel of "do I fully loot this room or do I risk going a few more"?
[0:54:33] marvelprincess2000: iskHeart iskHeart
[0:54:34] catatonic51: Every 10th cake should trigger a wild
[0:54:40] shrub_fluff: Heya everyone!
[0:54:41] rokenrollbo: Hi
[0:54:46] gaymersalsa: o/
[0:54:49] Benayman: mmmh will cost for cake vault crystals go up at least?
[0:54:50] rokenrollbo: Hello
[0:54:53] aaka41: No that works because you're not going for those many cracks
[0:54:54] itsJL137: Is the update live yet?
[0:54:56] Kasszi_: yes
[0:54:58] gaymersalsa: @catatonic51 now THIS i can get behind hryLaf
[0:54:59] Therank2100: As long as the mobs are scaling in difficulty correctly then this sort of risk/reward play is good
[0:55:00] thiccmilkguy: Make the seal obtainable through chests only and it is moderately rare or this might be a meta
[0:55:00] gaymersalsa: !release
[0:55:00] Nightbot: Vault Hunters update 13 is live on the Hermitcraft Vault Hunters server for testing! Public release will likely be out on Sunday the 14th. Check out iskall's video on the changes: https://youtu.be/CrAUh0SOGY0?si=Qw4iZq7S3-Kis9sv
[0:55:02] rokenrollbo: What are you doing
[0:55:10] Therank2100: the deeper you go the more pounishing itll get
[0:55:13] notTheRealHelmis: I think the crake # being big forces you to skip chests, and kinda balances it
[0:55:13] sivzzz: @iskall85 i feel like the pedistals not being available every room did add some interest, but I feel it was just too rare and was very easy to get unlucky.
[0:55:14] gaymersalsa: but you DO have time hryLaf
[0:55:15] z_e_ns: focusSkall hahaha
[0:55:15] TheImmortaldonut: It's hammer time
[0:55:16] Nightbot: Everything in VH 1.18 is very under development & things might change.. Just Trust the Process-- iskall & Devs
[0:55:16] DanMetroArnold: Oregi Oregi Oregi
[0:55:19] tito_me_doe: needs to get harder faster and I actually think it’s perfect. If it’s really hard, then the rewards being ridiculous makes sense
[0:55:21] profesorpineaple: The ores though
[0:55:23] xlett_: you should loot after this point iskalman
[0:55:23] McMelon_TV: think of the believers iskall
[0:55:23] aaka41: We need ores
[0:55:25] rokenrollbo: What is tis
[0:55:26] gaymersalsa: @rokenrollbo demoing the newly updated cake vaults for us
[0:55:43] Kasszi_: spiders are always sons of a nice lady....
[0:55:44] pb_b: weak vein miner lol
[0:55:46] Benayman: @TheImmortaldonut can't touch this. duuu dududu. dudu. dudu
[0:55:55] shrub_fluff: I can't wait to try the new cake vaults once I'm outta hospital
[0:55:55] gaymersalsa: Hmm
[0:55:59] cineeleo: This is so satisfying to watch so many chests
[0:56:04] gaymersalsa: based.
[0:56:04] Ribery931: any of the assasin mobs will hit hard like spiders/skelletons
[0:56:07] shrub_fluff: But I love that I can watch the stream
[0:56:09] pb_b: you’re changing cake vaults???
[0:56:13] Nightbot: Support the devs & the pack.  https://www.patreon.com/VaultHunters
[0:56:14] gaymersalsa: add it. gaymer68KEKW
[0:56:15] trisk33: i was thinking that to balance risk/reward
[0:56:16] Kasszi_: just better not include fading
[0:56:18] SuiteSunrise: i hope there's no mega curse
[0:56:19] P3pp3rF1y: minor curses would probably be alright
[0:56:22] muppification: but how do you convey curse chance for players?
[0:56:27] P3pp3rF1y: full on mana leak doesn't sound that much fun
[0:56:38] mahik750: Yeah, I like the curse idea too. Although, the cake run might seem too easy just because you are too good.
[0:56:39] Ler3ysss: I haven't run a single cake vault in my 100h run. But with this update, im excited to run it.
[0:56:42] faefair: feels like there should be a chance for a mega plus aswell
[0:56:43] jenn_jennnn: I am not a fan of curses if you arent given the chance to remove
[0:56:43] gaymersalsa: t4 mining fatigue pls hryPrayge
[0:56:43] valkojam: If the exit option is always there, then a curse option is good. Got cursed? Ope gotta go.
[0:56:45] thiccmilkguy: Iskalls PC is lagging idk if my potato laptop would even survive launching VH
[0:56:46] graegrove: 2 min 9 cake. I believe
[0:56:46] SuiteSunrise: you just leave at that point
[0:56:46] mohammad_alsalman: 2.30m
[0:56:49] NakeZast: I think we will hit 35 cake layers :P
[0:56:52] redstonehead777: Did you know that they changed cake vaults?
[0:56:54] polkmer: have both minor curse or minor buff for RNG
[0:56:55] iatemyroof: lol i just joined. perfect timing to, first thing i heard, C A K E.
[0:56:56] P3pp3rF1y: yeah bad curses are pretty much telling you stop now
[0:56:58] JashinFanatic: maybe not mega curses, because imagine getting Barren
[0:56:58] Therank2100: peak it?
[0:56:58] bafoon__: I’d rather it be more challenging then a random chance of it becoming impossible
[0:57:00] xlett_: just loot
[0:57:01] trashgamer300: NINE MORE
[0:57:06] enruko2: Look at all those mobs lol
[0:57:09] iatemyroof: Anyways since i just joined whats going on rn?

[0:57:16] pixelcrack_: ayooooooooooooooooo
[0:57:19] graegrove: omega
[0:57:19] EpicEgon: if you start to loot more at this moment you will feel the amount of mobs way more then just skipping them
[0:57:19] Therank2100: cake behind
[0:57:20] valkojam: Behind you
[0:57:20] nomadshelp: holy
[0:57:20] notTheRealHelmis: OOOO
[0:57:21] mohammad_alsalman: Nice room 🤣🤣🤣
[0:57:22] pixelcrack_: holy moly
[0:57:22] urban_beach: loot
[0:57:25] faefair: mega curse seems like the vault telling you to leave, rather than choosing yourself
[0:57:26] profesorpineaple: DoubleW
[0:57:30] maxxam230: hey iskall curious in the brazier vault is there an %ap increase bc strength wouldn’t do to much for ***nt wait for u13 though
[0:57:33] gaymersalsa: @iatemyroof he's showcasing what vault hunters' new cake vaults are like!
[0:57:42] Arqae: You gave the illagers a dodge mechanic Kappa
[0:57:43] S3l33ngrab: is this the new update already?
[0:57:49] Kasszi_: give us fizzle spawner in village rooms Madge
[0:57:50] xlett_: 2nd trinket incoming
[0:57:57] gaymersalsa: @Kasszi_ good take
[0:57:59] RMZing: I think the average person isn't going to be getting above 30 very often
[0:58:00] gaymersalsa: @Kasszi_ rare.
[0:58:02] cineeleo: I think will become the new meta again..
[0:58:03] naenas: Timeskall

[0:58:15] fluxrabbit: Mega curses can be countered with the possibility of mega buffs
[0:58:19] SwimStyle: every 10 or 20 layers should have a chance of a curse, imo. it invokes the feeling of "do i want to loot previous rooms or continue to press on and push my luck" once you hit the *9 layers
[0:58:23] pixelcrack_: soo much gear
[0:58:23] NakeZast: if we lose the poll, we blame iskall for being greedy ;)

[0:58:41] ace3473: time for kiwis
[0:58:42] travinia: Damn so many chests
[0:58:46] JashinFanatic: I'm getting my dopamine fix right now
[0:58:48] trashgamer300: Very satisfying vein mine
[0:58:52] lolluc007: greed - Kiwi - greed

[0:58:58] pixelcrack_: greed kiwi run KEKW
[0:58:58] WorkScorpio: etho has been busy hes level 85
[0:59:09] fluxrabbit: Also what if there is curses and or buffs that only lasts for a certain amount of cakes found?
[0:59:10] EpicEgon: want the cake or the loot?
[0:59:11] enruko2: Greedskall kicking in lol

[0:59:39] JashinFanatic: wait, does the crake despawn from the previous rooms?
[0:59:39] bashleyyyyy: NotLikeThis
[0:59:40] gaymersalsa: @NakeZast it goes up in pitxh

[1:00:12] Khalin1212: these rooms are the worst for cakes
[1:00:13] NakeZast: @gaymersalsa IK I feel like it changed a bit... might be because of the new headset I am wearing xD

[1:01:52] Lakosius2: Man , i cant believe you actually changed Cake Vaults
[1:01:52] bobsens3: @iskall85 why is mumnbo's face on the vault portal?
[1:01:52] Lady_Moonshadow: its great
[1:01:54] marvelprincess2000: iskGg
[1:01:54] lordeclipse01: nah make it bigger
[1:01:55] profesorpineaple: No good
[1:01:55] aeonep_: definitely too many chests
[1:01:56] matrai_: GG
[1:01:56] mpastor_25: the speed of cake is an interesting metric
[1:01:56] AmethystVicious: it’s finneeeeeee
[1:01:59] pixelcrack_: wait 1 trapped ?
[1:02:00] trashgamer300: My Gamba is ded
[1:02:01] Ferdster02: and the library
[1:02:02] JashinFanatic: keep it until I can run one nooo
[1:02:02] ye_olde_dice_goblin: I see you still haven't fixed the sharp sound when people mine chests...
[1:02:03] jenn_jennnn: i think you should do a few of them before deciding to nerf
[1:02:05] graegrove: bit too op
[1:02:06] knightrali: does each person still need their own pedistal if we're in coop?
[1:02:07] nomadshelp: you only say because of the challenge room
[1:02:08] stany_d: yay it's op, everyone do cake vaults now before he nerfs it
[1:02:12] TheImmortaldonut: Is the experience still a bit low?
[1:02:12] sp0rsk: i mean youg ot a challenge room and an omega room so that seems pretty normal to me
[1:02:13] littlepepperbutt: That was fun!
[1:02:14] aaka41: Needs buff
[1:02:14] ItzElixsis: That looked so fun!!!
[1:02:16] CapraDiCollina: mate update 13 is amazing! well done :)
[1:02:17] HazDS: HazDS subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 67 months! Much love boss man, looking forward to playing on Mordor after the reset!
[1:02:21] younge147: It'll probably be very powerful in co op
[1:02:21] itsJL137: For the  raw Vaults, can we get an ocean room? Like a coral reef, cold ocean, and a prismerene theme rooms? Those materials are difficult to get early game
[1:02:22] Danymaddox: yep, a little nerf is needed
[1:02:23] SuiteSunrise: that was really fun
[1:02:25] gaymersalsa: @HazDS o7
[1:02:28] Ferdster02: You got the village and the 20 cake library, still a bit to strong, but not much I think
[1:02:30] pb_b: cake vaults my beloved
[1:02:31] bobsens3: @iskall85 why is mumbo's face on the vault portal?
[1:02:34] xDreerer: Is this the December update?
[1:02:37] gaymersalsa: @xDreerer yes
[1:02:38] Danymaddox: artifact
[1:02:39] HamswordJr: I missed the cake vault?!?
[1:02:42] kowbieee777: i dont think you should have less chests but rather stronger mobs
[1:02:42] queenofdarkness93: Noooo I missed the cake vault!!!! Good morning
[1:02:42] shrub_fluff: This looks so fun iskall!! I'm so excited to try it!!! Omgomgomg
[1:02:51] maxxam230: hey iskall have to go in a bit sadge, is there an %ap increase in the brazier vault?
[1:02:52] sivzzz: the gear is crazy tho
[1:02:58] profesorpineaple: Not 50 trinkets so seems good
[1:03:01] HamswordJr: @queenofdarkness93 same I just got here
[1:03:03] caden7651: bro
[1:03:07] Miss_Didi: Is it not redundant to have it showing how many cakes you have collected both in the top middle of the screen and also in the bottom right as cake layers?
[1:03:07] Zaraca90: You would have seen it
[1:03:07] DragolicSoul: 2 trinki?
[1:03:09] ItzElixsis: Wow
[1:03:10] pixelcrack_: the backpack is full bruh
[1:03:10] ayla_or_something: increase damage scaling so that you’re more incentivised to loot when it’s a little safer?
[1:03:11] gaymersalsa: you need a stack upgrade there just for trinkets LOL
[1:03:11] alex_needs_coffee: 2 trinkets
[1:03:11] mahik750: Maaaaaybe a bit too powerful xD
[1:03:12] xlett_: he is so gonna nerf it
[1:03:12] Ribery931: thats a lot of gear

[1:03:14] caden7651: twitch streams don’t work on tv
[1:03:14] ItzElixsis: Loot is great
[1:03:15] P3pp3rF1y: there were 2 trinkets
[1:03:15] onceandalways: Omega
[1:03:18] DanMetroArnold: Oh my FROST look at all that Loot!!! :O

[1:03:23] notTheRealHelmis: guys don’t tell him
[1:03:23] mpastor_25: now you need the large backpacks
[1:03:25] sh4dow_d3mon: u should have 2 trinkets
[1:03:26] xlett_: it should be nerfed in this state
[1:03:28] notTheRealHelmis: he doesn’t need to know
[1:03:33] MathanW: you could make it so you cant resurrect if you die
[1:03:35] Niko_993: i am most interested about the eternal soul update personally
[1:03:46] alexsolm: What u use etrnal souls for??
[1:03:47] gaymersalsa: too good kekw
[1:03:49] Danymaddox: yep felt like too much for a normal crate

[1:04:04] CKM32: Really fun to watch and i imgaine to play
[1:04:04] SuiteSunrise: really fun but OP
[1:04:04] ItzElixsis: FUN!!!
[1:04:05] Dadel2400: strong, but looked fun
[1:04:05] italopussi: Too OP the chests
[1:04:05] Ferdster02: That looked super full for a less then normal crate
[1:04:05] devo_gr: Too op
[1:04:06] mahik750: It needs a nerf for sure
[1:04:06] Lady_Moonshadow: Great
[1:04:07] bshugks: Need buff
[1:04:07] asimithehero: Pedestal in every room feels to easy

[1:04:10] jeb_mack: TO WEAK
[1:04:11] flintmaster25: stronger
[1:04:11] P3pp3rF1y: I would say half the growth would be good
[1:04:11] whydoesnoone: Fun
[1:04:11] nomadshelp: its fun
[1:04:11] dheeraj1199: Lil strong
[1:04:11] bashleyyyyy: Looks fun
[1:04:11] Ler3ysss: leave it
[1:04:11] rektarina1594: the chest growth was the bigger issue
[1:04:11] StandaSK: felt a bit like too much, but I'm WAAAAYY slower player than you
[1:04:11] TheAmateurQueen: I do think a little too strong
[1:04:11] Therank2100: looked good, though maybe chests need a little nerf
[1:04:11] Zaraca90: Need buff
[1:04:12] jonathan_2119: it was sick
[1:04:12] kowbieee777: buff the mobs
[1:04:12] pixelwhizz: iskall, add images and videos to quests
[1:04:13] Danymaddox: i mean i do need to test it because im not as good as you but yeah, too strong
[1:04:13] lordeclipse01: nah needs more chests
[1:04:13] Heyitskyle93: will become meta to run cake]
[1:04:13] QDC__: it was better before
[1:04:14] TelicGamez: Looks fun
[1:04:14] thereal4thewin: BUFF CAKE
[1:04:14] decidiousdrake: I feel it's good
[1:04:14] rayman99912: Lower chest
[1:04:14] urban_beach: was exciting!
[1:04:14] alexsolm: Only cake vault
[1:04:15] suvichan2005: I like it
[1:04:15] drewbacca1981: No, it was good!
[1:04:15] magdaluo66: good
[1:04:15] stefono4: Mega thinks it's perfect
[1:04:16] BreakingTiger180: needs a nerf
[1:04:16] strandberggg: Cant fail the objective even, regardless of the loot
[1:04:16] spurlucke: If it's coop make it harder?
[1:04:17] Morno_: Remember that you're also very good at the game
[1:04:17] antegravity: Nahhhhh it's fine
[1:04:17] cheesebutt2302: it’s lerfect
[1:04:17] e_shailee: start with fewer chests than normal
[1:04:17] Lizerdman87: oerfect
[1:04:17] z_e_ns: 2 trink in one run for 30 is op
[1:04:18] thiccmilkguy: Make the seal available through chests ONLY but don't change the vault
[1:04:18] italopussi: 40 cakes is too much
[1:04:18] Paudot: op
[1:04:18] ZenoPlague: Maybe 10%  nerf give or take
[1:04:19] crazyshezy: 40 is do big a number for me :)
[1:04:19] forelini: but op
[1:04:20] pixelcrack_: one more cake vault and we decide Hmm
[1:04:20] Cerynne: I think you need more testing to know for sure.
[1:04:20] Dragonfoot21: Pedestal in every 5 rooms
[1:04:20] Tiffpocalypse: Dont base it off of 1 run
[1:04:21] tito_me_doe: @iskall85 I think everything was great if it was harder faster
[1:04:21] ayla_or_something: enemy scaling feels a little weak
[1:04:21] wildeagle07: its fine
[1:04:21] Lizerdman87: perfect
[1:04:21] prophet42699: Good
[1:04:22] biglez936: too week needs a buff
[1:04:23] mohammad_alsalman: Cake is now op XD
[1:04:23] hotloy: nerf 15%
[1:04:24] bestbla: nerf a bit but lotting all those chests feels so nice
[1:04:27] HamswordJr: I didn’t see how hard the vault was for the reward
[1:04:27] shamandude1: Its good
[1:04:28] seanlego23: xp gain was good
[1:04:28] bananajake722: as a not as good player I don’t think I’d reach 30 cakes anyways 😂
[1:04:28] ThrowTheCats: What about disabing the exit pilon thingy when you eat the cake in a room. So you are forced to go to keep going forward
[1:04:28] jscriptj: i cant get to 40! haha so i dont mind this!!
[1:04:29] devo_gr: Like 3/4 of the loot?
[1:04:31] maty02msu: leave it how it is for us noobs
[1:04:31] cheesebutt2302: absolutely perfect
[1:04:33] Ribery931: crake too strong the rest is fine
[1:04:34] Niko_993: do another cake, its hard to judge from one vault
[1:04:34] zichor: scale it down 5 cakes
[1:04:34] asparagus1800: pedestals are perfect but the stacking can be a bit nerfed
[1:04:34] AmethystVicious: it’s goodge
[1:04:35] cineeleo: I love the feeling but too accessible
[1:04:35] TheLifeofL: chest increase seemed a bit ott
[1:04:37] nomadshelp: 40 cakes is too much maybe make it 35
[1:04:37] Hydromail: A bit too strong, maybe 20% less progress, so that your 31 would be around 35/40
[1:04:37] MahSpoogies: Do you think you need another go add it to add more data before assessing the need for a nerf?
[1:04:38] Jarhielt: Missed it do it again
[1:04:38] Monatae: more data needed, imo
[1:04:38] jametrics: Do a few more before deciding nerf?
[1:04:41] k4ampfwolf: this feels like it should be the max you can get
[1:04:41] Cicatrix1988: I think it's great, finally worth running a cake vault
[1:04:42] Dragonfoot21: Full crate at 60?
[1:04:42] decidiousdrake: You're a high level. Lower levels will never reach that high
[1:04:43] Meena4578: seems more accessible for less good players
[1:04:43] pixelcrack_: that gear man its tooo much
[1:04:44] rektarina1594: isnt it super easy to win completion bounties with cakes?
[1:04:44] pendelluft: Chaos cake vault?
[1:04:45] alpinepanda: maybe make the seal more expansive?
[1:04:45] mpastor_25: need to see a 1 cake crate to judge it
[1:04:46] rayman99912: Chest way to op
[1:04:46] moriahberry14: idk I’m really excited to try I think it looks more exciting. before I didn’t want to spend the vault diamonds on it but feels worth now
[1:04:46] e_shailee: maybe start with like 1 chest per poi?
[1:04:46] Ferdster02: Little bit OP, but with the late village and the 20 cake library I don't think it's to bad
[1:04:47] rkdavis03: love the cake update….I haven’t been playing because it wasn’t worth it
[1:04:48] Lizerdman87: as someone that can’t get past 25 cakes. seems fine to me
[1:04:49] Wako110: could you instead make the seal harder to craft?
[1:04:51] SuiteSunrise: really fun tho
[1:04:52] heighleybaily: It was fun to watch
[1:04:53] littlepepperbutt: Love it it just needs a Lil tweeking
[1:04:53] TheAmateurQueen: I agree. Not very far off
[1:04:54] xDreerer: I wasnt here.. can you do it again?
[1:04:56] lukascandries: Do another one
[1:04:56] MilanNL1309: cant you make it so the pedestal gets removed from last room? so you cant go backwards only forwards for extra risk?
[1:04:58] Princess_Arya: pedestal is good, growth is a little high, maybe 10% nerf
[1:04:58] StandaSK: what about coop and pedestals?
[1:04:59] Nero918: I think if it's just deciding when you exit, it's deciding how much is too much?
[1:05:02] lifeblade789: The trade-off should be that crafting a seal could be more expensive so that people can't singularly run cake vaults
[1:05:02] RMZing: I have a theory that the modifier to the crake size is adding onto a full one
[1:05:03] gaymersalsa: wait where is theh 2nd artifact from hryLafExceptInPain
[1:05:04] ms_crafty_: run one and get 10 cakes to see what the crate looks like?
[1:05:04] z_e_ns: fun to watch fo sure
[1:05:05] Zinoba: EEEESKALL loved the update video! Big excite
[1:05:05] thiccmilkguy: Make seal available through chests not craftable but don't change it AT ALL
[1:05:05] TheImmortaldonut: Try some more, v you may have had an omega good vault
[1:05:05] saaaitam: A survival mode kind of
[1:05:06] aaka41: Yeah it seems normal but op
[1:05:07] trashgamer300: Think the new cake vaults are perfect now
[1:05:07] acg94: maybe add guaranteed artifact after like 50 cakes?>
[1:05:08] bobsens3: @iskall85 jade isnt working do you know why?
[1:05:08] YawNeon: Wings trinket makes it easy
[1:05:09] LsVxPagie: my wifi went out, did you get that in 1 vault?
[1:05:09] lordsfave: you should make challenge rooms that dont have chests
[1:05:11] XentoR2621: make it that the cake in the last room gets removed so if you go in to the next room and greed too much and cant find it you fail
[1:05:13] shrub_fluff: Do the cake vaults scale via level?
[1:05:13] ZenoPlague: I would say about a 10-15% nerf at most, seems very fun,chest growth might be too much
[1:05:14] thereal4thewin: library also didnt help with making balancing decisions
[1:05:15] DanMetroArnold: I mean... compared to what it was, it's an improvement.  I think the Linear scaling needs a bit more of an improvement (or could be scaled back up based on the number of players in the Vault)
[1:05:15] gaymersalsa: @lifeblade789 not a bad point
[1:05:18] jessmay121_: another cake vault to test...?
[1:05:18] Nightbot: Twitch Tiers 2 & 3 subs & Patreons Diamond level & above can now sign up to play on the Vault Hunters servers. Join iskall's Discord at  discord.gg/iskall85 & sign up https://vaulthunters.gg/server-status Patreon https://www.patreon.com/iskall85
[1:05:22] MunchNL: maybe everything needs to scale a bit slower so also the mobs so you will try to get more cakes
[1:05:22] DragolicSoul: @iskall85 test run 2
[1:05:23] Zinoba: Hey balsa
[1:05:24] Tavrog: i mean, in the chaos vault you looted 500+ chests
[1:05:25] jonathan_2119: maybe nerf challenge rooms because now you run until you found it and the looted
[1:05:25] JashinFanatic: that's true
[1:05:26] gaymersalsa: ZINOBA
[1:05:27] urban_beach: hard to balance after one run
[1:05:27] minipax84: can we try annother?
[1:05:28] jenn_jennnn: you should do more cake vaults
[1:05:29] alpinepanda: if it was more expansive to get in a cake vault the reward would be fitting
[1:05:30] momaggie1273: Soo much vault gear, lol
[1:05:31] aaka41: One more cake vault
[1:05:31] Lady_Moonshadow: another one
[1:05:33] thiccmilkguy: Don't make seal craftable
[1:05:34] minipax84: woop!
[1:05:36] dafzwilliams1: I suppose because it's a cake vault you don't loot as much? So a heavy crate is nice
[1:05:36] pixelcrack_: who needs to craft gear just mine ornate on 40 cakes EZ
[1:05:37] lordeclipse01: yaya
[1:05:38] jessmay121_: yayyy again!!
[1:05:38] pendelluft: I guess you just have to do another cake vault ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[1:05:38] ShapNine: Yeaaa
[1:05:38] Masuary: !release
[1:05:39] Nightbot: Vault Hunters update 13 is live on the Hermitcraft Vault Hunters server for testing! Public release will likely be out on Sunday the 14th. Check out iskall's video on the changes: https://youtu.be/CrAUh0SOGY0?si=Qw4iZq7S3-Kis9sv
[1:05:39] autumspog: pay the gamba :)
[1:05:40] Ferdster02: @Tavrog very good poiunt
[1:05:41] dcptcncrescendo: @lifeblade789 agreed!
[1:05:44] Miss_Didi: @iskall85 Is it not redundant to have the cake at the top middle of the screen showing how many you have collected, and it also to show how many cake layers in the bottom right hand corner?
[1:05:44] sleepysalp89: one more gamba
[1:05:44] EnslavedMoist: does the vendor expertise also apply to the new vendoors?
[1:05:47] Morno_: See what the crate looks like with just one cake
[1:05:47] redknightks: It would have been bad if you found that room in the begining.  And had to spend a lot of time finding the cake.
[1:05:48] ihcmoonie: I am looking forward to the new cake vaults niw
[1:05:48] antegravity: Exploit it while it's OP
[1:05:57] flintmaster25: also you got an artifact in both the update video and this stream
[1:05:57] z_e_ns: suuuuper funn
[1:05:58] Zaraca90: Bring Etho into a cake vault
[1:05:59] ItzElixsis: Can you try and avoid looting and go after number of cakes for next run?
[1:05:59] Inq_EretaH: iskall getting the good stuff and then nerfing cake vaults right after, I see
[1:06:02] TSE_Berndy: having a pedestal ever 5 cakes and making a decision of completing or taking the risk and keep going would be fun i think
[1:06:02] flintmaster25: so it is 2 for 2
[1:06:04] mpastor_25: can we see a 1 cake crate as a testing metric?
[1:06:04] moriahberry14: looks like lots of fun!!!
[1:06:06] jametrics: How small is the loot in a level 1 cake completion?
[1:06:08] e_shailee: it should prob start with fewer chests than normal, than increase in same rate. So that it takes you more cakes to get the rewards
[1:06:11] Hyweed_: the old cake felt empty tbh, it was just going for a high nunmber for records
[1:06:11] NakeZast: yup
[1:06:14] gaymersalsa: agreer
[1:06:14] nomadshelp: yup
[1:06:14] eonzcarr: Yh
[1:06:15] alpinepanda: yes
[1:06:15] shrub_fluff: Do the cake vaults scale with your level?
[1:06:16] pixelcrack_: yep
[1:06:16] Kieonas: nodders
[1:06:17] lordmobius13: Yea
[1:06:17] HazDS: #Nerfskall iskHeart
[1:06:17] graegrove: very fun
[1:06:17] asimithehero: Yep, the growing chest feels great
[1:06:17] pb_b: agree
[1:06:19] antegravity: fr
[1:06:19] jessmay121_: yeah definately
[1:06:19] DertyFerd: What?!? Cake vaults changed?
[1:06:20] PalladiumBc: Yes

[1:06:23] SuiteSunrise: i understand the point. the visual indication is great
[1:06:25] Pflanzer1987: oh yeah, definitely looks more fun the further you go
[1:06:26] CyberGeiger: yes, love the spreading chests
[1:06:29] TheRedBrain: the visual indication feels amazing
[1:06:29] autumspog: Should the rooms start with no chests?
[1:06:29] lordsfave: yeah, i think its not even that much bette but it seems a lot better
[1:06:29] Heyitskyle93: cant wat to run  a cake vault
[1:06:30] ItzElixsis: Visually seeing the vault get better is satisfying
[1:06:30] cheesebutt2302: you could spawn more movs
[1:06:35] biglez936: cake vaults need to be buffed
[1:06:36] thiccmilkguy: How would Making seal uncraftable be

[1:06:47] antegravity: @Ferdster02 Ye ye it's just a joke
[1:06:53] Plaeymaker: you could also cap the amount of chest after like 50 cakes
[1:06:53] notTheRealHelmis: wild magmatic piglins hryGappa
[1:06:56] momaggie1273: Ngl, with how fast the cake vault becomes op, I feel like having a small chance for an omega curse wouldn't be too bad

[1:07:01] Glacial__7: guessing you're gonna be doing scavs with etho later
[1:07:05] Ferdster02: @antegravity ah okay, you never know
[1:07:11] autumspog: If the first 3 rooms had like 1 chest at each POI it might scale the overal cake experience better? that was there is less loot at the start to drive you further into the vault
[1:07:12] Croseven: it feels rewarding get more cakes opposed to before where it felt like you got punished for being greedy
[1:07:12] TheLifeofL: Try and just go for cakes and get as many as possible and also just try a low amount of cakes to try and compare and see where it all sits in comparison?

[1:08:09] tito_me_doe: @iskall85 I disagree with you. I think the loot and chests is perfect, but the mobs should start super weak and get stronger faster, so that at 50 cakes, the typical mob takes 10+ hearts against the average-built player
[1:08:15] lifeblade789: make cake seal recipe more expensive so that cake vaults are as rare as an actual dessert irl PogChamp

[1:15:47] MrHaloBoy: any plan to make the forge and other Vault hunters tables insertable via hopper and so on
[1:15:51] superpig2007: hi @iskall85 i have a qeastion what do you think about adding a sidegrade to the javelin that make the cooldown longer but if you hit a mob the cooldown will be shorter and it will cost less mana(only  the next shot)
[1:15:54] Miss_Didi: @jenn_jennnn yes it shows different values, but realistically, you're getting the same information in two places. Removing the top middle one or having the cake layers in the top middle, only one is necessary to gain both values
[1:15:54] thiccmilkguy: Nooo i couldn't gamba
[1:15:57] Oynx_d7: Don't you need a item in your inventory for junk management

[1:17:41] gaymersalsa: @RavingHazard L L LL mobile
[1:17:43] nib__rl: You can easily afford a new PC. Ot would also be a business expense legally. Why do you not want to huy one??
[1:17:47] mahik750: @bobsens37 Moderately, but if you have a not-so-beefy one, you can try skyvaults. Those are much lighter on your pc
[1:17:49] 999nightmare999: wait THE CAKE VAULTS ARE CHANGING!?

[1:18:09] gaymersalsa: @bobsens37 ^^ if you can run vanilla 1.18, your pc will easily handle skyvaults at least
[1:18:09] aaka41: Maybe check inside those folded chests?
[1:18:10] lorcan_oilcan: how do the new soul flames work with co-op vaults?

[1:19:25] redknightks: I don't see much point looting in the first 10-20 rooms
[1:19:32] xedre11: Do the first rooms have lower mob difficulty and chest quantity?

[1:20:45] HamswordJr: @meena4578 Amazon is taking over
[1:20:53] gaymersalsa: venDoor

[1:25:56] sodapop_megatron: did you update the cake vault? CoolCat
[1:26:04] RMZing: Perhaps we should have the cake vault shape state whether it's a spiral or an antispiral
[1:26:10] gaymersalsa: @sodapop_megatron yes 😯
[1:26:11] fiterace: iskCOOL
[1:26:11] erinlynn82: yea I doubted this time smart 😂
[1:26:14] Matkimble: I had no idea cake vaults were changing. ;)
[1:26:17] sodapop_megatron: :o
[1:26:26] HamswordJr: what about a chance to get an “icing layer” gives bonus loot without making the mobs harder.
[1:26:28] loufo_21: Cake vault changed no way
[1:26:29] vikingismade: When the compass points to the right when you exit the room, if it is the correct way.

[1:27:05] Miss_Didi: @jenn_jennnn watching this run, do you feel as though both is redundant?
[1:27:05] RMZing: I think the last vault was spiral left, but this one is spiral right
[1:27:12] marvelprincess2000: iskHeart iskEnergy iskHeart
[1:27:17] gaymersalsa: @bobsens37 talent? heal or vein mine. the quest line recommends heal for vaults

[1:28:24] xDreerer: what does "Cake Layer" do?
[1:28:27] DanMetroArnold: I'm feeling really good about my GAMBA chances rn...
[1:28:28] Heyitskyle93: do treasure chest scale with cake layers??
[1:28:31] gaymersalsa: @muttpacket hryAdmire
[1:28:36] terpps_: Feel like you target certain loot/chests and just loot as you find those POIs
[1:28:36] Kasszi_: true
[1:28:38] lorcan_oilcan: do cake ;layers effect ores ?

[1:28:46] 999nightmare999: But profit makes fun funner you see
[1:28:47] ash_tronaut616: @xdreerer everything
[1:28:48] gaymersalsa: @Heyitskyle93 treasure chests dont scale with modifiers

[1:28:56] HazDS: I enjoyed the fun of the old cakes, but looking forward to trying the changes with extra loots.
[1:29:01] gaymersalsa: @CoconutTiim no dont thinkso
[1:29:01] thiccmilkguy: Make the seal only obtainable through chests only. Right now it is FUN and really GOOD
[1:29:13] ArzoAvex: isn’t there like a hunter perk that lets you see cakes??
[1:29:16] 999nightmare999: Exaaactly
[1:29:18] omkaarr: does the modifiers affect ores?

[1:29:22] EpicEgon: 40 cakes? Sadge
[1:29:23] JashinFanatic: yeah, I'd limit access to the seal, either from chests or more expensive like DP
[1:29:28] gaymersalsa: @ArzoAvex nope. only objective hunter, sees the pedestals (and god altars)
[1:29:29] xkraiix: Hello iskallman

[1:29:35] freddyb8: Can't wait to see you run a cake vault with etho!!
[1:29:38] mahik750: Yeah, but I think it is also important to feel like you earned the reward. Otherwise it can feel empty
[1:29:42] snapiihoob: what are those cake layers thingys btw?
[1:29:42] Matias429: I'm so hyped to try out all the new features in u13 <3

[1:29:54] HamswordJr: every time he loots I feel better about my gamba
[1:29:55] GhoulHunter811: which type of vault was hardest to develop? type as in monolith scav etc?
[1:29:58] JashinFanatic: @iskall85 can you make a cake vault chaos?

[1:30:07] avian946: ew
[1:30:10] gaymersalsa: avian ?

[1:30:26] dia__hi: Good idea

[1:30:33] lord_windgrace_: noo stop looting I gambled on you winning :(
[1:30:34] sivzzz: and that vendors are not scaled
[1:30:42] silentkiller___: a trophy with how many cakes collected would be nice
[1:30:49] ash_tronaut616: Now you are same speed as etho

[1:30:55] mikr0wav3: is the skill step still a thing?
[1:30:56] gaymersalsa: my cchault PepeHands (cake chaos vault)
[1:31:01] mefallit: Cheer1000 About update 13, I liked the braziers idea. Because people can pick negatives and positives. Yes i know people like gamba but i prefer to be able to choose. About ven-door (your pun.. not mine)  I kinda feel like after update 12, everything become gold-related which makes me thoughtful. I was loving to get omega rooms
[1:31:05] bobsens3: @iskall85 does it take a beefy pc to run vault hunters?
[1:31:07] aaka41: Not enough
[1:31:10] da1dman: ooh, pylon now says in chat, nice usablility upgrade
[1:31:14] gaymersalsa: @mefallit its ZINOBA's pun mind you!!

[1:31:29] mefallit: @gaymersalsa oh really?
[1:31:30] forelini: oh is the chat saying what pylon you used a new feature?
[1:31:30] bestbla: 40 Prayge
[1:31:33] CyberGeiger: is plentiful a part of cake modifiers?
[1:31:34] KaysoCheese123s: Heya everyone, hope you're doing well! Quick question, how is Iskall doing Elytra things without having that equipped? Is that a trinket or something? Thank you!
[1:31:39] gaymersalsa: @bobsens37 not really, 8gb ram is important, and if you can run 1.18 vanilla you can run at least skyvaults
[1:31:42] mitsuki1678: Dont loot iskall get more cakes
[1:31:44] shrub_fluff: Why ornate must have lava tho?
[1:31:45] sn1p3r_77: now what if you could scav seal a cake vault and see if you can complete by expanding the vault
[1:31:49] erinlynn82: wait are ores buffed to with each cake? wasn’t mentioned?
[1:31:49] Danymaddox: @KaysoCheese123s trinki yeah
[1:31:50] GhoulHunter811: have the normal dungeons been completely remove?
[1:31:50] ShelobsLair_: @KaysoCheese123s Wings trinket
[1:31:51] gaymersalsa: @KaysoCheese123s yeah wings trinket! allows a chest plate gear piece
[1:31:54] vikingismade: you can tell by the compass where you have to head without going back
[1:31:54] vhblast: it fun with more chests so how about lowering or removing item quant/rarity
[1:31:54] lorcan_oilcan: cant decide whether soulflame or cakes will be better for loot maxing
[1:31:57] forelini: @kaysocheese123s wings trinket
[1:31:59] bobsens3: @nomadshelp ok and do you know what i should go for first on my new world?
[1:32:05] lorcan_oilcan: @KaysoCheese123s its the wings trinket
[1:32:05] viquidraws: <3 <3
[1:32:07] tragicaltrain11: leave it as it is
[1:32:08] clairebearstare: @bobsens37 mine's pretty old and terrible and mostly does okay - but i did remove every other game first
[1:32:09] beastmode1694: Was that a chest in the ore?
[1:32:13] JashinFanatic: oh god
[1:32:13] aaka41: Maybe half percent atleast
[1:32:14] HamswordJr: does it add item quantity?
[1:32:15] sivzzz: yeah, I think thats too much scaling
[1:32:17] KaysoCheese123s: @Danymaddox @ShelobsLair_ @gaymersalsa @forelini @lorcan_oilcan Awesome, thank you so much <3
[1:32:22] CyberGeiger: no increased ores in cake vaults?
[1:32:29] SuiteSunrise: I think removing rarity is fair.
[1:32:31] aaka41: No runn
[1:32:34] bananajake722: or maybe not an whole percentage?
[1:32:41] snapiihoob: hey iskall i remeber watching your steram a while ago and i heard you taling about how you play/played diablo, and i wondered have you ever played path of exile?
[1:32:42] aaka41: Time
[1:32:45] gaymersalsa: @KaysoCheese123s hryAdmire have fun! theres a list of optimisation mods on the VH discord as well which are really helpful for beefier pc's as well
[1:32:47] gaymersalsa: !vhdiscord
[1:32:47] Nightbot: VaultHunter Discord: https://discord.gg/vaulthunters
[1:32:48] mohammad_alsalman: Will iskall get 40 cake or he will start greed again 🤣🤣🤣
[1:32:52] yurguth: I think altars should be removed from cakes too. increased mobs and chests make those a bit easy perhaps?
[1:32:52] danelix: Spider durability kek
[1:32:54] RMZing: Well I'll be. Chunky spiders.
[1:32:58] aaka41: Gg
[1:33:00] Karrbs: Or maybe just a quarter percent increase for every 5 layers or something?
[1:33:05] No0neAtAll: Does more cakes also spawn more ore in their poi's or just chests?
[1:33:06] braed_man_walking: GG
[1:33:06] GhoulHunter811: and he wanted to add crit hit with so many hard spiders!

[1:33:17] noxe_jkl: How is the code done on the added chests
[1:33:18] ThatNashi: removing a rarity buff would be a good call, since the sheer numbers already technically make your loot better
[1:33:18] ayla_or_something: @mohammad_alsalman he won’t be getting 40 either way, there’s nowhere near enough time
[1:33:22] crazyshezy: with cake vault+ choas vaults.. + divine paradox vaults .. is it time to retire catalyst crafting
[1:33:23] gaymersalsa: @No0neAtAll i think cake layers add a bit of plentiful-like modifier yea
[1:33:24] bashleyyyyy: DinoDance
[1:33:28] gaymersalsa: OOOO
[1:33:30] CKM32: Juicy
[1:33:31] aakashwani_: wait arent the cake vault over powered , you can just rush to a higher cake layer without the risk of not finding a cake return thingy
[1:33:31] ms_crafty_: of course
[1:33:32] gaymersalsa: dibs on trinket
[1:33:34] tornado82_: OOOO

[1:34:03] RMZing: Test with crit chance first before tweaking the mob scaling
[1:34:03] valentino598: are you testing upate 13 ?
[1:34:05] chezzmcmeat5: iskall are you using a soul flame
[1:34:09] CedH1: Also aren't you play on normal on HC ?
[1:34:09] jatt_desi: lust lost 20k points
[1:34:11] Acide_cap: Ever hear of the mountain Lion as  a house cat
[1:34:12] HamswordJr: how much do you think the crits are gonna change the difficulty?
[1:34:14] mefallit: ofcourse
[1:34:17] lorcan_oilcan: @chezzmcmeat5 no he is running cake seals
[1:34:19] Tavrog: maybe make the cake seal more expensive?
[1:34:23] StandaSK: the amount of chests seems kind of low to me
[1:34:25] mohammad_alsalman: @ayla_or_something  just looking at him faming and ignore the challenge 🤣🤣
[1:34:25] ayla_or_something: is there item quantity scaling or is just chest propagation?
[1:34:26] Edetnak: I liked the 0.5% item rarity per cake stack idea that someone mentioned
[1:34:28] Acide_cap: Ever hear of the mountain Lion as a house cat, his name is messi
[1:34:28] mefallit: every time.. i am here you got xmark room.. every time
[1:34:29] gaymersalsa: @gaymersalsa so true. playing VH while watching someone play it as well is incredibly cosy :,)
[1:34:31] Danymaddox: sir you are a pro playing normal, dont think this needs more dificulty hahaha
[1:34:34] 999nightmare999: Can cakes be soul flamed?
[1:34:34] ArzoAvex: OMG rumors are true, cake vaults are changing

[1:35:03] Buggyhoser: is this the cake change that etho is so excited about?
[1:35:07] lordsfave: should also add champion chance
[1:35:07] Miss_Didi: I would have stopped for those too
[1:35:11] Thomlennix: I love that the players has the question, to cake or to loot!
[1:35:12] Ferdster02: getting a resistance champion now would be killing
[1:35:13] brotherj1554: @iskall85 Have you ever considered an outside code review on the random generation? With the wutax special and Etho's treasure chests, an outside review may put the team's mind at ease
[1:35:13] HamswordJr: @kaysocheese123s It’s funny I’ve been the other way around, watching the development of this for a few years and only able to play the game recently

[1:36:35] flintmaster25: Make a vault without mana regen
[1:36:36] JashinFanatic: add champion's abode
[1:36:36] Kasszi_: never listen to salsa
[1:36:39] RMZing: Decrease the player speed
[1:36:39] gaymersalsa: (i diodnt listen to what he said)
[1:36:41] SuiteSunrise: i hate it.
[1:36:42] tre_2018: we're not allowed to have nice things are we?
[1:36:43] gaymersalsa: do it :D !
[1:36:45] blackwidowdps: unmod gaymersalsa
[1:36:47] danelix: Fat modifier, you move slower
[1:36:48] gaymersalsa: JHSKJFHJ
[1:36:50] clairebearstare: iskall some of us are bad at the game we need our comfort zone
[1:36:50] jenn_jennnn: i think that most people would hate it if you messed with their stats
[1:36:53] StrangePanthers: Would be interesting for sure
[1:36:53] Ribery931: its a cake vault not a poisonous mushroom vault
[1:36:54] stary_kartofel: 1% to add fading with each cake :tf:
[1:37:02] Acide_cap: Iskall: How about i give my players debufs so they die qukcer
[1:37:03] RavingHazard: @gaymersalsa Ah thats why my pun didnt show up LUL
[1:37:05] mahik750: @RMZing yeah, because the player is getting heavy from all the cake they ate :D
[1:37:10] xDreerer: Are there more Pedistals with the new update?
[1:37:13] Nightbot: Watch iskall85’s VOD’s at https://youtube.com/@vodskall85
[1:37:15] vhblast: after every 10 or so cakes they can have a random buff like poison
[1:37:17] ArzoAvex: KIWI CAKE and RUN
[1:37:17] 999nightmare999: Champion's abode is definitely a huge positive
[1:37:20] Kasszi_: champs abode would be hectic evil later
[1:37:20] faddybaddy: Half of your prefixes have no effect :tf:
[1:37:21] fit_solution04: That would simply be annoying
[1:37:22] Jbslim: add champ abode, it's a pog grind :)
[1:37:24] lexiewren123: hello Iskall and Dylan’s
[1:37:25] DanMetroArnold: @stary_kartofel iskTroll
[1:37:29] gaymersalsa: @lexiewren123 o/
[1:37:30] nomadshelp: like at 40 cakes its fully champions abode modifier level'
[1:37:31] lord_windgrace_: is it possible to get 100% cooldown reduction?
[1:37:31] superawesomeperson21: lol almost just died #drivinginsnow
[1:37:38] bailey_watches_twitch: cake champions that don’t drop gear?
[1:37:40] Matkimble: More Champions makes cence, better loot the harder it gets.
[1:37:46] bestbla: why do i believe he's too greedy to get 40 Sadge
[1:37:47] gaymersalsa: @superawesomeperson21 monkaS you better not be watching and driving
[1:37:48] notTheRealHelmis: @superawesomeperson21 glad you’re ok
[1:37:51] mort678: Were you a software engineer before doing youtube/twitch full time? What language is vault hunters written in, Java?
[1:37:52] 999nightmare999: I once got an omega focus and a trinket in a single room from champion's abode vault
[1:37:54] Pitakos: make good or bad cakes that add or remove time on the vault Kappa
[1:37:58] blackwidowdps: you spend a lot of time looking for cakes tho
[1:37:59] SuiteSunrise: 27 cakes is a realistic top score for a player like me
[1:38:02] magdaluo66: no it fint
[1:38:02] Oynx_d7: Does it do anything to treasure doors in them
[1:38:04] Lizerdman87: with 4 minutes left there should be a lot of chests I feel
[1:38:06] notTheRealHelmis: @gaymersalsa two types of people
[1:38:09] LLC_Hamumu: i feel like these chest values should be at around 35 cakes maybe?
[1:38:10] lordsfave: i think its good because you have to choose either loot or finish the crake, maybe theyre should be a jump before 40 t0 40
[1:38:12] asimithehero: Too many chests? Who are you and what have you done to greedskall?
[1:38:13] Nightbot: To add your alias to VHSMP-- Go to the official VH Discord https://discord.gg/vaulthunters  & add in the alias-request channel found in the VHSMP Category.  shorturl.at/ekxLX
[1:38:17] Hydromail: I think if you feel like looting when you have 10mins left, it's good.
[1:38:19] SuiteSunrise: actually more like 20
[1:38:26] RELENtLESS_55: @mort678 minecraft is all java I think
[1:38:26] zeus_o9o2: i heard theyre changing cake vault in next update Kappa Kappa
[1:38:28] sp0rsk: this is to make up for all the stuff you skipped, if anything i think you could tune it to be a little faster
[1:38:35] bshugks: Ha
[1:38:36] puffin989: I'm scared to see what a 50 cake room would look like
[1:38:36] mirohtomysoul: I think this is quite good chest wise, considering there's many players that don't run as fast as you
[1:38:38] ThrowTheCats: Seems like wooden chests grow way mpre than others
[1:38:41] erinlynn82: oof lol
[1:38:42] redstonedad: Classic
[1:38:42] xDreerer: Vendoor
[1:38:49] gaymersalsa: @mort678 he was an international businessman of doom (direct quote) with a passion for making games before starting on making mods and eventually, VH. the language idk about, but some of it is java ye
[1:38:50] HamswordJr: @asimithehero this is DevSkall, very different person
[1:38:51] RMZing: The vault knows
[1:39:02] erinlynn82: welp at least u can leave
[1:39:07] Slim_Shaded: Slim_Shaded subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 5 months! 
[1:39:08] zeus_o9o2: im so exicted it is scary
[1:39:09] pixelcrack_: excited and scary
[1:39:14] Plaeymaker: floor are chests
[1:39:14] FreudPlays: Please remove the champion one!
[1:39:17] aaka41: Instead of mob crit hit, add champions? 0.5% every layer
[1:39:19] OneTrueSpry: Pretty upset that I didn't get a notification that he was online. But seen the new video of updates. Happy to see it come into play soon..
[1:39:20] Thomlennix: in a level 50 cake, there will be to few blocks in the chest rooms
[1:39:21] jagare_1: jagare_1 subscribed with Prime. 
[1:39:23] mahik750: ores feel unchanged imho
[1:39:23] miraculousmultifan: yeah ores look good
[1:39:24] CyberGeiger: maybe don’t scale linear?
[1:39:26] Acide_cap: JUST VAINMAINGIN EVERY THING AT 50 CAKES
[1:39:26] SuiteSunrise: i think this is better. it starts to look good around 10-15
[1:39:27] YouWillHateMeXP: Every ten levels, a "locked in" miniboss fight?
[1:39:27] notTheRealHelmis: i think extra champions would fit the vibe of “more”
[1:39:30] m0nkej: maybe you could add champions abode at like 20-25 cakes or smthng
[1:39:31] gaymersalsa: BELIEVERS....
[1:39:31] 999nightmare999: Ores seem a little underwhelming tbh
[1:39:33] lorcan_oilcan: i think the chests are scaling well but the mobs might need a boost maybe with crit chance/damage
[1:39:36] blackwidowdps: @mahik750 what LUL
[1:39:37] VoidMoros: how many cakes would you need to only get ores
[1:39:43] erinlynn82: ok ores do scale eterna310Notes
[1:39:44] mitsuki1678: maybe if you decrease the rate of chest increase as no.of cakes increase
[1:39:45] gaymersalsa: oh that coin scaling to the stairs kekw
[1:39:46] danelix: Maybe add wild level every 5/10 layers?
[1:39:51] thepolkyman: May Wendar bless your cakes
[1:39:54] shrub_fluff: Iskall why does ornate chests usually have lava? Why lava? :c
[1:39:57] zeus_o9o2: i wanna see a 50 cake mushroom room please LUL LUL
[1:39:58] gaymersalsa: 5min pylon iskCheck
[1:39:58] rhometheus: important to remember not everyone is a 40-cake champion
[1:39:58] DanMetroArnold: Believers in full on Monka Mode rn monkaS monkaS monkaS
[1:40:00] CyberGeiger: scale more in the beginning and less later?
[1:40:01] crazyshezy: instead of champions abode.. why not create an uber modifier called lost champions..  these champions dont drop anything but drop extra soul shards
[1:40:01] Niko_993: as a skill issue player, i think i will probably start looting after 18 cakes
[1:40:04] thiccmilkguy: Rip all the believers
[1:40:06] ithillion55: Overflowing!
[1:40:06] Jbslim: Coin scaling! :)
[1:40:08] CKM32: UR TOOL DURA IS SO LOW BECreful
[1:40:09] redzero1300: this is where a machete is a bad idea
[1:40:09] mahik750: @blackwidowdps to be fair, now that I think about it, I have been running a lot of plunderers vault that have increased ores. So maybe it is my perception that is skewed xD
[1:40:12] Meena4578: is it an exponential difficulty progression?
[1:40:13] moriquendi197: I will love to see you and Barry or Etho run one of these together.

[1:41:01] gaymersalsa: and crit hit PepeiskallDoingaGaslight
[1:41:01] erinlynn82: I think adding a crit hit or more damage could be ok
[1:41:02] zeus_o9o2: yeah considering your armour isnt that good
[1:41:03] shrub_fluff: Tankier mobs
[1:41:03] Therank2100: somewhere in the middle would be good
[1:41:04] vhblast: and more mobs
[1:41:04] lorcan_oilcan: yeah mobs should be scarier to balance out the risk
[1:41:04] costalboy: !stress

[1:41:07] asimithehero: Speed feels thematic for cake vault

[1:41:12] Nightbot: For everything Vault Hunters, check out the website! https://vaulthunters.gg/
[1:41:12] gaymersalsa: @zebrainap ofcourse. trinket scrap tho kekw
[1:41:13] RMZing: Do the crit thing first before buffing damage
[1:41:16] thiccmilkguy: If you reduce chest it wouldn't be a cake vault
[1:41:21] redzero1300: time
[1:41:26] gaymersalsa: YES........
[1:41:26] zeus_o9o2: anvil goes bonl

[1:41:32] Hyweed_: yeah... you've been looting for 2 min
[1:41:33] lordsfave: you should make it jump tiers to get to 40 so that you have the option to loot or finish
[1:41:33] thepolkyman: 2 minutes ago yeah
[1:41:34] candidcrafter: Co op might be OP

[1:42:14] zeus_o9o2: wait we greeding ?
[1:42:15] TheHoffmanSpot: the chests need to be upped more and a the full crake should be at 30, not 40
[1:42:16] gaymersalsa: @amine1ha how could you say something like that bro
[1:42:22] notanirudh: what's a cake layer do ?
[1:42:23] Kasszi_: MrIskallShouldLeaveTheVaultButDieBecauseOfABitOfGreeding
[1:42:24] OneTrueSpry: Since you upgraded it is it better to start looting at 5 minutes left or better to go hunting until the very last minute? And just focus on rewards from crake
[1:42:27] Zeldok_: You got lemons, dont eat just kiwis
[1:42:27] gaymersalsa: @zeus_o9o2 this should not be surprising hryLaf
[1:42:28] aaka41: I think iskall will die while greeding in cake vaults

[1:46:02] braed_man_walking: Has the recipe for the cake seal changed at all?
[1:46:03] crmsn_: Loving that rainbow glass centerpiece in the floor. Really ties the room together! iskHeart
[1:46:04] kibaz_x: What if later in the vault they can spawn with modifiers without being champions?
[1:46:05] HamswordJr: what about a chance to get an “icing layer” gives bonus loot without making the mobs harder. but add non-linear scaling, like maybe every ten levels mob damage jumps up a bit
[1:46:07] Crazedmonkey406: Crazedmonkey406 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 11 months! wow looks like cake vaults got an update. what a fun surprise

[1:46:50] AustenFuego: @calypytter same for me, I am bad, but the game is fun
[1:46:53] YouWillHateMeXP: Lock a player in a room at 10 cakes, take a mob from say 20 levels ahead and force the players to battle them. Slows people down

[2:05:39] LaplaceDemon2k: @BlazeSpaceRl unfortunately it was a meme and we didn't
[2:05:42] Benayman: does the shop take away a dungeno or treasure-room spawn-chance?
[2:05:43] justalittlebacon: Just got here, what is this vault?
[2:05:44] notTheRealHelmis: would be the meta to stack buffs early on?
[2:05:45] dcptcncrescendo: how will the modifiers work in co-op?
[2:05:47] zeus_o9o2: One in every vault makes it too easy i guess
[2:05:48] Kasszi_: okay done with the dishes, now i must go to Bedge gnn

[2:06:17] Skylion62: can you get legendary modifiers from braisers
[2:06:17] gaymersalsa: i will continue being annoying about this and for that i am sorry hryLaf
[2:06:19] gaymersalsa: (not)
[2:06:19] rektarina1594: @CrunchyZedman you can only have 8 buffs *the amount of braziers)
[2:06:20] terpps_: Not super rare but they are a bit too common imo. Just a bit

[2:06:33] gaymersalsa: @GrimBirb monolith revamped a bit!
[2:06:37] thiccmilkguy: Thank you iskall for vendoors
[2:06:40] Kasszi_: @mefallit can you leddit to get us fizzle spawners in village rooms?
[2:06:40] mahik750: Do the vendoors replace dungeon and treasure doors in the room, decreasing the chance of those appearing? Or unrelated?
[2:06:41] dragon_scaled1249: just joined!!!
[2:06:45] GrimBirb: @gaymersalsa Oooh, how does this work now?
[2:06:47] RMZing: Cheer250 Iskall has opened Vendora's Box
[2:06:47] fallinitbh: does this objective replace monolith?
[2:06:48] Meena4578: it’s great having that many
[2:06:52] gaymersalsa: @fallinitbh yes
[2:06:53] ash_tronaut616: O
[2:06:56] CoconutTiim: I personally like stuff being rare makes it much more exciting for me personally
[2:06:57] pg_109: does anything happens to coin piles with item quantity?
[2:06:58] mefallit: @Kasszi_ if he ever read/listen yes
[2:07:07] gaymersalsa: @gaymersalsa im making a command to explain it. the update video he uploaded explains it as well

[2:07:30] MahSpoogies: Does anyone know if you can recover an item accidentally put into the trash can?
[2:07:31] spexley: Are the mobs getting harder every time you select one?
[2:07:34] zeus_o9o2: Mana goes brrrrr
[2:07:38] kibaz_x: They don't give negatives?
[2:07:39] fallinitbh: @gaymersalsa nice
[2:07:47] zeus_o9o2: Oldskall
[2:07:47] da_hyun0615: Is pillaging affected by item quant and rarity?
[2:07:57] fursten001: i feel the same. More doors gives you a choise if your gonna buy smth och save and perhaps find something better in the next one. If the doors are too rare i feel like i have to buy so i dont miss out on loot
[2:08:00] PadWar354: This update is awesome iskall and team!
[2:08:01] dia__hi: Something like copiously for coins
[2:08:04] OneTrueSpry: What is min and max for number of braizures you can get given to hunt
[2:08:10] miraculousmultifan: @MahSpoogies unfortunately, no. i think it just voids the item...

[2:08:41] pg_109: yahhh. with that idea i am part of VH
[2:08:47] SuiteSunrise: that was my thought. if it happens, should be higher level

[2:08:53] pb_b: doesnt make sense to me
[2:08:54] Megaking202: will it give better crate if they do?

[2:08:58] miraculousmultifan: @MahSpoogies OH NOOOOO
[2:09:00] BingOyuncu: Why not make ut something difficulty spesific?
[2:09:00] kibaz_x: Bring your son to work day
[2:09:01] Benayman: @iskall85 door positions of vendoors, treasures and dungeons seem related. what get's priority for spawn check?
[2:09:03] e_shailee: maybe mae it based on difficulty and not level?
[2:09:03] asimithehero: D: Iskall killed a whole family
[2:09:04] Wiroe_: why would anyone pick the negatives then?
[2:09:05] CoconutTiim: that is a pretty clean change @p3pp3rf1y

[2:09:22] DanMetroArnold: Vault wants Iskall Zoomies LUL
[2:09:25] LaplaceDemon2k: what is the rarity difference between different modifiers on braziers?
[2:09:27] SuiteSunrise: @Wiroe_ they're all both a positive and negative
[2:09:31] HamswordJr: I think it would add more to the choice to take them or leave them
[2:09:31] theachup: what do you think is the best change you’ve made since the beginning of 3rd edition?
[2:09:31] advcky: poor braziers they get burned then torn apart
[2:09:45] Mooseberg_: just got here, what's the objective?
[2:09:51] tornado82_: WHAT
[2:09:53] gamingwithtoimen: braziers
[2:09:58] mahik750: Hmm, not a fan yet of this objective, seems too easy.

[2:10:23] bodin____: How long does these buffs last?
[2:10:23] TobyButt89: Positive only before level 20, some positive and some negative level 20-40, some only positive, some only negative, and some oth positive and negative level 40+
[2:10:24] Tazzad: So after you got 8/8, there is no chance to get stuff like hoard?
[2:10:29] GrimBirb: Oooh, I see- so they're basically like monoliths but each "podium  thingy" changes the vault in a way?
[2:10:31] braed_man_walking: Fragged, double positive double negative
[2:10:31] pb_b: rampage all vault
[2:10:33] P3pp3rF1y: what was that I should be asked about?
[2:10:37] razlack1: ooo, your FAST today
[2:10:39] zeus_o9o2: You don't need that much mana

[2:11:14] zeus_o9o2: Maybe you can do at hard it'll add one +ve and a -ve so higher risk and higher reward ???
[2:11:14] dia__hi: On hard, you get one good, one bad each time perhaps?
[2:11:14] thiccmilkguy: Only so many difficult level. There can't be in-betweens
[2:11:18] ensalys: I really like the design of the progress bar for elixir and brazier vaults
[2:11:19] CoconutTiim: will there ever be a change to crystal difficult for local change instead of server @iskall85 ?
[2:11:25] gaymersalsa: !commands add !brazier Light the Monoliths objective has been replaced with Light the Braziers in update 13. Braziers appear in every room and have a range of positive modifiers that get added once you click on them! After you acquire the required amount of Braziers, you can continue to Pillage additional Braziers for good loot at the cost of negative/cursed modifiers.
[2:11:25] Nightbot: @gaymersalsa -> The command "!brazier" has been added successfully.
[2:11:27] eijebong_: You could do the opposite and make hoard better on harder difficulties to encourage players to challenge themselves
[2:11:36] Wiroe_: weak
[2:11:36] thiccmilkguy: !braizer
[2:11:38] netseeker: why not have a chanse of a bad outcome at a certain level... so that its 10% at the begining
[2:11:41] gaymersalsa: YES
[2:11:44] pg_109: hord should be renamed as Iskalmans favor
[2:11:48] Mierrin: This is a walk out the door vault right?
[2:11:51] gaymersalsa: crystal recipes
[2:11:53] Suffix: Cant believe you don't care about Bruno.
[2:11:57] zeus_o9o2: Yeah that is impractical
[2:11:58] gaymersalsa: ummm... freud's mod did it hryFlex
[2:11:58] Tazzad: @iskall85 Is it not possible to get buffs like Hoard when you  have lit all the braziers?
[2:12:02] tragicaltrain11: +160
[2:12:05] stary_kartofel: damn
[2:12:06] GrimBirb: @gaymersalsa i love you! :D

[2:12:26] gaymersalsa: bumble timmy
[2:12:28] StanleyMcC: Cheer500 I have been loving VH and update 13 looks amazing. I am an AP player (archon and fireball). To me Fireball is the AP version of the javlin. Is it considered a such? It feels that it doesnt have as many modifiers as the javlin.
[2:12:33] gaymersalsa: @gaymersalsa hryAdmire
[2:12:36] Danymaddox: yes pls a gamerule that changes locally the crystal recipe, and please loot too
[2:12:37] Dragonfoot21: !brazier

After you acquire the required amount of Braziers, you can continue to Pillage additional Braziers for good loot at the cost of negative/cursed modifiers.
[2:12:38] GrimBirb: Can they only give positive modifiers? are there none with negative? (before you reach goal)
[2:12:39] avian946: ope Timmy is pagging

[2:12:57] andydirk88: As a server runner, the most customization I can do for my friends to give them the experience they want, the better
[2:12:58] theachup: just a question that i was curious about: what is the best change you’ve made since the release of 3rd edition?
[2:13:07] gaymersalsa: @iskall85 cake transmogs when hryLeddit
[2:13:07] Spiderwolf27: @iskall85 I'm just playing Vault Hunters, so I don't know this, but is there a synergie when you have a full set of the same armor?
[2:13:11] brentos777: I'd love that for casual mode, as my friends that I've just introduced probably need it on casual, but I really don't want to play it that way
[2:13:13] zeus_o9o2: @iskall85 at hard 1 campfire having greater +ve and -ve ( i mean 2 attributes from each campfire or something so high risk and high reward )
[2:13:16] thiccmilkguy: Poor dad and mom piglins
[2:13:19] autumspog: @StanleyMcC i would the idea of being able to customise my fireball with different abilities like the javelin
[2:13:23] Zaraca90: You do but they jump
[2:13:23] TAxels: there should be a "no baby" modifier
[2:13:24] phoenix_king_01: dont forget the god altar
[2:13:34] zeus_o9o2: He says this and if next is strength he'll still ignore them 😂
[2:13:37] mahik750: You got extra items, mana regen, speed with no countereffects by just clicking the braziers in every room. This objective seems to go against the "you are not supposed to complete every vault" idea, no?
[2:13:38] tragicaltrain11: do it
[2:13:43] MrHaloBoy: any plans on making forges and other crafting blocks insertable via hopper and so on
[2:13:44] samsam21amb: do it
[2:13:48] gaymersalsa: @Spiderwolf27 there are some hidden easter eggs from wearing certain gear sets, but no actual buffs if thats what you mean
[2:13:51] pursued__toast: why do spiders still jump and move when frozen with blizzard?
[2:13:54] zebrainap: soul shards builds are so much fun
[2:14:00] Khalin1212: sure item quant is great, but can you clear the poi mobs?  strength = item quant
[2:14:05] zebrainap: running 700% now and get like 20k each vault LOL
[2:14:08] ThaMaTTeR: Hello o/
[2:14:10] zeus_o9o2: If soulshards then should've taken strength i feel
[2:14:19] gaymersalsa: PAUSERS
[2:14:21] mastertaint: O7
[2:14:26] ThaMaTTeR: love the changes!
[2:14:30] KoldGeneration: I feel like it's really easy to complete brasier, isn't just me?
[2:14:30] gaymersalsa: additional ore spawns hryFlex
[2:14:31] noninja5: and now we pillage
[2:14:33] ThaMaTTeR: elo salsa
[2:14:37] gaymersalsa: @ThaMaTTeR o/
[2:14:40] RMZing: The bonus coins thing should really be implemented into higher difficulty dungeons, especially. Right now, coin dungeons are Normal ONLY
[2:14:41] TheCykel: LOOT GOBLIN???
[2:14:43] zeus_o9o2: New dungeons added we get the same old smaller one
[2:14:44] thepolkyman: ooooo we getting treasure goblins again?!
[2:14:44] melonhunt: oooh
[2:14:46] Danymaddox: you got my attention
[2:14:47] muttpacket: i do think that you need something to buff coins now.
[2:14:50] Sirken1138: Sirken1138 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 4 months! excited for this update.

[2:15:01] gaymersalsa: treasure goblins HOPIUM
[2:15:03] soopacooopa: @soopacoopa85 you're welcome
[2:15:03] thiccmilkguy: Kill goblin get 1 billion gold
[2:15:03] Redlaggerr: Ohh you reminded me the season 2 treasure goblins, i really loved it
[2:15:04] SYM_uk: @koldgeneration that's kinda the point
[2:15:04] VoidMoros: time to pull out another laugh for the goblins like the witch
[2:15:10] whterknite: I do have a question does it light the same brazzer if you have multiple people in a vault or is it solo on brazzers
[2:15:15] gaymersalsa: @P3pp3rF1y please say in game hryLaf
[2:15:33] gaymersalsa: ITS SO CUTE
[2:15:34] notTheRealHelmis: does VH run on linux?

[2:15:45] CedH1: Artistskall
[2:15:47] gaymersalsa: i want to frame it!!!!!
[2:15:52] csheff56: pillage!
[2:15:53] Spiderwolf27: @gaymersalsa Yeah I meant that, wouldn't need a huge buff, like just +1 health, or thematic like for the Winter Wolf armour, you have a 1% chance of spawning a winterwolf at your side when getting attacked. It then stays for maybe 10 seconds (grin, I'm obviously a wolffan ;) )
[2:15:54] gaymersalsa: OMEGALOOL
[2:15:57] noninja5: whar it was so good
[2:16:00] gaymersalsa: swampy......

[2:16:07] erinlynn82: artist skall what?! 😂
[2:16:07] bunLunaa: should pillage for the full experience
[2:16:07] toomuchinertia: new cake vault ?
[2:16:09] da_hyun0615: Is it affected by item rarity and quant?
[2:16:13] hamisharms: !brazier
[2:16:13] Nightbot: Light the Monoliths objective has been replaced with Light the Braziers in update 13. Braziers appear in every room and have a range of positive modifiers that get added once you click on them! After you acquire the required amount of Braziers, you can continue to Pillage additional Braziers for good loot at the cost of negative/cursed modifiers.
[2:16:17] Cosmic_Star123: I have 8gbs of ram on my laptop, how much should i allocate for mc for it to run as smooth as possible?
[2:16:20] SYM_uk: Saving goldskall
[2:16:21] theachup: don’t
[2:16:21] ItzElixsis: I don't like the pillage idea so far. Seems not worth it... idk
[2:16:25] Megaking202: is leaving the only way to complete?
[2:16:26] noninja5: no
[2:16:27] zeus_o9o2: I like how Vh shows how much iskall loves greeding LUL

[2:17:02] Thomlennix: adgeee

[2:17:04] thiccmilkguy: Watch him die (again)
[2:17:08] HamswordJr: noo i have 4 ads to sit through
[2:17:08] thepolkyman: greed is good

[2:17:25] gaymersalsa: @gaymersalsa that sounds cute!! but gear transmogs have always been just for looks, buffs will be from abilities. its a cool idea tho, put this on the reddits if u want to

[2:17:35] pancake_lover_333: wait what does pillage mean
[2:17:39] Travess: Does the update bring anymore clarity on how to store gems and gear without effecting performance?
[2:17:43] theachup: more adds… i will not complain because my stremmer is getting paid
[2:17:43] Frankenstain: more mobs is good for soul shards
[2:17:43] RebelliousUno: Is a baby tank 20% of a tank lol

[2:17:46] tragicaltrain11: couple of mobs
[2:17:53] gamingwithtoimen: iskall do you have poison reduction  on your armor or not
[2:17:54] zeus_o9o2: I feel like he's gonna die BibleThump
[2:18:03] Dameojin: More mobs is actually a buff cause soul shards
[2:18:03] iljalz: @zeus_o9o2 its fineeeee
[2:18:03] twornell: Pilage, or Exit to Complete makes it sound like either option completes the vault
[2:18:04] omkaarr: Are you gonna build Poison build?

[2:18:29] thepolkyman: was just about to ask if you took out the go back to altar part
[2:18:30] mossycomet: can't u use the breizures to 1st stack soul shards and then add mob count?
[2:18:34] Cosmovoli: Hallo Fine People, hallo Salsa
[2:18:39] pancake_lover_333: @gaymersalsa oh no i meant at the top it says it and was wondering if it was like a tp home
[2:18:47] tragicaltrain11: can you get an OMEGA pog in these?
[2:18:50] Hyweed_: So far only gems from pilage?
[2:18:50] ThisReallyIsMe: @iskall85 will regret potions ever be made usable in Vaults?

[2:19:06] LaplaceDemon2k: still better than Fading xD
[2:19:06] theachup: at the moment it seems like pillaging needs to be buffed a bit.
[2:19:10] Cosmovoli: @gaymersalsa because you're better
[2:19:11] ItzElixsis: Ohh could you ghost walk and just pillage constantly?
[2:19:12] notTheRealHelmis: i hear there’s a 1/70 chance for a brazier scroll
[2:19:13] RMZing: Heyo Cosmo
[2:19:14] HamswordJr: @thisreallyisme I don’t think he wants you to change your build mid vault
[2:19:14] Croseven: does pillage loot scale based on the amount of braziers that you pillage? @iskall85
[2:19:15] e_shailee: xactly lol (:
[2:19:16] gaymersalsa: @pancake_lover_333 ohhh i think you still need to exit like in monolith

[2:19:54] zeus_o9o2: Yea stats need higher num
[2:19:57] gaymersalsa: OOOO nice!!!
[2:19:58] asimithehero: Pillaging feels very dangerous to buff, its basically zero risk if you clear rooms first
[2:20:04] jackfrost9879: @iskall85 Will you ever clean up your teleporter area and actually move it to Pacific? It feels silly to constantly have to fly back and forth to it. Cheer100
[2:20:06] ItzElixsis: @zeus_o9o2  it does seem broken
[2:20:06] zeus_o9o2: Dungeon <3

[2:20:11] gamingwithtoimen: maybe more loot you only get 3 things i dont think that is enough for it tho
[2:20:11] aaka41: What loot did we get now
[2:20:12] whterknite: @iskall85 I do have a question does it light the same brazzer if you have multiple people in a vault or is it solo on brazzers
[2:20:22] 17power: The more you pillage, the better chance for rarer drops?
[2:20:24] gaymersalsa: stupid swampy.
[2:20:25] ShelobsLair_: oooh pilons finally tell you in chat?
[2:20:29] ArzoAvex: maybe increase quantity and rarity as you pillage more
[2:20:30] Spiderwolf27: @gaymersalsa I will do that, have to work it out a bit though. And yeah I know that you can transmog, but you still need to find them first. But thank you for liking the idea :)
[2:20:32] zebrainap: do the brazier buffs apply to dungeons?
[2:20:33] ThisReallyIsMe: @hamswordjr I thought it would be, just get frustrated whenever I go into a scav vault without resetting my hunter. It just frustrating sometimes

[2:21:23] Nova_Max_: You could show one of the items that you'll get when pillaging
[2:21:23] theachup: patient*
[2:21:26] ilabb: i think it's probably fine considering how easy the base objective to complete the vault is
[2:21:28] 8lackops_99: cause lemons are soury
[2:21:28] TheKid217: does the amount of pillaged braziers increase the amount from future pillaged braziers?
[2:21:32] ChaoticTom31: now getting vault fruit other than kiwis is going to be really nice for us greeders :D

[2:21:52] RebelliousUno: As I say 60% of a tank is clearly a baby
[2:21:53] ThisReallyIsMe: Are Braziers related to the number you loot? E.g. the more you loot the better the items are
[2:21:59] mahik750: 2 more gilded

[2:28:08] gaymersalsa: gg believers
[2:28:09] cagiba2000: I like them better than monoliths

[2:28:17] thiccmilkguy: GG
[2:28:17] tragicaltrain11: did you get monolith crate?
[2:28:19] ilabb: it's way more interesting than monoliths so it's a win
[2:28:21] mahik750: Not a big fan, doesn't seem exciting, you complete them too easily.
[2:28:23] zebrainap: are there different rarities for braziers?
[2:28:27] TAxels: yeah need a quest with some details
[2:28:27] JAHislife_: Can you explain how to complete by pillaging?
[2:28:28] melonhunt: how would they know
[2:28:28] gamingwithtoimen: maybe should be able to get a crate when you have done a certain amount of pillages
[2:28:28] LalaDiable: Hey DamnSecci o/ iskHeart iskHeart

[2:28:38] gaymersalsa: OOOO
[2:28:39] tragicaltrain11: you should change the name of crate
[2:28:40] thiccmilkguy: hmm fair point
[2:28:42] Nero918: Monolith crate?
[2:28:42] damnsecci: hey hey @laladiable
[2:28:44] l___Nick___l: OMEGA pog.
[2:28:45] Garnail20: the item is still monolith crate
[2:28:47] Nero918: Name not changed yet?
[2:28:48] theachup: artifact?!
[2:28:49] l___Nick___l: ?
[2:28:49] gaymersalsa: !brazier
[2:28:49] Nightbot: Light the Monoliths objective has been replaced with Light the Braziers in update 13. Braziers appear in every room and have a range of positive modifiers that get added once you click on them! After you acquire the required amount of Braziers, you can continue to Pillage additional Braziers for good loot at the cost of negative/cursed modifiers, or exit the vault to complete it.
[2:28:51] lazypandaman: no pillage crate
[2:28:53] flintmaster25: fix crate it is mono
[2:28:55] arjun1511: where can i find the new update , i can't find it on curseforge
[2:28:56] v0ldy7: Crate name and Icon?
[2:28:56] jonathan_2119: can you get the Etho chest-scroll?
[2:28:58] 053thousand: they're still called monolith crates
[2:28:58] cagiba2000: Shouldn't the crate be different, @iskall85 ?
[2:28:58] PointlessRider: Crate
[2:29:00] thiccmilkguy: Super rare but a little more smaller loots as well?
[2:29:00] forelini: it’s still monolith crate
[2:29:00] gaymersalsa: @arjun1511 out on sunday
[2:29:03] lordsfave: the wording on the exit is weird
[2:29:03] gaymersalsa: !release
[2:29:03] Nightbot: Vault Hunters update 13 is live on the Hermitcraft Vault Hunters server for testing! Public release will likely be out on Sunday the 14th. Check out iskall's video on the changes: https://youtu.be/CrAUh0SOGY0?si=Qw4iZq7S3-Kis9sv
[2:29:05] neebit: maybe put the loot pools for pillaging in JEI like chests?
[2:29:06] Khalin1212: Complete by exiting, just like old monoliths.  Pillaging is just bonus loot
[2:29:07] arjun1511: ohhh
[2:29:07] pixel_161: Why still monolith crates ?
[2:29:13] lordsfave: bc it says pillage to exit
[2:29:15] forelini: iskall crate name
[2:29:15] JAHislife_: It said pillage to exit though
[2:29:15] dcptcncrescendo: maybe make the objective say 'Pillage, then Exit to Complete"
[2:29:16] braed_man_walking: I think it seems fair, excited to try it out
[2:29:18] da1dman: Do you want to add a quest to complete a brazier which explains the rewards?
[2:29:20] kerrlab: kerrlab subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months! Hype for Update 13
[2:29:21] asimithehero: The text at the top makes it sound like you can pillage to exit
[2:29:21] TheKid217: the label on the vault could use changing, definitely could be msitaken that pillaging could be your win condition
[2:29:22] BooBooFastCat: what level can you start to get brazier vaults
[2:29:24] thiccmilkguy: Uh oh texture problem
[2:29:24] arjun1511: ty for the info
[2:29:24] neednaame: give the info in a quest?
[2:29:25] fiddlyfudbucket: what does the flower from velara do
[2:29:25] phoenix_king_01: name too
[2:29:27] gaymersalsa: @BooBooFastCat lvl 0

[2:29:30] ShelobsLair_: @damnsecci how are you this fine snowy day?
[2:29:31] PointlessRider: Crate needs updating
[2:29:32] TotallyNotZhando: @BooBooFastCat lvl 0, they will replace Monoliths
[2:29:34] Thirdeyechakra69: the wording “pillage or exit to complete” is a bit confusing
[2:29:38] ladycorvo: I agree, I think people will assume they can pillage to complete the vault
[2:29:40] gaymersalsa: !release

[2:29:40] justalittlebacon: @iskall85 The wording on the text can be interpreted as that you can exit the vault by pillaging
[2:29:41] RMZing: It's very interesting vault, but it feels like an auto-complete even more so than Elixir. Guess that justifies the crate having the worst loot
[2:29:42] Nero918: iskNERD
[2:29:44] damnsecci: nomming my dinner at work @shelobslair_ so good
[2:29:45] e_shailee: can you quickly show your setup for the backpack deloot stand?
[2:29:48] SYM_uk: Can we flame vault??
[2:29:48] damnsecci: hows you @shelobslair_
[2:29:50] th3chick3ncoop: the pillage or exit makes it confusing on how to end the vault

[2:30:00] iljalz: love it!
[2:30:00] mirohtomysoul: good!
[2:30:00] grafpa1: I like it a lot
[2:30:01] JAHislife_: text for completion is confusing but it looks fun
[2:30:01] EllieIsShmexy: It's very pag
[2:30:01] forelini: it was good but run another
[2:30:01] xanking96: hello
[2:30:02] noninja5: not bad
[2:30:02] nomadshelp: better than monolith for sure
[2:30:02] jackfrost9879: Cheer100 @iskall85 Are you ever planning on cleaning up your teleporter area and moving it to Pacific? It feels silly to constantly have to fly back and forth to it.
[2:30:04] lordsfave: wording on exit message is weird but otherwise good
[2:30:05] gaymersalsa: @th3chick3ncoop it lists two options
[2:30:05] theachup: have you thought about stremming on youtube too?
[2:30:05] HamswordJr: it’s good I think
[2:30:06] thiccmilkguy: On iskall not vodskall
[2:30:06] trev392: i like it
[2:30:07] fake_thunder11: Their is a comma guys. It makes sense
[2:30:08] alexepul: It's great
[2:30:09] marvelprincess2000: Looks fun
[2:30:09] NakeZast: I feel the loot is a bit mediocre from the pillaging ones.
[2:30:09] forelini: we need more monolith
[2:30:09] G8L6: Needs more negatives, a some kind of a risk
[2:30:10] neednaame: do the info in a questline?
[2:30:11] kibaz_x: Way better than monolithssss
[2:30:11] pg_109: op
[2:30:12] th3chick3ncoop: it looked really good. agree on the extra negative pools
[2:30:12] costalboy: Intresting game mechanics
[2:30:12] gaymersalsa: i think its goodge
[2:30:13] AbsolutelyNafin: I enjoyed that seems much nicer then monos
[2:30:13] 17power: the loot should get better the more you plunder?
[2:30:15] ShelobsLair_: @damnsecci oooh, whatcha eating? Sounds like it's good. I'm doing good, procrastinating a bit much with iskall stream though. Should get back to work KEKW
[2:30:15] ido_katz: much better than monolith
[2:30:15] gamingwithtoimen: if you can pillage to exit would be very nice byut great start so far
[2:30:16] csheff56: Pag
[2:30:16] Nero918: Seems good, and teaches modifiers
[2:30:16] angrrrrydad: good but preffered rais vaults
[2:30:16] cezero11: looked so fun. cant wait to play
[2:30:17] lordsfave: should be easy
[2:30:17] niku71: much better than monoliths
[2:30:19] netseeker: i think that is good, but i think think that it should be a percewnted change off bad... much more fun then
[2:30:19] gaymersalsa: @17power Hmm
[2:30:20] bafoon__: needs negatives
[2:30:20] valentino598: too easy
[2:30:21] rytional: it’s great. text for completion isn’t clear that you HAVE to leave
[2:30:21] fiddlyfudbucket: I thought it was good
[2:30:21] Nightbot: www.youtube.com/iskall85 | www.twitter.com/iskall85 | https://youtube.com/@vodskall85
[2:30:22] netseeker: the old one
[2:30:22] TruePat: A coop brazier would be really enjoyable
[2:30:24] AmethystVicious: pagging for lit vaults
[2:30:26] angrrrrydad: raid
[2:30:27] orangey44: they look good for when you want to loot and dont need a good crate
[2:30:28] LaplaceDemon2k: is the artifact chance lower for braziers?
[2:30:28] tragicaltrain11: truth
[2:30:28] CooldAtTV: Why would anyone pick a negative modifier in a brazier?
[2:30:29] PointlessRider: They ar
[2:30:30] maetti1286: @iskall85 its something different. I like it
[2:30:30] pemu17: i think it should be one positive one negative
[2:30:30] samsam21amb: better than monoliths
[2:30:31] CapraDiCollina: isnt the video on the main channel?
[2:30:31] mandalise: What about the soul one?
[2:30:32] stepan12f: i think it needs negative modifers
[2:30:32] TheKid217: better than original, would be neat to see more reward according the amount of pillaging done
[2:30:32] HamswordJr: I like how much this update is working with vault modifiers
[2:30:32] thiccmilkguy: I like it but really really really really easy to complete
[2:30:32] LalaDiable: Iskall are you aware of the missing pixels on the chests in vault?
[2:30:33] saiakustar: when i saw the vid i thought the brazier spawned mobs... but now i know they dont
[2:30:34] Waffellord22: To complett the bracier u still need to exit via Portal right ?
[2:30:34] stary_kartofel: looks pretty good honestly
[2:30:34] Nero918: It makes for a good early game vault, because it makes people learn modifiers
[2:30:37] anonymoususer281: brazier may under value other seals
[2:30:37] PointlessRider: They are good
[2:30:38] meo_benderson: it felt a bit "event-less"
[2:30:39] csheff56: I thout that vault was lit
[2:30:39] damnsecci: @shelobslair_ shhh boss shall never know. i’m eating lasagna
[2:30:39] Ramzi65ok: it does seem easier than monoliths
[2:30:46] kaladinner: Is it ever better than cake?
[2:30:47] lordsfave: wording is weird for exit message
[2:30:47] gaymersalsa: @damnsecci LASAGA POGGERS
[2:30:47] e_shailee: major improvement to monoliths
[2:30:48] samsam21amb: I think it’s balanced
[2:30:53] Mierrin: I think the message needs to be clearer. "Find the exit. Pillage if you dare!" or something like that. Its currently unclear if you leave after pillaging once.
[2:30:54] chager212: I want to speed run the braziers and get a feel for the loot.
[2:30:54] damnsecci: ikr @gaymersalsa
[2:30:54] Travess: Should the braziers have smoke particles like monoliths? @iskall85
[2:30:59] theachup: vault with false?
[2:31:00] crazyshezy: they were a bit tame
[2:31:01] am_andrew: just watched the update video, THIS.... LOOKS... AMAZING.... ALL OF IT gj iskall and dev team
[2:31:02] SYM_uk: If you coop brazier are you gonna get more braziers before completion?
[2:31:02] thiccmilkguy: Even 20 braizers would be easy to complete I think
[2:31:04] xanking96: could you pls play some cake vault in a minute
[2:31:04] LaplaceDemon2k: Oooo thats a nice jewel
[2:31:04] kattenbrokken: Omejja chestplate i think
[2:31:13] mirohtomysoul: is there a place where all the icons on the right hand side will be explained? Like in the guidebook or something? Think that would be very nice for the people who want to know
[2:31:19] Ramzi65ok: can pillaged braisures give vault xp?
[2:31:20] gaymersalsa: yeye
[2:31:24] psychraton: If you have both positive and negative in the pool for pillaging it needs to be more higher
[2:31:26] TheImmortaldonut: I like it more than monoliths, especially for beginners
[2:31:28] gaymersalsa: I DONT HAVE ACCESS LOL
[2:31:31] damnsecci: yer fantasic @gaymersalsa
[2:31:31] gaymersalsa: im just noting on notepad
[2:31:35] TruePat: Is it a random amount of brazier you need to find?
[2:31:36] neednaame: is there quest info for new players? @iskall85
[2:31:39] kaladinner: In what scenario would you want to target braziers?
[2:31:39] noradthegreat: Wait what’s happening with braziers
[2:31:40] CooldAtTV: I dont understand why negative modifiers in braziers
[2:31:40] mahik750: @thiccmilkguy Yeah, all you do is run through 20 rooms and add 20 positive modifiers. Impossible to not complete, unless you die
[2:31:40] crazyshezy: on a monolith boit a positive and negative modifier
[2:31:44] chager212: @iskall85 I kind of liked the lit monoliths at the top instead of the bar. Can you share your thoughts on why you changed it?
[2:31:44] ShelobsLair_: @mirohtomysoul hmm idk but i assume on the vault hunters dot gg website
[2:31:52] e_shailee: is there +time to positives?
[2:31:52] psychraton: Ohhh got ya
[2:31:52] Nero918: Isn't hoard sort of a positive for soul shard builds?
[2:31:54] tigershrimp88: it is that the more of them you touch or take mean the better your crate is?
[2:31:55] pg_109: easy and op. what happens i keep stacking iteam quantity and then just loot loot loot. no pillage. win for player
[2:31:59] Mango5470: personally, I would increase the difficulty of the braziers and up the loot pool alittle bit, so the risk-reward factor is higher
[2:32:05] TheImmortaldonut: Allows new players to complete but also makes it still fun for advanced players
[2:32:06] gaymersalsa: ok
[2:32:06] tragicaltrain11: i like the bar better
[2:32:08] damnsecci: lol
[2:32:16] hamisharms: Can a hotkey be added to say in chat what a brazier is before activating it? So us coop players that aren't in a voice call can share it easily.
[2:32:19] psychraton: The bar is better
[2:32:20] damnsecci: salsa at work pagpag
[2:32:25] rektarina1594: How long is the stream today?
[2:32:25] P3pp3rF1y: yeah either complete quick and having negatives or search for those with positives only that don't spawn that often
[2:32:26] ItzElixsis: Seems like you would just want to speed run braisures. Get ur max and then pillage as fast as u can.
[2:32:26] gaymersalsa: emotional FeelsStrongMan
[2:32:33] gaymersalsa: true,...
[2:32:34] psychraton: I am lazy to count those icons
[2:32:39] strandberggg: I get very emotional
[2:32:39] RebelliousUno: It's also easier to not have to count the icons
[2:32:42] strandberggg: Call mom insta
[2:32:44] damnsecci: fuuuuture
[2:32:45] forelini: run another brazier?
[2:32:45] RavingHazard: Hmmmmm?
[2:32:46] jessmay121_: the bar is def better
[2:32:51] kibaz_x: Maybe the negatives could be only on the ultra good braziers like the 50% item quantity one
[2:32:53] supermarcus11: How about the chance of having negative modifiers increase after lvl 40 the more you play this vault type?
[2:32:55] braed_man_walking: Less intimidating
[2:32:55] HamswordJr: ahh boss reveal
[2:32:55] TheKid217: less daunting
[2:32:55] mirohtomysoul: Design psychology expert iskall
[2:32:56] cineeleo: i also liked to be the monolith as it was, why not keep both?
[2:32:56] jarivd03: You can also try when lighting them you can have a random negative chance and when pillaging a random positive chance
[2:32:58] gaymersalsa: bars.
[2:33:00] niku71: it’s readable
[2:33:01] th3chick3ncoop: I love the bar design
[2:33:04] IceCreamEmperor: Less imposing
[2:33:08] KalunRS: it’s less discouraging
[2:33:08] tre_2018: less overwhelming?
[2:33:08] ThomJGk: ThomJGk subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 48 months! 
[2:33:09] psychraton: Somebody will make a green joke of the new objective
[2:33:12] CalBoy_: CalBoy_ subscribed with Prime.

[2:33:17] TheCykel: bar kinda fits with how elixir works too
[2:33:17] samsam21amb: yes
[2:33:18] ThisReallyIsMe: More achievable
[2:33:19] JAHislife_: Cant wait to run but I would have died thinking I can complete through pillaging without seeing this first
[2:33:20] Mercutio42: love the bar! hated the 12 monoliths at the top!
[2:33:20] faefair: maybe daunting or intimidating
[2:33:24] jessmay121_: another one
[2:33:28] pb_b: yeaaahh
[2:33:28] CarlThePirate: So I heard you changed cake vaults?
[2:33:30] RebelliousUno: More useful is the X/Y part of it. Regardless of bar or no bar
[2:33:31] pemu17: Velara's the red one right?
[2:33:31] xanking96: ooooh could you pls play some cake vault in a minute
[2:33:32] e_shailee: but with the new mechanic, the ascending or w/e its called please

[2:33:57] noninja5: yes
[2:33:57] HamswordJr: 100% correct
[2:33:59] Aylabar: yea monolith looked also pretty weird on the top if you got 15-20
[2:34:02] Wiroe_: do the same kind stack the %?
[2:34:04] PointlessRider: Hunter sir
[2:34:04] verqix: I wonder if the game can have 9 different seals you could combine into 1 gauntlet vault type :p
[2:34:05] gaymersalsa: BRACE FOR BRAZIERS POGGERS
[2:34:06] gaymersalsa: ok.

[2:34:38] ShelobsLair_: did I miss an update something? how did crystal autocomplete?
[2:34:39] gaymersalsa: !dylan
[2:34:39] Nightbot: Who's Dylan you ask.  WE ARE ALL DYLAN!
[2:34:40] Ramzi65ok: not the seal of the challenger sprite!!
[2:34:42] SYM_uk: Is there a max of how many you can add to a crystal across all the gods or could you have 100% for all 4 gods on one crystal
[2:34:44] ShelobsLair_: oh i see
[2:34:46] ShelobsLair_: no recipe
[2:34:46] forelini: I don’t think I have heard a single person say “ oh boy! I can’t wait to run a monolith vault!”
[2:34:47] ShelobsLair_: lol
[2:34:50] anonymoususer281: scav vs brazier dilema now

[2:35:30] ItzElixsis: I hate watching scav runs.. seen too many..
[2:35:31] SuiteSunrise: but not better than cakes

[2:35:39] maetti1286: @iskall85 what was that german sentence you know?
[2:35:42] CKM32: Is this third edition?
[2:35:43] gaymersalsa: YAY!
[2:35:43] Nero918: Soul flame + Brazier would be OP

[2:35:58] mirohtomysoul: loving the transmog outfit
[2:35:59] Unheard_Nightmare: Would the favours be able to be added to the divine paradox to be able to reduce the blessing roll of that vault god (limit 1 per divine paradox)
[2:35:59] gamingwithtoimen: make a poll
[2:35:59] CKM32: @gaymersalsa thanks
[2:36:03] Phoenix_025: @iskall85 Does uses on the charms effect the number of tears eg the total percentage you get for the crystal?
[2:36:04] theachup: scav is perfect because it doesn’t distract you from looting. it’s a bit too hard for me though, but i’m an unde average vault hunter so i’m not mad about it
[2:36:04] jackfrost9879: Are you ever planning on cleaning up your teleporter area and moving it to Pacific? It feels silly to constantly have to fly back and forth to it.
[2:36:05] BooBooFastCat: iskall will the cake vaults increase in chests and coins slow down the more cakes you get or will there be a limit to the number of cakes to prevent the rooms from being full of chests and coins
[2:36:06] ShelobsLair_: D: poor flower
[2:36:07] HamswordJr: make the flower into a t shirt. I’d buy that
[2:36:13] andydirk88: gamba?

[2:37:43] Mercutio42: so the lower the number the more punishing it could be for the greeders!
[2:37:48] chager212: I’m so excited to try this! This is going to be amazing!
[2:37:51] hamisharms: got all my channel points on yes
[2:37:54] LalaDiable: Nighty Night DamnSecci
[2:37:54] BlazeSpaceRl: @Onmate i dont think so
[2:38:00] BlazeSpaceRl: but they are rather common
[2:38:01] fenixcrafter05: how is the xp on braziers?
[2:38:01] HamswordJr: @gaymersalsa he’s really taking advantage of that free labour eh?
[2:38:03] pemu17: isn't 4 super low?
[2:38:04] crazyshezy: can brazzer have multiple exits..     may be exit from end of a vault of something
[2:38:08] BlazeSpaceRl: slightly more than treasure doors
[2:38:09] chager212: @mercutio42 good point!

[2:38:21] 60wattlightbulb: Hello
[2:38:22] Onmate: @BlazeSpaceRl ah got it, thanks
[2:38:23] brentos777: I think the only thing I dislike about these are that there is no challenge to completing at the moment. Adding negative modifiers would help solve that
[2:38:30] Mercutio42: this vault type is very nice! very customizable to the player! its dope!
[2:38:42] Tristar3: can there be a 1 in 10 plunder positive?
[2:38:45] fenixcrafter05: seemd fair
[2:38:45] HamswordJr: @gaymersalsa fair enough, gotta help out the editor to get those vids out
[2:38:49] forelini: but I think like not too bad of negatives past level 50 for normal
[2:38:49] pemu17: u left  speed 1 bracher
[2:38:49] gaymersalsa: @brentos777 monoliths were meant to be easy to complete tho, theyre the tutorial
[2:38:50] kibaz_x: I find guardians easier lol
[2:38:56] tragicaltrain11: get swift
[2:38:57] e_shailee: can you get artifacts in braisers?
[2:38:57] gaymersalsa: @HamswordJr #plaqueforsecci
[2:38:58] Qbanish: you should make it that the more you pillage the better the crate gets
[2:39:01] DogeCreations_: !release
[2:39:01] Nightbot: Vault Hunters update 13 is live on the Hermitcraft Vault Hunters server for testing! Public release will likely be out on Sunday the 14th. Check out iskall's video on the changes: https://youtu.be/CrAUh0SOGY0?si=Qw4iZq7S3-Kis9sv

[2:39:02] pb_b: cake vaults 1 cake is worse i’d say
[2:39:02] ProfessionalsOnly: ad xp/loot to the crate for pillaging? :)
[2:39:09] mrPhilipJones: isnt it possible to use the soul flame and build stacks by doing 1 cake cake vaults
[2:39:12] gamingwithtoimen: stupid goverment
[2:39:12] Nightbot: For everything Vault Hunters, check out the website! https://vaulthunters.gg/
[2:39:13] samsam21amb: I think there should be both positive and negative after 5 braizers, but idk
[2:39:14] mahik750: @gaymersalsa yeah, but now elixir is the first objective, or not?
[2:39:21] gaymersalsa: @ProfessionalsOnly this is a cool idea Hmm
[2:39:24] BlazeSpaceRl: @mrPhilipJones you cant choose the objective
[2:39:24] gamingwithtoimen: glad we get a new one hope they change it back
[2:39:26] warfirev: make it a 'pillage' crate
[2:39:28] mirohtomysoul: Could do something like the more negative modifiers, the better the exp? with a cap of course?
[2:39:29] zeus_o9o2: Getting old dw iskall 🗿
[2:39:32] gaymersalsa: @gaymersalsa no brazier replaces monolith completely
[2:39:33] csheff56: could you it be increased based on number of pillaged braziers?
[2:39:36] haldoe: crazy.. i was crazy once
[2:39:36] anthonythompson3: Apologies if this has already been said but whats min-max for number of braziers?
[2:39:37] pb_b: not worth it

[2:39:51] dadsamuggle: @ocsisor Thanks for the gift sub!
[2:39:52] tragicaltrain11: too much
[2:39:52] Maserz: Have you ever thought about making a speedrun objective? One were the reward gets better the faster you complete it?
[2:39:55] e_shailee: not worth
[2:39:55] Pflanzer1987: worth it
[2:39:56] ItzElixsis: The slower you complete the slower u get to pillage.
[2:39:56] noninja5: noooo

[2:40:22] Vossela: gotta try to catch up to etho after all LUL
[2:40:23] antegravity: Greed on the haters
[2:40:24] TobyButt89: It'll pay for itself in the future
[2:40:24] brentos777: @gaymersalsa I know they should still be the easiest objective, but they are no longer the first objective (elixir is), and with them now being in every room it becomes ridiculously easy even at high levels when you need to find quite a lot
[2:40:26] hadesruby: greed is good
[2:40:28] Mercutio42: i missed it last run, does the counter stop at the total needed to complete or does it increase, keeping track of how many have been activacted?
[2:40:32] gaymersalsa: chest scroll! chest scroll! chest scroll!
[2:40:32] lwt1: is there guaranteed brasers in every room??
[2:40:32] aaka41: They're so easy to make
[2:40:33] nasrou85: Do it
[2:40:36] Xarallon: WWED - What Would Etho Do?
[2:40:36] noninja5: now you can't die
[2:40:37] gaymersalsa: @lwt1 yes
[2:40:40] samsam21amb: that’s a bargain
[2:40:45] haldoe: gold is eazy too get more of, treasure is forever
[2:40:45] zeus_o9o2: What is bartering?
[2:40:46] Nero918: Yeah, this seems like bartering is worth now
[2:40:46] Suffix: I really like the idea of low objective numbers at higher levels, thinking on it more. Smaller buffs, and more opportunity to pillage.
[2:40:48] pred_btw2: Yesterday I got b2b factory rooms and then there was another factory room down that same line 2-3 rooms later
[2:40:49] LalaDiable: iskPIRATE iskPIRATE  LUL
[2:40:50] Qbanish: make it so the more you pillage, the better the crate gets
[2:40:50] BlazeSpaceRl: oh yeah
[2:40:51] mawtrigger: gotta get that treasure chest scroll!
[2:40:54] pemu17: vendors seem realy cool now
[2:40:54] pb_b: yep
[2:40:54] Aylabar: now that Expertise has a use
[2:40:54] hamisharms: i owuld
[2:40:55] BlazeSpaceRl: bartering is omega good now
[2:40:56] cezero11: 100
[2:40:56] mahik750: @Suffix agree
[2:40:56] TAxels: yeah for sure it seems more valueable
[2:40:59] samsam21amb: yes
[2:40:59] DavidCzPdy: Yes
[2:41:00] dia__hi: We pillage for that gold now..
[2:41:00] mitsuki1678: when mage buil
[2:41:00] BlazeSpaceRl: bartering is OP now
[2:41:01] Tristar3: yep, wasn't worth earlier
[2:41:01] smash7711: I see it having use now
[2:41:02] BlazeSpaceRl: let sgooo
[2:41:03] thereal4thewin: time for dragon/pirate cove inscription vaults?
[2:41:03] gaymersalsa: @zeus_o9o2 lowers the cost of vendor items
[2:41:03] Travess: oh wow bartering has a lot more power now
[2:41:04] cyan_bun: Maybe instead of a positive and a negative it could be 2 positive and 1 negative.
[2:41:05] StandaSK: yee that was kind useless before
[2:41:06] 60wattlightbulb: I'd take it now. Before, no
[2:41:06] FoxFireX_: Are full Vendor rooms still a thing?
[2:41:06] veronicorn: with all these different kinds of doors to find it almost feels like hunter spec for doors could be reconsidered. because it’s not guaranteed treasure door finder anymore.
[2:41:06] bradkolz: definitely worth it now
[2:41:07] tragicaltrain11: could be an investment
[2:41:08] zeus_o9o2: Ohh it's op
[2:41:08] Lizerdman87: there’s not enough expertise points for all of the expertises I want lol
[2:41:10] redstonedad: Bartering definitely worth it now
[2:41:12] RMZing: Bartering is an A- tier expertise now
[2:41:14] TheImmortaldonut: Bartering is way better now
[2:41:14] caIImePeter: @iskall85 what about adding Ansiedlung to villager trading with bartering expertise
[2:41:15] rytional: at least it’s part of the decision now for sure
[2:41:17] kibaz_x: I'm still too poor
[2:41:17] pb_b: bartering is like hugely buffed now
[2:41:19] Ninjovich: High value points with the vendoors
[2:41:19] smash7711: Poor skall
[2:41:21] BlazeSpaceRl: KEKW
[2:41:23] fortune85_: Halllo sorry im late did i miss anything important ?
[2:41:23] stary_kartofel: gotta get that scroll to flex
[2:41:23] ilabb: with how common ven-doors are i think it'd be foolish to not take bartering
[2:41:26] chager212: Yep. Time to pull out the neutralizer
[2:41:26] BlazeSpaceRl: Brokeskall
[2:41:27] Pflanzer1987: isn't there an upstairs to vendor rooms?
[2:41:28] zeus_o9o2: You cannot
[2:41:28] fake_thunder11: I love vendoor rooms
[2:41:31] pemu17: zombie bathtub
[2:41:31] gamingwithtoimen: nope
[2:41:31] aaka41: Nope you have 5 gold left
[2:41:31] BooBooFastCat: is iskall a shopaholic
[2:41:32] pred_btw2: Don't die ez
[2:41:33] zeus_o9o2: But you still will greed
[2:41:35] Mierrin: What do you pass up for bartering though?
[2:41:35] cyan_bun: Then you could have pillages that have 2 negatives and 1 positive
[2:41:37] kathinkajean: treasure key > magnet
[2:41:38] Wiroe_: definitely not with the key
[2:41:41] BlazeSpaceRl: @BooBooFastCat yes
[2:41:42] gaymersalsa: @veronicorn i think theres been some talks of that lately, so it def would be less meta than a pure treasure door hunter wouldve been!
[2:41:43] TAxels: if you got the treasure key inside the vault does it count towards body value?
[2:41:45] mirohtomysoul: I think with the platinum from last vault you can
[2:41:49] gaymersalsa: NOBODY IS LAUGHING....
[2:41:56] dalton__haynes: Unless you find a dragon room then you can go back for that epic magnet?
[2:41:56] BlazeSpaceRl: Iskall release the update NOW i want to play @iskall85  lol
[2:41:57] mpastor_25: sounds like we need a big gold run next
[2:42:00] veronicorn: @gaymersalsa okay that’s cool!
[2:42:03] redzero1300: it looks cute
[2:42:04] sagyto02: mark the place, if you find another dragon room whit gold
[2:42:05] gaymersalsa: uhuh..

[2:42:10] mirohtomysoul: I like them, they're cute
[2:42:12] gaymersalsa: yeah that one is dope
[2:42:13] redzero1300: I like them
[2:42:15] PlayerSBB: Anyone know if this means dungeons will be more rare with the vendoors in the mix?
[2:42:20] speed0sound7665: they’re cute
[2:42:21] zeus_o9o2: Iskallim cluster
[2:42:22] TheCykel: flower token is great, keep it in the game
[2:42:28] ItzElixsis: Why does he keep saying his designs are ugly when they look good...
[2:42:28] trashgamer300: Hey Iskall it's 2am here in Australia I need to sleep, I'll watch your vods in da morning, good luck with your vaulting
[2:42:29] gamingwithtoimen: it look good not bad whoever said that deservse to be muted
[2:42:29] speed0sound7665: artistskall
[2:42:31] pemu17: NIce
[2:42:32] gaymersalsa: @PlayerSBB i dojnt think so but i might be misunderstanding kekw
[2:42:34] 60wattlightbulb: So, I just walked in. Is this like a new kind of Plunderer vault?
[2:42:35] caIImePeter: what about adding villager trading discount to bartering expertise?
[2:42:37] HamswordJr: ArtiSkall
[2:42:37] zeus_o9o2: Take it
[2:42:37] gaymersalsa: @trashgamer300 gngn

[2:42:51] zebrainap: soul shards are so OP
[2:42:52] tornado82_: Bounty table is reat

[2:42:54] Nero918: Yeah, soul shards + hoard negatives seems amazing?

[2:43:04] bafoon__: don’t need soul chance
[2:43:04] SYM_uk: Soul shard pagskall
[2:43:04] azurescens_: Love me shards
[2:43:05] cezero11: Soul shards are the best
[2:43:07] zeus_o9o2: It is a way of playing not many like it it's fine we enjoy it
[2:43:07] zebrainap: i run a poison soul shard build and get 15-20k per vault.....
[2:43:08] brentos777: I think sould shards are very hidden, so it's hard to see the effect
[2:43:08] gaymersalsa: i think its gotten more popular with black market expertise
[2:43:09] pemu17: whats a pacifist build?
[2:43:10] HamswordJr: I am, the black market is the best.
[2:43:10] gaymersalsa: yeye

[2:49:45] BlazeSpaceRl: its GRREAT
[2:49:45] JustLizTV: you have to have a risk for the reward to feel good
[2:49:46] Tazzad: @iskall85 What about taking a page out of WoW and Mythic +. Have the soulflame drop X amount og stacks?
[2:49:47] pb_b: but that
[2:49:49] am_andrew: i thought it would punish u more than just this
[2:49:49] gamingwithtoimen: i dont think so if you die than you have to start over yea but it is rewarding at the same time

[2:50:04] antegravity: Is there a way to guarantee that a vault haws a dragon room
[2:50:05] nomadshelp: trinket idea : a trinket that adds fire aspect to all weapons and javellins
[2:50:07] mirohtomysoul: I mean, it's the same with a hardcore world in minecraft. Hardcore is still worth it
[2:50:07] Mattsam1234: Thats the whole point of the gamba of soul flames though

[2:50:30] mahik750: Combine the stacking flame with this brazier vault objective, you can complete as many as you want.
[2:50:39] elio_saratsis: Who gets the soul flame if you complete in co-op?
[2:50:41] Z0eff: play WoT if you want tanks Kappa

[2:50:46] da_hyun0615: Tanks? You're welcome
[2:50:48] pikadude1228b: Slay the Spire does have an ascension mode, but you don't lose levels, just runs
[2:50:52] supermarcus11: Is the Pog to pag ratio still a thing?
[2:50:54] londonb2008: Hi
[2:50:57] N0FOOL: N0FOOL subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 3 months! can you coop soul flame
[2:51:00] csheff56: wining all the time is boring. you have to fail to have fun when you succeed
[2:51:01] 60wattlightbulb: I found a room this morning, with a conveyor belt full of presents! I loved it! So cool!
[2:51:07] Spiderwolf27: Without the sour taste of losing, you will never experience the real sweet taste of victory
[2:51:09] Monatae: @mahik750 you can't choose the objective with soul flame, it's always random
[2:51:10] gaymersalsa: alooo tanks ?
[2:51:11] RMZing: Oh wow, Dead Beard
[2:51:16] gamingwithtoimen: @mahik750 you cant combine them when you put the flame u cant put anything else on it tho

[2:51:41] pg_109: what is the waight of gear iteam in pillage?
[2:51:43] thechair83: You have to have risks in order to feel the reward imo feels bad moments are there for everyone but they need to be there in order for the wins to feel earned! Without stakes a lot of the reward feeling is lost
[2:51:44] gamingwithtoimen: yes

[2:54:19] cladmi: I think it depends on the theme. Some may replace more dwellers by other mobs.
[2:54:19] andydirk88: 100% trap disarm makes it harder

[2:54:53] BlazeSpaceRl: @Animeinlove_ on curseforge, if there is no update button beside the profile, you are up to date
[2:54:55] ursa_cat: when trap disarm on your tools and gear makes it impossible to get dwellers spawning in, this is not an easy challenge.
[2:54:57] gaymersalsa: or for more mobs
[2:54:57] mpastor_25: does this make Vendoor the 5th vault god?

[3:00:38] decidiousdrake: i understand what you mean. i dont know a simple way to put it but it essentialy adds half of the current trap chance once it has gone through your trap disarm, so if you have a 10% chance of trapped, and you pull clumsy, it is now a 15% chance

[3:09:38] gaymersalsa: i have a good gamba in mind okokokok
[3:09:38] sofie0125: I don’t know if this was already answered and I simply missed it, but is there a possibility of adding a new vault objective in which time isn’t the limiting factor, but the amount of rooms is. So, there would only be like five or so rooms, but unlimited time. It could be that the difficulty goes up with every room but so does the loot. - the catch is, you have to complete something like killing mobs/ a boss or another objective of sorts before you can move onto the next room.
[3:09:39] digikrynary: do one with impulse?

[3:10:17] jackfrost9879: Are you ever planning on cleaning up your teleporter area and moving it to Pacific? It feels silly to constantly have to fly back and forth to it.

[3:14:51] vhblast: @iskall85 if possible can you add to the chaos of the chaos catas by having more then one objective  :p ?
[3:14:59] avian946: more gold uses means I don’t skip a coin dungeon just cause it has no table lol
[3:14:59] grynd3rfl: Now if you could just fix the trinket rate for mef
[3:15:00] Danymaddox: gold is in a weird place: some players are always short, some have TONS, like in my server there's people that have more than 1 stack of platinum at lvl 45

[3:15:50] grynd3rfl: He's a gamer he'll do it
[3:15:50] AngelBunVT: angelf7Cheer i know he is determined he got that
[3:15:50] nathor092: not with his schedule
[3:15:51] KalunRS: impulse would make it if he stopped playing phasmo
[3:15:51] rytional: he will need burger help. he takes weekends off
[3:15:51] knightrali: impulse will make it we all know it he will grind hard the last three days before
[3:15:51] BroCox1: Burger burger burger

[3:16:46] speed0sound7665: u13 patch notes?
[3:16:52] CrunchyZedman: im lvl 77 in my world and i havent found a single one
[3:17:03] rumatomaatti: hi chat o/
[3:17:03] toasterburn809: Just get more coins
[3:17:07] Arvom: I found 1 in 40 vaults
[3:17:08] jane_co11: SeemsGood
[3:17:08] sofie0125: you could vault with impulse
[3:17:17] am_andrew: i found like 4 vendor rooms in my 3 separate playthroughts... so THIS IS GREAT
[3:17:17] TechnoHail: hlo
[3:17:19] pb_b: it is optional too
[3:17:22] Z0eff: I might actually bring gold into vaults now :)
[3:17:23] Nightbot: Support the devs & the pack.  https://www.patreon.com/VaultHunters
[3:17:24] e_shailee: more player choice
[3:17:24] mefallit: agree to disagree. this is all i can say
[3:17:26] AbeardedMustang: @mefallit thanks for the gifted, sorry I missed it
[3:17:31] knightrali: i think that the vendoors makes the discount expertise much more relevant.
[3:17:32] smash7711: Sounds like mega needs to invest in bartering
[3:17:33] Arvom: I'm slow kek
[3:17:33] avian946: just need to get more gold
[3:17:34] freshwatersipper: pag
[3:17:35] the_great_tan: you can reduce chance by a little i think
[3:17:36] Suffix: It's just more choice. But I see where you're coming form mefallit
[3:17:36] angrrrrydad: but if the doors compete with the dungeon and treasure doors its limiting the treasure key quest
[3:17:39] antegravity: Don't like vendoors? Don't go in
[3:17:41] rytional: I like that there are more.
[3:17:44] KalunRS: I get her point. Too many things that costs coins, but too few ways to get those coins
[3:17:44] Edetnak: im level 67 and I have found like 3 vendor rooms. So I think it's a really good update
[3:17:47] demonishlol: hello
[3:17:49] xX_BLADEX_Xx: Cheer100 hello iskall, i am glad to catch you live and i am in the mood for chaos so how much would it cost for you to run a vault without armor?
[3:17:51] gaymersalsa: forced
[3:17:52] cezero11: im excited about the change to vendoors. rip my gold, but im about it
[3:17:57] Fildrekk: just don't buy
[3:17:58] falsesymmetry: Are the vendors added onto the spawning of all doors? Or they don't affect the others rate?
[3:17:59] Fildrekk: easy
[3:18:01] jqckdaw: shopaholic
[3:18:03] rumatomaatti: I was to play stardew valley this evening, but now I'll just watch the stream
[3:18:08] Marknu: Marknu subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 19 months! awe I'm late today, sadge
[3:18:10] mefallit: Sir... after u12 everything is GOLD heavy. You need gold if you die as well.
[3:18:11] LalaDiable: logic? Sounds like a plan, to me LUL
[3:18:14] ShelobsLair_: @falsesymmetry oh interesting question, hadn't considered that.
[3:18:16] TheKid217: I do think things costing more gold isn't necessarily bad, but theres quite an imbalance IMO for how you gain that gold, gaining coins normally vs running a dragon room as an example is quite a big difference
[3:18:16] Morningblossom: oh etho will have the time of his life
[3:18:21] Nightbot: Watch iskall85’s VOD’s at https://youtube.com/@vodskall85
[3:18:22] anonymoususer281: man i am gonna get adhd with all the doors lol
[3:18:22] thechair83: My only question is does the inclusion of vendors make dungeons and treasure rooms more rare?
[3:18:26] forelini: ph damn I missed prediction
[3:18:33] thechair83: Love them though
[3:18:34] the_great_tan: you should blreduce chance by a litlte or they will not feel special
[3:18:36] NerdMomOfBoys: Small coin piles included with other POIs could help provide a little extra gold without a mega change.
[3:18:41] samsam21amb: etho will love this feature
[3:18:43] jackfrost9879: @iskall85 were you ever planning on cleaning up your teleporter area and moving it to Pacific? It feels silly to constantly have to fly back and forth to it.
[3:18:46] asimithehero: Iskall hates RNG, soon Vault hunters will be chess Smadge
[3:18:49] kibaz_x: Do they affect dungeons?
[3:18:52] falsesymmetry: Coooool. Just checking. Found less dungeons and wanted to check SeemsGood
[3:18:53] veronicorn: would be cool if you could buy things with soul shards in the shops too.
[3:18:54] JashinFanatic: JashinFanatic subscribed at Tier 1. 
[3:18:56] zebrainap: The added vendors increases the "feelbad" factor when you can't afford to buy trinkets etc
[3:18:57] therealtolazytothink: So there are just more doors for me to miss
[3:18:59] Suffix: It's just something else that requires MORE gold is all.
[3:19:03] 64_Bit_Cake: I missed it, are vendor rooms spawning as doors now?
[3:19:09] cashhmecashh: cashhmecashh subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months, currently on a 1 month streak!

[3:19:22] redzero1300: jewels are gold heavy
[3:19:22] Mercutio42: ive never seen a pardox vault
[3:19:23] gaymersalsa: hryLaf
[3:19:25] DaddyBonesMC: I'm always out of gold, I also die a lot, skill issue
[3:19:25] Kadeshi_: what are the odds iskall doesnt use a charm for this vault
[3:19:28] KalunRS: Penalty of dying is just a bit too much if anything
[3:19:30] HamswordJr: so your idea for a gold modifier is looking better and better
[3:19:30] mayaicefire: jewel cutting can be pretty expensive
[3:19:30] tekkugai: Has breaking blocks in paradox vault been fixed in this update?
[3:19:31] smash7711: Make some dragon inscriptions
[3:19:35] xanking96: good point @jackfrost9879
[3:19:36] Z0eff: Jewels ate all my gold, paradox vault isnt even viable for me hryLafExceptInPain
[3:19:39] shockwave_60: But does it try to spawn the treasure room or vendor first??
[3:19:39] P3pp3rF1y: dieing is an optin as well :D
[3:19:44] l___Nick___l: But you want to opt in
[3:19:45] KalunRS: You die once and you need like 10 vaults to get that gold back
[3:19:46] gaymersalsa: tts back on? or recording? @iskall85
[3:19:49] e_shailee: worst case, if most players are missing gold, just make gold piles bigger, no?
[3:19:52] keonmagic221: jewel cutting is very expensive
[3:19:53] smash7711: Or use some echos and make some pirate rooms
[3:19:54] missjillian129: Did you unspec hunter
[3:19:54] abibernard: Hunter? unspec
[3:19:56] EnteQuackQuack02: "just skip content" seems like not the best argument imo
[3:19:56] knightrali: I mean dont you remember when people said give us more things for us to spend coins on :D
[3:19:57] Miss_Didi: @64_bit_cake yep
[3:19:59] Tintelicious: why is the portal still at the beach?
[3:20:00] Ribery931: you can also save gold by not playing KEKW
[3:20:00] Bneney: Makes Soulbound also alot more desirable
[3:20:01] asimithehero: Dying is a choice. -Iskall 2024
[3:20:02] da_hyun0615: Btw, when are you gonna move your portal? Lol
[3:20:04] Marknu: Naaa it's iskFine at lvl 80+ you end up sitting on 4k gold quickly with no reason to burn it.
[3:20:05] gaymersalsa: flaskCheck
[3:20:05] Danymaddox: sir i cannot choose because i always die hahahaha
[3:20:05] grynd3rfl: Run cake with impulse and boost him?
[3:20:05] Tazzad: but "Maybe i cant die" isnt an OPTION though..
[3:20:12] migrainessop: I’m not choosing to die :(
[3:20:15] kibaz_x: I made new tools, emptied my gold sack and died the next vault
[3:20:16] maha381: @grynd3rfl mhm
[3:20:16] daiv29: crafting gear, cutting jewels, buying your body all cost gold I never bring gold into the vault anymore for vendor rooms bc I’m afraid of not having enough to buy my body back
[3:20:18] samkuper073: bro I just got 3 minutes worth of commercials, 1 minute after I had 2 minutes of commercials. this is getting out of hand

[3:20:38] bobby21213833: Hi
[3:20:39] randommisao: empty bag
[3:20:42] P3pp3rF1y: I would still think we should add more gold for sure as I am always feeling like I can only die once and then won't be able to buy back
[3:20:43] LalaDiable: iskNERD LuL
[3:20:44] libraven: Maybe do a vault with Impulse to boost him
[3:20:46] Travess: Would be interesting to have un-craftable gear, corrupted like on POE

[3:21:44] charmender2007: I do hope that more ways of gaining gold will be added or another way to get your stuff back if you die
[3:21:46] P3pp3rF1y: yeah, yeah, just that it should be the message that there will be a chance to get more gold in the near future
[3:21:54] cyan_bun: I wish there was an alternative for buying back gear when broke
[3:21:54] falsesymmetry: Rubbing salt in the wound

[3:22:18] candidcrafter: Force invite him to party @falsesymmetry lol
[3:22:20] smash7711: Maybe gear has a limit of buy backs. Or it costs a repair to bye back. That makes it harder. #dontdie
[3:22:26] forelini: should run a soul flame
[3:22:27] LaplaceDemon2k: Oooo a prosperous vault
[3:22:30] HamswordJr: maybe doing the draft vaults will give you large amounts of gold so you can use it to buy your gear back
[3:22:31] gaymersalsa: @thedarksoul_16 hes not doing them cause theyre getting changed down the line
[3:22:33] kibaz_x: I'm betting ores

[3:26:12] mefallit: karma.. thank you.  I'm aware of paradox is optional thats why i am not running. dont worry. But if you dont wanna hear opposite ideas maybe you shouldnt ask.
[3:26:14] Animeinlove_: Are vendor new or level based? im low lvl, do i get any in my vault?
[3:26:14] AllieRise: is it just me or do Vendoors seem a bit too common?
[3:26:15] KalunRS: @mefallit I don’t mind the optional gold expenditures. It’s mainly the forced ones like deaths, because they cost so much you are required to do 10 vaults to replace that gold loss
[3:26:15] 64_Bit_Cake: @z0eff oh did you mean just the model? Yeah I think so
[3:26:28] ProfessionalsOnly: If you die twice without buying your items back, will it get deleted?
[3:26:33] Z0eff: NODDERS
[3:26:33] forelini: will u make it so when you have all the vial modifiers unlocked it will be only gear tables in dungeons?

[3:26:41] juub406: vh is so hard that I have a 35% completion rate and 0 gold. can't afford to rerolled almost anything, so I only plan on plundering at 5-10 levels below where I am. bounties will be my only increase. FallCry
[3:26:41] therealtolazytothink: I hope at least one of those vendor doors has an old man sitting between two fires

[3:27:03] AustenFuego: just because he wants to hear them doesn’t mean he has to agree…
[3:27:04] redstonedad: I like relics except getting the 5th 1
[3:27:11] falsesymmetry: I like relics. They're just passive.
[3:27:14] tre_2018: @juub406 change your game difficulty level to easy?
[3:27:21] HamswordJr: @juub406 have you changed your difficulty?
[3:27:23] Tazzad: @iskall85 A suggestion to the Elixir vault. Once you loot/kill the ting that is "jackpoted", an icon will show somewhere around the bar to signal what you can targetfarm.
[3:27:23] the_great_tan: @allierise me too they will not feel special after some time. it will be like yeah.. its another vendoor !!
[3:27:29] falsesymmetry: Noone is surely running FOR relics
[3:27:31] alpharaposa: I didn't even know what relics are for!
[3:27:32] 64_Bit_Cake: @professionalsonly no, when you die you must pick up Ur spirit and put it on the altar then it only gets deleted manually so you can just leave the second spirit and buy it back after the first one
[3:27:34] DaddyBonesMC: I struggle with relics in solo
[3:27:36] vhblast: can't you have them add stats instead of time?
[3:27:36] Z0eff: I can barely finish scavs even with all 8 relics hryLafExceptInPain
[3:27:37] asimithehero: How is relic opt in?
[3:27:39] Nugorra: Nugorra subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 38 months! 
[3:27:41] zeus_o9o2: Relics are good as they are according to me
[3:27:42] Marknu: Current relics are aweful also as they are only opt in if you wish to nerf your ability to complete vaults.
[3:27:50] Marknu: and get less loot
[3:27:57] gaymersalsa: @asimithehero you dont have to build & complete em i guess
[3:28:04] zeus_o9o2: @asimithehero some get lucky in relics some doesn't

[3:28:23] TAxels: oooo would that be a way to get Unique gear that you teased?
[3:28:23] Suffix: oofa. One of my least favourite PoE mechanics.
[3:28:24] gaymersalsa: <- nevber played poe
[3:28:34] CmdrEmily: iskall85 any chance we could have a new focus that re-rolls the value of implicits without changing the type of implicit? It's so hard to get a good implicit with fundies, you end up killing omegas more than you succeed which feels badge :(
[3:28:36] ltl_drumm3r_boy: Could relics be traded in for gold/coins?
[3:28:50] e_shailee: alter for gamba?
[3:28:52] TheRedBrain: copying Poe is (nearly) always a safe way to go
[3:28:54] candidcrafter: Relics give you extra skill points maybe ?
[3:28:59] KalunRS: Relics are a permanent upgrade, so for an opt in, it’s basically a forced opt in if that makes sense. The incentive that do them is higher than the discouragement/effort of doing them.
[3:29:01] RavingHazard: Fix both problems and make them drop gold KEKW
[3:29:20] juub406: @hamswordjr @tre_2018 I dropped to normal. maybe if I play long enough I'll just get good.
[3:29:29] kibaz_x: Couldn't relics have like just  a few uses? You add them to thcrystal
[3:29:29] VoxelRifts: what if you use the hermitcraft member unique gear pieces as the relic rewards then?
[3:29:39] sivzzz: some poe things are good ideas for VH tho. Recombinators would be amazing here
[3:29:44] 64_Bit_Cake: PEARS?
[3:29:49] CooldAtTV: Completed relics could give you extra skill points?

[3:30:14] zeus_o9o2: You have to hold it in both hands and smash it on your face Kappa
[3:30:17] tre_2018: Ooh new dungeon
[3:30:18] Nugorra: hmm, would think more of something like special vault crystals, that you normally couldn't get.
[3:30:19] Travess: That’s a nice solution. Because it’s nice having options for more time in the vault.
[3:30:20] Nightbot: www.youtube.com/iskall85 | www.twitter.com/iskall85 | https://youtube.com/@vodskall85
[3:30:21] ShuuNeDere: oh banana also good
[3:30:26] Nightdust56: Can we get a door special for hunter?
[3:30:27] InflatablePanda: is it not still then an opt-in mechanic to gain time?
[3:30:28] veronicorn: it means relics are always valuable
[3:30:30] FranzQSR: @sivzzz that's kinda broken tho with legendary mods
[3:30:33] the_whtvr: so you can keep submitting them instead of it being just once?
[3:30:33] kazlem: might need relics to be a little more common, but otherwise sounds good
[3:30:35] Miss_Didi: But they wouldn't take life right?
[3:30:35] Rku04: apple
[3:30:36] zeus_o9o2: Watermelon 🍉
[3:30:37] AllieRise: Personally I prefer the permanent buff but I can understand why they'd make balancing hard
[3:30:37] sofie0125: you have talked about adding a legendary focus. You could implement them through relics
[3:30:37] ruby_realist: mangos
[3:30:38] slashv2: pineapple
[3:30:39] 0finifish: ADD CARROTS
[3:30:40] dia__hi: Mango best fruit
[3:30:40] TinusTussengas: TinusTussengas subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 28 months! 
[3:30:40] Z0eff: should't it be a sour fruit?
[3:30:40] Danymaddox: PEACH
[3:30:40] Marknu: dragon fruit
[3:30:40] sabrina1202r: peaches

[3:30:43] Rku04: melon
[3:30:43] keonmagic221: mangoes
[3:30:44] ladycorvo: but maybe not take health on the bigger ones
[3:30:44] Khalin1212: watermelon is the big boi
[3:30:45] Stargrl314: Starfrui
[3:30:46] PiTo_27_: mango hryAdmire
[3:30:46] noninja5: the pear needs to come back
[3:30:46] hwfreak70: We want Kumkwats
[3:30:47] pst0808: #bringbackpears
[3:30:47] VoxelRifts: it's citrus fruits only right?
[3:30:48] xanking96: mango
[3:30:48] fallinitbh: that would be bananas
[3:30:49] supermarcus11: Vault Peaches KEK
[3:30:49] Caigan: mango!
[3:30:52] mossycomet: anita max wynn
[3:30:52] Rku04: pineapple
[3:30:54] pcmode2: Fruit are good
[3:30:54] devo431: Pineapples
[3:30:56] Travess: Vault Hot Wings
[3:30:57] ThisReallyIsMe: Cucumber!
[3:30:57] LaplaceDemon2k: coconut mr iskall
[3:30:59] Rku04: dragonfruit
[3:31:00] falsesymmetry: Not a fan. I like them being passive. Don't wanna add relic runs to the list..
[3:31:01] forelini: banana is needed
[3:31:05] fallinitbh: but i love the idea
[3:31:06] xanking96: mangos and pine appples
[3:31:07] forelini: and papaya
[3:31:08] zeus_o9o2: Sadge BibleThump

[3:31:10] samsam21amb: dragonfruit
[3:31:13] Rku04: dragonfruit  is a
[3:31:14] tre_2018: @juub406 also there is a setting so you can get your stuff back automatically without paying that I also use.
[3:31:16] mirohtomysoul: I enjoy doing the relics
[3:31:19] fallinitbh: did you know pistachios are fruit?
[3:31:19] the_great_tan: we want durian 🤣🤣
[3:31:19] fultiaan: true
[3:31:20] Danymaddox: i agree, love collections
[3:31:20] highfivinhippo: Brussel sprouts
[3:31:20] juub406: @tre_2018 maybe that's my trajectory
[3:31:22] iljalz: @Travess LUL
[3:31:22] Tech_16: Vault Hunters Suika
[3:31:22] sivzzz: @sivzzz yeah that would be the point. but its very random. if you get a legendary scrappy, you get like a 25% chance to put it onto an omega base. I think thats good crafting
[3:31:25] mayaicefire: I love collections tasks
[3:31:27] Travess: Collecting is fun!
[3:31:27] Tazzad: @falsesymmetry Agreed
[3:31:27] Julio_Brz: is this a bumbo dungeon?
[3:31:30] lavacandy1: yup they are fun
[3:31:31] gaymersalsa: this room is so pretty what the heck
[3:31:32] zeus_o9o2: Cupcake <3
[3:31:33] PointlessRider: Dragon fruits
[3:31:36] ShelobsLair_: hermitron was amazing!
[3:31:36] TheReaperOf1985: #BringBackThePear
[3:31:36] karabahk: I remember Hermitron go
[3:31:40] graegrove: looong ago
[3:31:41] runtels: Season 4?
[3:31:41] lalorsa1: collecting things over a time is fun, if the reward is worth it
[3:31:44] falsesymmetry: falseBanana
[3:31:50] magnusx45: Rare fruit that does not reduce health precentage?
[3:31:51] the_great_tan: durian
[3:31:53] alpharaposa: Part of Tango's Decked Out building strategy
[3:31:55] LalaDiable: Hermitron was fun
[3:31:59] TAxels: bell!
[3:31:59] Nugorra: yes, it is. But still would find special crystals better.
[3:32:01] NaruhShousa: i love to complete my relics =3
[3:32:02] Caren9593: the satisfaction of completing relics was so good
[3:32:02] VogelVrouw: i do love the collection aspect, but it sometimes feels impossible on singleplayer worlds
[3:32:07] gaymersalsa: blindskall. what else is new
[3:32:07] lavacandy1: with fruit it wont be for long time
[3:32:08] pcmode2: Nope
[3:32:10] Suffix: It was above
[3:32:11] TAxels: it spawned earlier
[3:32:12] GraftyCook: I like relics the way they are, and the fruits too. I believe in y'all though
[3:32:14] xanking96: mangos dragon fruit and pineappels
[3:32:15] Mercutio42: the champ gave you posion
[3:32:16] fiddlyfudbucket: iskHeart iskHeart iskHeart
[3:32:17] lordsfave: you should add a lunchbox with soulbound to hold the fruit
[3:32:17] TheSplootingCorgi: The champion mayu have spawned upstairs by accident
[3:32:18] 64_Bit_Cake: No just peaches
[3:32:19] maty02msu: you already kill champion
[3:32:20] gyerekecskee: OK, where is Etho?
[3:32:24] smash7711: He  was the poison champ upstairs
[3:32:24] SuiteSunrise: people do love collection tasks
[3:32:24] jgrv: just more random things to juggle idk
[3:32:29] Marknu: it's an actual viable resource for stores in lategame where most players will have all items on farm and not lack most resources but even at 100 oranges are rare
[3:32:30] e_shailee: make them give expertise points
[3:32:32] lavacandy1: also with fruit ppl might take 5 of those 2 min fruit then have like 10min things
[3:32:33] ylme2001: I've done it in sg, level 75
[3:32:34] zebrainap: takes longer but deff not impossible
[3:32:40] EnslavedMoist: I completed them in like 1.5 weeks of playing
[3:32:41] Miss_Didi: Fruit rewards from cards would or wouldn't take life? Because a reward that then takes life would kind of not be a reward anymore
[3:32:42] zeus_o9o2: Watermelon that you have to hold in both hands and smash on your face
[3:32:43] Mercutio42: i think twitch chat is a bit bias lol
[3:32:43] simmo14_: @gyerekecskee doing Etho things
[3:32:45] ShuuNeDere: true
[3:32:50] JashinFanatic: there should be many fruits per relic set in that case. Going from permanent 30 seconds to a single instance of +120 feels pretty bad
[3:32:52] falsesymmetry: Relics are possible in SP for sure
[3:32:52] vhblast: @gaymersalsa can you poll it?
[3:33:02] the_great_tan: you can give them skill points too
[3:33:04] gaymersalsa: whats the question lolol
[3:33:05] Mercutio42: if you have no friend then get pooped on lol jk
[3:33:06] k4ampfwolf: make it so it detects singleplayer worlds and gives you a bonus or something
[3:33:06] fh_chris: I like the current way they is good like you said it gives a sence of achievement yes getting longer on a one off will feel like less of an achievement
[3:33:08] ruby_realist: i think because its an optional buff its okay to have in the game its a fun task
[3:33:08] 64_Bit_Cake: @lavacandy1 yeah but he might do It like mystic pear where you get poison/wither
[3:33:14] lavacandy1: 2 min fruits will be too op
[3:33:14] lt_judzia_dax: lol, mob conga
[3:33:14] mtunny27: @iskall85 will vanilla VH be bedrock compatible?
[3:33:16] Z0eff: That perfect congaline of mobs.... haha
[3:33:20] Teeldove: Personally I love the grinder challenge in single player as a different dynamic to my multi player
[3:33:22] gaymersalsa: @mtunny27 most likely not
[3:33:24] redzero1300: conga conga conga
[3:33:25] ShelobsLair_: So Tango level and not Gem level? KEKW
[3:33:26] aslittledesign: That's why I stopped playing vault hunters :( too many changes that optimized for multiplayer
[3:33:27] VogelVrouw: thats fair, honestly
[3:33:28] asimithehero: Ok, can we get a timey limey then?
[3:33:28] therealtolazytothink: It's good single player, and I have OP if I feel I need to adjust things.
[3:33:28] Marknu: but the question of wutax is honestly still valid why add a get time mechanic, it's still an optin feature that rewards luck with potentially more chance at luck
[3:33:29] gaymersalsa: @mtunny27 nbut i might be wrong
[3:33:29] zeus_o9o2: Ok so i now have to get friends too hunn good pc wasn't enough Kappa
[3:33:32] mossycomet: @iskall85 will there be a modifier where spawners spawn +1 wave?
[3:33:33] vhblast: @gaymersalsa about keeping the relics
[3:33:34] thechair83: What if you have no friends lolol
[3:33:37] lavacandy1: im 5 of those 2min fruits and theres 10 mins , too op
[3:33:37] PiTo_27_: platinum Chatting
[3:33:38] gaymersalsa: @gaymersalsa gotchu
[3:33:38] k4ampfwolf: @lavacandy1 but its rare
[3:33:41] Danymaddox: i do like it because it will preserve the idea of time fiving relics
[3:33:41] the_great_tan: no gold i think
[3:33:43] Pineapple0nPizza: short of having different "versions" for singleplayer with changed drop rates or somethign it's just how it is
[3:33:44] Arvom: Arcade mode is fun in solo
[3:33:44] e_shailee: expertise points
[3:33:45] juub406: 300 vaults in, I've never seen a relic
[3:33:46] ylme2001: A set
[3:33:47] DarkPharaoh: I personally like the idea of working towards relics and then having a passive pay off for the rest of the game. I know i wouldnt use fruits due to just having a bad memory and forgetting them/not wanting to waste them
[3:33:48] fultiaan: i think just fruit is better
[3:33:48] lawliet84: it is way too grindy outside the vault. I dont mind it inside the vault.
[3:33:49] Danymaddox: i like sets tho
[3:33:50] pcmode2: Set
[3:33:52] k4ampfwolf: @lavacandy1 you wont get them often
[3:33:54] 64_Bit_Cake: Set
[3:33:55] Skylion62: i think set would be good
[3:33:58] PiTo_27_: richity set giving platinum YEPERS
[3:33:59] EnteQuackQuack02: I like the POE way with different set sizes
[3:34:05] Joehills: 44 raiders from Joehills have joined! 
[3:34:05] iKayuri: Hey iskall85 I work in game dev, I love hearing you speak with passion of your game this is interesting and cool !
[3:34:06] lawliet84: like gear being hard is fine.
[3:34:06] AngelBunVT: sets are fun :D
[3:34:07] loridasmc: Set would be better
[3:34:08] dia__hi: 5 lemon seeds
[3:34:08] xanking96: 5 diffrent parts
[3:34:12] forelini: maybe maybe stick to citrus fruits?
[3:34:12] nabegane: Fossile lemon fragments
[3:34:14] lawliet84: drawer being hard is not
[3:34:18] Mattsam1234: sets are better
[3:34:19] TAxels: coolness+space vs clarity
[3:34:19] RELENtLESS_55: same
[3:34:20] 0laz_: a set that gives a cool transmog?
[3:34:20] skierbrenn: I have 6 of the 8 relics! they are great
[3:34:20] keonmagic221: I prefer sets
[3:34:21] InflatablePanda: purely visual difference
[3:34:22] supermarcus11: You crunch it and it makes break your treth
[3:34:23] Monatae: I like the idea of collecting lemon slices
[3:34:23] xanking96: yeah like seeds or something
[3:34:26] dia__hi: Seeds for fruits
[3:34:26] iljalz: sets
[3:34:26] gaymersalsa: poll up ok
[3:34:27] 64_Bit_Cake: Figuring out which you need is fun so sets definitely
[3:34:27] alpharaposa: With sets you run into the problem of that one that never shows up while you have ten of another.
[3:34:28] Pineapple0nPizza: 5 of the same - i hate duplicate managment
[3:34:29] phoenix_king_01: well it can give legendary gear (better then omeag , you were talking about)
[3:34:29] ruby_realist: sets are so much fun
[3:34:30] PiTo_27_: but sets are nicer hryUnless
[3:34:32] suuyd: i hate scavengers simgleplayer but the multplayers videos show they are fun
[3:34:32] fh_chris: could be a slice 5 slices make a full fruit
[3:34:33] SuiteSunrise: slice peel seed tree leaf
[3:34:33] lavacandy1: @k4ampfwolf but u get relic booster pack right? it might make vaults more grindyy
[3:34:33] Danymaddox: i love sets
[3:34:34] ValueTown: 5 of the same is less duplicates
[3:34:36] xanking96: yes set
[3:34:38] tre_2018: sets definitly better
[3:34:41] th3chick3ncoop: sets are much nicer
[3:34:42] fantakilla1thewolf: 5 of same
[3:34:43] ladislavcomrade: you get the lemon seeds, lemon back, lemon flesh, and lemon juice lol
[3:34:44] Animeinlove_: Are Vendor room new? :3 never seen before^^ maybe are them above lvl 70 ? :3
[3:34:46] VogelVrouw: 5 of the same feels like it would be easier, but i do like the sets
[3:34:47] 64_Bit_Cake: Is that new vendor room?
[3:34:47] freezingheat_: hi joehill raiders!!!!
[3:34:48] Danymaddox: use statues to trade the set
[3:34:52] zzoasty: both but you can get better rewards for a set
[3:34:52] ruby_realist: yes for decor
[3:34:52] dia__hi: Statues give lemon no?
[3:34:54] pb_b: its a trophy of some sort
[3:34:55] ryan_downy: Why don't you make them different rarity pieces or segments and then you can gamba or wait for all of the higher rarity segment relics
[3:34:57] CollaboK8: it’s nice to have statues for decoration
[3:34:57] zipsiriam: 5 of the same is easier, 5 different "parts" is more interesting
[3:34:57] rytional: 5 of same is best. way easier to understand.
[3:35:00] gaymersalsa: LMAO
[3:35:00] ProfessionalsOnly: LUL
[3:35:00] csheff56: the statues could unlock the new fruits?
[3:35:00] magnusx45: What is this?? Treasure dungeon?
[3:35:01] Z0eff: LUL
[3:35:02] superpig2007: @iskall85 i have a qeastion do you think that adding a sidegrade to the javelin that make the cooldown longer but if you hit a mob the cooldown will be shorter and it will cost less mana(only  the next shot) is agood idea?
[3:35:03] tre_2018: lol
[3:35:04] Travess: Collecting is great. Showing off your collection.
[3:35:07] ThatHairyGuyOG: Make the sets into parts of an item; for the banana, get the peel, the seeds and the fruit itself or something 🤔
[3:35:07] pb_b: but no time on getting statue
[3:35:08] Fildrekk: the mefalitn hate is real
[3:35:09] Z0eff: @magnusx45 venDOORs!
[3:35:09] kibaz_x: i like them lol
[3:35:10] HolocronCoder: As a very different idea, what if each set gave a different permanent bonus? Bonus damage, % item rarity, etc? And collecting duplicate sets increases the bonus (to a limit)?
[3:35:12] comedygold1313: decrease the time granted but make it so you can get the same set like 20 times. 1 or 2 seconds per set completed. and just make it more common overall
[3:35:12] dia__hi: Let's run some Dragon
[3:35:13] bestbla: megalit was right KEKW
[3:35:13] maxxam230: iskall you making me jealous xD,
[3:35:13] Marknu: meffalit 1 iskall 0
[3:35:14] cabobber05: Wait what happened to the player statues that made blocks?
[3:35:15] Fildrekk: just removing her relic
[3:35:17] 0of1est: Ask someone to bring gold in for you lol
[3:35:17] smash7711: Mega us making a good point
[3:35:18] ShelobsLair_: spec observer?
[3:35:18] Dameojin: Stop dieing
[3:35:19] asimithehero: Collecting sets does benefit from multiplayer i think yes. Because higher number even out the rng
[3:35:19] tre_2018: The bank of Iskall is empty
[3:35:19] debzz: make a dragon room with whealty on it
[3:35:20] PRIPYAT715: we asked if you had gold before you went in to the vault
[3:35:22] Fildrekk: Noppers
[3:35:23] magnusx45: VenDOORS? LOL that's omega!
[3:35:26] AngryPurpleCow28: Craft the bronze you have!!!
[3:35:29] connorjan: sets is good because getting a dupe incentivizes trading
[3:35:29] zeus_o9o2: If you had 26 gold
[3:35:30] antegravity: Dragon vault!
[3:35:31] Caren9593: maybe need to complete statue to unlock rewards for that set
[3:35:37] JustAHuman_xD: iskall craft the bronze you got
[3:35:38] rumatomaatti: has he forgotten to put more golf in the purse? or is he out of golf?
[3:35:42] Pineapple0nPizza: i have all the relics so now getting relic fragments etc is useless - i like the idea of changes
[3:35:43] rumatomaatti: gold
[3:35:44] Animeinlove_: does anybody knows about vendor rooms? im not asking iskall im asking the chat matastCuoricino  the man is busy ^^ can't answer everybody but chat can^^
[3:35:44] gaymersalsa: ooh
[3:35:47] ShuuNeDere: for simplicity, 5 of same would be great, like 5 pieces of BibleThump emote fragments
[3:35:49] xanking96: or a trurn around lemon so its a sweat lemon that takes time and gifts hp
[3:35:51] ProfessionalsOnly: Unequip it? :P
[3:35:52] zipsiriam: the biggest issue i see with 5 different over 5 fo the same is inventory clatter @iskall85 otherwise, 5 of the same is easier, 5 different are more "interesting"
[3:35:52] abhinav_agrawal: i ran 23x weathy 4x pirate cove i got 850 gold
[3:35:55] slc_eyeorg: 1 set builds  alter - additional sets can be turned in to Alter for reward
[3:35:57] gaymersalsa: @Animeinlove_ what do you wanna know?
[3:35:59] noahmeredith321: will u do co op vaults today ?
[3:36:01] TheImmortaldonut: I like the set of 5 thing as a long term collection quest
[3:36:02] sophistic_ated: @iskall85 why not make it so you you submit individual relics to a "relic table" which gives you points that can then be exchanged for the rewards? sophis6Sip
[3:36:03] HamswordJr: can you take it off when you do the wrong god alter?
[3:36:11] oshmedy: is vendor room still a thing or is it just the vendor doors
[3:36:12] mossycomet: iskBumbo
[3:36:19] Nightbot: Everything in VH 1.18 is very under development & things might change.. Just Trust the Process-- iskall & Devs
[3:36:19] Animeinlove_: @gaymersalsa never seen vendor room before, are them new or "above x lvl "? :3
[3:36:20] cabobber05: What happened to the player statues?
[3:36:22] Z0eff: dont say twitch chat is smart hryLaf
[3:36:23] AngryPurpleCow28: A relic set from each chest?
[3:36:29] csheff56: why not let the statues unlock the new fruits as an ode to the old and ushering in the new
[3:36:31] ProfessionalsOnly: I mean... You're incentivised to trade if you need 5 of the same as well
[3:36:33] JAHislife_: I like the fruit idea but what if they were like trinkets with limited uses but where you could get like +1 strength or speed?
[3:36:35] Fildrekk: but makes them even harder to complete in single player
[3:36:35] TheSplootingCorgi: Collecting always fun. HUman urge to horde
[3:36:36] AngryPurpleCow28: Wooden relic or gilded relic
[3:36:36] waviertech9335: I'm a casual player and love the long term collecting
[3:36:41] cursedoutlaw45: you can make statues out of only decorative collectibles
[3:36:42] gaymersalsa: @gaymersalsa added in update 13! unsure about levels though, cant remember if he mentioned it in the viddy he released earlier today
[3:36:43] tymac300: just watched the update video, pagging so hard
[3:36:44] ShelobsLair_: 10 minutes left to find and complete alter
[3:36:46] gaymersalsa: !release
[3:36:46] Nightbot: Vault Hunters update 13 is live on the Hermitcraft Vault Hunters server for testing! Public release will likely be out on Sunday the 14th. Check out iskall's video on the changes: https://youtu.be/CrAUh0SOGY0?si=Qw4iZq7S3-Kis9sv
[3:36:46] 0kingtay0: sadly can’t tread on single player
[3:36:48] JashinFanatic: would you give a set of fruits per relic set or just one?
[3:36:50] Dameojin: Sets may increase trading insensitive but it will reduce how often you can exchange the completed collection
[3:36:51] pb_b: yep totally
[3:36:52] the_great_tan: i have idea iskall please listen you give choice to players if they want to submit 3 of 5 relics in a set or 4 or 5 and give them fruits accordingly like for 3 or 4 you can give lemon for 5 you can give orange and if you trade in 2 sets you can give tbem more expensive fruits
[3:36:52] Mattsam1234: can we get a new transmog with the pedestal one?
[3:36:55] TAxels: ooo god armor sets
[3:36:57] 0kingtay0: trade*
[3:36:59] Tech_16: statues turn into Suika
[3:37:02] GraftyCook: Yeah that sounds awesome! More transmogs!
[3:37:04] Mercutio42: i would remove completely if its this troublesome and has been since update 9
[3:37:07] AmethystVicious: what about if you get a better reward the higher percent of the set you complete ie: turn in 2 pieces to get lemon or 3 pieces for orange
[3:37:10] AngryPurpleCow28: Just give me a transmog for an ornate relic
[3:37:11] Mattsam1234: Reason to keep the pedestals
[3:37:11] Teeldove: I love my statue room. It feels very cool to show off my collection
[3:37:12] TheImmortaldonut: OR maybe you collect the dry for a bigger reward than turning in 5 of a kind?
[3:37:12] ShuuNeDere: u know, u can also make it that u can submit 5 same items or 1 sets, but the rewards are different
[3:37:13] nabegane: Banana armor
[3:37:13] alpharaposa: Relic armor transmog
[3:37:13] pb_b: cosmetic would be fine
[3:37:14] lalorsa1: Maybe the set could be a seed, specific pot, soil, water and harvester for each fruit?
[3:37:14] th3chick3ncoop: unlock the statues and then you can turn in extras to it to unlock rewards.
[3:37:14] asimithehero: I hate collecting Smadge
[3:37:14] TobyButt89: We do love being vein, and we do enjoy flexing what we've collected
[3:37:15] 17power: maybe statues give a health buff instead of time?
[3:37:17] Animeinlove_: @gaymersalsa I already LOVE THEM WAAAAAAAAAAA matastCuoricino im waiting the release for us impatiently :3
[3:37:19] tre_2018: transmogs?
[3:37:19] Danymaddox: new transmogs for completing sets? ummmm
[3:37:24] Giafone: there could be different size relics that give 1-5 seconds depending on how many items the set needs!
[3:37:29] mtunny27: would you suggest restarting with update 13 if we just started?
[3:37:31] TheImmortaldonut: Collect the set**
[3:37:32] AngryPurpleCow28: Chest based relic
[3:37:35] Mercutio42: Legacy statues
[3:37:37] magdaluo66: dungeon
[3:37:39] zolexa1369: 1st set gives statue, after that you "feed" the statue more relics to obtain more fruit
[3:37:40] tre_2018: @Danymaddox yaaaaaas! Imagine running round the vault lik a dragon
[3:37:40] lalorsa1: Maybe the set of a fruit could be a seed, specific pot, soil, water and harvester for each fruit?
[3:37:40] ladycorvo: statues of people that unlock their armor sets
[3:37:42] redzero1300: dungeon downstairs
[3:37:43] Sicknez_: get relic and then lemons are great
[3:37:43] magdaluo66: down
[3:37:43] nabegane: Transmogs for tools?
[3:37:43] gaymersalsa: @gaymersalsa same!!!
[3:37:46] Pineapple0nPizza: the current rewards feel valuable and worth the effort
[3:37:47] ShelobsLair_: spec observer sir? 9 minutes
[3:37:51] kattenbrokken: What about the statues stay but they give oranges every day and then you can craft up the oranges or something like that
[3:37:54] Monatae: cheer500 omg I want am entire fruit based armor transmog set please please please sir
[3:37:55] pb_b: fruit collection but the statue is just a side cosmetic thingy
[3:37:55] Z0eff: LUL
[3:37:56] dia__hi: LUL LUL LUL
[3:37:56] crist0_st0p: why not making them the trade for the fruits of eatch set?
[3:37:57] gaymersalsa: HAHAHAHHAHAA
[3:38:00] gaymersalsa: BASED
[3:38:01] ladycorvo: like statue of False gives cosmetic set
[3:38:01] eonzcarr: HAHAHAHAHA
[3:38:01] ThatHairyGuyOG: Or make it non-physical; just add the relics to a menu so they'll be auto-collected for all player types
[3:38:02] gaymersalsa: GIGACHAD
[3:38:04] Caren9593: or use the transmogs already in game that are unobtainable at the moment
[3:38:04] Lemon_RdBrn: maybe statue can drop a fruit on timer?
[3:38:07] JAHislife_: Change the current relics from time to like skill point type buffs and then add the fruit system
[3:38:10] ShuuNeDere: LuL
[3:38:12] kibaz_x: maybe each set gives a buff, life cupcake set makes food give more saturation (dumb example)
[3:38:13] ShelobsLair_: gigchad move KEKW
[3:38:13] Rachaelrose1212: its only hard to work out because they are not in JEI
[3:38:14] Nightbot: Support the devs & the pack.  https://www.patreon.com/VaultHunters
[3:38:15] mirohtomysoul: KEKW
[3:38:16] missjillian129: U could do sets with better fruit or 5 of the same for not as good so you can do something with duplicates?
[3:38:16] Grimm8_: Use your new mob egg block to display a cool graphic for relic completions
[3:38:17] Dark0Morphi: Collect cards for statues each statue gives a benediction for limited number of vaults
[3:38:17] Zaraca90: Then why do Etho go in first?
[3:38:21] Marknu: You could make it less random buy making a fruit vendor like black market so you can trade in relics for fruits with different types of fruit having different relic part costs then making the status collectable as is just with no bonus
[3:38:22] Kadeshi_: could you add some of the player sets as a reward for completing a relic set? makes completing them multiple times worthwile too
[3:38:23] Miss_Didi: @falsesymmetry nicely done.
[3:38:25] Pineapple0nPizza: just gotta make Etho enter vaults first
[3:38:26] crazyshezy: Can we have ven-doors where we submit/sacrifice our loot to get gold? meaning you can submit unidentified scappy+ item and get 1 gold or submit your ores and do the same? @iskall85
[3:38:26] sofie0125: i feel like the most important thing is that its a choice so you dont feel forced to opt in
[3:38:27] asimithehero: Copege
[3:38:29] zeus_o9o2: @zaraca90 LUL LUL
[3:38:30] kattenbrokken: @lemon_rdbrn thats What i said
[3:38:34] jammanty: How close are the hermits to completing the challenge?
[3:38:38] maxxam230: relics should give you an special modifier type and scale on the amount you have
[3:38:49] zeus_o9o2: Don't die
[3:38:51] tre_2018: was that a banana skin?
[3:38:54] asimithehero: Memes > Mechanics
[3:38:59] dia__hi: Uh huh.. "meme"…
[3:39:01] Skipp_Jenkins: eeeeskall
[3:39:02] 0of1est: Woo
[3:39:05] redzero1300: trinkie
[3:39:06] sivzzz: also Etho is used to it. iskall can be ethical on his own
[3:39:06] Z0eff: iskall.json strikes again
[3:39:11] Mercutio42: relic are safer for people dont like the push the time with fruit because of anxiety lol
[3:39:12] iljalz: niceee
[3:39:14] usernameunavailablevtff: I like the fact that it should give fruits tbh, like still ties relics with vault timer, but maybe that need for fruits will be answered by braziers and new loot solutions, so idk.
[3:39:15] Nightbot: Watch iskall85’s VOD’s at https://youtube.com/@vodskall85
[3:39:16] Aylabar: I was thinking a transmog unlock when you get every relic. Maybe a fruit merchant or banana sword
[3:39:16] Zinoba: YEP
[3:39:18] samsam21amb: wow
[3:39:21] gharmonica: Make it that completing a relic set increase the chance of getting fruits
[3:39:22] HarcosMalac: YEP
[3:39:22] Fildrekk: i never find those Ledditing
[3:39:23] strandberggg: never got a archive in that duengon
[3:39:24] sabrina1202r: wow
[3:39:24] the_great_tan: i have idea iskall you give choice to players if they want to submit 3 of 5 relics in a set or 4 or 5 and give them fruits accordingly like for 3 or 4 you can give lemon for 5 you can give orange and if you trade in 2 sets you can give tbem more expensive fruits it will be fun to hold on or submit for less time fruit
[3:39:25] ShelobsLair_: Sir you're running out of time for alter
[3:39:26] strandberggg: always empty
[3:39:28] kattenbrokken: Paggers
[3:39:30] MichiBird: Pagman
[3:39:43] tre_2018: Fandabbydozie
[3:39:48] kenneth_432: why not think of relics as a benefit for playing a longer time?
[3:39:50] Mercutio42: splat
[3:39:59] neednaame: I JUST GOT A TREASURE CHEST SCROLL
[3:40:02] TAxels: elixir is still sketchy too
[3:40:04] degabber: I miss mystery boxes

[3:40:08] e_shailee: in this here channel we believe!

[3:40:14] Paudot: gg my points

[3:40:15] nightmare_xz: We need more potions pls
[3:40:16] tre_2018: @neednaame Niiiiiiice. I've only ever got 1 of those
[3:40:17] Jarhielt: Is jade junk?

[3:40:22] xanking96: bye gonne eat
[3:40:29] pst0808: Maybe add an expertise for +30s in the vault? I really like the longer vaults (Still remembering the Jardonk >1h, > 10 treasure rooms vault from S1)
[3:40:30] ShuuNeDere: living? where? modCheck
[3:40:31] eXQyu_: since god altar is more common shouldnt the particles color differ from objectives (for hunter and goggles)
[3:40:31] toasty_ryebread: guaranteed artifact + trinky boi
[3:40:36] tre_2018: @degabber same. Need emeralds on sky vault. :/
[3:40:37] Zinoba: Finding a treasure chest scroll is illegal in this chat hrySir
[3:40:45] Marknu: You could change the concept of relics as something that do not affect the vault but the vault crystal cost ie each relic reduces crystal cost 10%
[3:40:46] bafoon__: are burger parts worth keeping for future updates once your level 100 or should they be diffused?
[3:40:46] Kairoger: iskDab
[3:40:46] chad_masters: The first time you complete a set get the pedestal. Then you have to use that pedestal to assemble additional sets and it'll pop out a corresponding fruit. Make it so thr gui is internal storage for that type to solve space issues
[3:40:51] 60wattlightbulb: Door?
[3:40:54] ShelobsLair_: time running out sir
[3:41:07] ZaZZoto: My felling is that the relics is like a feel good u are leveling up getting stronger faster better at looting and the extra time adds to that feel good right now it feels like apart of the game
[3:41:08] kibaz_x: called it
[3:41:08] tre_2018: @ShelobsLair_ it's fiiiiiiiiiiiine
[3:41:15] elffern: relic statues could slightly increase finding that set in the future?
[3:41:18] rumatomaatti: are those new PUIs
[3:41:24] maty02msu: maybe add a system for multi selction of hunter? like more levels in hunter allows more specs
[3:41:28] Elissa_Rose: @ShelobsLair_ @ShelobsLair_ you must be new here lol
[3:41:35] ShelobsLair_: @ShelobsLair_ for you maybe, my boints monkaS
[3:41:35] 64_Bit_Cake: I missed a bit so you may have mentioned this but smelting the relics in a furnace feels... Wrong. Can there be a dedicated table?
[3:42:02] AngelBunVT: angelf7Teehee angelf7Teehee angelf7Teehee

[3:50:02] Timberwolf24: Cheer300 Hey Iskall, saw your video reading comments and just wanted to add my two cents. As a viewer I don't have as much time to spend on hermitcraft. And as a player I don't play vanilla anymore. So I normally only watch 2 perspectives, but I really appreciate this VH server because now I try to find time to watch 4/5/6 different perspectives. Thank you for a modded SMP.
[3:50:03] Paudot: gamba mess loophole

[3:50:49] dcptcncrescendo: but favor is being said when people mean reputation
[3:50:51] Marknu: false got him there

[4:08:32] saxymatt: After this series is over, are you going to resume your singleplayer lets play of VH or will you start over?
[4:08:35] gaymersalsa: @Tintelicious a twist on the "100 days in minecraft" concept, filling the days between hc seasons and vhsmp seasons

[4:09:21] EVO_Gaming6000: The thing I like about the og vault hunters is that each room in the vault was a different theme, now every room is the same.
[4:09:21] wumst3r: Iskall i WOULD NOT mind at all pleas keep it going, I love this series
[4:09:29] NaruhShousa: we need more hermit vault hunters o//

[4:09:43] gaymersalsa: !brazier @Kevin33_3

[4:09:50] kingboo314: iskDab
[4:09:52] psylence7: I think there will always be a call for more VH content; this has actually been a good way for me to get back to some of the hermits I've barely watched all S9 and felt too behind to get into without a serious binge
[4:09:55] RachelElizabeth92: I would LOVE for him to turn up Impulse KEKW
[4:09:56] Marknu: in the immortal words of sun bruh: Git gud ;)
[4:10:00] VogelVrouw: thats good to hear
[4:10:03] GraftyCook: I love the vault themes. It makes the vaults more consistent

[4:10:21] pakamccormick: "normal" modded mc players are not the best minecraftersXD
[4:10:31] foxpuzzlewood: in the chat can any one say is this a mod ?
[4:10:31] Luxi86: Backseatega
[4:10:34] smash7711: Lots of people think they are helping and meen well but it goes so bad
[4:10:35] sygerious: yeah vault hunters might feel boring after a while (personally), maybe you guys could start a new modded series? i'd be excited for a new modded series every year but that would be really difficult to carry out
[4:10:37] 0of1est: Omg why have I only just noticed petezahhtt is like pizza hut

[4:11:19] gaymersalsa: joe hryBoggies
[4:11:22] jammanty: I'm pretty sure I've seen Pete do it in the past.

[4:11:43] gaymersalsa: all the garbage kekw
[4:11:51] Pineapple0nPizza: I didn't realise that you had no chance for a reputation without affinity at first - Impulse might have the same confusion
[4:12:05] da_hyun0615: Flying garbage lol
[4:12:18] herbertthecow1: hey iskall i know you are losiing your spark for hermitcraft but would you play the life series
[4:12:27] xanking96: who joined the voice chat
[4:12:29] Marknu: only need like 100+ alters to build one with the reputation gain mehanics ;)
[4:12:31] gaymersalsa: @herberthecow1 he has not been invited to the series
[4:12:37] brutusjay: i actually had a question about the altars - when i've watched videos it looks like they complete as soon as you do the thing, but when i did one it told me to go back to the altar - is that just based on the vault difficulty setting or something more specific?
[4:12:38] sabrina1202r: hey joe is here on vc
[4:12:39] gaymersalsa: @xanking96 guessing thats joehills hryLaf
[4:12:46] TheImmortaldonut: @pineapple0npizza I actually didn't know that. Glad I started taking levels in divine

[5:05:59] BlazeSpaceRl: @iskall85 maybe there should be a cooldown on the  ascension like divine paradox
[5:06:04] Grim_Stoner: Gamba?
[5:06:08] netseeker: @iskall i heard that Etho has alot off gold =)

[5:06:37] momaggie1273: Iskall, I must be getting luck from watching your stream because I just found a second treasure room I had a key for
[5:06:38] HamswordJr: I think the gold issue will be fixed if you add the draft vaults. because you can run them without gear
[5:06:38] gaymersalsa: um
[5:06:38] stany_d: free win
[5:06:40] lazypandaman: brace yourself
[5:06:40] TheRedBrain: so what ascension class will you choose?
[5:06:43] saxymatt: whats the max amount of braziers you need to complete a vault?
[5:06:43] SunflowerMead0w: no
[5:06:49] HazzaBazza9: it would be advantageous for someone on the server to set up a bank with interest to profit off al the deaths on

[5:06:58] capitatebow2387: What is this objective
[5:06:59] BlazeSpaceRl: iskallBURN
[5:07:00] rytional: just complete and do a second one
[5:07:01] KalunRS: just do the vault normally, waste of trinket use tbh
[5:07:02] gaymersalsa: classic
[5:07:02] zeus_o9o2: @BlazeSpaceRl iskall is not a theif LUL
[5:07:05] trefz_: @Zinoba yeah but if u use the wrath totem on your vial u can already get 90% more dmg
[5:07:11] kibaz_x: nah that was hot
[5:07:12] tangerinedoro: Nahhh
[5:07:13] zeus_o9o2: thief
[5:07:13] thiccmilkguy: "burnt to death" would be such a hilarious vault death
[5:07:17] tangerinedoro: it's bait
[5:07:35] netseeker: @zeus_o9o2 well borrowing isnt stealing.. if he leaves a iou note =)
[5:07:43] Zinoba: @Zinoba truu but it can be +mana regen, soul chance etc depending on the god

[5:07:55] thiccmilkguy: he needs pog for the junk but naah he spent like 20 of them on fundi
[5:07:55] CedH1: oh I would love to be a lock vault
[5:07:57] AlliBlueS: @P3pp3rF1y you didnt see the finnish laughing at us when it was 2:5, and in the last like 2/3 minutes we score like 4 goal, the finnish guy looked so pissed LOL
[5:08:00] muppification: YES
[5:08:04] e_shailee: noooooo
[5:08:06] zeus_o9o2: @netseeker i meant as a joke when he stole treasure chest
[5:08:07] gaymersalsa: @tangerinedoro nah wasnt sure if completion was good or not
[5:08:11] Trall543: IMO braziers are now even better than elixer vaults for doing loot crystal runs
[5:08:11] BlazeSpaceRl: no please no
[5:08:12] BlazeSpaceRl: yeah
[5:08:16] notTheRealHelmis: locked on hard difficulty?
[5:08:18] asmodanprime: please don't
[5:08:18] pb_b: yeah it is a double feel bad
[5:08:19] BlazeSpaceRl: agreed Iskallman
[5:08:20] littlepepperbutt: Nooo
[5:08:21] BananaSama42: I really hate the mummies! You did so good with them!! :p
[5:08:22] saxymatt: Can ascension vaults be co-op
[5:08:22] thiccmilkguy: bye bye souls + money?
[5:08:23] e_shailee: no need for locking
[5:08:23] gaymersalsa: new dunge oooo
[5:08:27] tangerinedoro: @gaymersalsa yeah fair let's save it for when we have stacks
[5:08:27] stephaniebutton23: just want to say hi, i wont be watching live as i want to watch FIVE HOURS??? in order lol
[5:08:28] melonhunt: maybe depending on difficulty?
[5:08:31] Baab83: Makes it more interesting to have the choice
[5:08:33] LunaticGoneMad: Dont Listen to X ik he wants you to add a negative to these
[5:08:36] Zinoba: gamers always wanna run brazier but how never wanna em"brace her"
[5:08:38] SeriousCreeper: ooooh new dungeon, who dis?
[5:08:43] gaymersalsa: @stephaniebutton23 hahah hello! enjoy the vod o7
[5:08:49] MasterElementsCommissions: Hey Iskall in my last vault I found 2 treasure chest scrolls from the treasure sand in a room.
[5:08:51] CedH1: eeehhh I don't really know, because you choose to play an ascension, it should be locked in my opinion giving the fact it's so great if you manage to stack a lot
[5:08:53] pb_b: well its still a choice so
[5:08:54] chewbacca_0312: chewbacca_0312 subscribed with Prime. 
[5:08:58] Buggy_Girl: yeah i think unlocked is better
[5:08:59] e_shailee: give the player choice, not destiny
[5:09:02] gaymersalsa: looks very nice goodge
[5:09:02] zeus_o9o2: iskall goal is 85 stacks
[5:09:06] ramnite_tv: @Zinoba Ah yes, the new objective, brassiere mrmatt17Monka
[5:09:11] muppification: i kinda miss adrenaline of locked vaults Awkward
[5:09:15] timmolaa: Locked vault with 50% discount on buying back body
[5:09:19] gaymersalsa: @muppification based
[5:09:24] Zaraca90: If you get a scav you have no way to do, and you can't leave
[5:09:26] gaymersalsa: @Zinoba hryLafExceptInPain
[5:09:35] gaymersalsa: 1x POG

[5:09:37] zeus_o9o2: @timmolaa agrreed
[5:09:37] VogelVrouw: yeah they do feel extra exciting and intense
[5:09:41] gaymersalsa: @skierbrenn hryAdmire
[5:09:52] Baab83: But thats part of the game
[5:09:53] netseeker: @zeus_o9o2 sorry... lol =)
[5:09:54] furiexx: Will you be able to upgrade to the new vh version without a new world btw?
[5:09:59] gaymersalsa: @furiexx yes
[5:10:03] notTheRealHelmis: so forcing people to push themselves
[5:10:08] bone_bytes: hryAdmire
[5:10:13] gaymersalsa: omg lectern
[5:10:13] Baab83: Same as greed
[5:10:15] pb_b: but you lose money and stacks
[5:10:15] CedH1: would it be possible to make it lock but if you dont succeed you just keep what you enter with and loose all the loot you got in the vault?
[5:10:18] thepolkyman: on this here channel, we finish vaults
[5:10:18] Herathina: hryAdmire
[5:10:21] gaymersalsa: TWO LECTERNS
[5:10:22] SuiteSunrise: oh gawd. what are we locking?
[5:10:22] lukeminer2: locked with old soulflame would be fun
[5:10:24] gaymersalsa: OOOO
[5:10:26] e_shailee: isnt that in every vault and challenge? it's up to you to get better
[5:10:30] CheekyGirl43: yay fab
[5:10:30] BlazeSpaceRl: it is huge
[5:10:35] notTheRealHelmis: higher difficulties for the challenge i think
[5:10:36] bone_bytes: hryOOOO
[5:10:40] Danymaddox: I do like it to be locked
[5:10:42] StrangePanthers: Bit having to buy ur stuff back if locked...
[5:10:43] SunflowerMead0w: you already recouped the cost!
[5:10:44] Zinoba: iskall aggressively supporting players like "YOU CAN AND WILL DO THIS"
[5:10:48] fAt_CaT123456: Hii I haven't seen ur vh in so long
[5:10:48] kirakiraaisu: i start to doubt myself at the 5 minute mark
[5:10:48] Buggy_Girl: if they are already losing the skull, dont make them then spend the money to get their body back, they wont want to try again
[5:10:49] LunaticGoneMad: what do you mean exiting will cost you a pog?
[5:10:50] pb_b: maybe locked and grace?
[5:10:59] timmolaa: Could do buy back at 50% discount
[5:11:10] SeriousCreeper: i think locking it actually would discourage people to push the ascension levels higher
[5:11:12] fh_chris: what about having 2 tiers  it locked on one where it gives you 2x stack each with with no option to recover items
[5:11:13] saxymatt: are you going to run a cake vault for the next habba event?
[5:11:16] Grandwigg: i like the choice element to the new objective.
[5:11:17] Ferdster02: As it is now there is no downside to just running ascension vaults
[5:11:25] gaymersalsa: emotional and psychological BASED
[5:11:27] tangerinedoro: i think it's good they're not locked, it would just be a feelbad for no reason. at least if you have to bail you'll still have the loot without spending gold
[5:11:30] balu_98: Maybe a gamerule that peaople.
[5:11:31] lordsfave: Locked and grace is good
[5:11:38] lordsfave: or locked and free buy back
[5:11:44] pb_b: yeah i would love a clutch too in a moment of desperation too
[5:11:51] Robbie0301: true words of greed
[5:11:51] Korgis: locked vaults is just forced stress on casual players :P
[5:11:53] pb_b: it would be a huge feel good
[5:11:55] balu_98: Maybe a gamerule that people can choose, what they want?
[5:11:58] e_shailee: i think losing your streak is enough incentive via oppurtunity cost
[5:12:01] smolkato: is this ascension? just went away to watch the update video haha
[5:12:02] 0laz_: is he doing the soul flame thingy?
[5:12:06] dspbird: with more and more options to spend gold,  is there a gold farming mode.
[5:12:06] melonhunt: if the buy back is free, then whats the point of locked tho?
[5:12:06] muttpacket: I went from such a wimp - leaving with 4 minutes remaining to actually raiding a blacksmith with 18 seconds to go and making it out.
[5:12:06] Grandwigg: lol. watching the video- VenDoors. Love it!
[5:12:06] LunaticGoneMad: locked and the old after life mechanic of getting your stuff in the state they were before the vault?
[5:12:07] TheReaperOf1985: Or we never try, because its locked iskDab
[5:12:07] zeus_o9o2: also you got a strength no ?
[5:12:09] AmethystVicious: psyche hunters
[5:12:10] gaymersalsa: ????
[5:12:10] thiccmilkguy: if braizer is played in coop, is the 10 objective for both or per person (like elixer)?
[5:12:16] strandberggg: no they are in twitch chat
[5:12:16] lynx235: what if the people are worse because they worry more about falling the value
[5:12:16] Danymaddox: Locked + gold discount based on dificulty??
[5:12:16] krux702: You may also have people who would never try ascension due to fear of losing
[5:12:17] lordsfave: @smolkato yep
[5:12:17] VogelVrouw: sure
[5:12:22] lazypandaman: quote that
[5:12:23] saxymatt: If you were a vacation what would you be?
[5:12:24] zeus_o9o2: @thiccmilkguy both
[5:12:31] KalunRS: I played a lot of games where death costs was needed for a gold sink, but it also ruined improving in the game, because people wouldn’t limit test
[5:12:35] iRoyalCoconut: It's all about GREED.
[5:12:38] SeriousCreeper: losing the ascension item could already be motivation enough to push, especially at higher levels. Dying cause of locked may discourage trying at all
[5:12:38] Jackkabuki: "Most Babies are Zombies."  Thats a sentence you dont want to hear irl
[5:12:40] gaymersalsa: yessss peepoHappy
[5:12:43] ShelobsLair_: @gaymersalsa no gamba or did i miss it?
[5:12:46] volaticbrad: update comes out on my birthday thanks sir
[5:12:50] RubberDuckyKnight: 5 raiders from RubberDuckyKnight have joined! 
[5:12:52] Z0eff: just got back, he going for ascensoin? was else did I miss?
[5:12:53] gaymersalsa: @ShelobsLair_ no we just taking the new vault in
[5:12:53] tangerinedoro: no gamba too low stakes lol
[5:12:54] iljalz: @Jackkabuki LUL
[5:12:55] thiccmilkguy: @zeus_o9o2 i think 10 for both would be way too less
[5:12:56] gaymersalsa: welcome raiders !
[5:13:02] smolkato: ascension looking damn good tbh. wish there was something like this before, can’t wait to try it!
[5:13:03] ShelobsLair_: @gaymersalsa ok
[5:13:06] gaymersalsa: @Z0eff yeh its an ascension vault with brazier obj
[5:13:09] RubberDuckyKnight: rubber114Dance rubber114Dance rubber114Dance rubber114Dance
[5:13:12] iljalz: yes
[5:13:15] mondgesicht98: I dont like the new modifier in this objective have you considered using the old modifier ? confusing for new player
[5:13:16] MasterElementsCommissions: Impulse is base building, I am watching his stream as well
[5:13:20] foreverlizzie_xo: does he play music normally ?
[5:13:23] SeriousCreeper: does the warden pearl work on an ascension crystal though?
[5:13:26] zeus_o9o2: @thiccmilkguy but the buff is for both so i feel same thing
[5:13:26] tonTeufel: is there any reason now to not run afterlife on every lvl 100 vault?
[5:13:27] noninja5: ye
[5:13:29] Zinoba: i saw a post recently asking for suggestions on what people were watching in between the HC season and SO many people said VH!
[5:13:30] gaymersalsa: @foreverlizzie_xo no, just on breaks/intros
[5:13:35] Ferdster02: Maybe locked and like a 50% discount on buy back. There is still the loss of gold if you fail, youre being pushed for completing since it's locked and it creates a risk to just running ascension vaults. As it is now ascension vaults have no downside so you would never run rando vaults
[5:13:37] TAxels: 2016
[5:13:38] gaymersalsa: @Zinoba BASED
[5:13:38] maha381: 2019

[5:13:46] CedH1: I cant wait to grind the ascension, i'm aiming 100 flames
[5:13:46] Baab83: Who came up with the idea for Ascension?
[5:13:47] gaymersalsa: kek
[5:13:54] SunflowerMead0w: wow
[5:13:57] maha381: november 29
[5:13:59] notTheRealHelmis: maybe a random modifier? double crate loot but locked/grace
[5:14:01] maha381: OMG im so smart

[5:14:09] zeus_o9o2: when did 2029 happened Kappa Kappa DinoDance
[5:14:21] thiccmilkguy: @zeus_o9o2 and the plunder negative is for both as well. Plus the talk to make it negative for hard difficulty as well
[5:14:25] tangerinedoro: HELPPPP THE DYLAN THAT GUESSED?
[5:14:34] FaeAura: I definitely love braziers replacing monoliths. it seems like just that bit more of a lastingly fun objective
[5:14:34] 1mnotjoe: are relics gone/changed in this update
[5:14:37] 1mnotjoe: ?
[5:14:39] nystadt: Have you runned any cake vault yet

[5:14:48] gaymersalsa: omg
[5:14:49] LadyMcRibs: Yooo
[5:14:55] thiccmilkguy: nevermind it would be too buffed if individual
[5:14:56] TheSilver_Kitsune: the8bitPoggers
[5:14:57] Zaraca90: now leave
[5:14:57] toasterburn809: This almost seems like baby mode TBH
[5:14:58] KalunRS: @nystadt he ran cake vaults at the start of the stream

[5:15:10] Tru_n_Blu: Are you still doing the lvl 50 subclass thingy or implementing eternals?
[5:15:11] SunflowerMead0w: I love how no one can say that word
[5:15:12] the_whtvr: the braziers seem like a really cool objective now :D
[5:15:14] tangerinedoro: YOOOO
[5:15:15] gaymersalsa: poggSpinskall
[5:15:15] RaulRB36: honestly the new brasiers seem bad, people will probably try them 2-3 times, then just stack the buffs and ignore the rest
[5:15:16] Gorbyas: pillage pr exit? huh?
[5:15:16] zeus_o9o2: @iskall85 maybe just skip rooms ?
[5:15:24] BlazeSpaceRl: i cant WAIT to run ascension vaults
[5:15:25] gaymersalsa: !brazier gorbyas
[5:15:25] Nightbot: Light the Monoliths objective has been replaced with Light the Braziers in update 13. Braziers appear in every room and have a range of positive modifiers that get added once you click on them! After you acquire the required amount of Braziers, you can continue to Pillage additional Braziers for good loot at the cost of negative/cursed modifiers, or exit the vault to complete it.
[5:15:26] zebrainap: it shouldn't tbh
[5:15:26] LsVxPagie: was just about to ask that haha
[5:15:29] starlight_jess: I like the creepers with funny hats
[5:15:32] Z0eff: are brazier objectives a little... too good? monkaHmm
[5:15:33] lazypandaman: i was just about to ask
[5:15:38] gaymersalsa: @Z0eff hryLaf
[5:15:47] CedH1: -50% is huge no?
[5:15:49] tangerinedoro: i like braziers, it's gonna be sooo good in skyvaults
[5:16:00] Ferdster02: @Z0eff it does seem that way, huh
[5:16:00] gaymersalsa: SSSsss
[5:16:02] thiccmilkguy: @Z0eff and also a little too too easy
[5:16:09] gaymersalsa: cause its your favourite theme hryYimmy
[5:16:11] Zinoba: desert moment
[5:16:13] Gorbyas: @gaymersalsa ohhh ty salsa iskHeart

[5:16:21] gaymersalsa: @Zinoba AKSHUALLY its a mesa.
[5:16:21] KalunRS: brazier reward crates are worse than the others to counter the level of difficulty if that makes sense

[5:16:49] gaymersalsa: ad watchers: dark seal inspired from LoL since vault cast
[5:17:02] KalunRS: brazier objective is the 1st objective for newer players, so making it inherently difficult isn’t really something devs want I assume
[5:17:04] marbene: Is it just me or are the gamesounds a little too quiet?
[5:17:05] tangerinedoro: remember that iskall doesn't control ads, they're put there by twitch 🙏
[5:17:09] da_hyun0615: I cant sleep so... im back lol
[5:17:20] zeus_o9o2: ohhhh dark seal i buy it then die   2 mins later and sell it great Kappa BibleThump
[5:17:24] gaymersalsa: @marbene imo theyre good, we hear him a lot better
[5:17:25] thiccmilkguy: iskall likes pirate. definitely THE ONLY reason I am using adblocker
[5:17:25] mygenfordt: is the loot equally random on all pillage monuments? or does some disadvantages reward you more?
[5:17:26] Robbie0301: @kalunrs it’s actually the second objective, they moved elixir to be the first one
[5:17:27] rektarina1594: @KalunRS they swapped it so now elixir is first
[5:17:30] Nightbot: Everything in VH 1.18 is very under development & things might change.. Just Trust the Process-- iskall & Devs

[5:18:24] zeus_o9o2: skips rooms until omega ?
[5:18:24] SeriousCreeper: does brazier objective give more exp than elixir?
[5:18:27] MasterElementsCommissions: @tangerinedoro Thanks
[5:18:29] PyderMandy: @mefallit !! Ty for my sub 💚
[5:18:29] KalunRS: @robbie0301 they should probably revert that then

[5:18:35] DcNiemandd1: That looks like Im gonna have some trinkets.. finally
[5:18:40] abibernard: speed run for omega rooms?
[5:18:40] P3pp3rF1y: with 85% item rarity you are getting close to what Etho is running all the time :D
[5:18:41] zeus_o9o2: @SeriousCreeper same as monolith completion
[5:18:42] superllumina: you have no stacks so not much loss
[5:18:43] SeriousCreeper: @gaymersalsa nice
[5:18:51] mart1n_g: did you ever make the poison build you wanted to do in an episode before holidays break?
[5:18:51] gaymersalsa: Copege
[5:18:55] Z0eff: genuinely feels a little too strong, brazier objective
[5:18:56] JashinFanatic: secret room

[5:19:21] Nightbot: Watch iskall85’s VOD’s at https://youtube.com/@vodskall85
[5:19:22] Batchz05: y'know what ne interesting if the more ascension vaults you do the higher the chance is for rarer loot
[5:19:25] KalunRS: not greeding after crafting a trinket is such a feelsbadman moment
[5:19:25] zeus_o9o2: keys*
[5:19:28] kot7k: imagine mushroom room
[5:19:31] Baab83: Is it not really broken? Even when you run level 1 all the time you get so many good modifiers

[5:25:09] migats21official: You should have saved those crates for your video
[5:25:10] NakeZast: Very early vault in Iskall's terms.

[5:25:16] zeus_o9o2: whatttt theres 100 language and bro choose violence
[5:25:17] gaymersalsa: ASCEND
[5:25:17] Chibi_Wez: Wait, this isn't yt shorts?
[5:25:17] Zaraca90: One min is a long time
[5:25:21] smolkato: are you able to seal + ascension the vault crystal?
[5:25:22] gaymersalsa: @Chibi_Wez hryLaf
[5:25:26] warkr0: i like no difficulty increase
[5:25:29] e_shailee: what's the ascension modifier item recipe?
[5:25:30] noninja5: trinkit !
[5:25:30] Zinoba: @iskall85 could the ascension icon and maybe stack number be shown like the modifiers of the vault?
[5:25:30] zeus_o9o2: @Zaraca90 LUL LUL
[5:25:35] nomulous: tell that ghost to stop interfering with my research!
[5:25:36] djdan5678: hi
[5:25:36] KalunRS: the streak it self is the difficulty
[5:25:37] the_whtvr: being able to complete one vaults after another is hard enough in itself, true
[5:25:37] Marcin3205: ASCEND to ABE
[5:25:39] 64_Bit_Cake: @smolkato no
[5:25:41] am_andrew: difficulty comes from the streak exactly
[5:25:41] Marcin3205: Kappa
[5:25:47] zebrainap: you and hrry only got to 26 scavs working together so completing is hard enough
[5:25:48] Merrie_Poppins: can someone expain to the me pedestals?
[5:25:53] Baab83: level 1 feels really strong already with those modifiers
[5:25:55] Lizerdman87: I bet scavs get super easy the further in you are
[5:25:56] ddSqueeze: is there an end goal to ascension? or just the journey?
[5:25:57] Nauhar: I agree, streak + not choosing the objective in already a trade for XP
[5:25:59] gaymersalsa: @Merrie_Poppins saving loot from the stream to show on yt episode
[5:26:00] lordsfave: + .5 wild every run
[5:26:03] DieeneLegend: but you dont lose everything, you only lose your streak. So why would anyone run a normal vault?
[5:26:06] iljalz: @Merrie_Poppins for a future video, im guessing
[5:26:08] Wiroe_: Could be that every 5 or 10 stack gets stronger mobs
[5:26:10] SunflowerMead0w: I can’t find the patch notes are they out yet? I wanna know if you fixed that nothing can push or pull from the artisan station
[5:26:14] volaticbrad: it should be very small if so
[5:26:17] gaymersalsa: @SunflowerMead0w not out yet
[5:26:19] Merrie_Poppins: @gaymersalsa  thnx!
[5:26:23] Lizerdman87: elixir and scavs have to be so easy to complete the more stacks you get
[5:26:27] 64_Bit_Cake: Why not black chromatic?
[5:26:30] toasterburn809: As a level 100, i feel like the difficulty has to increase. Scavs are the only objectives that you might not be able to complete
[5:26:31] bunLunaa: @DieeneLegend soul flames cost echo gems
[5:26:40] Merrie_Poppins: @iljalz Thnx!
[5:26:42] togu84: woho äntligen lyckas jag komma när du streamar
[5:26:52] dia__hi: Scatter was so much fun
[5:26:58] breadandbutter07: How does ascension work with multiplayer? Do all players need to complete, or just the one who owns the vault crystal?
[5:27:01] gaymersalsa: @togu84 welcome o/ english though please for moderation purposes :D:D
[5:27:02] 64_Bit_Cake: I love scatter
[5:27:02] mouse_ina_boot: mouse_ina_boot subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 12 months! Hi Iskall, 13 looks great, excited to try cakes!
[5:27:19] 64_Bit_Cake: Please include scatter and that wand in new January build
[5:27:21] zeus_o9o2: is co op allowed in ascension ?
[5:27:22] minipantalon: the sad thing ascending and not getting hard is you are gonna complete the dungeons slightly easier everytime
[5:27:26] KalunRS: unless every vault was the exact same objective in the sense that it’s exact same amount and type, the difficulty is the streak itself and the randomness of the objectives
[5:27:26] fh_chris: does the Pearce and scatter go together
[5:27:28] trendel03: is it a mod or something that let's Iskall put items from his backpack to a chest?
[5:27:39] zeus_o9o2: @fh_chris no one at a time
[5:27:39] SilentSword3975: Why is there a bamboo sword in the drawers?
[5:27:46] 64_Bit_Cake: @trendel03 deposit upgrade on backpack
[5:27:46] smolkato: how do co op vaults + ascension work assuming levels are the same?
[5:27:49] gaymersalsa: @trendel03 peppa's backpack mod
[5:27:49] NakeZast: @trendel03 that would be Modular Routers.
[5:27:51] trendel03: thanks
[5:27:52] Gorbyas: is your junk manager full already?
[5:27:58] TAxels: how's your progress on upgrading the trashcan?
[5:27:59] aniketop123: iskBIRDPOOP
[5:28:05] the_whtvr: @trendel03 deposit upgrade
[5:28:21] zeus_o9o2: does this guy remember the sword he said hes gonna build after coming back from vacation did he build it ?
[5:28:24] ssvkronau: ssvkronau subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months! First time on a Stream, love your Vods and Videos tho
[5:28:33] thiccmilkguy: lucky altar hmmm he has alot of luck today
[5:28:34] pb_b: can you coop ascend or its solo only?
[5:28:41] gaymersalsa: @zeus_o9o2 uhhhh i think he remembered it on stream and realised its kinda garbage LOL
[5:28:46] KalunRS: watch him needing 2 earrings in the scav vault now 4Head
[5:28:50] TAxels: is hunter un-spec'd?
[5:28:51] Jackkabuki: How about an expertise that gives you a chance to decrease the number of objectives a bit
[5:28:54] toasty_ryebread: can you get a cake vault randomly?
[5:28:55] Wiroe_: can the soul pouch work in a backpack?
[5:28:58] volaticbrad: if it is multiplayer, does all people get soul flames?'
[5:28:59] Marknu: people will cry over scavs in the mix anyway
[5:29:03] minipantalon: i mean scav is the hardest (kinda) and you gon get more chestsq everytime you progress then you will complete the vaults easier
[5:29:04] zeus_o9o2: he took my name DinoDance DinoDance DinoDance
[5:29:05] the_great_tan: lvl 65 look a bit high
[5:29:08] thiccmilkguy: he made 20 fundi damn it
[5:29:11] NakeZast: I like the grayish-blue vault portal color with the Ascension Crystal...
[5:29:13] gaymersalsa: @Wiroe_ no
[5:29:13] PhysicsNovice: Cheer100 What is the 'cake vaults are being updated' meme now?
[5:29:20] strandberggg: Save ur echos Aware
[5:29:28] gaymersalsa: @PhysicsNovice "eternals will be worked on" OMEGALUL
[5:29:29] tragon_cita: why arent u carrying the junk inscription thing so it works?
[5:29:31] l___Nick___l: Don't you need the junk identifier in your inventory?
[5:29:32] minipantalon: gives me unlimited snowball feeling
[5:29:37] gaymersalsa: @tragon_cita hes a bit silly.
[5:29:48] gaymersalsa: broke.
[5:29:49] 64_Bit_Cake: Need 24
[5:29:50] LoopTJ: using pogs like they're candy
[5:29:53] ProfessionalsOnly: Don't you need to save Echo gems for something else? LUL
[5:29:59] NikitaNik_of: Good day to you, Big Man! I have quite a noob question. What was that ornate chests with somethink like chains on it? I saw it in a video, but I dont know, what was that. Thank you ph1lLove
[5:30:00] RobUrHood: Oh good a 5 and a half plus hour vod to watch later.
[5:30:03] breadandbutter07: I’m excited for the new changes! Can you co-op in ascension vaults?
[5:30:05] ramnite_tv: @KalunRS Once you get through the initial hurdle the cascading chests help a lot (with both elixir and scav), and you can cheese the system here by cooping these vaults and helping the owner complete the vault till you reach the point of chest surplus; rich get richer kinda scenario  hryPeepers
[5:30:08] muppification: 2?
[5:30:08] Gorbyas: 2 echo pogs
[5:30:12] 64_Bit_Cake: Oh ok just 4 more
[5:30:14] veronicorn: echo gems disappearing off the shelves
[5:30:15] gaymersalsa: @NikitaNik_of strongbox! appears after lvl 50, has better loot
[5:30:19] Kieonas: mine room?

[5:30:34] zeus_o9o2: part 2

[5:30:49] melonhunt: would love a mine room destruction with a hammer
[5:30:53] Marknu: agree
[5:30:53] ShelobsLair_: GAMBA  this time?
[5:30:56] hi748: iskBomb
[5:30:57] smolkato: ac-cited for ascension
[5:30:58] muppification: cow vault the hardest
[5:30:59] abibernard: gamba
[5:30:59] Myri_Sea: are we going straight for objective?
[5:31:01] TAxels: guardian you have to be good at fighting tho
[5:31:03] NikitaNik_of: @NikitaNik_of does it have different break stats, timings?
[5:31:04] tangerinedoro: "secci" umm we
[5:31:05] minipantalon: sir may you read my preo
[5:31:06] muttpacket: what is the flame modifier?
[5:31:08] iballen93: i can never find the guardian oboliscs
[5:31:13] minipantalon: previous mesages lol
[5:31:22] gaymersalsa: ok
[5:31:24] thiccmilkguy: i forgot what happens if you get high souls?
[5:31:25] freddyb8: What if there was a 25% champion abode negative in the brazier vault.
[5:31:27] gaymersalsa:  gamba is up!!!!!
[5:31:29] Zinoba: some of us are hunters, and some of us have eyes hryLaf
[5:31:36] gaymersalsa: he said "speedrun it" so lol
[5:31:39] p3ngu1n_09: yes
[5:31:46] strandberggg: Thats not even a negative @freddyb8
[5:31:46] KalunRS: @ramnite_tv depends on how much they cascade and how coop is integrated.
[5:31:49] migats21official: Dangit. These channel points are useless
[5:31:52] adwund: if you run the ascension vault coop do all players get a flame or only the one who profided the vault?
[5:32:03] Gorbyas: all-in baby
[5:32:03] tangerinedoro: the fuwu build? nope, no nether damage iirc
[5:32:07] thiccmilkguy: lmao imagine how rich people would be if he died
[5:32:07] zeus_o9o2: he is introvert
[5:32:10] 1mnotjoe: bless
[5:32:11] 1mnotjoe: thats goo
[5:32:12] gaymersalsa: @NikitaNik_of yeah, they work more like wooden chests for the 'sliced' chests. but i dont think you can really get enough mining speed to insta break
[5:32:13] 1mnotjoe: good
[5:32:15] 64_Bit_Cake: Oh yay!
[5:32:21] GhoulHunter811: YAYY
[5:32:21] zeus_o9o2: @thiccmilkguy hehe greed is good
[5:32:22] freddyb8: @strandberggg could be a lot easier to die from though
[5:32:24] SnipyPlays: Wait that was a bug?
[5:32:26] gaymersalsa: SO MANY DOUBTERS?? do you remember how this man will loot
[5:32:30] ReshiramEighteen: the champ guardians will not be missed
[5:32:31] xsimax1982: Are the turtles gone now also?
[5:32:35] SukoruXD: 5 hours
[5:32:35] gaymersalsa: dylans. betting on NO here could pay big
[5:32:35] ramnite_tv: @KalunRS Im basing this on seeing the amount of cascades in the yt video on flame x10 and no coop restrictions being mentioned :P
[5:32:36] asimithehero: That was a bug? Now i'm kinda sad about the time i got 6 guardian champs
[5:32:40] minipantalon: is it a bug idk but the harass totem triggers their thorns damage fully
[5:32:42] NikitaNik_of: @NikitaNik_of ph1lYep got it, thank you very much!
[5:32:44] KalunRS: Can champions still get ethereal? That one was way worse lol
[5:32:47] itsjonathanjones: doubters are losing here
[5:32:49] GhoulHunter811: @xsimax1982 nope
[5:32:49] zeus_o9o2: @asimithehero LUL LUL
[5:32:50] gaymersalsa: @NikitaNik_of o7 npnp!
[5:32:51] NakeZast: Vault Hunters Ascension World Record incoming? Rigged? Absolutely not xD
[5:32:58] muppification: elixir defintely too easy
[5:33:05] the_whtvr: I've had elixirs I wasn't able to complete after lvl50, probably due to bad rng with most stuff giving almost nothing :X
[5:33:05] lothar286a: I fail elixer and obelisk vaults all the time
[5:33:06] S4lovic: I think guardians need to be reworked a bit, the number of guardians doesn't change to much
[5:33:09] gaymersalsa: BINGO? iskCheck
[5:33:10] breadandbutter07: Oh that’s good! I had guardians in champions abode and got 2-3 champs per pillar and it was so much harder than it should be!
[5:33:12] am_andrew: i dont think u can only fail scav, if u are really unlucky (or unexpirienced) u can frickup even elixir
[5:33:21] tangerinedoro: guys remember to gamba so iskall doesn't get banned
[5:33:23] EricMTGCast: I'm playing normal and fail objectives all the time at level 50. Admittedly not a great player
[5:33:23] TgoodClay: replace turtles with snapping alligators .
[5:33:24] OneTrueSpry: Holy heck your still live. Been at work a few hours missing all the fun sadly. Hope testing update has been going well.

[5:33:54] captainpeanutbutter: !patch

[5:34:19] zeus_o9o2: @tangerinedoro ahhh me and my 85 iq
[5:34:23] tangerinedoro: @thiccmilkguy salsa is not a mod salsa is just a little guy

[5:35:43] RaulRB36: that would kill the modpack ngl
[5:35:44] sambhavsam: No time pls
[5:35:44] warkr0: so there is a theoretical limit to how much time can be removed
[5:35:46] mcpeking18: no buts
[5:35:47] skierbrenn: Unlimited time? That would be fun
[5:35:49] Ferdster02: 1 second per stack

[5:35:53] SunflowerMead0w: more mobs would be fine
[5:35:54] iljalz: pls not LUL
[5:35:56] pb_b: but not so steep scaling

[5:36:01] sambhavsam: I would rage quit LUL
[5:36:01] gaymersalsa: @TechnoHail revamped soulflame, lets you have a streak of sorts
[5:36:02] TheKid217: as long as it has a ceiling and doesn't cause the feeling of "guess my streak ends here" on entering, should be okay to add difficulty
[5:36:03] gaymersalsa: @gaymersalsa SMH
[5:36:07] ramnite_tv: A wild stack per 5x flame hryLafExceptInPain
[5:36:11] Knew_It_Owl: Damn.. just missed the gamba.. Not like I have much luck with them today.. xD
[5:36:12] toasterburn809: I lol imagine an infinite vault with infinite time
[5:36:15] Gorbyas: NO ISKALL theres a GAMBA
[5:36:15] KalunRS: maybe make the vault a lvl higher than the Crystal per soul flame level
[5:36:17] Nightbot: Support the devs & the pack.  https://www.patreon.com/VaultHunters
[5:36:17] asimithehero: Don't remove time but make objectives harder (more monoliths, more scav items etc.)
[5:36:22] TechnoHail: @gaymersalsa ok thanks
[5:36:22] kathinkajean: nooo, what about believers?
[5:36:25] pobblebonk2102: i'd just add a random negative modifier every 5 ascension levels
[5:36:27] RobUrHood: imagine just betraying the believers
[5:36:27] smolkato: lol like hiding the guardian spawning thing behind a parkour?
[5:36:28] lothar286a: make the vault 1 vault level higher for each stack?
[5:36:30] zeus_o9o2: @Gorbyas greed is good VoHiYo
[5:36:31] 0finifish: make the objective a higher level

[5:36:34] MarkDatter: e

[5:36:35] thiccmilkguy: @Gorbyas where?? asked on discord people suggested twitter. (i am not subbed to him)
[5:36:36] JashinFanatic: @iskall can you tweak the objectives? 0 flame requires 4 normal scavs, 10 flame requires 3 epic scavs
[5:36:37] ShelobsLair_: sir the believers....
[5:36:39] nounou26x: e
[5:36:39] volaticbrad: I thin you should make a objective multiplier
[5:36:39] gaymersalsa: @gaymersalsa 7tv ?
[5:36:40] thinkjaguar: what about just weighting it so that the more stacks you have the more chance their is to get a more difficult objective
[5:36:43] bestbla: why do i believe in this man Sadge
[5:36:44] cadeaugh: Like every 10 flames you get a special vault that the objective is ascension and harder. Keep the other 9 the same, but have landmarks?
[5:36:46] floppypidgen: maybe something like cake vaults where you have to get x cakes before leaving
[5:36:47] kathinkajean: siiiiir…. the believers

[5:37:58] ash_tronaut616: Really unexpected
[5:38:00] CormacAers: maybe an increased need for objective? all objectives are number based (find x pylons, find x salvage, and so on) maybe an exponentai increase in need? i.e. after the firsd vault 1%, second 3%, than 6% and so on?

[5:39:27] migats21official: iskEnergy that's better
[5:39:27] tangerinedoro: so like, every stack makes the objective % harder. more monoliths or braziers, less chance of jackpots in elixir, more scav items of higher rarity, etc
[5:39:28] 64_Bit_Cake: Because of your guardian egg
[5:39:42] MaxusTheOne: Bamboo req should be capped at 12

[5:43:46] Nightbot: Light the Monoliths objective has been replaced with Light the Braziers in update 13. Braziers appear in every room and have a range of positive modifiers that get added once you click on them! After you acquire the required amount of Braziers, you can continue to Pillage additional Braziers for good loot at the cost of negative/cursed modifiers, or exit the vault to complete it.

[5:55:15] isacooo: @gaymersalsa  yeah that ofc makes a lot of sense in that way. No reason to add stuff without a solid reason I guess

[6:05:49] DanRas08: It's expert for 10yo kids XD
[6:05:51] Grandwigg: in that context, at least.
[6:05:51] chille84: no difficulty just time sync
[6:05:55] zeus_o9o2: opinions strongly*
[6:05:57] gunn301: i definitely feel like when Iskall says that Ethos has been luckier at finding Dungeon and Treasure room doors, that he’s probably found the same amount hes just an expert at staring a door in the face and not noticing it 🤣😂
[6:05:57] toasterburn809: Only reason i ever played VH was because most popular modpacks are just crafting sim
[6:06:00] apelsinaisupienu: @bacowl show them iskallman
[6:06:01] angelwitch25: jip i found that 2
[6:06:04] nerdoidaao: expert modpack for me is like crash landing
[6:06:08] melonhunt: tbf project ozone is one of the best packs. all of the newer "expert" packs are cringe
[6:06:09] nija0dragon: hello im back, what did i miss?
[6:06:09] RNForrestRN: @zinoba the ultimate time gate lol
[6:06:10] minipantalon: scares me
[6:06:10] simiray27: beating vault hunters on fragged is expert
[6:06:12] apelsinaisupienu: Or gunpoint @bacowl
[6:06:12] hngi1: a lot of players love that @iskall85 i would love if you would do sometghing like that in vaulthunters, something really machine heavy grindy would be loved by a lot of people
[6:06:17] lazypandaman: questing mod packs are like that, but i never finish till the end then
[6:06:18] tricksofevil: being an expert at something in real life is usually a time gated skill
[6:06:21] gaymersalsa: @Zinoba further proof that education is completely useless! hryFlex
[6:06:27] zeus_o9o2: hard mods for me are finding friends to play with
[6:06:28] Gorbyas: what about gregtech :D
[6:06:29] Zinoba: @DanRas08 if he read this he would have laughed hard about this
[6:06:32] thimicool: Is Etho sold for a hammer ye?
[6:06:33] TheReaperOf1985: Express packs. hryPog
[6:06:38] Eagle_ps: Expert isn't difficulty, it's that mod progression is gated behind other mods
[6:06:39] nerdoidaao: crash landing is classic, one of my favorite modpacks of all time
[6:06:39] gaymersalsa: @DanRas08 LOLOL
[6:06:40] freddyb8: Does the Flame vaults give more XP as you run it more and more?
[6:06:41] Bacowl: gunpoint isnt a half bad idea
[6:06:43] Paudot: @zeus_o9o2 TRUEEE
[6:06:43] sofie0125: the expert part is the patiencen to want to waste so much time
[6:06:43] SirChamomile: Just a colloquial term, not a definition tbh
[6:06:45] Jackkabuki: Expert should mean you have to bring knowledge. not be unnecessarily complicated
[6:06:52] sadge_Boris: Discovered Iskall with lets play project ozone iskHeart
[6:06:53] warkr0: @hngi1 VH has a ton of room for big automation as you level up
[6:06:57] Meals5671: you can clear the vault now iskall
[6:06:58] ghost13563: What did i miss
[6:06:58] oMoNok_: RLcraft is a elit ?

[6:07:17] zebrainap: i think
[6:07:17] TechnoHail: ozone was the mod he streamed before VH right?
[6:07:21] warkr0: VH feels like a way more gratifying way to interact with mods
[6:07:27] blackjacksepp: I really enjoyed the Crash Landing modpack a few years ago, because it really was a challenge
[6:07:31] AnirakZed: stoneblock is fun
[6:07:47] MrHaloBoy: i personaly find botania is nerft pretty hard in VH
[6:07:52] gaymersalsa: marketed elitism to make players feel good about themselves
[6:07:54] NakeZast: I wonder if you can stack God favor flowers
[6:07:57] izeplaysGames: i thought expert means harder endgame
[6:08:02] MrHaloBoy: but i understand why
[6:08:03] VogelVrouw: yeah, it sounds exclusive and dumb
[6:08:03] asimithehero: Label is kinda weird yesh, but i just read "100% more grind"
[6:08:04] eonzcarr: nope
[6:08:04] thiccmilkguy: ultra pro max mod pack letsgooo
[6:08:05] Zinoba: yes. but for other reasons
[6:08:07] Bacowl: reminds me of those weird mobile game ads that are like 99% of people can't solve!
[6:08:08] PiTo_27_: when are we getting Vault Hunters 3 Expert Mode Kappa
[6:08:09] afuneralfork: iskall discovers "higher" education
[6:08:12] TAxels: "Professional" Packs GIGACHAD's only
[6:08:13] Agzarah: expert implies a skill level. but those mod packs are just about gridning, not difficulty
[6:08:13] zeus_o9o2: i got introduced to moded through VH 2 years later all i know is VH
[6:08:13] gaymersalsa: @Zinoba a secret third option
[6:08:14] boowaz758: i really like sky factory 4
[6:08:16] marvelprincess2000: iskHeart iskEnergy iskHeart
[6:08:18] SunflowerMead0w: no I agree I think you’re right
[6:08:22] magdaluo66: Dungeon downstairs
[6:08:23] candidcrafter: "Grind mode" would be apt
[6:08:23] Ge0Matrix: Expert Vault Hunters
[6:08:24] ShelobsLair_: it is a bit weird. Maybe the ideas is so that poeple who do play it get to feel like they're experts?
[6:08:24] spurlucke: It sounds cool tho if you're called an expert, no?
[6:08:25] hngi1: @iskall85 were you ever thinking of developing your own grindy chemistry tech time consuming vaulthunters pack
[6:08:29] saxymatt: I havent played much modded MC, do you recommend going create, TE, or mekanism during a vault hunters playthrough?
[6:08:32] 1mnotjoe: just complete
[6:08:32] Trall543: i think your confusing "expert" as in someone who would be considered a professional...and "expert" as in the difficulty, this is just english being english >.>
[6:08:33] melonhunt: yeah i agree, its mostly wrong naming
[6:08:36] timmolaa: I suppose doing expert modes feed the ego
[6:08:38] thimicool: Etho convince on hammer yet?
[6:08:38] AmethystVicious: should label vault hunters as “non-expert modge”
[6:08:41] gaymersalsa: @timmolaa this

[6:08:58] asimithehero: GregTech : Vault hunters When?
[6:09:00] dob19wastaken: vault hunters is probably the best modpack that I've seen, its really unique
[6:09:01] jtthegreat2020: hello
[6:09:09] apelsinaisupienu: Lots of tangos
[6:09:17] Laughsheep: i had to go 4 hours ago and i didn't expect that you would still be live.
[6:09:25] smolkato: I think it’s fair
[6:09:26] gaymersalsa: fair
[6:09:36] Eagle_ps: @iskall85 Expert doesn't mean difficulty directly, it refers to mod progression being gated by other mods, so recipes get changed so that you might need Botania endgame items to start the Galacticraft mod, for example.
[6:09:43] VogelVrouw: yeah, like what you said about forge and stuff the other day
[6:09:48] rytional: Now he's thinking Valheim VH which is cool
[6:09:48] asimithehero: Iskall robbed us of GT:VH :(
[6:09:49] gaymersalsa: the s2 lovers would love that tbh
[6:09:50] MrHaloBoy: @iskall85  any plan to make the forge and other blocks insertable
[6:09:52] SunflowerMead0w: I think the term feels so ego loaded and that’s part of why labeling some things “expert” feels like it’s over inflating some and insulting others a little and it’s not a good word for game development
[6:09:55] iAdoly: @iskall85 is there lucky hit for cool-down reduction
[6:10:09] gaymersalsa: classic bonne hryPog
[6:10:15] TheKid217: devils advocate but then VH4 kind of directly goes to "splitting" the community in a way
[6:10:18] sunflowerseedshell: You shouldet him do it tho :'(
[6:10:20] VogelVrouw: i guess thats true
[6:10:22] zeus_o9o2: 4 tank needed
[6:10:24] Bacowl: charms are way more exciting to get now
[6:10:26] hngi1: gregtech vaulthunters would be extremly good, i am willing to fund it

[6:10:43] sambhavsam: Look for tans man
[6:10:46] craftydanno: craftydanno subscribed at Tier 2. They've subscribed for 9 months! damn I missed a 6 hr update stream... did the extra dungeon layouts make it? love this game :)
[6:10:47] TAxels: is there competition for Vault Hunters? This feels very unique
[6:10:48] sambhavsam: Thanks*

[6:10:52] thiccmilkguy: oh foolish me to imagine he would have completed in 10 minutes
[6:10:58] Zinoba: more satisfying mine than the actual mine room. classic
[6:11:02] apelsinaisupienu: Does chocolate oxidise?

[6:32:08] zeus_o9o2: @sophistic_ated that same vault he bought in
[6:32:10] TAxels: if you escape does it restart the  flame?
[6:32:10] pendelluft: @valkojam Do you know what I'm referring to? xD I can send you the link
[6:32:15] forelini: I came back after 2 hours and still live?
[6:32:17] volaticbrad: I think armour should heavily break
[6:32:18] gaymersalsa: @gaymersalsa ur dunges look fabulous hru
[6:32:19] 0of1est: DoritosChip
[6:32:24] ShelobsLair_: what happens if a coop ally dies in ascension? @iskall85
[6:32:25] Lambo_321: risk/reward analysis is one of the most fun aspects of Vault Hunters
[6:32:27] Aww_Mann_: how many days are left in the 100 days challenge?
[6:32:29] pb_b: make the objective scale in difficulty?
[6:32:31] asimithehero: But why would i ever run normal vault when i could run ascension?
[6:32:32] Kampf_Strudel: you could make that with low asscension theres less loot
[6:32:36] valkojam: @pendelluft I do not. Please to send.
[6:32:36] sophistic_ated: @zeus_o9o2 that'll teach me not to pay attention LUL
[6:32:38] fabdonkey: meowdy omg tank u salsa
[6:32:40] No_xor: downside is no catalysts
[6:32:48] Ler3ysss: what is pacifists build?
[6:32:50] Ferdster02: I think making it locked with maybe a decreased cost for the buyback is good
[6:32:50] nib__rl: didnt you crowd fund a PC months ago?
[6:32:51] ramnite_tv: That's a dangerous moment for a pc lag iskSkull85
[6:32:52] smolkato: could boost mob speed/number of mobs?
[6:32:52] Cammmmy: Less time?
[6:32:52] 1vanpopta1: are the stacks bound by soul flame? like if you had two could you stack 2 different soul flames?
[6:32:58] TAxels: chest durability?
[6:33:01] ShelobsLair_: @iskall85 how does that work in a coop ascension vault?
[6:33:01] gaymersalsa: @Ler3ysss not killing mobs and focusing on looting
[6:33:08] zebrainap: @iskall85 a big streak is hard to keep up, you and barry only got 26' scavs in a row which isn't an insane stack
[6:33:09] ChaoticTom31: magmatic popsicle :D my favorite
[6:33:10] Tonrac: why does blizzard cause fps lag like that?
[6:33:11] Zaraca90: Have it so they have to kill mobs... like 100 mobs
[6:33:11] Danymaddox: why not add one curse every 10 stacks // make the vault less complete every 10 stacks?
[6:33:12] pb_b: is pacifist good against hunt the guardians though?
[6:33:17] thinkjaguar: what about just scaling the objectives
[6:33:17] forelini: xp scaling bad
[6:33:21] JashinFanatic: can you make it so the vaults require more of the objective? Like more elixir count, or more scav items
[6:33:22] Kadeshi_: I mean, pacifist builds also just lose to hunt the guardians dont they?
[6:33:24] ShelobsLair_: in terms of death
[6:33:27] oralekin: @onceandalways everyone is an ethogirl after all, doesnt stop me getting the fuzzies from that kind of video
[6:33:29] thiccmilkguy: you go all in. other people realise their potential and bail when needed. So keeping streak is a tough thing on itself
[6:33:31] sophistic_ated: Give mobs immunity to some attacks, poison, lucky hit, froze nova etc...
[6:33:33] Klinten__: boss after objective done to succed
[6:33:37] Zinoba: oh i LOVE that
[6:33:41] nib__rl: that is interesting....'
[6:33:42] timmolaa: Could make a downside being no fruiting
[6:33:44] ShelobsLair_: what happens if your ally dies?
[6:33:45] nija0dragon: also the rng makes it harder
[6:33:49] strandberggg: What is that F word?
[6:33:50] smolkato: so all has to complete to ascend? or just the owner
[6:33:50] TheLilMay: What level do you recommend starting ascensions?
[6:33:56] ShadowCrafter_01: So it's just important for the person owning the flame to complete the vault?
[6:33:59] pomi2137: good thing i have no friends
[6:34:03] Hyweed_: hmmmm, that could be real bad
[6:34:04] zeus_o9o2: downside you need a friend Kappa
[6:34:06] pb_b: yeah thats good i think
[6:34:07] gaymersalsa: its a bit weirdge
[6:34:08] sambhavsam: That takes away the scav dopamine rush
[6:34:08] simiray27: what if the person who owns the ascension doesn't go into the vault and the buddy completes?
[6:34:17] Kildain82: @sophistic_ated That sounds awful tbh
[6:34:18] OrangeJuuce890: So even if the friend dies in the vault the flame is fine because it belongs to the other person
[6:34:19] oheylol: so you get 1 stack for each time you win a vault in a row?
[6:34:20] kolacna2: i think breaking a streak is enough of danger, some scavenger hunts are quite hard, but maybe scavs are easier on higher stacks becouse of more chests
[6:34:20] invisablealley: remove rotten
[6:34:23] apelsinaisupienu: Thanks to iskall abba's "the winner takes kt all" is stuck in my head
[6:34:24] LobsterCanary: agreed
[6:34:27] micdale: @iskall85 lets say you skail to 10 can you give the flame soul to some one else or is it bound to you?
[6:34:27] TAxels: also counter productive to your god fruits
[6:34:33] zeus_o9o2: wendar alter
[6:34:35] ShapNine: True
[6:34:36] 0of1est: GREED.
[6:34:36] banana_splits: it's Rotten!!
[6:34:40] Zinoba: @oheylol yeah for every vault you win with the flame on
[6:34:43] onceandalways: Maybe it just makes kiwis mouldy, so you’re forced to spend your good fruit?
[6:34:43] slinky_doge: id rather it knock off a minute at the start and u can eat oranges or lemons to get it back if thats what you want
[6:34:43] thiccmilkguy: seeing your playthrough, it feels PRETTY IMPORTANT
[6:34:48] ramnite_tv: @Kadeshi_ You can have a generic pacifist build and a way to deal with guardians. It's not like youre presented with an oath not to fight mobs KEKW
[6:34:50] invisablealley: get rid of rotten
[6:34:52] oheylol: @zinoba thanks
[6:34:52] ShelobsLair_: Do you Fail the ascension if an ally dies in your vault?
[6:34:54] TheImmortaldonut: And it's not like most people are running around with a bag full of lemons or oranges
[6:34:56] zeus_o9o2: do that creeper do anything ?
[6:34:57] Korgis: make it so when you lose an accession you can negative stacks
[6:34:58] tatw69: can you enter the vault with an ender chest incase the objective is to hard
[6:35:01] redknightks: mark the room
[6:35:08] Jackkabuki: how about instead of vault fruits you just cant eat
[6:35:09] thiccmilkguy: 1 minute sounds alot seeing you play though
[6:35:12] zeus_o9o2: mark room
[6:35:18] proshooter27_: can someone remind me which chest factory room gives?
[6:35:20] Nightbot: Everything in VH 1.18 is very under development & things might change.. Just Trust the Process-- iskall & Devs
[6:35:21] TAxels: rotten makes sense as a god penalty
[6:35:28] invisablealley: that sounds fun
[6:35:29] Xisuma: xvxRAID
[6:35:31] Kampf_Strudel: if they get a bad modifier make it worse
[6:35:31] Blacktron1324: does acension only give more xp
[6:35:33] despiced: have it add more durability drain per stack? @iskall85
[6:35:34] StrangePanthers: Hmmm
[6:35:34] MarkDatter: @proshooter27_ there's no chests, instead you find compressed blocks and ancient debris in that room
[6:35:36] ltl_drumm3r_boy: bring back the crab walk curse! (kidding please dont)
[6:35:38] freddyb8: My current mana regen in my gear is 325%
[6:35:39] Xisuma: 367 raiders from Xisuma have joined! 
[6:35:42] LissieBess: xvxRAID xvxRAID xvxRAID
[6:35:42] gaymersalsa: xisuma hryBoggies
[6:35:44] chiwipeppa01: xvxRAID xvxRAID
[6:35:44] thiccmilkguy: then after 50 every reduction would be 100% and then it will be unplayable
[6:35:45] 0wlmirr0r: I liked what you said about making the objective harder
[6:35:46] ChimeraDev: xvxRAID
[6:35:47] thiccmilkguy: RAIDER
[6:35:48] Zinoba: hello x and raiders hryAdmire
[6:35:48] JPiGuy: o/
[6:35:49] Night2315: lower trap dissarm
[6:35:49] simiray27: not movement speed pls...
[6:35:49] keshkup: Hiii Iskall
[6:35:50] ShelobsLair_: Xisuma raid
[6:35:50] krzysiek3_0: welcome X raiders!
[6:35:52] Butzehier: just a single negative modifier, but at random and increasingly bad
[6:35:52] iljalz: welcome raiders!
[6:35:52] proshooter27_: @MarkDatter oh its that room mb.. idk the names
[6:35:53] bennieboi20: xisuma!
[6:35:53] freddyb8: !raid
[6:35:53] CedH1: it's not giving me hype to grind it with that I think
[6:35:54] sabrina1202r: Xisuma
[6:35:54] ChimeraDev: xvxRAID xvxRAID
[6:35:55] Yharon_Likes_Jazz_: onevery funny idea i've had sitting for a while is to have a random chance to have a killed enemy explode - probably not helpful though
[6:35:55] m00npug: hello
[6:35:56] bas3j: Hello raiders
[6:35:56] lazylearner: shaswami
[6:35:56] sunflowerseedshell: What if you get an 3xtremely long streak qnd you'r moving at slowness 4 speed tho?
[6:35:56] smartyone: what about making kiwi time random?
[6:35:58] antegravity: Shishwami!
[6:35:59] JPiGuy: Vault Raiders!
[6:36:00] e_shailee: @iskall maybe allow player to gamba on own ascension?
[6:36:01] candidcrafter: I think ascension is good as it is
[6:36:01] mrkatt200000: What if there was a way to incress the quantity of elixre or objektivs needed to complet the vault go up as your streek getts higher. In a similare way it already how the vaults gets harder the higher level you are?
[6:36:04] pb_b: isnt that limiting though? cause its infinite right?
[6:36:05] asimithehero: Thats just not very thematic, sounds more like descension
[6:36:11] Heroblender: xvxRAID
[6:36:15] Nightbot: Support the devs & the pack.  https://www.patreon.com/VaultHunters
[6:36:15] LissieBess: xvxRAID xvxRAID xvxRAID xvxRAID xvxRAID
[6:36:18] big_bahemith: Hellooooo
[6:36:20] PiTo_27_: raiders hryAdmire
[6:36:20] whomps_pogchamp: the actual objective of the vaults should get more difficult (eg more elixir)
[6:36:20] BigDoggxx2: So if someone with, let's say 5 stacks.  They want to help out a lower level friend.  They can put their stacks on their friends crystal to get more loot?  Would that then add a stack if the low lvl friend goes in first sense it would be their crystal?
[6:36:20] Bacowl: i like the idea of the player getting tired after running the series of vaults
[6:36:20] alivedemonnyte: Make it so that every fifth stack be some kind of challenge run
[6:36:23] bruce61616: less chests, but better quality loot?.... nah
[6:36:24] oheylol: reduce vault time for every 5 or 10 stacks?
[6:36:30] ChimeraDev: Update 13! I am really hyped! I hope they updated the cake vaults xvxTROLL
[6:36:33] ShelobsLair_: Is there a penalty to an ally dying in your ascension vault? @iskall85
[6:36:36] gyerekecskee: and new Etho series confirmed
[6:36:37] Zaraca90: There can be a secondary objectiv where you have to kill 100 mobs, mine ore, chest wtc
[6:36:38] Merrie_Poppins: no
[6:36:40] floppypidgen: fruit give less time?
[6:36:40] CedH1: ye
[6:36:41] zeus_o9o2: no
[6:36:41] marvelprincess2000: iskHeart iskHeart iskHeart
[6:36:43] TAxels: maybe
[6:36:48] anonymoususer281: Sealing Abilities can be an option
[6:36:56] warkr0: have you all considered make soul flame vaults locked?
[6:36:56] tom_goku_: why dont you make the objective harder. like upper end on elixier needed or scav items needed.
[6:36:57] oralekin: @mrkatt200000 i was thinking thats a great way to make ascension vaults harder, its based on the objective which is more relevant
[6:37:11] e_shailee: maybe make/allow player to gamba on how many stacks they can reach?
[6:37:12] SeriousCreeper: What if a difficulty modifier could be that chests cant be opened until all mobs from the POI are dead, that will show Pacifists Kappa
[6:37:14] Wiroe_: @warkr0 he has considered it
[6:37:16] Nightbot: Watch iskall85’s VOD’s at https://youtube.com/@vodskall85
[6:37:18] montypythoncode: reach debuff hehe (also for looting)
[6:37:23] sagittarius_greenbow: you could maybe scale the objectives themselves?
[6:37:27] OrangeJuuce890: I heard this thing somewhere about an update to cake vaults, sounds like something they should do!
[6:37:29] the_great_tan: you can add barriers to the rooms
[6:37:30] minipantalon: random curse maybe on ascending
[6:37:31] zeus_o9o2: @SeriousCreeper LUL LUL  going all in
[6:37:33] nomulous: Add clumsy levels for ascension levels? Promotes stacking more trap disarm
[6:37:34] nib__rl: reducing movespeed would be very annoying
[6:37:34] AZAZEL_PLAYSs: no ore dungeons?
[6:37:37] 0of1est: I'd love to see a series of just etho iskall and brry vaulting together lol
[6:37:39] terribrill: opt-in annoying isn't so bad
[6:37:39] zipsiriam: yeah but by making the player weaker you make it feel "worse" for the player to play as they progress, instead of better
[6:37:40] angelwitch25: Make high ascension vaults void vaults lol
[6:37:42] Tonrac: less vault time for higher ascension chains?
[6:37:42] thiccmilkguy: yeah after like 50 even with 2% per stack it would be 100%. Then they are basically useless?
[6:37:42] Zaraca90: Can't put down blocks
[6:37:45] smolkato: what if it unlocks a special boss min after you complete the objective..?
[6:37:47] Hyweed_: you're too good, needs nerf LUL
[6:37:51] thiccmilkguy: !ascension
[6:37:53] Zinoba: ehh maybe a feelsbad. id like it more if OTHERS get buffed not myself nerfed
[6:37:56] zipsiriam: its not good
[6:38:01] Marknu: could just do a throwback to season 2 and add a stack of wild per 5 ascension
[6:38:01] alivedemonnyte: Not every vault tho . Do it every 5th stack
[6:38:04] gaymersalsa: forced
[6:38:04] micdale: @iskall85 is the soul flame character bound or is it tradeble?
[6:38:04] candidcrafter: Objectives scale higher with ascension maybe ?
[6:38:04] zipsiriam: you make the player feel worse for progressing
[6:38:10] strandberggg: @gaymersalsa Do I need to install JEI configured to enable that search info?
[6:38:11] thiccmilkguy: @gaymersalsa still searching for perfect writing for !ascension
[6:38:12] whomps_pogchamp: the actual objective of the vaults should get more difficult (like more elixir) it would feel weird to have an easy objective at ascension 30
[6:38:14] TAxels: is there a way to run ascension without increasing it? or decreasing ascension?
[6:38:15] Nightbot: To add your alias to VHSMP-- Go to the official VH Discord https://discord.gg/vaulthunters  & add in the alias-request channel found in the VHSMP Category.  shorturl.at/ekxLX
[6:38:15] ggmacy: WHY DONT YOU BUFF THE MOBS INSTEAD!!
[6:38:15] wostu29: Iskall you could also make the objective itself harder, like having harder scav items, more needed elixir, etc
[6:38:16] zipsiriam: its terrible
[6:38:24] the_great_tan: its annoying
[6:38:27] CedH1: I dont like that tbh, the excitation from loosing all your 30 grind asencsion level is enough to me, adding some negativ might reduce my envy to grind the asencsion level
[6:38:30] Johny_76: oh no
[6:38:35] despiced: you just have to mess around with the numbers as to how much you debuff per stack @iskall85
[6:38:35] gaymersalsa: @strandberggg what search info? i havent been paying attention sorry hryLafExceptInPain
[6:38:45] dashmax1214: hi iskall
[6:38:46] gaymersalsa: @thiccmilkguy my brain is too empty sorry man
[6:38:47] toasterburn809: Like a vh2 scav where you need 7 different items
[6:38:48] mczimo: what if you block an increasing number of hallways so people have to be smarter about pathing
[6:38:48] zeus_o9o2: all caps means RuleFive RuleFive
[6:38:50] snowball7242: the scav gets easier because theres more chests tho
[6:39:01] kolacna2: i think not matter what negative effect you do it is nice to be random
[6:39:03] strandberggg: @strandberggg Searching in crafting grid comes into the other grid to the right
[6:39:04] MarkDatter: every common room at least
[6:39:04] Zinoba: BROTHER you have NO RIGHT to put that "?" there for false after that cake vault earlier today
[6:39:08] toasterburn809: There will be more chests tho
[6:39:08] Johny_76: or you need 1 drowned hide
[6:39:15] Nightbot: For everything Vault Hunters, check out the website! https://vaulthunters.gg/
[6:39:17] zipsiriam: think about it like this @iskall85 lets say you got movement speed+2, and worked hard for it in the progression, then suddenly the same progression takes away that +2 speed, would you feel fine with it?
[6:39:18] Night2315: would adding something like a random negative modifier that carries across the ascension that adds one per stack work?
[6:39:18] thiccmilkguy: is cake vault maybe bugged? like that last time you couldnt see the pedestal
[6:39:19] minipantalon: well but you get so much more stuff
[6:39:20] that_kael: rotten = first X fruit are have as effective? maybe
[6:39:22] gharmonica: It's fellowship asleep while watching the stream, and had a dream about vault hunter and you
[6:39:26] sagittarius_greenbow: you could scale the scavs slower
[6:39:28] Bacowl: arent you also getting the more chests to counterract that?
[6:39:28] slc_eyeorg: I like the idea of player de-buffs - that you can build against....
[6:39:30] Coralotl: Isn’t the loot scaling as well? So harder scavs would coincide with more loot
[6:39:33] gaymersalsa: @strandberggg ahhh, no! it's just a view setting
[6:39:34] pendelluft: hey it's falseJam falseJam falseJam falseJam falseJam
[6:39:36] Ler3ysss: why are you screeaming at each other LUL
[6:39:40] e_shailee: @iskall can you implement a slowmo/ff modifier?
[6:39:44] e_shailee: prob no
[6:39:48] slinky_doge: if false is in a challenge room she going to be looking forevert
[6:39:48] pendelluft: @Ler3ysss nah that's their love language
[6:39:48] the_great_tan: you can add barriers as you ascend betwwen the rooms
[6:39:48] micdale: @iskall is the soul flae character bound?
[6:39:49] cursedoutlaw45: With ascension level jumps increase stacking negatives
[6:39:50] Skrzacior2137: Now we can see who dose not read pach notes
[6:39:51] thinkjaguar: what about just making it more likely to get harder objectives
[6:39:52] Marknu: just remember the fun ;)
[6:39:53] alivedemonnyte: Why not make every 5 stack a planned run as in tou guys plant every 5th vault till 100th stack
[6:39:55] simiray27: brazier would just become better Kek
[6:39:58] rhinojenkins: Yeah but there are more chests
[6:40:03] zeus_o9o2: number of chests
[6:40:09] gaymersalsa: chat. watch this
[6:40:10] toasterburn809: Yeah for sure
[6:40:11] Hyweed_: hmmm, IT could be easier actually yeah
[6:40:13] ramnite_tv: Once you get through the initial difficulty, yes :P
[6:40:13] thiccmilkguy: definitely easier
[6:40:14] hibbey4: you could make there be a chance to get a curse the higher your streak goes
[6:40:14] timmolaa: Random nerf per vault. Eg anti-freeze meaning mobs cant freeze
[6:40:14] pendelluft: Cake vault GG False!!

[6:40:58] dia__hi: Not in special rooms
[6:41:00] pendelluft: cubKing falsePog
[6:41:09] OrangeJuuce890: My brother just started playing vault hunters again after not playing since early update 3, it's hard to watch him and not tell him everything he needs to do but he's doing pretty good so far
[6:41:12] kolacna2: maybe make difficulty scale exponential, and reward too, so it is very hard to have like 10 stacks but you get also a lot of loot, if difficulty and reward scale really fast it isnt as much of a pain losing as if you got like 50 stacks and you lose them
[6:41:12] Arwen036: 2N 1 W
[6:41:13] nija0dragon: nemesis enemy? like when you soul flame you get the chance to face yourself, "your soul" with your build but as a mob?
[6:41:17] keonmagic221: can you stack faviors on crystals with the tokens?
[6:41:21] MasterElementsCommissions: What about changing hunter so that instead of hunting chests it does other things; Like treasure rooms, dungeons, make a separate one for god altars, the base one could be objectives still.
[6:41:22] Zaraca90: You can always have them in the middle of the room
[6:41:22] ramnite_tv: hryLeddit hryLeddit
[6:41:23] Marcin3205: can we do no difficulty scalling on lower difficulty ? o:
[6:41:26] zeus_o9o2: nicest leauge player LUL LUL LUL
[6:41:27] the_great_tan: you should add barriers as you ascend betwwen the rooms more the flames more hard to find way across the vaultso it hard to find way like you need to go zig zang and explore more rooms
[6:41:27] gaymersalsa: MRGLURP
[6:41:33] mrbunk9: That was before bounce
[6:41:38] warkr0: i like rolling them out like this and seeing how it plays out
[6:41:38] MarkDatter: this is why i dont like having hotkeys on caps lock lol
[6:41:40] TAxels: I like streak being challenge
[6:41:44] pendelluft: @gaymersalsa falseLurk
[6:41:45] thiccmilkguy: cant see no venDoor. Realised im not subbed 😭
[6:41:47] ShelobsLair_: it's a new idea, still needs playtesting
[6:41:47] grossjr20: not sure if you are in an easy vault, but you look very stonk compared to last strim.
[6:41:49] gaymersalsa: @MarkDatter OMEGALOOL i just gave up on it hehe
[6:41:53] zebrainap: you streaked 26 times in a row with scavs
[6:41:56] iljalz: i mean, feels like the streak is good enough of of a challenge
[6:41:57] e_shailee: @iskall85 any chance to implement a modifier where time move faster? like mob movements, attack speed, player fall, etc
[6:41:59] rektarina1594: Can you look up data when it releases, how many stacks do people with the right criteria have on their souls?
[6:41:59] SuiteSunrise: you are not the average player
[6:42:00] Tazzad: @iskall85 You are BY NO MEANS an average mediocre player xD
[6:42:01] therealtolazytothink: Maybe just cap them at a certain point and give a big reward
[6:42:01] gaymersalsa: @gaymersalsa PAUSERS do u have an emote extension?
[6:42:02] Juburin: hryLOLW
[6:42:05] simiray27: maybe make it harder but not loose the streak but get a -5 flame penalty
[6:42:16] ShelobsLair_: My bet is a 15+ streak will be very difficult
[6:42:20] EricMTGCast: given my play to date I doubt I can streak more than 5 or 6
[6:42:21] redstonedad: You're above average thank you
[6:42:24] strandberggg: You mind telling me where I can change that? :) @gaymersalsa
[6:42:29] j4dice: that works with debuffs also
[6:42:30] Soulless0120: we dont need SBMM in VH LUL
[6:42:30] JashinFanatic: isn't that kind of the point?
[6:42:32] krzysiek3_0: ii think to make scaling objectives fun, the scaling must be greater for the loot than the objective
[6:42:38] 0wlmirr0r: maybe a unique mob that gets a higher and higher chance of spawning
[6:42:38] SuiteSunrise: same with making mobs harder
[6:42:39] SeriousCreeper: what if after every X ascension levels you have to prestige it somehow to continue incrreasing it, but every prestige also gives the vault negative modifiers or something (or has a chance)
[6:42:40] warkr0: just make whatever scaling it is logarithmic then
[6:42:41] Butzehier: build in a difficulty maximum
[6:42:41] the_great_tan: @iskall85 you should add barriers as you ascend betwwen the rooms more the flames more hard to find way across the vaultso it hard to find way like you need to go zig zang and explore more rooms
[6:42:42] timmolaa: Every 5 or 10 vaults an objective is removed starting from easiest objective
[6:42:45] e_shailee: risk~reward think, no?
[6:42:45] Hyweed_: And when you reach the end you will have to do it all again
[6:42:47] TAxels: maybe add a way to cap the increase?
[6:42:49] cursedoutlaw45: Mob scaling with ascension levels?
[6:42:51] asimithehero: But if you don't lose its just infinite loot hack, no?
[6:42:52] funisgood_: What about locked?
[6:42:54] thiccmilkguy: thats my point! after like 50 stacks player might not be able to deal any damage because some modifier might get to 100%
[6:42:55] terribrill: scale weighting of vault type
[6:42:57] Marcin3205: as soon as i get a scav i will end my streak anyway classic
[6:42:59] sofie0125: could add a curse, no?
[6:43:05] pb_b: maybe its not bad as is
[6:43:05] toasterburn809: Sure, but lack of challenge will be more boring
[6:43:07] montypythoncode: rambling is part of the creative process
[6:43:08] zeus_o9o2: well elixer and scav will get easier cause no of chest increases ??
[6:43:08] TAxels: like a plunder pearl for the flame
[6:43:08] xMizzlefaShizzlex: maybe have the vault scale with each ascention scale the vault a level or 2 per ascention
[6:43:12] Marknu: just look at your statistics if your completion rate is about 70% then you will complete 7 out of 10 so a streak of about 5-10 is not impossible if it's 50% you won't get a high streak
[6:43:14] xMizzlefaShizzlex: vault level that is
[6:43:16] firepotato_burn: hallo
[6:43:17] Jaschinz: addon via anvill that stops you from getting more flames, but stops getting harder
[6:43:17] micdale: @iskall is the soul flame character bound?
[6:43:19] simiray27: well maybe not loose the streak but get -5 or some flame?
[6:43:20] nystadt: What's the recipe for the a ascension thing
[6:43:21] Butzehier: mobs can hav a maximum % +dmg
[6:43:22] ProfessionalsOnly: A way to lock the prestige level? :)
[6:43:24] timmolaa: Every 10 vaults is a scav chaos
[6:43:24] player3977047: I think the challenge should be that it would always get harder, since in my opinion if its always the same difficulty ir would feel like only a silly mistake would end your streak, which would feel unfair
[6:43:25] kolacna2: i think long streaks isnt as good becouse it is really bad if you loose multiple weeks of "work"
[6:43:30] onceandalways: Maybe a higher tank mob rate? Although that could mess with alter objectives
[6:43:32] pb_b: but for scav and elixir will get easy
[6:43:33] thiccmilkguy: feel like VH is in a delicate point of balancing
[6:43:33] whomps_pogchamp: If you scale the difficulty properly than yeah there is an impossible level, but the player can always reach a higher level by being better
[6:43:36] minipantalon: maybe every flame randomly decreases one stat
[6:43:37] SuiteSunrise: but ascension is sort of like normal vaulting
[6:43:37] ShelobsLair_: gg
[6:43:38] Wiroe_: doesn’t Minecraft dungeons have something like this type or am I misremembering?
[6:43:38] sunflowerseedshell: Couldn't you get softlocked tho? Like moving at turtle pace after like 50 streak?
[6:43:38] Unheard_Nightmare: flame could do the modifiers the old cake did, so like each flame level is 2% mob damage, 2% mob health to slowly increase so at 50 assension it's a 100% increase
[6:43:41] prophet42699: Maybe add a mini boss after the objective is copleted and the mini boss scale with the flames?
[6:43:41] madsflink: maybe the first few vault have “less than normal” loot so theres an invesment
[6:43:43] KamillPlayZ: what if after each ascension the player gets to choose 1 of 3 difficulty modifiers to add to the flame?
[6:43:44] Slimezzzzz: add like a debuff every 5 - 10 stacks?
[6:43:48] P3pp3rF1y: X mark after 12 cakes seems pretty nice :D
[6:43:49] bestbla: if u add difficulty ur basically adding a limit
[6:43:49] ShelobsLair_: sir what happens if an ally dies in your ascension vault?
[6:43:52] krzysiek3_0: currently it willl be the meta. LIke free more loot for basicly no consequence
[6:43:52] e_shailee: maybe make every flame a gamba? where the blind keeps getting higher?
[6:43:57] Marknu: risk vs reward
[6:43:57] CedH1: wait experience go higher as flame go higher??
[6:43:57] toasterburn809: Thats a loser mindset
[6:43:59] oheylol: increase the cost the making the vault? so it can just cost a lot of gold or something the higher the streak?
[6:44:04] Ferdster02: I don't think it should scale with the amount, I think there should just be a downside to the ascension in general.
[6:44:04] toasterburn809: Sometimes you lose and thats ok
[6:44:05] ExplodinEmeraldsLIVE: How is it going?
[6:44:05] Nfora: I just think there's no reason to run other vaults
[6:44:06] thepolkyman: you know what you're getting into running it though
[6:44:06] Gryfenfer88: You could decrease XP gained in ascension vaults, so it's a loot thing and you wouldn't only do ascension
[6:44:07] Slimezzzzz: or random chance of debuff every couple stacks
[6:44:08] madsflink: Cause the problem is also why wouldnt you run ascension
[6:44:10] e_shailee: maybe in gold or soul value?
[6:44:10] mouse_ina_boot: Whats happening?? You completed wit htime still on the clock!! are you well?
[6:44:13] f0uad01: What about like every 2 to 3 stacks it decreases your trap disarm chance alittle bit
[6:44:13] snotboy22: when was Hermitcraft add to vault hunters
[6:44:14] zth22_: For elixer and scav vaults scaling the difficulty by the same magnitude, or slightly less, I dont think would feel like a failure condition.
[6:44:15] Kildain82: I feel like Dylan was complaining vaults were hard to complete, and now we are complaining completing vaults is too easy of a condition? lol
[6:44:15] TheExecutiioner: what if you could get a max stack of soulflame, you could turn it in and get an omega vault. No enemies, just looting, and once you run that, you have to reset the soulflame?
[6:44:15] thiccmilkguy: to those people: skill issue
[6:44:18] sabrina1202r: it is what it makes it interesting tho
[6:44:20] toasterburn809: Part of the fun is that you can lose
[6:44:20] BlockBreaker2012: @iskall85 whats the biggest radius hammer you can make for mining ores
[6:44:20] gaymersalsa: I I I I I I _
[6:44:22] RELENtLESS_55: @iskall85 will there be a limit of ascension levels?
[6:44:23] gaymersalsa: crap
[6:44:24] Skrzacior2137: Maybe after like 20 flames you see what the objective will be but it will be hard so you will have to prep for the volt acording to objective
[6:44:24] CyberGeiger: It's a game. I have enough loss in real life
[6:44:24] ShelobsLair_: loss makes things interesting
[6:44:27] joe_176: no you get all the loot
[6:44:27] DeeperDevil: then people should not have played hardcore mode
[6:44:30] Hamston85: is there a downside to acention vaults?
[6:44:31] thiccmilkguy: @gaymersalsa HMMMMMMMM
[6:44:31] gaymersalsa: any loss memes in chat rn
[6:44:34] zeus_o9o2: thats the main challenge to keep up the streak
[6:44:36] SuiteSunrise: but you haven't lost tho. you benefited for as long as you had it
[6:44:37] the_great_tan: add barriers across the rooms as you progrees flames
[6:44:37] smolkato: it’s a game… why so serious lol
[6:44:38] juub406: if you lose your streak, drop back a few steps but not all the steps
[6:44:39] j4dice: league its true, vaulthunters its the loot you got along the way LUL
[6:44:41] Svennonontwitch: Did you not clean the room ?
[6:44:44] Tazzad: @iskall85 What about having the easy difficilty in vault decreases the stacks of the soulflame instead of removing it?
[6:44:44] freddyb8: Ask False if she got a artifact in her cake vault crate.
[6:44:45] nomulous: riot should make my account unable to lose YEP
[6:44:45] ramnite_tv: @gaymersalsa mrmatt17Monka
[6:44:45] Kampf_Strudel: not even that you dont loose the time you still got better loot
[6:44:48] pomi2137: and there are some people that actually say that playing league LUL
[6:44:51] Kadeshi_: would requiring a "charge" to use the soul flame be good? like you can't run it 10x in a row, you have to run some normal vaults between?
[6:44:53] asimithehero: If ascension 1 is as good as running an unmodified crystal, there is no reason to ever run a normal vault tho
[6:44:54] CedH1: Why did you get 2.4X EXP?
[6:44:54] Kampf_Strudel: its like having a timed powerup
[6:44:58] despiced: it is the minecraft community you're talking to tho @iskall85
[6:44:59] Mera_212: you lose your mind when losing in leuge not your time
[6:44:59] gaymersalsa: @gaymersalsa I II II I_
[6:45:00] ShelobsLair_: without a price involved you place zero value on anything
[6:45:08] smolkato: yes the journey is the joy
[6:45:08] bigal1978: maybe including a gold payment to ascend or even lock certain vault paths behind a payment lock
[6:45:10] OrangeJuuce890: its about the friends we make along the way
[6:45:11] Myri_Sea: whats the durability on the shield
[6:45:11] bom222243: its always risk vs reward. Thats what makes games fun.
[6:45:12] TgoodClay: maybe create an option where you can “double down” the ascension, but it it twice as hard. if completed you gain 2 points but it would be much more difficult and possibly even cursee
[6:45:13] drak_wastaken: @iskall85  make the objective harder for the type that gets easier from more chest (only elixir and scav , others dont get affected from more chest)
[6:45:16] cadeaugh: if your pet is going to die then why ever have one. You wasted all the time you had with them
[6:45:20] tornado82_: @gaymersalsa Is this loss? Susge
[6:45:23] rektarina1594: You could also decrease by an amount instead for down to 0 upon death
[6:45:25] gaymersalsa: @gaymersalsa :)
[6:45:25] juub406: what if you drop 5 or 10 levels for each loss?
[6:45:27] redstonedad: That's the point of playing a game. Time = enjoyment
[6:45:28] Nightbot: Vault Hunters Reddit for you to check out! https://www.reddit.com/r/VaultHuntersMinecraft/
[6:45:28] karmawins: why not take a percent of the level for failing
[6:45:30] thiccmilkguy: @gaymersalsa I have no idea why this meme is still alive
[6:45:31] urban_beach: its like a run in slay the spire
[6:45:31] rhinojenkins: How much does the flame cost to make?
[6:45:32] bafoon__: do you get catalyst fragments in ascension vaults
[6:45:34] flypig07: Sir, could you add some way to see how much mining speed one needs to instantly break  blocks, chests, ores, ect.? Perhaps in the jewel quest line?
[6:45:36] urban_beach: a game within the game
[6:45:37] zeus_o9o2: even in real life
[6:45:41] kot7k: @bafoon__ no
[6:45:42] luckyboi314: vanilla hardcore players be like
[6:45:45] ferrastar: the real ascension are the friends we meet on the way
[6:45:46] pb_b: even life has that
[6:45:48] nihal_prakash: decrease the chance of attaining elixir and scav while scaling
[6:45:52] foodgod: as long as you have a chance of winning it is fun
[6:45:52] e_shailee: maybe make each vault longer? with more objectives?
[6:45:53] pb_b: school relations work
[6:45:53] xMizzlefaShizzlex: @iskall85 how about this while ascending gain no XP and only finally gain the xp when you end the ascention by leaving the dungeon
[6:45:54] PurpleHeartedUnicorn: i hate loseing but with out it it would be borring
[6:45:55] empcatligula: on the other side it is minecraft and you can't lose in it
[6:45:56] TAxels: what if you added a MAX streak and if you complete the MAX it gives a reward and resets to half
[6:45:57] Tazzad: @iskall85 You can loose 5 or 10 levels if the vault difficulty is easy
[6:45:57] xanking96: why are there iskBurger iskBurger iskBurger iskBurger in the chest by the artifact wall @gaymersalsa
[6:45:58] smolkato: I think I prefer you just reaet
[6:46:01] chippychops1: how is the altar dimension thingy?
[6:46:06] onceandalways: I like the system as it is.
[6:46:07] minipantalon: random stat decrease on every flame ?
[6:46:07] Myri_Sea: ad :(
[6:46:11] iballen93: ads :'(
[6:46:12] smolkato: it’s a gamba every round and that’s exciting
[6:46:14] gaymersalsa: @xanking96 hmm idk prob saved for public use?
[6:46:15] sabrina1202r: reduced to half
[6:46:16] drhallofduty: are you able to have multiple going at the same time?
[6:46:16] thepolkyman: its not like its wasted, you can always do it again
[6:46:16] montypythoncode: i just want the flame to turn into a trophy to show off how high you got before losing
[6:46:18] Nightbot: www.youtube.com/iskall85 | www.twitter.com/iskall85 | https://youtube.com/@vodskall85
[6:46:19] angelic_lillith: Just get good that's all
[6:46:23] smolkato: and you can push yourself to complete
[6:46:25] th3chick3ncoop: can you run side by side ascensions?
[6:46:25] Gryfenfer88: @iskall85 couldn't you make it so Ascension vault rewards less XP, so it does not become the only vault you play
[6:46:26] rektarina1594: Could you trade the soul flamer between players?
[6:46:27] snaptin5643: the part of a good gamer is the ability to rebuild after a loss
[6:46:28] sambhavsam: Maybe going down 10 levels would remove the feel bad factor
[6:46:32] Jackkabuki: Losing all levels is good. its the risk to the reward of more loot.
[6:46:34] eightwebs: Bring back flamigo floaties!
[6:46:35] zeus_o9o2: sylas mid <3
[6:46:35] simiray27: buy back after streak loss?
[6:46:37] SeriousCreeper: thats kinda cool
[6:46:39] f0uad01: What about when you lose you lose a repair slot from all of your gear
[6:46:41] keonmagic221: maybe every 5 lavels it could add a random negative?
[6:46:43] mihea13: Every 5-10 stacks a debuff?
[6:46:44] rytional: think of the hours you could put into super Mario and lose at the end. hours lost or an opportunity to play again?
[6:46:44] Night2315: could make the cost of buying back your body higher than normal
[6:46:45] toasterburn809: Maybe feeling bad is not the worst thing in the world
[6:46:46] zichor: thats just dumb u die u reset just like irl
[6:46:46] smolkato: tbf if you don’t want to take the risk then just make multiple small stack souls
[6:46:50] SeriousCreeper: so you can decide to keep going with the higher level but cursed crystal, OR start a new one from scratch
[6:46:52] mczimo: could you just add ascension level to the crystal level?
[6:46:54] basketbalthijs_06: basketbalthijs_06 subscribed with Prime. 
[6:46:58] sambhavsam: That sounds good
[6:46:59] KamillPlayZ: make the player be able to choose 1 of 3 random difficulty modifiers after going into the vault based on the ascension stack amount
[6:47:00] malcjamz: thats really good i think
[6:47:00] SuiteSunrise: i'd never do it
[6:47:01] Secmt: @iskall85 if you play duo with someone, both of you need to complete to gain the streak?
[6:47:01] thiccmilkguy: you get back 50% of the stacks not 100%
[6:47:03] tacotown85: @iskall85 what is your opinion on Nucleus/Nova builds? Have you ever played around with one?
[6:47:03] drak_wastaken: just make elixir and scavs harder and dont thouch the other vaults  @iskall85
[6:47:03] gaymersalsa: @strandberggg it's the 2nd last option on the left side of the grid GUI. "search box mode" set to JEI synchronized
[6:47:03] marvelprincess2000: iskHeart iskHeart
[6:47:04] CedH1: that sound good
[6:47:05] 2Peache: imagine losing a 20 streak to a computer crash
[6:47:06] the_great_tan: what if you add barriers across the rooms as you progress the flame
[6:47:07] player3977047: it would make the crystal unplayable after a while
[6:47:09] timmolaa: Could you do it so that scav items only have a chance of appearing in core chests. Eg not in added chests from ascention
[6:47:10] Skrzacior2137: you should małe it 50%
[6:47:11] Caseopei1: Nah if the curse is too bad you just start a new one anyway
[6:47:12] minipantalon: but still easy to win
[6:47:12] SuiteSunrise: i'd rather just lose it and start again
[6:47:13] bryzplays: who's on the server?
[6:47:14] thiccmilkguy: only 50% of the stack
[6:47:16] rhinojenkins: What does the soul flame cost to craft?
[6:47:19] j4dice: every 10 stacks random curse on a vault
[6:47:20] StrangePanthers: Yee
[6:47:20] zebrainap: permanent fading PepePoint
[6:47:23] boredbadger: @iskall85  i think at one point you'll have to take a decision. you balance the game around casual or hardcore players
[6:47:24] ramnite_tv: @bryzplays iskall
[6:47:25] brotherj1554: Nah. It's good the way it is
[6:47:25] gaymersalsa: @bryzplays hermits, impulse and joe and false are/were on
[6:47:27] Kildain82: Who are the people streaking so many vaults that this seems easy and please tell me your tricks lol
[6:47:28] zeus_o9o2: it would be unplayable after a while
[6:47:29] onceandalways: I trust the judgement of the devs so I’ll just be happy with whatever comes out of this :D
[6:47:31] thedarksoul_16: Nah... I prefer high risk high reward
[6:47:33] OneTrueSpry: Kinda off topic not sure if you covered it earlier or if anyone has asked. However, would you be able to add a way of earning bronze in the overworld to save our spirit in the event of dying in vault and not having gold to pay for death.
[6:47:34] toasterburn809: Keep the stack system the way it is please dont babify it
[6:47:36] empcatligula: what about an expensive way to save the progress
[6:47:37] pb_b: balancing is harddddd ;-;
[6:47:38] smolkato: nooooo
[6:47:41] StrangePanthers: Cause u can make new ascension
[6:47:42] malcjamz: stops it from being too OP and eventually you would have to stop cause the curses are too hard
[6:47:42] MarkDatter: @rhinojenkins 2 echo gems, a pog and the same stuff you needed for a soul flame before
[6:47:42] e_shailee: I think it can't be a streak that you can keep going forever for profit
[6:47:44] bennieboi20: i like the current system
[6:47:46] Batchz05: maybe instead of perma curse just curse the next vault you run
[6:47:50] superllumina: i like how you have it now, its simple and easy to understand
[6:47:50] drhallofduty: are you able to do multiple ascensions at the same time?
[6:47:55] cadeaugh: Is there a way to set a streak number in configs to recoup a loss due to external factors? E.G. crash, lag, power outtage,
[6:47:56] Danymaddox: i think its way too early to say its super op
[6:47:57] antegravity: Have we done the lost bounties yet?
[6:47:57] Lich_Kirby: So what does it do now? Can a dylan help?
[6:47:58] sambhavsam: Lacks a difficulty factor imo
[6:47:59] Marknu: Don't doubt, unless you have a 90% completion rate your odds ofa 20 vault streak are not that high
[6:48:01] asimithehero: It just seems better than normal vaults, no big drawbacks
[6:48:01] zeus_o9o2: @iskall85 well find out you keep stacking
[6:48:01] CedH1: why your previous vault got 2.4 time experience?
[6:48:02] rhinojenkins: @MarkDatter Honestly that seems fairly cheap for level 65
[6:48:04] onceandalways: Don’t doubt yourself Iskall, people who don’t like it are gonna speak up alot more than the ones who do
[6:48:05] hs_tempo: love the updates iskall cant wait to try it sunday
[6:48:06] Kampf_Strudel: you should make the beggining be worse like you get normal loot at 5 stacks only before that you get less loot than normal
[6:48:06] bennieboi20: you don’t have enough data yet, keep it as it is for now and check in a couple weeks
[6:48:06] sabrina1202r: curse every 10
[6:48:07] SuiteSunrise: yeah.
[6:48:08] fh_chris: I think every 5 lvls remove 30 sec
[6:48:09] snaptin5643: iskall remember you cant build for every one just do what you like and dont dout yourself
[6:48:11] bestbla: how about this after a certain number u get a chance to get an omega curse like for that one vault
[6:48:15] Danymaddox: i like the curses idea yeah
[6:48:16] thiccmilkguy: after 40 ascension every adds one curse because making it harder every ascension will result in huge nerf to the player to the point where they cant play
[6:48:17] drak_wastaken: have you read my sudgestion or you didnt see it @iskall85
[6:48:20] NikitaNik_of: curse every 10 + every fail?
[6:48:24] ndburger05: is each stack equal to a cake or is it more percentage?
[6:48:28] minipantalon: been playing vampire survivors a lot and theres e thing like randomly increases your stats a little everytime you level up should we try it on negative side
[6:48:29] sonic4spuds: Looking forward to having the update to try out! Changes look really fun so far!
[6:48:35] aishikrana125: finally caught up live
[6:48:35] ProfessionalsOnly: Remember to unlearn hunter if you spec into it :)
[6:48:36] TheReaperOf1985: People that are good at the game will win. I will maybe get a streak of 5, and just try to get to 6 iskHeart iskHeart iskHeart
[6:48:37] cursedoutlaw45: Male ascension vaults spawn special ascension mobs which scale with ascension level
[6:48:40] strandberggg: @gaymersalsa Thanks alot :)
[6:48:40] SonicTox: How about soulflame is a way to get permanent buffs? Reach x soulflames and  get a perma bonus, not something op but good enough for endgame where every buff is good? Then startover so it motivates you to play more soulflames and earn more buffs
[6:48:45] asimithehero: @Kampf_Strudel This is a pretty elegant solution
[6:48:47] alpinepanda: it would be cool if you only get all the loot once you decide to end the streak. you can see it in a station or  something
[6:48:48] timmolaa: Downside could be +1-5% trapped chance per vault after level 10
[6:48:49] simiray27: would the curse be the same or random every vault?
[6:48:58] Kampf_Strudel: @asimithehero yeah it makes it more of a commitment
[6:48:58] LsVxPagie: is the new crafting recipe for vault alloy in this new update?
[6:49:00] Matt0027: Every win increases the chance of champions. That way they get considerably harder the farther you go while being more rewarding
[6:49:03] sambhavsam: Oo
[6:49:04] zeus_o9o2: how about a curse other than life going brrr for every 5 vault something
[6:49:05] itsJL137: Where can I find where what vault modifiers do?
[6:49:07] ramnite_tv: I commented that on YT earlier, hueh
[6:49:09] kolacna2: If you make it scale (difficulty and reward) really fast it is very challenging and not so punishing when you fail
[6:49:09] StrangePanthers: Ok ok
[6:49:11] sunflowerseedshell: Imo it's better the way it is now. The people that are afraid of dyeing in it can just not play it
[6:49:14] TAxels: like every 10 streak adds an additional objective?
[6:49:16] e_shailee: i like it
[6:49:17] thiccmilkguy: kill 50 horde mobs
[6:49:17] gaymersalsa: @strandberggg nw! try the different ones out to see which one you like the most!
[6:49:19] Coralotl: Ooooo that sounds very fun! A random quest and completing
[6:49:20] onceandalways: Oooh I like that
[6:49:21] sabrina1202r: hmmmmmmmm interesting
[6:49:27] KamillPlayZ: what if the player would be able to choose 1 of 3 random difficulty modifiers (-x% trap disarm chance, +% mob health, +% wild, or anything, but the player is able the coose the best worst modifier that suits him) after going into the vault based on the ascension stacks
[6:49:27] Zaraca90: Thats what I said xD
[6:49:28] zeus_o9o2: thats hard
[6:49:28] slc_eyeorg: I really like that
[6:49:31] lenjenben: please change that bounty reroll thing so you don’t have to re click the available bounties every time you reroll
[6:49:32] littlepepperbutt: I like that
[6:49:32] jpmendes93: @iskall85 a way to stop ascension level  is hen you reach the number you want you can start adding crystals 1 level lower
[6:49:33] minipantalon: stacking quests ?
[6:49:35] iljalz: thats a good one!
[6:49:35] abtechgen: i like it
[6:49:41] Marknu: if you have the same time to do quest as you do the rest of the vault it would be cool
[6:49:42] jackasspen: haven’t caught one of these streams yet. I was so stoked to see an hold hermit craft build brought in:)
[6:49:45] connorjan: And if you failed would it brick it or stay the same level?
[6:49:47] aszejner: some vaults are very challenging as they are... imagine you get an unfortunate scav, AND get another goal....
[6:49:48] Ferdster02: That sounds really fun
[6:49:50] Oliveeeeeeeeer: !relrease
[6:49:53] Oliveeeeeeeeer: !release
[6:49:53] Nightbot: Vault Hunters update 13 is live on the Hermitcraft Vault Hunters server for testing! Public release will likely be out on Sunday the 14th. Check out iskall's video on the changes: https://youtu.be/CrAUh0SOGY0?si=Qw4iZq7S3-Kis9sv
[6:49:53] prophet42699: @iskall85  Maybe add a mini boss after the objective is completed and the mini boss scale with the flames?
[6:49:54] m_karlss0n: önskar jag kunde bidra med mer än att bara kolla på dina video/streams! men är ensamstående pappa, så kan ej hjälpa till mer än att kolla på allt du gör <3
[6:49:54] Caseopei1: Loot 20 gilded chests is one POI when your streak is high enough
[6:49:55] unknowfrench: Idea : when you loose you get a "broken soul" with the amout of flames you had written on it to make the player think of it as a high score to beat
[6:49:56] thiccmilkguy: how would you code it? because both needs to be complete for the player to win
[6:49:57] JashinFanatic: what if you add additional objectives? Fill the elixir bar to 80% to complete, fill to 100% to ascend
[6:49:57] Lich_Kirby: What if you get ALL 4 god challenges, and you have to complete them all to win?
[6:49:59] Baab83: I think you overthink it now and should first feel how things go on high stacks
[6:49:59] CedH1: even the best player got some big unluck with scav and fail it
[6:50:05] stutte_: or maybe just increase the cost of the soul flame each time?
[6:50:08] j4dice: maybe just every 5 or 10 levels give the extra challenge, or maybe make it random
[6:50:11] CormacAers: how about instead of getting the item, you get a new crystal withg +1 asc. but no create. if you lose a vault, you lose the crystal and the crate. if you want to finish your asc., you combine it with a special craftable item as a finisher, if you win the next vault, you gain a crate that contains level*crates, each crate better the higher level your asc. was
[6:50:11] drhallofduty: are you able to do more than one ascension at the same time?
[6:50:12] woogienatorz: What also a option is, if you complete a ascention, you gain 1% of every your stats, upto 100 ascentions, this way you could make ascentions more difficult right?
[6:50:19] thepolkyman: what do you think the realistic top stack would be for "normal" players?
[6:50:20] zeus_o9o2: yea too early to draw any remarks
[6:50:26] oheylol: increase body buyback, on death, the higher the streak
[6:50:30] gaymersalsa: next one Copege
[6:50:31] asimithehero: Maybe ascension objectives should just be harder than normal objectives, but no scaling
[6:50:38] SeriousCreeper: what if they dont give Xp at all (or reduced) so you have to run other crystals to keep up
[6:50:39] TheReaperOf1985: Just lose 1 min vault time. Every 5 stack, or something
[6:50:39] antegravity: Have we done a puzzle room in this playthrough yet?
[6:50:40] minipantalon: we gonna see 100x
[6:50:40] TAxels: is it possible to have a vault with multiple objectives? like Elixir+Scav
[6:50:40] Ferdster02: That you could easily scale, since the chests will also scale in number so elixir or scav will become easier, so doing more varied stuff is a good compesnation
[6:50:44] SuiteSunrise: if you have 80 stack and lose it, that could be heartbreaking enough.
[6:50:48] Coralotl: It may be a bandaid, but it sounds like a *fun* bandaid. Even if it doesn’t solve the problem, it could make ascension vaults have something even more unique to offer
[6:50:50] drak_wastaken: just change elixir and scav to scale and see what happens with the others no?
[6:50:50] EnslavedMoist: I never find the pilons in guardian vaults
[6:50:52] thiccmilkguy: it definitely needs a difficulty though other wise its easy enough except the 1 in 4 chance of scav
[6:50:53] Nfora: hah, just add vexes to guardians
[6:50:53] trsblur1: is there a way to take scavs off of the pool of possible vault objectives after 10?
[6:50:54] j4dice: lol i think i do worst on guardian vaults, struggle to find all the obelisks
[6:50:56] zeus_o9o2: but so are campfire ones now
[6:50:59] Marknu: well math says if you compete 50% of your vaults your chance of doing a streak of 5 random vaults are roughly (1/2)^4'th assuming you always start your streak after first competionso it does not count ;)
[6:50:59] JustAngelOne: Every 10 streak -30s, then its challenge by it self cuz you want to loot so much at high streaks but you also have less time to complete.
[6:50:59] Caseopei1: Brazier ascension free as well
[6:51:07] tacotown85: Guardian vaults are not free. I can never find obelisks.
[6:51:09] TAxels: shield dura looking sketch
[6:51:09] sabrina1202r: maybe loosing the streak is a big enough cahllenge on its own
[6:51:10] noobmaster69000000000000: how many staxks are you on
[6:51:11] polkmer: @iskall85 Objectives like Decked Out did?
[6:51:11] minipantalon: floor made of chests kekw
[6:51:14] timmolaa: What about No hunter in ascencion vaults
[6:51:15] OneTrueSpry: Iskall "May be to easy" Me, have only successfully completed 2 Scav vaults out of the 30+ I have ran.
[6:51:17] gaymersalsa: @noobmaster69000000000000 this is 5 or 6
[6:51:18] aszejner: a bit late to the party, will you try a cake vault, like a 40 cake-run?
[6:51:22] chippychops1: what god charm do you have?
[6:51:22] Marknu: no we are not going to see a 100 soul flames most players do not have a 99% competion rate
[6:51:23] gaymersalsa: oooh
[6:51:24] thedarksoul_16: We don't have enough data
[6:51:26] Myri_Sea: shield durability?
[6:51:28] keonmagic221: Powergamers are always ahead of the curve
[6:51:29] thiccmilkguy: scav will be way too easy after some stacks and then its too easy for anything
[6:51:30] k1_setae: Iskall, i want to hear your toughts on desing choises for paradox, if theoretical max is 100 rooms. reaching that means swapping between gods multiple times. Is this intentional?
[6:51:31] superllumina: i think greed will kill high streeks
[6:51:40] zeus_o9o2: 2 times 4 Kappa
[6:51:41] NikitaNik_of: maybe flabe "burns" every completion?
[6:51:41] xverion_: 100% i've got some crazy players on my server that will easily get over 100
[6:51:42] sonic4spuds: I've failed more guardians than other objectives, probably close to 50%
[6:51:44] smolkato: scavs are meant to be hard tho. easier if it’s coop
[6:51:46] Juburin: @aszejner he did cake at the beginning of stream
[6:51:46] ProfessionalsOnly: Will you be walking only on chests if you have super high level soul flame? LUL
[6:51:47] onceandalways: Greed is good
[6:51:52] Archimedes94: So, every single Hardcore player should be perma-running Soulflame Vaults right?
[6:51:59] smolkato: yes!
[6:52:00] Litago89_ha: yea
[6:52:00] zeus_o9o2: hunter
[6:52:00] gaymersalsa: have i misunderstood sth, why are scavs getting easier
[6:52:01] sabrina1202r: go
[6:52:02] bafoon__: what about 10% less in every stat every 10 stacks up to a max of 50%
[6:52:03] its_honk: I mean, might as well
[6:52:03] polkmer: @iskall85 would you imput Objectives like Decked Out did?
[6:52:05] sabrina1202r: gamba?
[6:52:06] eightwebs: Gamba!
[6:52:06] drak_wastaken: JUST CHANGE SCAV AND ELIXIR PLEASE READ IT
[6:52:07] Nfora: The xp buff seems like a big deal
[6:52:08] Paudot: gambaa
[6:52:08] jpmendes93: a way to stop ascension level is hen you reach the number you want you can start adding crystals 1 level lower
[6:52:09] onceandalways: Always Iskall, it would be our pleasure
[6:52:10] NikitaNik_of: gamb
[6:52:11] ShelobsLair_: GAMBA
[6:52:13] bunLunaa: @gaymersalsa more chests
[6:52:13] FreudPlays: @iskall85 can people do these accension vaults coop?
[6:52:14] minipantalon: @gaymersalsa more chests
[6:52:14] helliero: So if u are progressing on soulflame, there will be more chests that will make it complete elixir/scav faster
[6:52:19] gaymersalsa: oh duh more chests
[6:52:20] grossjr20: we shall go again!
[6:52:22] aszejner: did you guys see a long care run? like a 40 cake run yet?
[6:52:23] msap_wiz: If anything every ten levels of Ascension, you need to get an random item in the vault in order to go to the next Ascension
[6:52:23] Matt0027: Tbh, you probably need to ban scav and elixir from it. otherwise they both will turn into free wins
[6:52:25] SuiteSunrise: i like the crystal getting cursed every 10 stacks makes sense
[6:52:28] despiced: i also think the audience is overestimating the ability of the average player @iskall85
[6:52:29] BigDoggxx2: Maybe for sav runs with high stacks.  The amount of items needed could go up?
[6:52:30] dashwasher_: gamba?
[6:52:31] OrangeJuuce890: gamba?
[6:52:32] Kampf_Strudel: @Archimedes94 you cant put modifiers on it
[6:52:33] TaxxEvader: is there a way to make it so the soulflame chests just dont drop scav items?
[6:52:33] magdaluo66: how do you make a soulflem
[6:52:34] ShwiftyPirate: is there currently any way to see the streak after you die with it?
[6:52:35] Tiny_Tau: would be interesting to have the flame "burn" in inverse to how much completion you get per run (i.e. more completion = less burn)
[6:52:37] zeus_o9o2: yea show that spiders
[6:52:38] gaymersalsa: what should we gamba on?
[6:52:38] quirkyship28698: I've only ever completed 1 scav vault. As soon as I got a scav I'd lose my streak! But then again I'm not that good and play on Easy and casual mode
[6:52:39] LsVxPagie: at one point or another you will end up reseting the streak when you lose, the streak will be too easy if you dont lose the whole streak
[6:52:40] zeus_o9o2: hunter
[6:52:44] grossjr20: spec?
[6:52:45] thiccmilkguy: i got 104 no more gamba BibleThump BibleThump
[6:52:47] gaymersalsa: flaskCheck
[6:52:48] kibaz_x: @drak_wastaken why should he
[6:52:49] ShelobsLair_: time to GAMBA because i'm a GAMBAADDICT
[6:52:56] zeus_o9o2: free
[6:52:58] Ferdster02: can you make cascading chests not drop scav items?
[6:52:58] minipantalon: shoul there be a cap between spesific mob damage talent
[6:52:59] drak_wastaken: @Matt0027 just make only the two harder no?
[6:53:04] SuiteSunrise: i won't get giant streaks
[6:53:04] Paudot: @thiccmilkguy wdym no more gamba, those 104 could turn into 400
[6:53:05] BunnyMountain: i just hope my poison nova build is still good :)
[6:53:06] gaymersalsa: SPEEDRUN EH?
[6:53:09] SuiteSunrise: but a lot will
[6:53:09] Marknu: So iskall do you know the average completion rate from iskallia servers ?
[6:53:11] sabrina1202r: speedrun
[6:53:13] Kildain82: Isn't the average clear rate under 50%?
[6:53:16] Myri_Sea: speedruunnnn
[6:53:17] zeus_o9o2: @iskall85 this is even easier than guardian no ?
[6:53:18] DutchMSTRSparky: DutchMSTRSparky subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 18 months! 18 months!! Amazing how far you and your team has come with this mod pack. looking forward to the future and what you bring to this amazing game.
[6:53:18] TechnoHail: gamba
[6:53:21] Zaraca90: You can make it so that only the end crate gets better?
[6:53:21] NikitaNik_of: 10 min gamba?
[6:53:22] onceandalways: Maybe for scav the ‘loot’ decreases. That’d be a novelty as well, since it doesn’t scale otherwise
[6:53:23] ShelobsLair_: speedrun lets goo
[6:53:26] EricMTGCast: For me in 12 streaking victories is still quite hard.
[6:53:27] PhysicsNovice: what if the extra chests didnt have scav items
[6:53:30] bas3j: Gamba?
[6:53:34] OrangeJuuce890: next run gamba?
[6:53:35] gaymersalsa:  QUICK GAMB
[6:53:39] IAmMunzee: the higher the stack the % of rarer items needed for scav ever so slightly. for elixir, increase the total amount
[6:53:39] teddybjorn1337: I think it is good as you have it now
[6:53:40] TheReaperOf1985: I love this game. Play a couple of vaults every day. Never had a streak over 3 on random vaults
[6:53:40] drak_wastaken: @kibaz_x becouse more chest makes it easier unlike other vault objectives
[6:53:40] hs_tempo: offer a chance to trade in stacks for something rare? or use them to buy stuff from vendoors?
[6:53:43] thiccmilkguy: wtf under 5
[6:53:46] zeus_o9o2: wtf 5
[6:53:48] gaymersalsa: hryLaf
[6:53:52] strandberggg: holding
[6:53:55] MathanW: you should also consider that not everyone will be as good at this as many are here
[6:54:00] warkr0: trinky time!
[6:54:01] thiccmilkguy: holding for the last
[6:54:01] onceandalways: RIP our channel points
[6:54:01] zeus_o9o2: yea now he loots x mark thanks
[6:54:06] bunLunaa: are there braziers in omega rooms?
[6:54:07] gaymersalsa: oh believers hryLafExceptInPain
[6:54:09] bas3j: Nooooo
[6:54:09] Zinoba: when you click that speed brazier it feels like a x1.25 VOD LUL
[6:54:14] gaymersalsa: @bunLunaa dont think so
[6:54:15] tornado82_: nooo
[6:54:17] fabdonkey: 🧠
[6:54:18] bom222243: I like the ascension system of slay the spire.
[6:54:18] Matt0027: @iskall85 Make it so it exhausts after every run. And you need a special piece of loot to be able to reapply it. That way you cant over use it
[6:54:24] zeus_o9o2: @gaymersalsa Keepo Keepo Keepo
[6:54:25] iljalz: oh god, there goes the gmaba
[6:54:25] Paudot: @thiccmilkguy did you gamba?
[6:54:25] SuiteSunrise: then it's just temporary
[6:54:26] sweetburple: There's also people that won't do this because they think scavs are impossible including some on this server
[6:54:26] thiccmilkguy: after some stacks it would be 0 time LMAO
[6:54:27] warkr0: i like logarithmic time decrease, so that it curves out at like 10 or 15 min
[6:54:28] TheReaperOf1985: 1 min every 5 stacks is good
[6:54:31] PyderMandy: Oh yess
[6:54:31] TgoodClay: maybe every failed objective decreases time
[6:54:33] SuiteSunrise: temporary is good!
[6:54:33] avian946: there’s no skill to that. eventually you just won’t have the time to complete
[6:54:33] onceandalways: Maybe increases the chance to lose time
[6:54:35] thiccmilkguy: @Paudot rip me
[6:54:36] qerutar: and now relics make sense
[6:54:39] j4dice: LUL
[6:54:39] asimithehero: Time decrease seams fun, but it can'¨t be linear
[6:54:41] Archimedes94: KEKW
[6:54:41] TechnoHail: YESSSSS
[6:54:42] myster_ious_iroh: Cool

[6:54:52] FoxFireX_: 10 seconds comes off the clock.
[6:54:53] s1m0n251: seems good
[6:54:54] ggmacy: YESSSSSS
[6:54:54] netseeker: yeah that could always be countered... and that is still good
[6:54:54] j4dice: so win in 15mins or no stack
[6:54:55] WightPaladin: NooOOooo
[6:54:55] onceandalways: Oooooh! Interesting.
[6:54:55] Coralotl: Oooooo
[6:54:55] TAxels: oh a second timer
[6:54:56] thiccmilkguy: after 40 stacks it would be 0. thats dead game
[6:54:56] ShelobsLair_: ooooh? i like this
[6:54:57] sabrina1202r: then it  wont be infinite esssention
[6:54:57] sagittarius_greenbow: sounds cool
[6:54:58] NotMeNever: I think it’s balanced!
[6:54:58] superllumina: YESSSS
[6:55:00] Zinoba: not so much man!!
[6:55:03] j4dice: do you get it back
[6:55:03] TechnoHail: decrease the time in percentage would be better
[6:55:04] Nfora: That sounds great. It still seems good enough to always run those crystals
[6:55:04] crayadass: Hmm interesting
[6:55:05] avian946: stacks of what?
[6:55:06] pb_b: oh yeah sounds good
[6:55:06] polkmer: ooooh
[6:55:06] myster_ious_iroh: yes!
[6:55:07] lavi12310: good
[6:55:07] Myri_Sea: I waited for the x mark to be good for the gamba :)
[6:55:07] Paudot: @thiccmilkguy but you did right? for the nope
[6:55:07] SeriousCreeper: thats neat
[6:55:07] zeus_o9o2: huh ?
[6:55:08] tornado82_: I like it
[6:55:08] PiTo_27_: MMMM
[6:55:09] Kildain82: That would hard cap it though
[6:55:09] ghost_kingv0: that is fin but needs balance
[6:55:09] thiccmilkguy: after certain ones it would be 0 time though
[6:55:09] leo2369q: just a little
[6:55:10] kbcstorm: Sounds perfect
[6:55:11] OneTrueSpry: so like an extra alter in front room to gamble for more stacks faster
[6:55:11] Klinten__: yeah
[6:55:11] zifster: That's a better limiter if tuned right
[6:55:11] CedH1: ok thats GOOD
[6:55:11] Caren9593: no
[6:55:11] valkojam: iskTroll
[6:55:12] bafoon__: makes sense
[6:55:12] NikitaNik_of: smartyone
[6:55:12] toasterburn809: how would fruit work?
[6:55:12] JashinFanatic: that's still a hard cap
[6:55:13] TgoodClay: like the weekly completions from last version?
[6:55:13] smolkato: ohhhh that’s interesting
[6:55:14] atenbobi: that sounds perfect.
[6:55:14] kattykutie: yes
[6:55:14] DavidCzPdy: yes
[6:55:14] jackasspen: I think that would make sense because some objectives would be easier  the higher you get.
[6:55:15] jk_sajoko: Oh that sounds way better
[6:55:15] ramnite_tv: Implied flame stack cap, it is a nice thought
[6:55:15] rhinojenkins: Oh now that sounds good
[6:55:15] Hyweed_: OOHHHHHHH
[6:55:15] abtechgen: that sounds great
[6:55:15] endlesstag59227: might work yeah
[6:55:16] pelu_18: please no I just want to have fun
[6:55:17] Kampf_Strudel: good idea
[6:55:17] FoxFireX_: I like this.
[6:55:18] EricMTGCast: That sounds much better.
[6:55:18] Marknu: ooh good idea
[6:55:18] No_xor: its still the cap though
[6:55:18] littlepepperbutt: Ooo ok
[6:55:19] razlack1: Do u still lose your progress tho?
[6:55:20] TechnoHail: YESSSSS
[6:55:20] 1mnotjoe: that might be something yesh
[6:55:21] stutte_: than u would cap the max stacks no?
[6:55:21] TobyButt89: oh, ye that's cool
[6:55:21] NikitaNik_of: smart
[6:55:21] jqckdaw: Speed run vault?
[6:55:21] Nightbot: Everything in VH 1.18 is very under development & things might change.. Just Trust the Process-- iskall & Devs
[6:55:21] bennieboi20: can you use fruit to increase?
[6:55:22] 1vanpopta1: so whats the cap on time then
[6:55:22] sunflowerseedshell: You would get soft locked at some point tho
[6:55:22] 1mnotjoe: yeah
[6:55:22] NotMeNever: OH there was catch
[6:55:22] iljalz: me likey
[6:55:22] HarcosMalac: Oooooo
[6:55:24] SallData: this will make a cap
[6:55:24] ranger1332: Sound great
[6:55:24] madsflink: thats great
[6:55:24] SunflowerMead0w: hmmmmm i actually do like that and i was the one being dramatic earlier
[6:55:24] warkr0: thats interesting
[6:55:25] PiTo_27_: sounds reasonable FeelsOkayMan
[6:55:25] bestbla: isn't that limiting it ttho ?
[6:55:25] onceandalways: OH that sounds interesting
[6:55:25] gaymersalsa: @pelu_18 this is so valid
[6:55:25] itsjonathanjones: sure, but make it SMALL
[6:55:26] hs_tempo: meh
[6:55:26] PyderMandy: Can you reset without dying?
[6:55:26] mihea13: Sounds good
[6:55:26] TheImmortaldonut: Oh, that's interesting
[6:55:27] sabrina1202r: no it would be annoying in think
[6:55:27] jackasspen: and it would be sick for bragging rights
[6:55:27] YamitsuVT: better
[6:55:27] sonic4spuds: OH, so you it would go down if you took longer?
[6:55:27] Tazzad: @iskall85 Will you have two timers then?
[6:55:28] Marknu: Epic solution
[6:55:28] gregormendele: that just sounds like a soft cap on the stack size
[6:55:29] magdaluo66: noono
[6:55:29] LsVxPagie: would there be a way to increase the time then?
[6:55:29] AyzeckN: hmmm
[6:55:29] kolacna2: oh something like that would be good, that we can make it more risk and more reward if we want
[6:55:29] iljalz: thats a god one
[6:55:29] sagittarius_greenbow: it should have a floor though
[6:55:30] thepolkyman: can you add a lemon to the seal  to get it back?
[6:55:30] Mattsam1234: That basically means you get hit with a scav at 10 stacks and its over
[6:55:30] jackasspen: yeahhhh
[6:55:31] michallive1337: Nooo i think not everything has to have a downside
[6:55:31] minipantalon: cool
[6:55:32] PurpleHeartedUnicorn: maybe not every single stack?
[6:55:33] cannedcrane: This sounds fun
[6:55:34] pb_b: i think its perfect
[6:55:35] howdy_neighbor412: That effectively caps it at some point
[6:55:36] meet198: Where is the cap?
[6:55:37] oheylol: yes. that
[6:55:38] bas3j: Yes
[6:55:38] Batchz05: thats not bad
[6:55:38] NikitaNik_of: YEP
[6:55:39] TAxels: that would still introduce a cap once that timer hit's 0
[6:55:39] magdaluo66: boo noo
[6:55:40] tornado82_: Two timers is a little confusing though
[6:55:41] ItsQuipz: still feels like it can cap out
[6:55:42] Caren9593: that would work
[6:55:42] HarcosMalac: Thats PAGGING
[6:55:43] verqix: Does that mean exit in case of scav but not in case of lodestone exit?
[6:55:44] TheImmortaldonut: It's like a good challenge
[6:55:45] Danymaddox: but that will have a cap
[6:55:45] pelu_18: I just want to keep playing, makes it too hard
[6:55:46] HarlequinCircus: But then if you got cake vaults you could just instant stack?
[6:55:46] DarkOakGhost136: That sounds fun there should be a cap on how low it gets
[6:55:49] tom_goku_: so hard limit?
[6:55:50] thinkjaguar: I feel like you would have to then cap the minimum time other wise it would become impossible to gain stacks
[6:55:51] Mattsam1234: Terrible for scavs
[6:55:51] Archimedes94: With 2min spare on the clock
[6:55:53] TheImmortaldonut: Like a god challenge
[6:55:55] donuttdude22: i like the challenge of trying to get the highest stack size tho
[6:55:56] thiccmilkguy: it would be 0 minutes after some stacks without a cap. With a cap its useless again
[6:55:57] CedH1: but does that mean there is a CAP @iskall85  ?
[6:55:57] MarkDatter: so you can still keep the stacks on completing but you have to basically speedrun it to keep getting it higher and higher
[6:55:59] OtzBigShot: eventually its gonna get to hard
[6:56:01] Hyweed_: IT'S 2 Timers chat
[6:56:01] j4dice: i think that's a good balance because at a certain point average player will fail if you add debuffs and stuff, but this allows them to be able to stay at their skill-capped level
[6:56:03] NotMeNever: I think then the time dediction could be even steeper that way
[6:56:04] JashinFanatic: unless it's logarithmic growth, that's a hard cap on stack growth
[6:56:05] k1_setae: Multiplayer abuse is present in the vault then?
[6:56:09] aszejner: and in scavs....
[6:56:10] Klinten__: 10-30 per plus stacks?
[6:56:10] Kampf_Strudel: you could also do harder ascensions at some intervals to prove worthy
[6:56:12] No_xor: you need to add another timer then
[6:56:14] Nightbot: Support the devs & the pack.  https://www.patreon.com/VaultHunters
[6:56:15] TAxels: Does Fruit increase both timers?
[6:56:16] percival97_: whats up iskall? just joined so i'll go watch the vod back
[6:56:16] redknightks: How would fruits work with this?
[6:56:18] Archimedes94: you only GAIN stacks if you have EXCESS time on the clock after you exit
[6:56:19] verqix: Can you fruit?
[6:56:20] SunflowerMead0w: that does put a hard limit on how many stacks you can get though. eventually you will run out of time
[6:56:20] TechnoHail: cap at 15 min reduction
[6:56:21] onceandalways: There would have to be a cap at some point, or at certain points it remains stagnant
[6:56:24] StrangePanthers: Hmmmm
[6:56:25] Caren9593: you would have to have 2 timers on the screen
[6:56:25] therealtolazytothink: Lose looting time though.
[6:56:27] sambhavsam: Maybe not 2 minutes too much
[6:56:28] namikazeriqqs: every 10 levels of acecnsion, maybe have an urgent/mandatory quest where you have to clear an impossible dungeon to actually gain a level after 10, 20, 30 etc. :/
[6:56:30] Hyweed_: that will be a hard cap tho
[6:56:30] jane_co11: Ouch
[6:56:30] Mattsam1234: okay thats good then
[6:56:30] PiTo_27_: omega
[6:56:30] lavi12310: ya good
[6:56:31] OneTrueSpry: Oh like a stacks multiplyer option
[6:56:31] Lich_Kirby: Oooo
[6:56:31] HarcosMalac: YEP
[6:56:31] thepolkyman: 10 min remaining cap?
[6:56:31] oheylol: overall vault time stays the same. objective time is separate
[6:56:33] 64_Bit_Cake: OOOO yes!
[6:56:33] Mattsam1234: yes
[6:56:34] kibaz_x: what will be the cap tho?
[6:56:34] cynebeald: isnt this like in diablo 3, you had to finish in time to level up your speciakl gems (or get a new one or something)
[6:56:34] Juburin: you still get a soft lock
[6:56:35] ninic139: Yes
[6:56:36] Batchz05: #pag
[6:56:36] candidcrafter: That sounds overcomplicating
[6:56:37] Coralotl: But would that still not create a cap at some point? A cap on increasing the stack size. Not being able to increase your stack size every time is good, but wouldn’t it become impossible at some point
[6:56:37] NikitaNik_of: POG
[6:56:37] hs_tempo: you can loot after achieving objective??
[6:56:38] Myri_Sea: yay!
[6:56:39] cursedoutlaw45: Yep
[6:56:40] razlack1: And if you fail the vault entirely
[6:56:40] thiccmilkguy: You have to cap it or it will be 0 minutes after some stacks
[6:56:41] HarcosMalac: PagBounce
[6:56:42] zeus_o9o2: i feel dumb BibleThump
[6:56:42] Aww_Mann_: Aww_Mann_ subscribed at Tier 2. 
[6:56:43] automattus: Iskall is there a build guide somewhere?
[6:56:43] Katsanity_: vendoors seem very nice
[6:56:46] Chrispello1995: great idea
[6:56:46] sambhavsam: You'll have 5 minutes for 50+ streaks
[6:56:47] SunflowerMead0w: vault time is not infinite
[6:56:52] jessmay121_: different difficulties could cap at different times?
[6:56:52] Zinoba: that sounds complicated but interesting
[6:56:53] sabrina1202r: it would be anyoing i think
[6:56:54] littlepepperbutt: I like it
[6:56:54] TheReaperOf1985: This is speed running crate wibes
[6:56:58] 0finifish: yap
[6:57:00] Caseopei1: After a certain streak, you just run empower and prayge for braziers
[6:57:01] sagittarius_greenbow: the time should have a floor though
[6:57:01] avian946: I’m assuming these vendoors gear can have legendary?
[6:57:03] TAxels: sounds good to me
[6:57:05] abhinav_agrawal: or make -1 accension stack
[6:57:09] SunflowerMead0w: i changed my mind i dont like it
[6:57:10] LsVxPagie: so you speed run to increase your time?
[6:57:14] bennieboi20: can you extend your time with fruits
[6:57:14] NardiuS: PAG great idea
[6:57:16] Nightbot: Watch iskall85’s VOD’s at https://youtube.com/@vodskall85
[6:57:18] th3chick3ncoop: I really like that solution
[6:57:18] wulfeheart: is there a way to lose stacks?
[6:57:19] toasterburn809: i like the idea of the ascension being a challenge and not being OP for looting anyways
[6:57:19] kolacna2: yea it is similar to caking but higher stakes, i like it
[6:57:20] thedarksoul_16: What if they just loot and leave
[6:57:21] nihal_prakash: -1 accension stack
[6:57:22] tacotown85: Don't you hit a point where you lose too much time to make scavs possible?
[6:57:22] haze_deadline: pagging on that
[6:57:22] HarlequinCircus: Are cake vaults part of ascension? If you got lucky to get a cake vault you could just end it on the first room right?
[6:57:22] Caseopei1: SPeedrunning braziers for streak. Loot the other to keep
[6:57:24] Sea_Jay27: Could you use the old speedrunning timer to indicate the time to increase the stack?
[6:57:25] thiccmilkguy: then after 70+ it will be 0 minutes and then its not worth playing
[6:57:25] Ramzi65ok: is there a way to prevent the size from increasing?
[6:57:25] cannedcrane: Is there a time cap?
[6:57:25] SuiteSunrise: stack 50 you just jump in, loot and scoot
[6:57:26] TechnoHail: YESSSS this sounds better but give atleast 5 mins for the vault
[6:57:27] endlesstag59227: what happens when you reach the point of having 2 mins to complete a scavenger hunt
[6:57:30] meo_benderson: sort of a new cake vault then
[6:57:30] razlack1: If you fail the vault or die you lose you stack?
[6:57:32] d0nghamm3r: I like the update 13 changes Iskall!
[6:57:32] xsabato: like the portals in diablo 3
[6:57:33] pb_b: it would be a hard cap at one point
[6:57:34] sabrina1202r: i think it takes away from the theme i thinl
[6:57:38] oDtEoDoA: sacrifice the stacks for a mega loot run
[6:57:40] hs_tempo: most scavs are impossible in 5 minutes for most of us
[6:57:41] gaymersalsa: Luting
[6:57:42] lienka557: i think you’re overthinking it. it’s good now. more rules will make it more distraction from main goal of the game. simple challenges are fun addition
[6:57:47] itsjonathanjones: after a certain size, it becomes a perm looting crystal
[6:57:47] abhinav_agrawal: or make it -1 accension
[6:57:48] CedH1: I dont love the fact there is a cap
[6:57:48] OneTrueSpry: would fruits affect the timer?
[6:57:49] minipantalon: its a real big cap pshycological wise
[6:57:50] Zinoba: Luting
[6:57:51] kade_kat: is it always going to be 11
[6:57:51] Batchz05: what if you also had a diffuvult quest that increased that by like a min or so
[6:57:52] MathanW: then why would people play it if they hit the soft cap?
[6:57:53] thiccmilkguy: 5 minutes over close the gamba i need that 5+
[6:57:54] Nfora: What's the cost to run one of these vaults?
[6:57:54] nihal_prakash: make it -1 stack
[6:57:56] Wiroe_: Is there a point in running other vault crystals now?
[6:57:57] pelu_18: please don’t that’s going to be so impossible, I just want to enjoy the game
[6:57:57] Roll_It_Twice: How Would vault fruit work
[6:57:58] haze_deadline: i like the idea except for the soft cap I guess but that's probably fine or it would be the only thing anyone does like you said earlier
[6:57:59] NikitaNik_of: cake-flame peepoGiggles
[6:58:01] ShelobsLair_: if you fail you still loose the flame right?
[6:58:02] Klinten__: can it ba a cake objective?
[6:58:02] PiTo_27_: @gaymersalsa since when did wwe have Luting here hryLaf
[6:58:03] D008ie360: I CAME OUT AS LESBAIN today
[6:58:03] 64_Bit_Cake: Iskall But if I still complete but not in 5 mins do I keep stack size right?
[6:58:04] ramnite_tv: At stack 50 youve earned your loot
[6:58:05] jane_co11: Dungeon in middle
[6:58:07] SuiteSunrise: i wasn't criticizing i was planning
[6:58:08] hba423: i love this. feels like the old speedruns from VH2
[6:58:08] hs_tempo: make all ascension crystals be the new monolith things?
[6:58:11] Caseopei1: Once at stack 50 you'll never lose it
[6:58:11] Mattsam1234: Are the soulf flame vaults only solo?
[6:58:12] gaymersalsa: @D008ie360 CONGRATS!!!
[6:58:13] zeus_o9o2: itll make the progression speed quite fast like skipping it
[6:58:13] Hyweed_: seems a rlly good balance
[6:58:13] Tazzad: But you can just farm for scav objectives then
[6:58:14] Nightbot: To add your alias to VHSMP-- Go to the official VH Discord https://discord.gg/vaulthunters  & add in the alias-request channel found in the VHSMP Category.  shorturl.at/ekxLX
[6:58:15] veronicorn: so it just becomes speedrun strats
[6:58:16] cannedcrane: 3
[6:58:18] 64_Bit_Cake: @d008ie360 congrats!
[6:58:20] OneTrueSpry: would fruit extend time for objective??
[6:58:20] sunflowerseedshell: Wouldn't it be better to cqp the time reduc5ion at some point (just so we can see what the max streak is)?
[6:58:21] automattus: Don’t over complicate
[6:58:22] gaymersalsa: @gaymersalsa since a while ago hryLafExceptInPain based
[6:58:23] pb_b: still havent fixed the scav issue
[6:58:23] DavidCzPdy: wow
[6:58:25] PiTo_27_: @D008ie360 hryAdmire congrats
[6:58:26] sambhavsam: Omega
[6:58:28] 0of1est: Pag
[6:58:28] despiced: @iskall85 how about you do that but then you add ascenscion fruits that give you more time?
[6:58:28] thiccmilkguy: without any other disadvantage, after 15 it will be too easy to reach 50. Maybe it will take more time this time but it will still be easy
[6:58:29] razlack1: Sounds like a win to me. Nice idea
[6:58:29] Ramzi65ok: is there anyway to replace a soul flame if the vault is lost unfairly (bug, server issues)?
[6:58:31] thedarksoul_16: But there's no penalty to leave
[6:58:32] Knew_It_Owl: OOOO Omega chestplate
[6:58:32] Myri_Sea: omega chestplate :)
[6:58:32] Nfora: Maybe applying it to the crystal should cost echo or bennies
[6:58:36] connorjan: If you fail the special objective you should lose a stack then
[6:58:39] Tazzad: @iskall85 You can just farm for scavs then
[6:58:40] xWiedzmax: @D008ie360 congrats!
[6:58:40] boredbadger: what happens on bail?
[6:58:40] toasterburn809: i like that a lot
[6:58:43] Zinoba: @D008ie360 LesbianPride
[6:58:44] my_only_fearghal: Or once you go done to 5 minutes to and a level it stays at 5 minutes for the rest, so not a cap but a very hard thing to complete
[6:58:45] abhinav_agrawal: or -1 stack size
[6:58:46] D008ie360: OMG TYYY
[6:58:48] NardiuS: ok what about  relics then ?
[6:58:48] smolkato: and if you fail it resets?
[6:58:48] lazypandaman: omega sword
[6:58:52] Ferdster02: But what is the difference between maintaining it and increasing it in this case?
[6:58:54] MrFreeze935: LesbianPride
[6:58:55] iljalz: @D008ie360 congrats!
[6:58:57] sundew2524: @D008ie360 hell yeah!
[6:58:58] sunflowerseedshell: LesbianPride
[6:58:59] gaymersalsa: LesbianPride
[6:59:00] flynnflannflonn: <3 <3 <3
[6:59:00] ninjataco25: but what about loot chest then?
[6:59:01] kolacna2: that is why iskall is a developer and we arent, he made great idea of our commets
[6:59:01] CasualGameuz: can't wait for the update!
[6:59:02] IAmMunzee: it will also promote more co-op as multiple people can do scabs in the reduced time to complete it
[6:59:03] PhysicsNovice: whatever
[6:59:04] noteevee: @D008ie360 jmaria2Pride its a big milestone, proud of you!
[6:59:05] bom222243: maybe if you only complete the objective 3 times in a row. you decrease one stack.
[6:59:06] Caren9593: but that just turns it into a speed run
[6:59:07] MarkRubisntein: @D008ie360 Congragulation!!
[6:59:08] tangerinedoro: LESBIAN DUDES RISE UP
[6:59:10] 64_Bit_Cake: LesbianPride
[6:59:11] flynnflannflonn: LesbianPride LesbianPride
[6:59:11] Coralotl: LesbianPride
[6:59:11] thiccmilkguy: without other disadvantages, it will be easy to get to 50 I think because after 10ish it will be easy to complete anything
[6:59:12] NardiuS: cuz what gonna be starting point  for that quest?
[6:59:14] Marknu: Another option could also be to allow random modifiers to roll like for all other dungeons that are pure random
[6:59:15] bunLunaa: TransgenderPride LesbianPride
[6:59:16] beejypoo: Congratulations!!
[6:59:17] iljalz: LesbianPride
[6:59:20] TgoodClay: ?
[6:59:21] Ramzi65ok: is there a way implemented to artifically increase the stack size with commands? incase the flame is lost unfairly
[6:59:26] ramnite_tv: @Ferdster02 You'll have a constant vault time to maintain, but decreasing time to ascend further, that's the difference here
[6:59:26] Cychadopi: Congraaats
[6:59:27] beejypoo: LesbianPride
[6:59:28] noobmaster69000000000000: eww
[6:59:29] SuiteSunrise: i think temporary is a good idea. build in a restart
[6:59:35] thiccmilkguy: close the gamba lets goo
[6:59:35] EVO_Gaming6000: Ig etho would like to hang around
[6:59:37] sundew2524: LesbianPride
[6:59:40] pelu_18: will there still be the normal timer? if you complete in that timers you keep the stack, if you complete in the quick timer you get another stack?
[6:59:42] azrafdaguy: @D008ie360 LesbianPride LesbianPride
[6:59:43] oheylol: just do what ever Etho suggests
[6:59:44] ShelobsLair_: @gaymersalsa looking like even 10 minutes woulda been close
[6:59:46] Marknu: it's a great idea to run it on a seperate timer
[6:59:47] phreaks: maybe the flame degrades and an item needs to be found in special rooms to fix the degradation
[6:59:49] Litago89_ha: thats good :D
[6:59:49] CedH1: But does that mean this way means there is a cap ?
[6:59:50] razlack1: It sounds like an interesting concept. You would need to have a counter somewhere to remind you of the reduced target time
[6:59:53] No_xor: you would need to show both timers somehow
[6:59:54] asimithehero: So ascension is just VH:Expert mode? Kappa
[6:59:56] mysticjerboa: @oheylol tru lol
[6:59:59] eightwebs: My sister came out by rocking up on bmw motorbikes with her partner and we were like "we know".
[6:59:59] TheItalianDylan: How about taking 2 minutes 30 seconds every 10 and it caps at 50
[7:00:03] NardiuS: do relics gonna increase the lenght what u have for objectiv ?
[7:00:04] toasterburn809: its kinda like the raffle seals
[7:00:10] warkr0: would it makes sense for running a soul flame vault be a part of the questline
[7:00:12] Ferdster02: @ramnite_tv Oooh, i get it now, so you'd still have 25 min in the vault, but if you don't complete in 5 min you will still keep it
[7:00:13] HarlequinCircus: Are cake vaults in ascension?
[7:00:13] zifster: It's that or increase the scav/elixer/etc difficulty
[7:00:15] Tazzad: Would there be two different timers? @iskall85
[7:00:17] thiccmilkguy: completing objective after 10 will be extremley easy
[7:00:20] pelu_18: will there be two timers?
[7:00:21] Nightbot: Want to host your own Vault Hunters server? Check out https://bisecthosting.com/vaulthunters , use code: "VaultHunters" for a 25% discount on your first month of hosting
[7:00:21] ramnite_tv: @Ferdster02 Exactly
[7:00:22] sofie0125: wont scavs and elixar still be super easy, that way even if you dont assend you would still have an easy time completing
[7:00:24] abhinav_agrawal: -1 stack
[7:00:29] Caseopei1: Doesn't solve, you still complete the objective easily
[7:00:31] OneTrueSpry: Do you have an estimated date of release for VH vanilla+?
[7:00:36] Marknu: It's not gonna be an issue
[7:00:37] Dreizemo: Dreizemo subscribed at Tier 1. 
[7:00:37] zeus_o9o2: saying its ezzzz LUL
[7:00:40] Hyweed_: NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[7:00:42] sambhavsam: Skill issue
[7:00:43] Lich_Kirby: What if! You have to complete the objective within a very short timer based on the ascension level?
[7:00:45] e_shailee: lolll
[7:00:47] therealtolazytothink: I figure I'll lose everyone early on a scav.
[7:00:49] smolkato: are vaults difficult to complete…?
[7:00:49] Dreizemo: sup Iskal
[7:00:50] ranger1332: @iskall85 , could you plunder assention Vaults?
[7:00:54] cannedcrane: Different people complaining
[7:00:55] thiccmilkguy: with more chests it will be too easy after 10 stacks
[7:00:55] Kampf_Strudel: on higher levels you will still have the problem with scavs
[7:00:57] dia__hi: -1 is good
[7:00:59] sambhavsam: Too complicated for my brain 🧠
[7:01:06] pb_b: it would get easier though thats true lol
[7:01:07] zeus_o9o2: yea thats competitive
[7:01:08] kathinkajean: its not majority of players in your stream either. there are casual redditors wh/o will not think it’s too hard
[7:01:11] TobyButt89: I will never get more than 3 stacks, so ye, go big on the time penalty, it won't affect me, but will challenge the pro players
[7:01:11] Kieonas: im down with that
[7:01:11] xverion_: nah lose 5 stacks
[7:01:15] ninic139: -1 good idea!
[7:01:16] Mattsam1234: kekw when you get 3 scavs in a row
[7:01:16] agentdid127: what if your kiwis keep your hearts down?
[7:01:16] Coralotl: Oooo yeah
[7:01:16] Nightbot: For everything Vault Hunters, check out the website! https://vaulthunters.gg/
[7:01:16] NardiuS: nah
[7:01:19] Marknu: haha
[7:01:21] d0nghamm3r: Negative penalty would need to be more than -1 probably
[7:01:24] melonhunt: yeah that sounds fine i think
[7:01:26] Chibi_Wez: Maybe that'd be a difficulty thing?
[7:01:26] Ramzi65ok: we could use the golden timer speedrun mechanic from season 2
[7:01:27] HarcosMalac: EZ
[7:01:27] abtechgen: its not easy
[7:01:28] sabrina1202r: -1 is a great idea
[7:01:29] Wiroe_: If you exit the vault you could get minus
[7:01:29] Banfetaar: Or add a curse at the end of "soft timer"
[7:01:30] sagittarius_greenbow: nah, cuz im gonna get 10scavs and lose all my progress
[7:01:31] sonic4spuds: I think that makes more sense.
[7:01:31] xverion_: more then 1 for sure, minimum 5 stacks. over 50 maybe 10?
[7:01:31] thiccmilkguy: its too easy when there is 10x chests not normally BibleThump BibleThump
[7:01:31] Lich_Kirby: End game content can be a little more complicated
[7:01:32] smolkato: scavs are hard but they’re meant to be and I appreciate the challenge, the others are easy enough you could complete ez
[7:01:33] gaymersalsa: @ShelobsLair_ he said "complete and run out" and i ran with it.
[7:01:33] trsblur1: it should cost a stack
[7:01:34] Grothe406: could even do stack checkpoints, lose go to last checkpoint, lose multiple times in a row go back a checkpoint
[7:01:34] 64_Bit_Cake: Yep that's perfect
[7:01:35] blackjacksepp: I like that idead
[7:01:35] asimithehero: Now we are talking
[7:01:36] leo2369q: yes
[7:01:37] oDtEoDoA: -1 per x amount of chests looted
[7:01:37] ramnite_tv: In before "Every time I roll a scav I lose stacks" hryLeddit hryLafExceptInPain
[7:01:37] endlesstag59227: and then you will have to work to maintain it rather than perm looting
[7:01:38] zeus_o9o2: after some level itll be back and fourth type
[7:01:43] cannedcrane: The people that watch twitch are probably going to be better than people who play casually
[7:01:46] bennieboi20: that’s a good compromis
[7:01:47] bom222243: yeah , that will come at an equilibrium at your true skill level.
[7:01:48] lienka557: don’t overthink it. it sounds like fun now
[7:01:50] Ferdster02: maybe a percentage of stacks so it's worse to go higher
[7:01:50] bennieboi20: compromise *
[7:01:51] slc_eyeorg: I dont like losing something you have earned.....
[7:01:51] bestbla: that will cap it real quick KEKW
[7:01:55] SunflowerMead0w: grumble grumble why does everything have to be hard why cant they sometimes just be good?
[7:01:56] OneTrueSpry: WIll the pedestals affect the timer for completing the objectives in time?
[7:01:57] jester_badger: What about lose a percentage of stacks with a minimum of 1? More punishing at high levels?
[7:01:57] ShelobsLair_: @ShelobsLair_ it's iskall, he always greeds even when he plans not to KEKW
[7:01:57] mysticjerboa: could u use fruit to extend the ascension timer?
[7:02:00] hs_tempo: completing vaults is pretty easy if you dont loot and focus on objective. but looting is the best part so its hard... makes sense to me
[7:02:08] zeus_o9o2: yea that  is good
[7:02:08] nihal_prakash: YAA
[7:02:10] thiccmilkguy: people might get frustated but it sounds alot of fun now
[7:02:11] gaymersalsa: @ShelobsLair_ you would think we'd have learned byu now
[7:02:14] ddSqueeze: When can you start ascension? 65?
[7:02:16] sambhavsam: Nah death shuru be like -10
[7:02:17] zeus_o9o2: dylans be braining
[7:02:17] gaymersalsa: @ShelobsLair_ my gambas have been arse today hryLaf
[7:02:19] toasterburn809: that sounds a lot more deep
[7:02:21] maetti1286: but would you get your time back?? @iskall85
[7:02:22] Marknu: I consider my self a semi decent player but my competion rate is only about 70-80%, survival is 99% - playing on impossible so i expect a good chance to make a 10 streak but doubt i can hit 50 or higher
[7:02:22] Dreizemo: Dreizemo is gifting 1 Tier 1 Subs to iskall85's community! They've gifted a total of 1 in the channel! 
[7:02:23] Dreizemo: Dreizemo gifted a Tier 1 sub to Scypio55! 
[7:02:23] tacotown85: What about losing a percentage of stacks instead of a static amount?
[7:02:23] kibaz_x: what about multiple objectives on 50+ ascension vaults? like scav + guardians
[7:02:23] dia__hi: Dylan smart!
[7:02:27] ferrastar: so punishing people who want to greed?
[7:02:27] gaymersalsa: !rock
[7:02:28] Nightbot: Gifted subs are given by our generous iskallians. If you get one, you'll see an iskallium crystal in front of your name. Check your notifications to see who it was & remember to thank them.
[7:02:30] thiccmilkguy: previously it wasn't as fun but now it sounds quite fun
[7:02:31] Ramzi65ok: by that logic fruit would have to increase the alter objective timer
[7:02:33] player3977047: the best way to knoa what works better is to try different things and experiment
[7:02:34] despiced: @iskall85 make ascenscion fruits for that reason
[7:02:34] Zoogie82: How about that stacks also increase champions change?
[7:02:36] Mattsam1234: Could make ascended fruit?
[7:02:36] cannedcrane: What about Wedars Hourglass
[7:02:37] Dreizemo: have fun scypio
[7:02:38] asimithehero: Not very confusing i think. Just have two timers
[7:02:38] Tazzad: I have a hard enough time to keep track of the one timer in the vaults now..
[7:02:38] Zeronar: I feel like more than 1 level would be better
[7:02:38] TAxels: but think of how hype all the scav's are because you are using fruit
[7:02:39] 64_Bit_Cake: What does soul flame cost? I forgot DinkDonk
[7:02:42] nerdydog682: it should cost more than a stack, just because I don’t think there’s enough drop off on loot from one stack to another
[7:02:44] Ramzi65ok: the golden clock yess
[7:02:45] ItsQuipz: what if there was ascended fruits for the ascension timer
[7:02:48] TheRedBrain: the -1 stack is a very interesting idea and as you say it would kinda balance itself
[7:02:53] aranckerosaurus: wait how dcan we complete a vault after the timer? i just got here
[7:02:54] ShelobsLair_: @gaymersalsa they've been great for my point balance GAMBAADDICT And I'm glad people havn't learned yet, better for my ratios KEKW
[7:02:57] Lich_Kirby: You could have the Ascension as a quest on the left
[7:02:58] kolacna2: so if i understand you mean -1 stack times the number of stacks you would get if you win?
[7:02:59] ranger1332: @iskall85 could you plunder essention crystals?
[7:03:02] Skrzacior2137: What do you think about myabe getting less time but after you finish the objective you get the time back to loot
[7:03:03] MarkDatter: @64_Bit_Cake 2 echo gems, a pog and the same stuff on the old soul flame recipe
[7:03:06] onceandalways: There could be a vault pepper or something that adds time to that timer. TECHNICALLY a fruit, but also kind of not one xD
[7:03:08] gaymersalsa: @ShelobsLair_ ofcourse
[7:03:08] pb_b: like with the final vault for vh2?
[7:03:08] thiccmilkguy: it will be like a level of pro. it will also be a soft cap
[7:03:09] Hyweed_: yeah, but that gives no info on how much time you have?
[7:03:13] ProfessionalsOnly: a 2nd differently coloured timer seems beter
[7:03:15] Hyweed_: just when you are out of time
[7:03:16] Nightbot: www.youtube.com/iskall85 | www.twitter.com/iskall85 | https://youtube.com/@vodskall85
[7:03:16] JashinFanatic: I feel like anything that messes with time feels bad. Void liquid is avoidable, but forcing it on ascension is cringe
[7:03:16] Kampf_Strudel: whats the full timer?
[7:03:25] lienka557: time cap will make it really just focus on completion. will limit looting. so why do it if don’t have time to loot further you go?!?
[7:03:28] 64_Bit_Cake: @markdatter ty
[7:03:29] maetti1286: @iskall85 but what happens to the time then?
[7:03:31] simiray27: but then there needs to be a way to see how much time you've got for the ascension
[7:03:33] doomyjuke: it would be like an ELO rating
[7:03:34] piso112: Does sub give a option to rewatch stream offline
[7:03:37] zeus_o9o2: -5 something stacks will make it easier to flex higher lvl stacks
[7:03:37] kaspertgjone: do it, do the impossible
[7:03:37] rektarina1594: I think mid-late game monoliths were harder than the new braiziers
[7:03:39] Archimedes94: You'd reach an equalibrium
[7:03:40] connorjan: Why not just scale the main vault objective to get harder? Scavs more items, more elixer required, etc. Then leveling up and gear will help you get to higher levels and feel good that way
[7:03:42] mikog079: then you should maybe scale it, so how higher you go the more stacks you lose
[7:03:45] thepolkyman: with the stacks, would you eventually run into the same issue as the darkness vaults?
[7:03:48] Lemon_RdBrn: its like an mmr system
[7:03:48] Wiroe_: Did you see Etho doing the impossible dungeon in his video?
[7:03:52] gaymersalsa: @piso112 you dont need a sub to watch his VOD here! hryAdmire
[7:03:52] CasualGameuz: Can't wait to try the new cake!
[7:03:52] Kampf_Strudel: @JashinFanatic it will only be necessary for increasing your asscension
[7:03:53] Ramzi65ok: it'll reach equilibrium
[7:03:53] verqix: The different color hides information, I would prefer having a full timer added
[7:03:54] Coralotl: The self balancing seems very nice
[7:03:55] thiccmilkguy: it will be like "i got 40 stacks im pro" which is absolutely fun
[7:03:55] Kevin33_3: if you die maybe it removes a lot of stack without resetting all progress
[7:03:55] zebrainap: will reach an equilibrium yes
[7:03:56] Kush_06: that also effectively is -2 as compared to what it'll be if ya won because instead of gaining 1, you end up with your old stack minus 1
[7:03:57] Marknu: @iskall85 question: will we ever see challenge again like we had in season 2 ?   You spoke about raid and boss returning if those are also in the pool for asc. they will also mix it up more
[7:04:06] gaymersalsa: hryLaf
[7:04:07] Gschiidli: just came in and what is the idea?
[7:04:08] thiccmilkguy: LMAO
[7:04:08] trsblur1: worth the follow up
[7:04:08] Roll_It_Twice: More videos woooo
[7:04:10] Kampf_Strudel: woohooo
[7:04:11] Zinoba: yayyy more videos
[7:04:13] sagittarius_greenbow: lol
[7:04:13] iljalz: lol

[7:04:17] StrangePanthers: Worth
[7:04:17] therealtolazytothink: More bugs moar views
[7:04:18] 64_Bit_Cake: I mean it could go In Update 14....
[7:04:18] thiccmilkguy: money money money
[7:04:19] sofie0125: you would have to make a way of comleting the objective without leaving the vault
[7:04:20] gaymersalsa: do a RE: title hryLaf
[7:04:21] bennieboi20: gotta get that YouTube bag
[7:04:21] minipantalon: progressing with dylan the way we like
[7:04:21] pb_b: it still limits how much forward how much you push forward right?
[7:04:22] lazypandaman: oh no more content
[7:04:24] Zinoba: WOOO TEAM MORE YT VIDEOS
[7:04:24] agentdid127: yay extra Iskall video!
[7:04:25] OneTrueSpry: Yeah I can def get behind this idea it adds some complexity to it sure but it seems like it will make the challenge more of an effort. As you increase in stack size is the number required to complete the vault get harder? such as scav requesting more items with each stack upgrade or elixer requiring more?
[7:04:25] WteLotuS: Dylan sometimes smart
[7:04:26] sabrina1202r: isnt it too early to judge
[7:04:26] HarcosMalac: @lienka557 that's the tradeoff, you either loot, or gain more chests for next time

[7:04:34] Dreizemo: can someone give me a brief explanation of vault hunters?

[7:04:41] lavi12310: hi yt
[7:04:43] TheImmortaldonut: Maybe collect data first and see where you land with the ascension?
[7:04:44] 64_Bit_Cake: Yay look mom I'm on YouTube!
[7:04:49] zeus_o9o2: we are having a asencion of knowledge

[7:05:02] asimithehero: CHAT! We have ascended to the level of vodskall. Rejoice!
[7:05:12] gaymersalsa: it would help if you'd put the correct link in your video descriptions hryUhm
[7:05:12] ShelobsLair_: @gaymersalsa 13 minute "speedrun". Pretty good for Greedskall
[7:05:13] xHarjot: 3.1x
[7:05:14] onceandalways: @dreizemo A roguelike dungeon crawler in which you enter these temporary vaults and pillage and plunder
[7:05:16] 64_Bit_Cake: 73.5k rn so not far
[7:05:18] Tonrac: are there going to be any cosmetic unlocks for ascension milestones?
[7:05:21] sabrina1202r: end the gamba
[7:05:22] Ferdster02: @Kadeshi_ That would just make passive builds stronger
[7:05:23] Crazedmonkey406: loot if you get a scav

[7:05:24] razlack1: #PLAQUEFORSECCI
[7:05:27] candidcrafter: Washed up .. jk lol
[7:05:28] toby8998: would it be helpfull for you to let the vodskall video's play in the background?
[7:05:29] Ramzi65ok: omega legendary chaining sword time
[7:05:33] kattenbrokken: Is it me lagging or iskallman?
[7:05:34] varaaq: Hey Mr. Skall!  Another angle to consider would be customizing these ascensions with a UI similar to the dungeon tables -- when you complete your ascension choose one of 3 random modifiers to tack on.  That would incentivize people to create a soul flame for each specific need rather than treating it as a blanket vault improvement.  Though it may be a bit redundant, considering catalysts and divine vaults already exist.
[7:05:35] thiccmilkguy: you initially said you would do a stream and the video from the stream. That would have removed the follow up
[7:05:35] jessmay121_: would the ascension time scale differently for the different difficulties (easy, normal, hard)?
[7:05:36] jointwing: going to YB to see if im subbed to vodskall!
[7:05:39] cynebeald: still called monolith crate?

[7:13:23] zeus_o9o2: Going down at oxygen lvl
[7:13:23] mossycomet: it give the vault an intention
[7:13:24] mondgesicht98: this guzy
[7:13:24] Hamston85: @iskall85 is there a downside to acentions because it sounds like if you don’t catalyst or key run there is no reason to not run acention
[7:13:25] BlueCrystalBeast: copium
[7:13:25] therealtolazytothink: Then you tumble down when you fail
[7:13:25] Stressmonster: he is cute he is
[7:13:26] onceandalways: The lift ascends or descends
[7:13:26] kibaz_x: climbing the tower
[7:13:28] ranger1332: @iskall85 , what is your thought about PLUNDERING the assention vault?

[7:13:40] warkr0: ascension is a good word for it still tho
[7:13:40] dia__hi: Ello ello ello
[7:13:41] MarkDatter: like you're climbing, ascending, on a tower and the higher you go the more loot and danger there is

[7:13:58] Paudot: 5 min gamba where
[7:13:59] Ramzi65ok: we gonna check the config after this one
[7:14:00] gaymersalsa: i trust u shelpobs
[7:14:02] pb_b: she meant dont die iskall lol
[7:14:03] Lich_Kirby: No, that's just the game rendering slowly tanukidanExcuseMe
[7:14:03] lazypandaman: which sun, it is minus x degrees in sweden
[7:14:03] warkr0: someone didnt let the vault load in
[7:14:04] zeus_o9o2: Also he is old Kappa LUL
[7:14:06] TgoodClay: maybe change it to “Vault Descension” so it sounds like you’re going in deeper to each one.
[7:14:07] 0laz_: climbing a mountain with infinite steps
[7:14:08] abhinav_agrawal: that sun is chunks not loading
[7:14:11] MrRedVII: true
[7:14:11] smartyone: can you make flame + cake vault and have it infinite success?
[7:14:11] Archimedes94: This is one of the thing I love about you Iskall (and conversing with other non-native speakers of English).. these quirks of the language and slight misunderstandings
[7:14:12] gaymersalsa: no i dont trust u shelobs i think he will greed
[7:14:12] zebrainap: does ascension increase ore amounts?
[7:14:12] luke_sch02: TIL up is down in swedish Kappa
[7:14:12] toasterburn809: icaruskall flying too close to the vault sun
[7:14:16] lykedemapplz: like in Valo, you got ascendant as a second highest rank, you're climbing to the top
[7:14:17] jetlius: i love false's gaslighting
[7:14:17] EscoStar69: Hallo
[7:14:21] apelsinaisupienu: Oo FUNGI
[7:14:21] EscoStar69: EscoStar69 subscribed at Tier 2. They've subscribed for 31 months! 
[7:14:21] smolkato: oh dude I’ve had like over 10 monoliths in a row running plunderers
[7:14:24] bas3j: Dont get to close to the sun lol
[7:14:24] ShelobsLair_: @gaymersalsa dang it, was gonna wing big KEKW
[7:14:29] pledgeness: what happens if the portal is broken whilst inside it?
[7:14:31] zeus_o9o2: But it's boring tbh
[7:14:31] abibernard: gamba???
[7:14:33] chankafps: ik u cant modify the ascension vaults urself, but can it roll random modifiers?
[7:14:34] gaymersalsa: @EscoStar69 hryQt
[7:14:42] EscoStar69: @gaymersalsa hiiii
[7:14:43] Merrie_Poppins: I have to go! enjoy th rest of your stream!
[7:14:46] gaymersalsa: @abibernard no im sorry to disappoint i dont have a good gamba in mind
[7:14:46] jarivd03: Just nerf the pacifists
[7:14:47] smolkato: nerf the pacifists!
[7:14:50] onceandalways: Plot twist: he’s talking about irl
[7:14:50] asimithehero: Also vaults shouldn't be too similar, different scaling is nice
[7:14:54] zeus_o9o2: And also wanting to clear vaulta quickly will have pacifist hurt
[7:14:54] Paudot: @gaymersalsa that's the fun part, the believers slowly loose hope while we gain points
[7:14:55] Caren9593: this convo must be so confusing for the others online just seeing false’s responses
[7:14:55] e_shailee: whay exactly is the pacifist build?
[7:14:56] candidcrafter: That's why objective scaling might be better
[7:14:56] toasterburn809: pacifists still get hit by mobs
[7:14:59] pb_b: hunt the guardians
[7:15:00] BigVirusBoi: crinkle :)
[7:15:02] toasterburn809: they just dont kill them
[7:15:07] SuiteSunrise: joe has a message in chat
[7:15:08] nija0dragon: or guardians
[7:15:12] gaymersalsa: have a backup plan
[7:15:12] abibernard: @gaymersalsa finished before 7 minutes? he usually wins these between 7-10
[7:15:13] ItsQuipz: or hunt the guardians
[7:15:16] ShelobsLair_: hunt the guardians, scav or elixr needing mobs = bad for pacifist ascension
[7:15:20] iljalz: @gaymersalsa will he get archive?
[7:15:22] zipernater: ask the mobs nicely
[7:15:22] abhinav_agrawal: joes message
[7:15:23] 64_Bit_Cake: Iskall Read game chat sir
[7:15:24] smolkato: negotiate with the mobs for drops lol
[7:15:24] gaymersalsa: @gaymersalsa eh the time gated one is kinda meh
[7:15:24] ramnite_tv: id guess that most pacifists are not purists like Barry and actually have a backup plan for killing mobs
[7:15:27] jenn_jennnn: I think Brry carries a sword just for killing mobs when he HAS to
[7:15:33] luke_sch02: obv have a second set of GEARGI in your backpack
[7:15:36] gimpygomer: Check game chat
[7:15:39] ihcmoonie: Just hit.80 and hooooly are the echoing tools expensive
[7:15:41] ShelobsLair_: @gaymersalsa yep he greeding,  not sure what to gamba instead
[7:15:41] Ferdster02: guardians would be insta fail for a passive build

[7:16:00] Tazzad: I really really hate the thought of two different timers :/
[7:16:01] rektarina1594: 20 is a lot
[7:16:06] Ramzi65ok: vodskall video just went live lol
[7:16:07] 64_Bit_Cake: Joe getting donowalled
[7:16:10] iljalz: ad :/
[7:16:10] ggmacy: af
[7:16:11] Khalin1212: 0:15
[7:16:11] gaymersalsa: @Ramzi65ok pag
[7:16:12] piso112: @iskall85 have u wondered to use mod things from mod that u ve unlocked to create crystal?
[7:16:12] theo03h: ad
[7:16:13] Thomlennix: Add
[7:16:17] theo03h: add
[7:16:18] theo03h: ad
[7:16:18] jenn_jennnn: ad at the absolute wrong time xD
[7:16:19] Paudot: @gaymersalsa maybe xp?
[7:16:20] jackasspen: nooooo an advert during the recap
[7:16:20] e_shailee: please instead of coloring the timer just add another small one next to it
[7:16:20] Myri_Sea: ad
[7:16:21] gaymersalsa: peepoAds
[7:16:23] Lich_Kirby: "Completion Time" is a good unique difficulty layer that isn't utilized in other places.
[7:16:27] aszejner: omg 1min ad...
[7:16:28] Urenzal: add 3 to 1 and get 4
[7:16:29] pb_b: but wont that be a cap for something that is meant to be infinitely expandable? to test your limits?
[7:16:29] smolkato: pacifists would need to make friends to ascend lol
[7:16:30] gaymersalsa: @gaymersalsa idk whats a good range for that hryLafExceptInPain
[7:16:31] Nightbot: Everything in VH 1.18 is very under development & things might change.. Just Trust the Process-- iskall & Devs
[7:16:34] Thomlennix: Recap agane
[7:16:34] thiccmilkguy: if its 20 second, in 75 stacks you would reach 0 minutes. #maths
[7:16:37] TechnoHail: new vodskall vid
[7:16:41] zeus_o9o2: And if you don't you lose 2 stack something
[7:16:44] craftydanno: what do the stacks do????
[7:16:46] gaymersalsa: peepoAds HE IS LOOKING FOR ORES
[7:16:47] MarkDatter: my main worry is how to convey that you need that much time to complete the objective compared to how long you can stay in the vault
[7:16:49] donuttdude22: could you explain how old notes work
[7:16:51] Klinten__: minus a random amount of time like 10-30 seconds
[7:16:51] RavenclawNatsfan: iskall streaming when I get to school and when I leave lol
[7:16:53] apelsinaisupienu: No gamba?
[7:16:55] cynebeald: maybe only chance to decrease + mastery to make it safer?
[7:16:58] zeus_o9o2: That's the limit then
[7:16:58] lynx235: how would fruit work in them
[7:16:58] rektarina1594: But its weird that you would wanna loot higher stacks but dont have time to do so
[7:16:59] my_only_fearghal: Check Joe's message in chat
[7:16:59] SuiteSunrise: joe found a bug?
[7:17:01] Archimedes94: @iskall85  is it easier to explain the "reducing time" thing as "You need to have 20s times stacks left on the timer when you leave" to gain a stack?
[7:17:03] Tomaeux: what happened to trashing the junk items when pickup from most recent vid
[7:17:04] nicolasthefifth: I think the timer-thing should have a bit of rng
[7:17:05] Megaking202: well the ad made me not hear anything :D
[7:17:07] Paudot: @gaymersalsa he has had like 80k, and 120k so i would do like 3 tiers maybe(?
[7:17:12] gaymersalsa: @donuttdude22 theyre hints about legendary transmog unlocks, some of them cant be unlocked yet tho
[7:17:12] jenn_jennnn: @donuttdude22 they dont do anything, they are just hints on how to get transmogs
[7:17:14] kaspertgjone: how bout having specific food for increasing ascention time? just an idea
[7:17:16] e_shailee: you can decrease it LOGARITHMICLY
[7:17:17] TgoodClay: @iskall85 the term “stack” seems like a weird terminology to describe how the dungeon becomes more plentiful
[7:17:19] abhinav_agrawal: iskall ingame chat
[7:17:20] sofie0125: no good for your 85 stack goal lol
[7:17:22] thiccmilkguy: To watch the video or the stream, that is the question
[7:17:22] kathinkajean: then you’ll never get to 85…
[7:17:23] Khalin1212: but then you could never get 85 stacks.  make it 0:15.  Then 100 stacks makes it 0:00
[7:17:23] DORITOBUCKET: When is this out?
[7:17:24] omarjet05: maybe having an ascension scav that is more dependant on killing mobs to make it more difficult
[7:17:26] e_shailee: sorry for the math bomb
[7:17:26] iOsney: @iskall85 teach etho the void + pick backpack trick that barry uses to make him deside on the hammer
[7:17:27] jessmoos2000: Just joined what is the new goal of the vault ?
[7:17:27] ShelobsLair_: never gonna get to 85
[7:17:28] bafoon__: maybe cap the timer at some points so it’s always possible
[7:17:29] Nightbot: Support the devs & the pack.  https://www.patreon.com/VaultHunters
[7:17:32] razlack1: Can the stack go to negative numbers

[7:17:38] mondgesicht98: im not that pro
[7:17:38] ShelobsLair_: no question
[7:17:39] Marknu: very
[7:17:39] SuiteSunrise: yes
[7:17:39] timmolaa: What if you ascend a level when you complete one of each objective. And the objectives appear in the same orded easy to harder objectives
[7:17:39] WteLotuS: yes
[7:17:39] abhinav_agrawal: yes
[7:17:39] nihal_prakash: yes
[7:17:39] StrangePanthers: Yes
[7:17:40] Caren9593: no level 85 flame rip
[7:17:40] SunflowerMead0w: meh
[7:17:40] piso112: Yes
[7:17:40] cynebeald: yes
[7:17:40] ramnite_tv: @TgoodClay It's a stack of flame modifier on the crystal
[7:17:41] Tazzad: I will never play it if it has two timers
[7:17:41] ShelobsLair_: it's way more fun
[7:17:41] montypythoncode: it does sound like the lp grind
[7:17:41] Juburin: yes
[7:17:41] bennieboi20: yeah I think so
[7:17:42] TechnoHail: yes
[7:17:43] iljalz: bye chat bye iskall!
[7:17:43] minipantalon: sure
[7:17:43] HarcosMalac: yes
[7:17:44] gaymersalsa: !brazier @jessmoos2000
[7:17:44] Nightbot: Light the Monoliths objective has been replaced with Light the Braziers in update 13. Braziers appear in every room and have a range of positive modifiers that get added once you click on them! After you acquire the required amount of Braziers, you can continue to Pillage additional Braziers for good loot at the cost of negative/cursed modifiers, or exit the vault to complete it.
[7:17:44] smolkato: I kinda want to try the og one
[7:17:44] Meals5671: ehhh, not really
[7:17:45] CedH1: if there is a cap it's not as fun as it was without a cap for me
[7:17:45] SilentWife: with currebt stack of reward, yes
[7:17:46] Oh_No_Its_Kat: yes
[7:17:46] jarivd03: I would be less excited
[7:17:46] Klinten__: jupp
[7:17:46] d0nghamm3r: What if you flipped the stack effect to be "negative" when you fail and you have to redeem yourself to switch it back to a postive?
[7:17:47] rytional: It'd still be fun. I wont hit 50 anyway
[7:17:48] zeus_o9o2: @iskall85 people will love to show off thier stacks when they reach high num and that'll be possible when people lose more stacks for losing than they get for winning
[7:17:49] Marknu: no
[7:17:49] mondgesicht98: is there save spots on the levels?
[7:17:50] asimithehero: Also yes
[7:17:50] ghost_kingv0: no
[7:17:51] bas3j: Yes
[7:17:51] k1_setae: yes it would
[7:17:51] nija0dragon: also challenging your friends would be fun
[7:17:52] Garnail20: yes it's more fun to get a higher ascention level that way
[7:17:53] ShelobsLair_: hmmm
[7:17:53] No_xor: yes, but the scaling must be better than lost time
[7:17:54] leo2369q: no
[7:17:54] cannedcrane: Just got back from ad, whats the idea?
[7:17:54] TheImmortaldonut: I probably won't make it above 5 anyway lol
[7:17:54] Archimedes94: It all depends on the balance to see where your equilibrium ends up
[7:17:55] StrangePanthers: Nah
[7:17:56] rektarina1594: no, high stacks cannot really loot since theres no time
[7:17:56] thiccmilkguy: absolutely but it would be too easy. Way too easy after maybe 20 stacks
[7:17:56] TacticalSurgeon: I would like to accend all the way to heaven. +100 stacks
[7:17:56] nihal_prakash: yes i guess
[7:17:57] mebiggen92: no
[7:17:57] sheeberz: sheeberz subscribed with Prime. 
[7:17:57] Gschiidli: so it becomes a skill modifier that excludes all other vault goals
[7:17:59] bennieboi20: but in the end you would have a cap
[7:18:00] montypythoncode: it sounds like a ranked gamemode
[7:18:01] ShelobsLair_: hmmMeeting i don't think it would completely replace
[7:18:02] nounou26x: yes
[7:18:02] Marknu: would replace regular vaults sure
[7:18:02] kibaz_x: it's a long term investment
[7:18:03] Tech_16: itd replace chill vaults, not architect
[7:18:03] jenn_jennnn: it wouldnt replace vaults for me
[7:18:03] hevmaster: no
[7:18:05] Nightdust56: it turns into a speed run vault
[7:18:06] berrden: it would replace running regular vaults for me
[7:18:07] micdale: if you dont make it in time 2-3 times it resets to 0
[7:18:07] toasterburn809: I like the idea of ascension being a fun challenge and not an op way to get loot
[7:18:07] jackasspen: imagine the bragging rights to having a maxed out ascension
[7:18:09] mczimo: no, if its good enough i think it will be default, if not then wouldnt use
[7:18:11] 64_Bit_Cake: It would replace running "perfect" vaults for me
[7:18:11] TheRedBrain: it's getting a speedrunning vault
[7:18:12] asimithehero: I'm very afraid it would just be the only best choice
[7:18:12] omarjet05: no the cap makes it less enticing
[7:18:14] PyderMandy: I don't run architect anyway
[7:18:16] jessmoos2000: @gaymersalsa thank yoy
[7:18:20] Nightbot: Watch iskall85’s VOD’s at https://youtube.com/@vodskall85
[7:18:24] floppypidgen: i like the idea of making difficulty scale with stacks and you loose 10% of stacks on death
[7:18:25] laxxbe: watching you I over estimate my ability a lot so die frequently so not loosing the flame in easy ,ode for example would be good for me
[7:18:33] pb_b: maybe its better if the limit for time is like 5-10 minutes and then mobs scale in health and damage?
[7:18:33] Lich_Kirby: Can you run other vaults in between Ascension runs?
[7:18:35] zeus_o9o2: I won't replace chill vaults at all cause you have the pressure of always completing which isn't good at all times
[7:18:36] craftydanno: oh
[7:18:37] when_no_username: i think that depends on how expensive the flame is
[7:18:41] thiccmilkguy: 20-50 would be too easy. After 50 time restriction would make it hard
[7:18:44] apelsinaisupienu: Hallo
[7:18:46] bennieboi20: the only thing being is you can’t call it unlimited stacking now
[7:18:49] mondgesicht98: What is in multiplayer? only one player will get the level up? sad for servers
[7:18:50] CedH1: @iskall85 (for me) the cap decrease my hype about ascension
[7:18:52] moondancerjen: moondancerjen subscribed with Prime. 
[7:18:53] kibaz_x: after many stacks it may replace some things, but running catalysts or normal vaults will always be more chill
[7:18:55] Tech_16: These Acension vaults cant have the new God Tears, so i think it wouldnt replace regular vaults either
[7:19:03] SilentWife: only for the first few vaults, then the time will bite you
[7:19:08] jenn_jennnn: what is the purpose of making a time restriction?
[7:19:12] apelsinaisupienu: Well its late for me and i have school tomorrow so bye chat and iskall
[7:19:14] gaymersalsa:  gamba up
[7:19:17] TacticalSurgeon: Maybe cap it so it doesn't drop below 15 min
[7:19:18] gaymersalsa: @apelsinaisupienu gngn

[7:19:22] Megaking202: what happens if you play it in coop and one fails?
[7:19:25] onceandalways: Can you only have one soul flame with 1+ stacks at a time? Could you have more than one ongoing, which you could maintain in different vaults?
[7:19:25] thepolkyman: 1:40
[7:19:26] cannedcrane: 1000
[7:19:26] Archimedes94: 16.666minutes
[7:19:27] Ramzi65ok: so specialized vaults should still be better than the soul flame, a catalyst rework sounds very nessessary lol
[7:19:28] ITZHI5: 1000 secs
[7:19:31] gaymersalsa: bumbleIskall MathTime
[7:19:34] StrangePanthers: I feel like it goes well with paradox. Once a day kind of thing
[7:19:35] ColeKaro: good, 'in general' but not like "Omega Catalyst Run". right?
[7:19:38] bafoon__: not any objective but it’s doable
[7:19:38] thiccmilkguy: 9 minutes remain
[7:19:38] toasterburn809: i feel like once you get to 10 minutes it should stop
[7:19:40] Marknu: about 9 min
[7:19:43] cannedcrane: 10 ish
[7:19:43] warkr0: make it a remove a percentage of remaining vault time, that way it never reaches zero
[7:19:44] Archimedes94: You love 16.66minutes so you have about 9minurs
[7:19:46] sportaflop104: i just got here and have never seen that objective tracker, what type of vault is this?
[7:19:46] ItsQuipz: 9 minutes
[7:19:50] mihea13: 9min more less
[7:19:50] Nightdust56: 8.3 mineutes remain
[7:19:51] arron_skie: You could make it like the paradox vault you can only do it every so often
[7:19:51] jarivd03: def more than 50% of them
[7:19:56] MarkDatter: @Megaking202 as long as the player who owns the soul flame completes, the streak will still be there iirc
[7:19:58] apelsinaisupienu: @gaymersalsa fank you
[7:20:07] hs_tempo: i cant complete any scav in 9 minutes
[7:20:07] CedH1: yes
[7:20:10] CedH1: no
[7:20:13] zeus_o9o2: @iskall85 you can have same as leauge feature that at lower levels you lose less stacks maybe 1  per completing after assension and after 25 it is 2 stacks per completion after given time
[7:20:14] jenn_jennnn: i definitly couldnt
[7:20:14] CedH1: not 100%
[7:20:15] thiccmilkguy: 50 was my ballpark. Lets say 20-40 then
[7:20:15] cannedcrane: Do relics boost the time for this completion or just total time?
[7:20:17] Zinoba: that elixir earlier wouldnt have been doable easily in 9 mins
[7:20:18] warkr0: thats cope
[7:20:20] lynx235: scavenger
[7:20:20] 0laz_: def not me
[7:20:21] Ramzi65ok: i've done a scav in just over 4 minutes cause i got high rarity things and got them all

[7:20:23] gaymersalsa:  remember to gamba!!! GAMBA
[7:20:24] mondgesicht98: what is for multiplayer?
[7:20:25] Waliyounas: Video released on vodskull85
[7:20:25] sleepygirl124: TombRaid
[7:20:26] tonTeufel: nobody can claim that. If you get lucky you could, but you don't always get lucky
[7:20:32] Nightdust56: I need 15 on average
[7:20:36] OneTrueSpry: even with them in every room it could take 15 minutes just to find all the braizures
[7:20:37] omarjet05: I think ascention should have separate objectives that are tailored to the style of the challenge
[7:20:42] lags611: I just got killed by an iskall33 in Fortnite and had to check here if it was you but no 😂
[7:20:43] smartyone: you will lose the fun if you know you can't go more then X levels based on the math
[7:20:44] asimithehero: But if i loose, it will just go down my one point? So i have multiple tries
[7:20:44] Eijuno: i cant even do scav in 25 minutes lmao
[7:20:46] superpig2007: can you get a cake vault in ascension?
[7:20:50] thiccmilkguy: 12 minutes sounds doable. Imagine the TONS of chests
[7:20:50] Tomaeux: everything but scav
[7:20:54] gaymersalsa: @superpig2007 dont think so
[7:20:55] itsjonathanjones: 11.5 mins
[7:20:56] Darkwytchcraft: long time since i've been able to catch a stream from you :)
[7:20:57] zeus_o9o2: But also people can co op so there are intresting strategies people can have
[7:21:02] Ramzi65ok: I think we also need to aknolage how many crystals this would take and the prices of them scaling becuase of it.
[7:21:03] Archimedes94: Even IF that was true... it all comes out in the balance of the loot scaling
[7:21:07] Paudot: mom famous my gamba idea got accepted!!
[7:21:09] MathanW: the issue is that it isnt a skill restriction. Then you create an artificial restriction on what you can do
[7:21:09] XentoR2621: based
[7:21:09] gaymersalsa: spilled hryLaf
[7:21:11] TAxels: higher the streak the harder the fall.
[7:21:12] Marcin3205: i cant do a scav in 30 min Ledditing KEKW
[7:21:15] 64_Bit_Cake: He has a point considering the amount of chests and rarity
[7:21:15] 0laz_: it gets repettitive after 3 games
[7:21:16] Nightbot: For everything Vault Hunters, check out the website! https://vaulthunters.gg/
[7:21:19] sofie0125: i feel like it still should be a risk so you dont choose to run it every vault
[7:21:19] Marknu: @asimithehero still need to complete if ou fail the short time you lsoe 1 if you fail vault you start over.
[7:21:19] saxymatt: but fortnite is a loot n shoot game
[7:21:20] faddybaddy: iskall33 Oldge
[7:21:21] MathanW: instead of making the game more difficult, you just make it more constrained
[7:21:21] gaymersalsa: 3rd person perspective feels soooo weird for a shooter
[7:21:22] TruePat: Fortnite lego is fun
[7:21:22] sundew2524: shots fired
[7:21:23] thinkjaguar: it does put a cap on it because eventually you have no time
[7:21:28] seglats: lets go
[7:21:29] grossjr20: mr Skall, as a fan and casual observer, I think the updates can be overwhelming. always trying to catch up. I still love it though
[7:21:29] thiccmilkguy: there would be so many chests at 40 that it would be easy. But we haven't see the progression
[7:21:30] Ler3ysss: based
[7:21:33] seglats: your online
[7:21:33] zeus_o9o2: Goes in 3rd person to explain LUL LUL
[7:21:35] berrden: cant see through them but around them
[7:21:36] gaymersalsa: hryLaf
[7:21:41] TacticalSurgeon: cap at 15 min. Then at that point scav is just a low rool where you can focus on looting
[7:21:41] ShelobsLair_: minecraft = wall hack KEKW
[7:21:42] mossycomet: stay focused pls, i need this gamba
[7:21:47] bas3j: Lol
[7:21:53] gimpygomer: Did you ever see Joe's message in chat?
[7:21:53] bennieboi20: I don’t know if having a cap means it’s the same thing anymore
[7:21:55] gaymersalsa: oooh
[7:21:58] WteLotuS: what if each ascension reduce the ascencion window by 1% instead of flat X seconds?
[7:22:00] onceandalways: :0
[7:22:01] Ramzi65ok: oh so there are different tiers of the modifiers?
[7:22:01] gaymersalsa: fortiiouououoeous
[7:22:02] zeus_o9o2: LOOT !!! <3
[7:22:03] thiccmilkguy: the Chest would be too much at 40 stacks though. But we havent see the progression
[7:22:06] warkr0: trinky time?
[7:22:07] 64_Bit_Cake: Four too ish us
[7:22:07] mondgesicht98: Sir beside the stacks... What are you getting in multiplayer?
[7:22:07] Marknu: loot n scoot
[7:22:09] seglats: do you post somewhere when you go online?
[7:22:10] jackasspen: 30 stacks = 15 min to complete
[7:22:11] AshThingss: what is this objective is it new for u13?
[7:22:11] gaymersalsa: kekw
[7:22:14] gaymersalsa: @AshThingss yes
[7:22:16] Nightbot: Vault Hunters Reddit for you to check out! https://www.reddit.com/r/VaultHuntersMinecraft/
[7:22:17] Crazedmonkey406: i want to see scav so bad
[7:22:17] gaymersalsa: !brazier
[7:22:17] Nightbot: Light the Monoliths objective has been replaced with Light the Braziers in update 13. Braziers appear in every room and have a range of positive modifiers that get added once you click on them! After you acquire the required amount of Braziers, you can continue to Pillage additional Braziers for good loot at the cost of negative/cursed modifiers, or exit the vault to complete it.
[7:22:18] asimithehero: @Marknu Ye, so to stay at 50 stacks i only need to complete the vault within the short time limit 50% of the time
[7:22:18] SilentWife: still, you will have to go for completion and stop looting
[7:22:19] Archimedes94: KEK False
[7:22:20] therealtolazytothink: does rarity/quant affect the pillagin?
[7:22:23] ndburger05: complete and run again
[7:22:25] ShelobsLair_: For-too-ih-tous
[7:22:25] Paudot: iskall but... the 100k experience...
[7:22:27] gaymersalsa: @therealtolazytothink dont think so
[7:22:27] zeus_o9o2: Greeder
[7:22:33] arron_skie: Like you can only play every 3 hours to increase your flame stack
[7:22:35] Lich_Kirby: IskScavMAN
[7:22:35] onceandalways: Just loot Iskall, 50% rarity is omega
[7:22:36] thiccmilkguy: I don
[7:22:40] sagittarius_greenbow: complete for xp iskall
[7:22:42] Garnail20: @ShelobsLair_ my thoughts exactly kek
[7:22:42] Attackeight: in game chat
[7:22:43] kot7k: gambas PepePoint
[7:22:45] onceandalways: GREED is GOOD
[7:22:46] jk_sajoko: How about reducing the remaining ascention time by a certain percentage
[7:22:47] gater51015: greed!!
[7:22:48] floppypidgen: 50% omega
[7:22:49] gaymersalsa: @sagittarius_greenbow shhh he doesnt know the gamba
[7:22:56] craftydanno: 15 seconds 4 = 1 minute sounds better
[7:23:01] asimithehero: I don't think the time scaling should be linear, makes the cut-off too harsh
[7:23:03] mondgesicht98: @gaymersalsa Do we know how this will work in multiplayer?
[7:23:11] nija0dragon: does pillaging give you xp??
[7:23:14] TAxels: it might not actually need any changes either and just streaking is hard
[7:23:15] Nightbot: www.youtube.com/iskall85 | www.twitter.com/iskall85 | https://youtube.com/@vodskall85
[7:23:16] Lich_Kirby: What positives do the pillaging add
[7:23:17] toasterburn809: it should be a lower time loss so you can get a very high streak
[7:23:18] Veisterios: Omega vault of doom...
[7:23:21] zifster: treasure goggles and hunter is basically (authorized) wall hacking haha
[7:23:23] ShelobsLair_: @mondgesicht98 your allies can help/boost you. Don't know what happens if an ally dies in your ascension vault yet though
[7:23:24] Marknu: @asimithehero In theory, but out of all your vaults what is your completion rate ?
[7:23:25] toasterburn809: no thats bad
[7:23:26] gaymersalsa: @mondgesicht98 i think so? i think he said if it does but im not 100% sure
[7:23:27] CedH1: tbh the really hype side of ascension for me is the fact i can grind unlimited (no cap)
[7:23:28] toasterburn809: badge
[7:23:28] thiccmilkguy: I don't know the progression but there would be so many chests at 40 stacks. It is difficult to say and would need quite alot of balance
[7:23:28] zeus_o9o2: No on hard it can more stacks losing
[7:23:30] AshThingss: @gaymersalsa  is there info on this objective on the VH website ?
[7:23:30] lorcan_oilcan: had to run for a bit has soul flame happened yet?
[7:23:31] Ramzi65ok: i don't like that
[7:23:33] 64_Bit_Cake: And on PoC no seconds?
[7:23:34] Ramzi65ok: speedruns
[7:23:34] SonicTox: 15 secs 20 secs and 25 secs on hard
[7:23:36] cannedcrane: Yes
[7:23:39] gaymersalsa: @AshThingss not yet, patch notes arent out
[7:23:39] 1vanpopta1: weekly best
[7:23:40] TheSilver_Kitsune: speedruns
[7:23:40] Ramzi65ok: champion crate speedruns
[7:23:40] PiTo_27_: speedrun
[7:23:40] Coralotl: Speedrun
[7:23:40] ItsQuipz: speedruns
[7:23:41] toasterburn809: it shouldnt be a punishment for playing on hard
[7:23:41] duuuuuuuuuug: raffle
[7:23:41] sambhavsam: Yes
[7:23:42] Unheard_Nightmare: Weekly speedrun
[7:23:42] k1_setae: to me these new features are loosing the feel of accomplishment and making finding gear too mundane.
[7:23:43] ndburger05: speedruns
[7:23:43] pb_b: wendarr/
[7:23:43] abhinav_agrawal: speedrun
[7:23:44] Jaja123happy_face: speed runs
[7:23:44] brotherj1554: Boss speedrun
[7:23:44] 64_Bit_Cake: RAFFLE!
[7:23:45] jetlius: raffles
[7:23:45] bafoon__: I think 20 seconds is better 30 is too high
[7:23:45] gils135: speedtuns
[7:23:46] jarivd03: I would think harder modes lose more stacks maybe?
[7:23:46] shubhu321mj: raffle
[7:23:47] pb_b: tenos/
[7:23:47] HitchHiker87: Speedruns
[7:23:47] antegravity: 5% of previous vault, then it will take much longer
[7:23:47] jetlius: yeah
[7:23:49] ShelobsLair_: speedruns
[7:23:52] Marknu: So people post your completion rates on your current plathrough - mine out of 650 vaults is about 78%
[7:23:53] Archimedes94: @lorcan_oilcan e's doing ascension runs now - he's on 5 or 6 stacks now I think
[7:23:53] gaymersalsa: Applecatrun
[7:23:57] Darkwytchcraft: your update didn't affect difficulty settings right?
[7:23:57] melonhunt: @mondgesicht98 it will work, but only for the person whose crystal it is
[7:23:57] 64_Bit_Cake: I loved raffles
[7:24:05] lorcan_oilcan: @Archimedes94 cool cool thank you
[7:24:06] saxymatt: What about the higher the number the more it costs to get your gear back?
[7:24:08] Lich_Kirby: A quest on the side could show you exactly how long you have left
[7:24:08] jenn_jennnn: making a time being a thing that gets affected by stacks kind makes me not want to really want to run them like i did when i first heard about the idea
[7:24:11] toasterburn809: the time loss being tied to difficulty is bad
[7:24:12] thinkjaguar: doesn’t losing time create a hard cap though
[7:24:17] Ferdster02: speedrunning on the smp
[7:24:18] Attackeight: @lich_kirby you get loot every time you pillage a brazier, but it adds a negative modifier
[7:24:21] bafoon__: no
[7:24:21] thiccmilkguy: thats broken game
[7:24:22] Ramzi65ok: that sets yourself up to to take 25 minutes
[7:24:22] Marknu: Thats brutal
[7:24:28] antegravity: No no no
[7:24:28] Archimedes94: You force people to be slow at the start
[7:24:30] gaymersalsa: greed is good hryLaf
[7:24:32] despiced: @iskall85 have you mentioned what you thought about making ascension fruits yet?
[7:24:32] Darkwytchcraft: that would be brutal, because no two vaults are alike
[7:24:35] batt3ryac1d: That sounds like a nightmare LUL
[7:24:36] 64_Bit_Cake: Then they would cheese and go as slow as possible
[7:24:37] Caren9593: I think you should lock timer where it doesn’t go below like 5 minutes or something
[7:24:42] jackasspen: yeah people would milk the time
[7:24:46] Kekemui: "show me the incentive and I'll show you the behavior"
[7:24:48] Khalin1212: Percentage of the available time, not the used time
[7:24:49] antegravity: Each vault get's 5% slower than the previous one, instead of 20 seconds etc.
[7:24:52] Paudot: @thiccmilkguy did you gamba?
[7:24:52] Marknu: boring
[7:24:54] thiccmilkguy: 30 second would make it 0 min remaining at 50 stacks. Removing 15 stacks for 1 difficulty is too much
[7:24:56] gaymersalsa: cringe DansGame
[7:24:56] maha381: FUN
[7:24:56] freshwatersipper: LOVE the new update @iskall85  especially the cake vault change - my afv type of vault
[7:24:57] SilentWife: boring
[7:24:58] lazypandaman: you love it
[7:24:58] e_shailee: maybe the opposite?
[7:24:58] k1_setae: "its fun"

[7:25:09] HarcosMalac: Fun?
[7:25:09] floppypidgen: peak
[7:25:10] rythmyr: I think they meant based off of previous vault starting time, not completion time?
[7:25:10] Yagaraschi: Expert! :D
[7:25:10] dawwsoon: is TTS on?

[7:25:23] smolkato: peek gameplay? lol
[7:25:24] empcatligula: Timegate? is that like Stargate? Cool!
[7:25:26] Attackeight: @lich_kirby np!
[7:25:27] onceandalways: Percentage of time left, not time spent I think they meant
[7:25:28] 64_Bit_Cake: Iskall has no patience
[7:25:30] when_no_username: how will this work multiplayer?
[7:25:31] zeus_o9o2: Best content watching mud blocks right in front of your face for 5 hrs ohhh DinoDance DinoDance DinoDance DinoDance
[7:25:32] mad_lantros_dane: so turtles still in 13.....
[7:25:32] gaymersalsa: venDoor
[7:25:33] P3pp3rF1y: yeah, Iskall's first question is always how do we make people afk in our game? :D
[7:25:33] sofie0125: i feel like everybody would just run it every time with one ascent/decent
[7:25:37] Zinoba: venDoor
[7:25:37] marvelprincess2000: iskHeart iskEnergy iskHeart
[7:25:37] Ferdster02: sfk is cringe

[7:25:41] gaymersalsa: yoink
[7:25:42] smolkato: there are too many trashy games out there that time gates with ads and stuff. not fun
[7:25:46] luke_sch02: venDoor
[7:25:47] steein92: Hi peepoHey Love your content. Just wanted to peek in and support :)
[7:25:48] agentdid127: what If you had a set amount of time to use the flame? when you finish the vault, the next stack continues at the time you left off
[7:25:50] damnsecci: bro
[7:25:53] damnsecci: what are u doink
[7:25:56] damnsecci: 7,5 hrs?
[7:25:57] gaymersalsa: @steein92 welcome in! hryQt

[7:26:00] ShelobsLair_: @damnsecci welcome back
[7:26:01] fossil160: As I'm farming 85 melons for Mt next crystal, I can see that.
[7:26:03] Paudot: i feel like I underestimated skalds greed
[7:26:04] itsjonathanjones: what if you sort time by objective? When toy complete a scav, your scav time goes down. when you compete an elixir, you elixir time goes down. Etc
[7:26:05] lazypandaman: i see more chaos on vodskall
[7:26:09] 64_Bit_Cake: @gaymersalsa can we have venDoor emote?
[7:26:09] Attackeight: brokeSkall
[7:26:10] batt3ryac1d: Vanilla can be quick if you minmax but then you end up with exactly the same base and stuff every time
[7:26:10] damnsecci: @gaymersalsa no mercy to the boss
[7:26:12] thiccmilkguy: farms which work on their own is not bad but manual work is too much in vanilla
[7:26:12] lazypandaman: !vodskall
[7:26:14] floppypidgen: yoo 8gs for a fundi?
[7:26:16] thinkjaguar: doesn’t removing time for each stack create a hard cap on how high it can go
[7:26:17] snaptin5643: im still confused why loosing the progress is a bad thing. you get better with time. just leave it and see how it works
[7:26:20] gaymersalsa: secci. its been 2 hours of ascendioning.
[7:26:20] thiccmilkguy: !uptime
[7:26:20] Nightbot: Stream uptime: 7 hours 26 minutes 26 seconds
[7:26:24] Myri_Sea: what was the bounty?
[7:26:27] damnsecci: are we addicted to the new objective?
[7:26:28] gaymersalsa: @64_Bit_Cake we do, i made it earlier :)
[7:26:28] Attackeight: !vods
[7:26:28] Nightbot: Watch iskall85’s VOD’s at https://youtube.com/@vodskall85
[7:26:33] ggmacy: when will you finish base?
[7:26:35] gaymersalsa: @myri_sea assassin mobs
[7:26:37] kolacna2: I would do somethink like get more stacks if you make it in smaller time, like you could get 5 stacks in one vault if you complete it really fast, but than scale difficulty with damage or smth else
[7:26:40] ShelobsLair_: @damnsecci i went and subbed to vodskall for you're Plack
[7:26:46] saxymatt: what about it just cycles through each vault type?
[7:26:46] 64_Bit_Cake: @gaymersalsa oh LUL I'm on mobile so I can't see
[7:26:46] damnsecci: @ShelobsLair_ tytytytyty
[7:26:46] Hamston85: hi iskall how about you guys put a family member in every vendoor
[7:26:48] zeus_o9o2: Easier*
[7:26:50] Ramzi65ok: first 10 are allways scav iskTroll
[7:26:52] gaymersalsa: @64_Bit_Cake hryLaf
[7:26:59] ggmacy: when will you finish Pacific??!!
[7:27:00] thiccmilkguy: I still think 13 minutes would be doable with alot of chests at 30 stacks
[7:27:08] seglats: are you getting off 10 aclock or are you staying on longer?
[7:27:10] batt3ryac1d: Yeah it should probably crank the difficulty up with the extra loot
[7:27:14] zeus_o9o2: Don't worry iskall I'll bet against you in gamba I always lose Kappa DinoDance
[7:27:15] onceandalways: Is it time to scale scav loot :D
[7:27:19] gaymersalsa: @ggmacy tahts not the goal of this series since it has a deadline in almost 20 days
[7:27:20] sygerious: 8 hour stream!!!?
[7:27:26] luke_sch02: are you inclined to pillage braziers?
[7:27:27] batt3ryac1d: or eventually you won't be able to walk for all the chests LUL
[7:27:27] damnsecci: how much work do i have lmao @gaymersalsa freaking 7,5 hrs
[7:27:27] jdubbs211: you need to run a scab for the science before adjusting
[7:27:32] oDtEoDoA: instead of ascension timer objectives get more difficult
[7:27:37] gaymersalsa: @damnsecci ....dms
[7:27:43] cannedcrane: The more chests could help balance the lower time you need to ascend more
[7:27:45] damnsecci: @gaymersalsa rip me
[7:27:49] ggmacy: when will u finish Pacific?!
[7:27:50] bloodcollector_: how much do you have to pillage to complete?
[7:27:51] lenjenben: Iskall please can you give us some history for the names of some of the things in VH, like the gods?
[7:27:53] Wiroe_: Every 5 stacks increase mob health/strength is a “simple” solution
[7:27:56] thiccmilkguy: what about death would decrease 50% and add permanent curse part?
[7:27:56] piso112: I think loot for pillaging is a bit too bad
[7:27:59] itsjonathanjones: can you sort time by objective? You have a different time based on how many of that objective you have beat?
[7:28:03] ali78899: @iskall85 it could scale the difficulty of the vault the higher the ascension, aka more scav items needed or braizers to be lit etc.
[7:28:07] Zinoba: hi secci hryAdmire
[7:28:08] Angelshine: no
[7:28:09] kelsers82: never
[7:28:09] sagittarius_greenbow: noo
[7:28:09] zeus_o9o2: I feel @iskall85 the leauge rank system can be replicated here which will make higher number stack even better

[7:28:15] jdubbs211: nope
[7:28:15] ShelobsLair_: @damnsecci do you have a watchspeed extension? I use it sometimes to watch long vods at 3-4x speed
[7:28:15] WteLotuS: tired of vault hunters? you kidding?
[7:28:16] NotMeNever: nope!
[7:28:18] muttpacket: I can stay all night!

[7:28:26] thiccmilkguy: its 2am. I can alive till 4am
[7:28:27] skierbrenn: I just want to be done work so I can go home and play VH
[7:28:27] tangerinedoro: can't believe you're still streming
[7:28:29] Attackeight: !vods Help Damnsecci get a YouTube plack!
[7:28:29] Nightbot: Watch iskall85’s VOD’s at https://youtube.com/@vodskall85
[7:28:31] 64_Bit_Cake: @wiroe_ it's the easy solution but definitely not the best
[7:28:32] atenbobi: NODDERS just stop being tired doofus
[7:28:32] kawaii_grape_: Never tired of VH
[7:28:34] luke_sch02: @gaymersalsa go slep then :)
[7:28:34] sagittarius_greenbow: its not like i should be studying for exams
[7:28:36] smolkato: it’s 4am I may have to sleep lol
[7:28:37] littlepepperbutt: But I'm sick I'm so tired but I must watch
[7:28:37] rkdavis03: ha-I have been watching for 6 hours
[7:28:38] zdralek11: if there is decrease in time for the completion i believe it would be good to cap the decreasing like you will always have at least 5 mins so the ascension is not caped
[7:28:39] piso112: Should the loot from pillaging be more like 6x loot sand?
[7:28:40] maha381: just dont be tired it so simple
[7:28:41] melonhunt: missed the long streams tbh
[7:28:42] onceandalways: Well I’m SORRY good sir, I can’t just switch off my chronic fatigue NotLikeThis
[7:28:43] HarcosMalac: 4Head just stop being tired
[7:28:43] tangerinedoro: isSCAVman
[7:28:45] gaymersalsa: @luke_sch02 no i need to pay out gamba!
[7:28:46] TheLilMay: I've been watching the stream all day at work because there is nothing to do today. Getting paid to watch lol
[7:28:46] Kildain82: I'm WFH, no sleeping here :)
[7:28:49] seglats: what swedish football team are you a fan of?
[7:28:49] StanleyMcC: its great, i have had you on all day while i have been at work. :)
[7:28:53] zeus_o9o2: Se can come back
[7:28:54] luke_sch02: @gaymersalsa panege
[7:28:56] bom222243: its still 1 in 4.
[7:28:57] batt3ryac1d: We can sleep when the game is balanced GIGACHAD
[7:28:59] Caren9593: I don’t think the assention timer should go to 0. it should stop at a certain point where it’s hard but not impossible to continue. like 2 min or something
[7:29:00] Ramzi65ok: altars would also be impossible when trying to assend with the time mechanic
[7:29:09] floppypidgen: eepy rn. Dare I say deepy too
[7:29:09] toasterburn809: thats good
[7:29:12] sagittarius_greenbow: its art
[7:29:13] zeus_o9o2: It's ascending downwards
[7:29:13] thepolkyman: definitely wont get mistaken for up
[7:29:14] ProfessionalsOnly: The Smack your head into it while flying pillar
[7:29:14] lazypandaman: his descending pillar
[7:29:21] Paudot: damn +150k experience is a given now i think
[7:29:22] onceandalways: @floppypidgen You wouldn’t dare
[7:29:23] sofie0125: I fear that the overall objective will be really easy so the only punnishment would be loosing one stack if you dont make the ascend time
[7:29:29] grossjr20: hit the valara first! might be mob kills
[7:29:30] thiccmilkguy: i will sleep at 4am and do 0 social interaction tomorrow all for VH damn
[7:29:35] baani07: @lazypandaman lmao
[7:29:35] ggmacy: are you going to finish your base?
[7:29:35] heyguy27: Hey @iskall85  YT frog here  Just want to say ty for good videos and happy times
[7:29:35] RachelElizabeth92: Definitely NOT going to slam into that on the way home KEKW
[7:29:36] zeus_o9o2: Coins <3
[7:29:37] Attackeight: it’s just big enough to hit your head into when flying
[7:29:37] toasterburn809: I think you are going to have to really tryhard and most people wont get high streaks anyways
[7:29:44] antegravity: Think someone asked already but does pillaging increase exp?
[7:29:49] YoungGecko123: bro guys i went to bed and woke up chillin in bed and i open up twitch and this man is still going its the next f ucking day this man is insane
[7:29:55] 64_Bit_Cake: Wait what did we decide?

[7:30:07] gaymersalsa: @heyguy27 hryAdmire welcome to the twitch side!
[7:30:08] MarkDatter: @YoungGecko123 timezones are wild
[7:30:10] floppypidgen: @onceandalways 😼
[7:30:11] damnsecci: wuss
[7:30:16] Attackeight: @antegravity I wouldn’t think so
[7:30:17] smolkato: but the trinkies
[7:30:18] eCosit3: Wait, what are those doors?
[7:30:19] gaymersalsa: @damnsecci HAHAHA
[7:30:19] damnsecci: not doing a challenging dungeon
[7:30:20] damnsecci: pft
[7:30:21] thiccmilkguy: death in ascension will lower by half and put permanent negative curse. Is that still on the table?
[7:30:22] Julio_Brz: !shaders
[7:30:22] TechnoHail: imma grab something to eat then rejoin
[7:30:22] lazypandaman: guilded chest are out of stock sir

[7:30:24] KalunRS: the cascading of chests doesn’t seem that much tbh
[7:30:26] CaddyWhumpusGamer: What about making stacks be fractions and the faster you complete the vault the closer to a whole stack you get on the soul flame? if it takes you a long time to complete you may only get .10 of a stack.
[7:30:26] ggmacy: Pacific??!!
[7:30:27] MarkDatter: its living
[7:30:28] Pitakos: grown man cant handle some spiders Kappa

[7:30:42] thiccmilkguy: no vodsakll tomorrow then?
[7:30:43] CheekyGirl43: SECCI!
[7:30:44] tomatoasted: would there be something like god vaults or god rooms + minions/worshipers for each god? with them having god damage, which would add resitances for each god maybe linked to favors/influence/reputation???

[7:38:33] mossycomet: Apologies for the confusion! Kiwi, lemon, and orange already create a citrusy and tangy combination. To complement these flavors, you might consider adding fruits that either enhance the tanginess or balance it with sweetness. Here are some fruits that can pair well:  Berries: berries can add a touch of sweetness that complements the tanginess of the citrus fruits.  Pineapple: Its tropical sweetness can complement the tartness of the citrus fruits quite well

[7:51:11] Knew_It_Owl: Get gud is the solution of a skill issue tho
[7:51:12] CrunchyZedman: skill issue and git gud is the exact same thing
[7:51:13] sofie0125: also depends on your build
[7:51:15] vhblast: get iskall.json
[7:51:16] gaymersalsa: HEREWEGO
[7:51:20] falsesymmetry: Tbh. The X leveled elixr we did with 4 of us yesterday was impossible. Wasn't going up at all falseLurk
[7:51:21] zeus_o9o2: allso different playstyle
[7:51:21] Zaraca90: Aboth the same as etho
[7:51:24] Paudot: @gaymersalsa i don't think you actually are
[7:51:25] gaymersalsa: based
[7:51:29] gaymersalsa: @gaymersalsa frick
[7:51:36] ddSqueeze: he’s heckin gaming
[7:51:37] ferda127: didn’t you get a junk identifier?
[7:51:37] Matkimble: definitly a skill issue in the least negative way.  Someone like Joe just needs to learn how to get faster
[7:51:44] SuiteSunrise: not the same.
[7:51:46] Attackeight: 1
[7:51:49] lazypandaman: he learns how to prank, our little boy has grown a lot
[7:51:50] zifster: If you want to be good at something, first you've got to be bad
[7:51:50] DigitalDrug: etho is a god gamer
[7:51:51] 64_Bit_Cake: Honestly Joe would be great with some boosting
[7:51:54] Nukeri: Joe is an artist, and trolling? Thats an art
[7:51:56] Zaraca90: But etho is washed up
[7:51:56] Paudot: @gaymersalsa my own gamba idea made me poorer, im just sad at this point lol
[7:51:56] SuiteSunrise: etho has WAY more play time
[7:51:56] Wiroe_: Etho is a strategy genius
[7:51:57] batt3ryac1d: Etho is A GAMER though
[7:51:57] HoboWith2Shotguns: Etho also loves a grind right?
[7:51:58] SnipyPlays: Etho won decked out. He is the exception
[7:51:59] EVO_Gaming6000: With great power comes great responsibility (void liquid)
[7:52:04] KalunRS: some people just have inherently better mechanics
[7:52:09] gaymersalsa: @gaymersalsa LMAOO it really is like that sometimes ekjghekj hryLaf
[7:52:10] dia__hi: 3 treasure chest SeemsGood
[7:52:11] Dameojin: How much favor are you going for?
[7:52:12] Momo_819: You did get a favor...
[7:52:14] zifster: Etho loves roguelike games and challenges
[7:52:16] terribrill: what would be terribl, was if skill didn't matter at all
[7:52:25] Luthien907: Having played VH myself, I totally get if you're not used to modded it's a steep learning curve, but like, you get better with time and it feels rewarding once you get it.
[7:52:26] damnsecci: etho fangirls unite
[7:52:27] iballen93: god altars are mostly hard
[7:52:30] gaymersalsa: ethoMAN
[7:52:32] falsesymmetry: There are some difficult ones tbh
[7:52:34] zeus_o9o2: dungeons too
[7:52:39] gaymersalsa: SECCI u see the new emotes
[7:52:39] Archimedes94: @iskall85 is he still in Hard mode where he had to go back to the Altar to complete them? LUL
[7:52:44] unknownrek: oh yeah. those champion ones are NOT free
[7:52:44] Marknu: You use hunter etho does not iskall that makes alot of difference for god challenges
[7:52:45] kelsers82: sir you did get a favour in chat? im confusd
[7:52:46] batt3ryac1d: I think he just greeds too much LUL
[7:52:47] CyberGeiger: Because you are a pro, Iskall, even if you don't believe it
[7:52:48] falsesymmetry: 45 dwellers is too much for some vaults.
[7:52:49] CheekyGirl43: the quantity of specific chests at high level can be challenging
[7:52:50] gaymersalsa: NOTED #DontTrustIskall
[7:52:51] Pitakos: that was before having to go back to the altar though right ? what etho said
[7:52:53] Wiroe_: he struggled with purple mob essence in his video
[7:52:53] spurlucke: VH is pretty much made for Etho haha
[7:52:56] therealtolazytothink: He doesn't have hunter yet right?
[7:52:56] Ferdster02: Remember chat, 2 months into season 1 of the VH SMP everyone on the server was absolutely broken after running 2 vaults, now even new players like Joe and Impulse are running vaults constantly
[7:52:57] dia__hi: Coins omeja
[7:52:58] asimithehero: You can get so unlucky on them i feel
[7:53:04] Oh_No_Its_Kat: I also have trouble with altars, currently level 52
[7:53:04] gaymersalsa: @therealtolazytothink dont think so no
[7:53:10] da1dman: to be fair, he is 10 levels higher than you
[7:53:12] iballen93: im lv 71 with 1 reputation point :O
[7:53:19] Paudot: @gaymersalsa this is why i'll never go to a casino, or it has shown me i shouldn't go. Every time i lose i think "next time i'll win those points back" (toxiccc)
[7:53:35] ramnite_tv: @Ferdster02 Yeah it's a very different game at this point, heh
[7:53:35] Crazedmonkey406: 11
[7:53:41] thiccmilkguy: but you would have significantly more chests as well
[7:53:44] notorangepatchee: Are there still treasure rooms like ones you need keys for
[7:53:47] andyketogymi: Wooooo! 8 hour stream! :D
[7:53:49] andyketogymi: yayVaultHunters
[7:53:49] Archimedes94: 2min 20s
[7:53:50] Marknu: 2min 20sec
[7:53:50] kot7k: i understand the idea but i dont really like the time solution
[7:53:50] batt3ryac1d: @iskall85 honestly the only one that's hard is the unique ores one that can be rough if you don't have plentiful cause it can take 3 or 4 ore rooms at high levels
[7:53:53] Zarey_z: At 70 the altars are good but dwellers are too tricky when you have good trap disarm
[7:53:59] jackasspen: 22 min
[7:54:01] unknownrek: 2min20s
[7:54:09] Lich_Kirby: How many stacks is a "good amount" though?
[7:54:11] sofie0125: if you view god-challenges as autocomplete its easy to fail it because your not paying attention to it
[7:54:26] gaymersalsa: @andyketogymi JAEGEEEEER
[7:54:27] tonTeufel: it should be 10 seconds, looks so much cleaner than 20 seconds
[7:54:32] Hyweed_: 11min left
[7:54:33] notorangepatchee: @iskall85 are there still treasure rooms you need keys to enter
[7:54:36] Marknu: @Zarey_z just don't use a tool with disarm for abit ;)
[7:54:38] andyketogymi: @gaymersalsa Still modding after 8 hours? :D
[7:54:43] 64_Bit_Cake: I mean look at bar and time...
[7:54:45] tangerinedoro: sir sir, speaking of god altars, why don't we go for another one,
[7:54:48] onceandalways: 20 for hard, 15 medium and 10 easy?
[7:54:49] hs_tempo: can you kiwi for more time on ascension?
[7:54:50] randommisao: And no fruits right?
[7:54:50] gaymersalsa: @andyketogymi girl my brain stopped working 2 hours ago
[7:54:53] AllieRise: what are these stacks? what do they do?
[7:55:04] TheCykel: what is the concept is talking about
[7:55:06] seglats: does it exist a max pennality/drawback for the 20 seconds
[7:55:09] Hyweed_: exp tho, this will be like a 130k+ EXP
[7:55:09] Juburin: @tangerinedoro lol
[7:55:10] andyketogymi: @andyketogymi hryBleb What is a brain? @gaymersalsa
[7:55:14] alexandrospent: Elixir*
[7:55:15] terribrill: #NotAScav
[7:55:17] seglats: or do you plan the 20 seconds?
[7:55:17] gaymersalsa: !release @AllieRise watch the video for a brief explanation!
[7:55:17] Nightbot: Vault Hunters update 13 is live on the Hermitcraft Vault Hunters server for testing! Public release will likely be out on Sunday the 14th. Check out iskall's video on the changes: https://youtu.be/CrAUh0SOGY0?si=Qw4iZq7S3-Kis9sv
[7:55:17] snaptin5643: not a scav
[7:55:20] Nightbot: Everything in VH 1.18 is very under development & things might change.. Just Trust the Process-- iskall & Devs
[7:55:22] Archimedes94: SCAV?
[7:55:24] Marknu: My only gripe with god altars was having to return and getting less time on impossible and fragged difficulty i mean i had 90 ornate chests in <6min on fragged diff... impossible
[7:55:26] kathinkajean: scav? lol
[7:55:27] thiccmilkguy: @onceandalways 20 to 10 would remove about 10 stacks so I don't think it should be like that
[7:55:37] gaymersalsa: @Marknu felt
[7:55:39] tangerinedoro: let the man live he's been here for 8 hours
[7:55:41] KalunRS: Tbh, if the xp was slightly nerfed, the current state is fine
[7:55:43] laxxbe: I also like that with the cascading chests objectives also become easier, so there's a bonus to a high ascenction
[7:55:43] Mr_GlubBlub: what are the new vault fruits?
[7:55:57] Archimedes94: @seglats currently the 20s thing doesn't exist it's an idea come up during the stream
[7:55:58] toasterburn809: trust the process
[7:56:00] ranger1332: Hear me out chat...plunder essention? So you don't overlevel if you don't want
[7:56:02] seglats: like i mean does it exist a max time drawback
[7:56:03] gaymersalsa: Chatting MAKE VILLAGE ROOM SPAWNERS FIZZLE
[7:56:08] Dameojin: Will the time loss cap? Or decrease time every 3 ascension?
[7:56:08] Lich_Kirby: What if you could "cash in"? Spend stacks for something?
[7:56:08] thiccmilkguy: I can do mafs and 20 seconds sounds fair enough. People would generally be around 30-40 stacks if its 20 sec

[7:56:24] asimithehero: See, that was your first mistake. Chat is always wrong
[7:56:25] zeus_o9o2: im gonna comment on vodskall my idea
[7:56:25] Dameojin: Do you want it to be auto loss at 20 stacks?
[7:56:28] sofie0125: maybe you add the benefit of ascending and having many stacks to the crate rather than inside the vault that way objective will still be challenging with the timelimit but scavs and elixir runs wouldnt be nerfed
[7:56:31] ferda127: you can never reach 85 tho since it’s 28 mins
[7:56:31] Kadeshi_: I do worry that removing time just creates an effective hard carp on how high you can go, whether thats a good thing im unsure
[7:56:32] damnsecci: don't miss a vid on vodskall so u can comment on the vid
[7:56:33] Ryvenarie: Ryvenarie subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 47 months, currently on a 47 month streak!

[7:56:35] krahnsters: Would hourglass trinket affect ascention time?
[7:56:36] Attackeight: Get Secci a plack!
[7:56:38] seglats: i just meant like in the end say you will have 3 minutes to complete the vault?

[7:56:44] gaymersalsa: SO TRUE
[7:56:47] Knew_It_Owl: That text is bliss
[7:56:47] lorcan_oilcan: would you then impliment a minimum time? like if somone reaches X number of stacks would it stop reducing the time until someone fails
[7:56:49] Caseopei1: When is our salary coming in LUL
[7:56:53] libraven: I don't know if it was already suggested. But maybe buffing the mobs with increasing stack. Maybe with negative modifiers or adding 1 level to the mobs
[7:56:54] RandomTheWolf: What's with the 20 sec?
[7:56:55] damnsecci: bless peppah

[8:32:38] ylme2001: It's great like that
[8:32:39] 64_Bit_Cake: @poke13x no, bedrock sadly doesn't allow external modding
[8:32:40] brotherj1554: Good with 20s
[8:32:40] seglats: so say 20 for the first then 10
[8:32:42] mahik750: I dont think I ever completed 8 vaults in a row thought, so idk
[8:32:43] AnirakZed: either slightly slower or a cap
[8:32:44] gaymersalsa: @Logicholly hryQt
[8:32:45] lenjenben: maybe no penalty the first X stacks
[8:32:45] xHarjot: xp should be slower
[8:32:47] kay_taureau_17: i think with the 20 seconds per stack it will be good
[8:32:50] abyssaldancetransmission: maybe like 15
[8:32:51] Monatae: @Poke13x no, Bedrock is a completely different game.  they use the same textures, but under the hood they're totally different sadly.
[8:32:51] Lich_Kirby: What if it was 15s? I think 10 stacks is a good solid average
[8:32:51] lazypandaman: we should see how many chest around 50 stacks
[8:32:52] gaymersalsa: @lenjenben agreer
[8:32:53] kibaz_x: make it 17 seconds just to upset people
[8:33:01] j4dice: doesnt seem busted good at t his rate and most people are not going to breeze through to this level without bailing imo
[8:33:03] KalunRS: 20s per stack until like 20min
[8:33:04] Thomlennix: Harder faster scooter
[8:33:04] Wat3rMelown: what would the lowest time it wouldgo be?
[8:33:06] zebrainap: nothing wrong with something being good
[8:33:11] Trall543: maybe base the amount of time on difficulty setting?
[8:33:13] vladszpilownik: Iskall, time!
[8:33:14] lenjenben: 20s at hard or normal?
[8:33:16] Ferdster02: 20 seconds would also be easy to remember and count out, maybe 15
[8:33:19] gaymersalsa: remember shield is broken
[8:33:24] fishtank2009: will xp gain ever been prohibitive for running ascension?
[8:33:27] SuiteSunrise: that's why i think this is a good pace
[8:33:29] SunflowerMead0w: i think it should stay as it is tbh
[8:33:29] tygo720: I think that it shouldn’t go past 20 minutes of time removed
[8:33:30] saxonkil: iskallman long day of streaming
[8:33:31] seglats: i think maybe 10 first will be 10 for 20 seconds then then it will add 10 seconds
[8:33:31] Marknu: 200 sec
[8:33:33] mahik750: 3min 20sec
[8:33:34] luke_sch02: 3min20
[8:33:35] thiccmilkguy: I think after when people cant win within time frame, it will be a busted vault with no penalty (unless they dont complete the objective).
[8:33:37] zeus_o9o2: do this affect treasure and dungons ?
[8:33:40] abyssaldancetransmission: well are you intending for being to be able to get up to like 50 stacks??
[8:33:42] saxonkil: I did not expect to see you still here
[8:33:43] antegravity: 15 secs, that's 1/4 minute each time
[8:33:47] gummibaad: gummibaad subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 14 months, currently on a 14 month streak! wuhuuu
[8:33:48] BlazeSpaceRl: oh
[8:33:49] Marknu: 3min 20 sec, 1 min per 3 stacks
[8:33:50] kay_taureau_17: repair shield?
[8:33:53] Poke13x: Is there at least, some type of controller usage for Vault Hunters? I know on Java you can use a controller
[8:33:54] gaymersalsa: good point
[8:33:57] mahik750: Timecheck
[8:33:58] Lich_Kirby: 30s mark
[8:33:58] BlazeSpaceRl: you get less time per stack?
[8:33:59] the_real_edrick_the_great: Is their a vault hunter wiki?
[8:34:03] zeus_o9o2: time
[8:34:05] kibaz_x: relics are changing is the new cake vaults are changing
[8:34:07] seglats: i think maybe the 10 first will remove 20 seconds then it will remove 10 seconds from then on
[8:34:09] Marknu: Time skall
[8:34:11] gaymersalsa: iskKiwi
[8:34:20] Attackeight: @Poke13x No, the_vault (the core mod) is still WAY too complicated for the bedrock 'modding' system. VH4 Vanilla will just allow you to play VH on a much worse computer

[8:35:11] veronicorn: wow that xp be insane
[8:35:12] Krazy_E: dat XP
[8:35:13] kibaz_x: Maybe the exp needs a little bit of scaling
[8:35:14] jgrv: that’s crazy
[8:35:15] Dameojin: Ascension is the way to get exp
[8:35:15] gaymersalsa: @saxonkil patch note? not yet

[8:35:18] unagi18: rather than adding more chests, you can make it more item rarity and  item quantity and for ores, you can copious
[8:35:19] Nightbot: Everything in VH 1.18 is very under development & things might change.. Just Trust the Process-- iskall & Devs
[8:35:20] noninja5: lv80 pog
[8:35:21] Marknu: blitz lvl 100 before etho notices
[8:35:23] Alger_Waterlow: Hello
[8:35:26] sagittarius_greenbow: imagine this with x3 xp
[8:35:26] 64_Bit_Cake: @poke13x same with lot of feature like the map
[8:35:27] TAxels: 2 levels?
[8:35:30] peppa_j: that thing looks very similar to trinket
[8:35:30] saxonkil: @gaymersalsa yeah thats what i meant thanks
[8:35:31] avian946: oh that’s good, I didn’t see you get any though. could be rng though
[8:35:33] gaymersalsa: ketchup to etho hehe

[8:35:45] kattykutie: The xp scaling  is too high
[8:35:46] Ferdster02: The exp gain seems pretty extreme
[8:35:52] KalunRS: so cake for loot, soul flame for xp
[8:35:54] Attackeight: he was 79 guys
[8:35:55] sabrina1202r: the xp is a bit much
[8:35:56] 64_Bit_Cake: Nearly as good as etho
[8:35:57] Ferdster02: 4 stacks gave 2.4x exp, that seems a bit much
[8:35:57] saxonkil: im at work rn so i cant hear or watch the vid lol
[8:35:58] toasterburn809: 2 skill boints
[8:36:00] Zinoba: run more xp boost and then nerf when youve caught up to etho hehe
[8:36:01] Crazedmonkey406: I think late game this much xp is good
[8:36:02] mygenfordt: and you got that helmet
[8:36:04] lazypandaman: you will get up with etho
[8:36:05] alexandrospent: @iskall85 Yeah but then 85 in ascension would be imposible, since it would've been -28 minutes
[8:36:06] mahik750: Imagine the xp at ascension stacks 50
[8:36:06] zeus_o9o2: @64_Bit_Cake LUL LUL
[8:36:07] andyketogymi: @Ferdster02 They're on fast mode, with Iskall burgering I think.
[8:36:09] Sage898: How many artifacts are left now?
[8:36:10] pb_b: barter expertise?
[8:36:13] Sicknez_: can you ascension with friends
[8:36:15] Sicknez_: ?
[8:36:15] Lich_Kirby: 3 words: Soulflame trader maybe?
[8:36:16] Nightbot: Support the devs & the pack.  https://www.patreon.com/VaultHunters
[8:36:18] thiccmilkguy: IF we assume someone can complete within 15 minutes, they can play until 60 stacks if you make it 15 seconds. Assuming 60 to be max, adjust it and balance it
[8:36:20] Ice1Berrgg: Holy Moley 9 hours is coming up dude this is crazy
[8:36:20] Crazedmonkey406: one more please sir
[8:36:21] Poke13x: Would't it make since for it to be higher XP? The higher the streak, the more XP you gain
[8:36:25] Attackeight: yea I think the xp could use tuning down
[8:36:26] Kieonas: what do u do with the thing fro mgoing back to god altar?
[8:36:29] k1_setae: the XP is too high sir
[8:36:30] SuiteSunrise: not with time leak
[8:36:34] ggmacy: 10
[8:36:34] d4ppi: Is stacked accension shop possible?
[8:36:35] aniketop123: What does token do can anyone tell?
[8:36:37] jogardar: new shield?
[8:36:38] actualmooncore: stacks of what?
[8:36:41] zeus_o9o2: thats 5 words
[8:36:43] ggmacy: do 10
[8:36:44] k1_setae: with burger half a million from a single vault
[8:36:44] TheMickeyest: You should make the flame on the skull bigger the higher ascension level you get to
[8:36:46] j4dice: i imagine you'd cash in your soul flame for a good item and choose to give it up
[8:36:49] peppa_j: i miss season 2 traders
[8:36:52] oDtEoDoA: turn stacks into a currency
[8:36:55] Lich_Kirby: Something that lets you trade stacks off the soulflame for loot?
[8:36:58] TAxels: @TheMickeyest xD that sounds great
[8:36:58] 64_Bit_Cake: @poke13x it does indirectly increase xp because more chest and loot = more xp
[8:37:01] antegravity: bumbo
[8:37:05] CedH1: you cant stop at 9 it has to be 10
[8:37:06] ggmacy: get 10
[8:37:07] Kadeshi_: sell flames with 10 stacks for big profit?
[8:37:07] kibaz_x: what if we could sacrifice the stacks for something?
[8:37:10] EVO_Gaming6000: This is a 8 hr stream
[8:37:12] KalunRS: you have cores in backpack
[8:37:12] thiccmilkguy: if you reduce to 15s and assume people can complete in 15 minutes, then the max would be 60 stacks. Balance making 60 the highest point
[8:37:13] zeus_o9o2: poorskall
[8:37:15] Nightbot: Watch iskall85’s VOD’s at https://youtube.com/@vodskall85
[8:37:16] Ferdster02: @andyketogymi I meant the amount of modifier on the flames, cause getting 300k exp on a not even 300 chest run is a lot
[8:37:18] tkap_21: what about a big craft that super charges ascension to start at 5 levels or something
[8:37:21] Crazedmonkey406: true
[8:37:22] Attackeight: tru
[8:37:23] zeus_o9o2: yes
[8:37:23] Marknu: you need one core
[8:37:23] damnsecci: ohno
[8:37:23] nihal_prakash: ya 10
[8:37:24] damnsecci: lol
[8:37:25] 64_Bit_Cake: 1 more vault to make it 9 hours?
[8:37:28] andyketogymi: @andyketogymi Ah, ok, my bad!
[8:37:29] HarcosMalac: lol
[8:37:29] SuiteSunrise: people aren't gonna keep 50 stacks with the time
[8:37:30] aszejner: lol
[8:37:30] jogardar: you cant stop at 10, you have to make it to 11
[8:37:31] avian946: has to be 85…

[8:37:46] mahik750: My biggest problem with VH is that I always get the urge to eat kiwis in real life too.
[8:37:50] Attackeight: !release see why he got a free crystal
[8:37:50] Nightbot: Vault Hunters update 13 is live on the Hermitcraft Vault Hunters server for testing! Public release will likely be out on Sunday the 14th. Check out iskall's video on the changes: https://youtu.be/CrAUh0SOGY0?si=Qw4iZq7S3-Kis9sv
[8:37:55] luke_sch02: spend 50 gold to get lucky hit like etho ofc
[8:37:57] Poke13x: That would be cool, once you hit steak 10, 25, 50, 75 and 100. You gain new armor styles, and some type of feature to show off your highest streak count
[8:37:57] Monatae: ooh, lucky hit wand
[8:37:58] zeus_o9o2: @iskall85 hunter
[8:38:03] Lich_Kirby: @iskall85 Followup: A Soulflame trader that you spend stacks of Ascension at for top tier loots
[8:38:04] zifster: I wonder if not having dungeons be effected would mean they would be avoided in most cases.  Risk too high for reward at higher counts.
[8:38:05] tygo720: why does it need to remove time because as you said it will get a lot harder the more stacks you have so why take time away from looting when you can just make the vault mobs harder?
[8:38:11] seglats: an idea would be maybe the 10 first will remove 20 seconds then it will remove 10 seconds from then on, thoight it wil make the coding slightly harder

[8:43:09] BlazeSpaceRl: hmmmm
[8:43:11] 64_Bit_Cake: Yeah you would have lost a stack last time :p
[8:43:12] Monatae: was that three magmatic piglins in one spawn?

[8:43:18] zeus_o9o2: maths
[8:43:19] thiccmilkguy: if people complete in 15 minutes, max would be 40 stacks
[8:43:19] tygo720: why no vendoor for soul shards.
[8:43:22] BlazeSpaceRl: people say paint room left of portal
[8:43:26] pb_b: then wouldnt it be better to run cakes?
[8:43:28] candidcrafter: Gamba ?
[8:43:38] lukyp13: almost 9 hour stream is crazy
[8:43:42] CedH1: thats giga meh the cap
[8:43:43] BlazeSpaceRl: @iskall85 check left of the portal sir
[8:43:43] SuiteSunrise: cap is necessary tho isn't it?
[8:43:46] pb_b: thats what i was saying
[8:43:50] toasterburn809: make it stop at about 10 minutes?
[8:43:51] andyketogymi: Super satisfying coil pile there gtwsJellieLove
[8:43:54] sagittarius_greenbow: cap the time
[8:43:56] zeus_o9o2: its boring
[8:43:57] kathinkajean: yeah, don’t change it. let it be, no cap.
[8:43:57] Monatae: that is true
[8:43:57] scuria94: Could you implement a max?
[8:43:58] luke_sch02: good night, i gotta go schlep
[8:44:00] j4dice: what was your goal when you created this
[8:44:00] HamswordJr: I left for an hour and you’re still live?!? I’m guessing you’re trying to catch up to Etho
[8:44:01] kattykutie: But it could Max the time reduction
[8:44:02] Attackeight: @gaymersalsa  can we do a gamba for 2 god altars and elixir completion
[8:44:02] thiccmilkguy: 30* max if you complete in 15 minutes
[8:44:02] pursued__toast: how can u know the paint room is left of the portal?
[8:44:03] zebrainap: @iskall85 maybe try to see how far you can go before you lose the stack before you change it?
[8:44:04] gaymersalsa: @luke_sch02 gngn
[8:44:05] Marknu: you could just cap the time reduction so the lowest it can go is 5min or something
[8:44:05] CedH1: I hate the cap make it not as hype as it is without a cap
[8:44:05] chuckleslaughed: gamba?
[8:44:07] tygo720: NO because more LOOT
[8:44:15] luke_sch02: @gaymersalsa ty flowerr
[8:44:16] KalunRS: just cap the time until like 20min flat
[8:44:16] infinity045: could be random? or time or mob
[8:44:16] gaymersalsa: @Attackeight hmm
[8:44:20] debzz: slow effect on mobs?
[8:44:22] FoxFireX_: Making Divine Paradox uncapped (unintentionally) made it way too unbalanced. A cap is okay here, just like it is there.
[8:44:22] lynx235: limit the time drain to 15 min or something like that
[8:44:23] Affalcons: You could have a max decrease  so no cap
[8:44:28] rythmyr: You could remove the cap by doing it percent-based, every vault reduces the start time by like 5% compared to the previous vault
[8:44:29] C0SMICCRACKER: iskall is the goat
[8:44:34] SuiteSunrise: i really like the time thing
[8:44:39] KalunRS: a hard scav in 20 min is really difficult
[8:44:40] unagi18: iskCube
[8:44:41] lazypandaman: what you could do if you play on normal each stack is -15 s and for hard -20 s and for easy -10 s
[8:44:42] zeus_o9o2: how about adding a quest of killing 20 tanks with vault completion
[8:44:44] StrangePanthers: Time cap slower?
[8:44:45] Lich_Kirby: More mobs could be more interesting than stronk mobs
[8:44:48] danielthuir: so many chests
[8:44:49] Rynocurl: poison nova will just clear everything
[8:44:50] mr_unknownm: wooo
[8:44:52] sportaflop104: and scav vaults needing mob essences makes it so you need to touch mobs
[8:44:52] nathor092: every 2 stacks of flame should add a wild to the vault
[8:44:53] infinity045: true fair enough
[8:44:57] thiccmilkguy: it might feel similar to cake if you start debuffing. Make it unique
[8:44:58] seraf_fae: maybe a softcap and it begins to give diminishing returns?
[8:45:07] zeus_o9o2: @Lich_Kirby itll be same as cake then
[8:45:08] wagdragon: gamba?
[8:45:09] when_no_username: what if you have mobs spawn like in the older version
[8:45:09] jdubbs211: I think you are overthinking the need to change anything.  seems to be good as is.
[8:45:12] floppypidgen: How many stacks?
[8:45:15] Marknu: easy elixir though
[8:45:16] HarcosMalac: yep

[8:45:30] kibaz_x: so Barry is the problem
[8:45:32] tygo720: removing time just removes the part of the vault in which you can just loot because of objective so that actually can work against mob interactions I think
[8:45:32] nathor092: got it
[8:45:33] sboggsie02: i am very late to the stream, but what’s the 9x soul flame?
[8:45:35] nihal_prakash: make it 10s less - that puts the cap at 90 and that is enough ig
[8:45:36] BlazeSpaceRl: @iskall85 people say there is a paint room left of the protal
[8:45:38] ladislavcomrade: What if time would remain the same but for every stack would add negative modifier and evers fifth one add a curse

[8:45:42] trefz_: @isklall why dont you have the junk identifier in your inventory? to remove all junk blocks
[8:45:43] mahik750: Maybe you can have an option in the first room, that if you enter the vault and need more time you sacrifice some of your stacks. 1stack for an extra 30 sec
[8:45:49] candidcrafter: God challenge - favor or rep ?
[8:45:49] Ferdster02: But pacifists cant beat guardians ore mob essense scavs
[8:45:50] KalunRS: or instead of removing the time, add slowness 😂
[8:45:52] zeus_o9o2: @iskall85 having a side quest too like 20 tank mob kills with vault completion
[8:46:04] Lich_Kirby: @zeus_o9o2 Don't cakes increase damage and HP?
[8:46:05] thiccmilkguy: haha he denied the altar yes people are gonna get robbed

[8:48:25] Attackeight: ok I like thaty
[8:48:28] toasterburn809: no dont make super aggressive
[8:48:29] TAxels: if you fail would it be worth considering cutting stacks in half instead of a full reset?
[8:48:30] 64_Bit_Cake: No I don't like that one
[8:48:34] Lich_Kirby: Fair, plus maybe spending stacks at a vendor?
[8:48:36] Gorbyas: or increase scav rate the more stacks you have

[8:49:13] Matias429: You could also cap it at let's say 5 minutes, so you can theoretically stack it infinitely, but of course the difficulty would still increase
[8:49:18] xverion_: @gaymersalsa HAHAHA
[8:49:19] thiccmilkguy: Yeah sounds nice but after 25ish it will be a buffed vault so risk should also be super buffed
[8:49:21] Attackeight: no @xverion_
[8:49:23] zeus_o9o2: there is  no quest based on killing mob unless guardian but they can be cheesed so a quest for killing mobs
[8:49:30] when_no_username: crowd control lmao
[8:49:36] kibaz_x: @xverion_ i'm gonna blame you
[8:49:39] KalunRS: add a magmatic piglin spawn at every poi per stack 4Head
[8:49:41] mahik750: Low dmg ranged mobs would be nice, or effect ranged mobs, like knockback, slowness, etc
[8:49:52] SwimStyle: i love the different color pallets of the dragons in the paradox vault themes
[8:49:58] zeus_o9o2: cmon were in dev team your dylans PopNemo PopNemo
[8:49:59] tito_me_doe: 9 hour strim! What did you decide on cake vaults? I had to work lol
[8:50:02] gaymersalsa: @mahik750 "WOULD BE NICE"
[8:50:02] tygo720: but are people not just going to speed run objectives to get high soul flame and just ignore mobs?
[8:50:06] sideburns_of_fire: reckon you've just passed over 5k bronze in this room alone
[8:50:06] Trall543: maybe have it so that if you dont complete in time for auto upgrade, you still have a chance at upgrade, that way it removes "cap"
[8:50:07] norvillesdingus: I have a feeling I'm going to have a hard time with the soul flames.
[8:50:08] thiccmilkguy: xp shouldnt be as rewarding that is definitely too much
[8:50:10] thiccmilkguy: !uptime
[8:50:10] Nightbot: Stream uptime: 8 hours 50 minutes 16 seconds
[8:50:13] Darkwytchcraft: if you mess with folks who are cassual it won't be good
[8:50:17] Zinoba: agreedge
[8:50:17] endlesstag59227: yup
[8:50:18] brightwing_21: yes
[8:50:19] kay_taureau_17: no makes sense
[8:50:21] valkojam: makes sense
[8:50:22] Heri_Man: It souds good
[8:50:22] HarcosMalac: yep
[8:50:22] noninja5: y
[8:50:22] jessmay121_: I agree with that
[8:50:25] TechnoHail: yes sounds good
[8:50:26] nathor092: ya
[8:50:27] AmethystVicious: I agree
[8:50:27] CedH1: i'm fully agree, I just don't love the cap at all
[8:50:27] Attackeight: !cookies @thiccmilkguy
[8:50:27] Nightbot: Here, thiccmilkguy have some cookies!
[8:50:28] xverion_: fully agree
[8:50:29] mahik750: @gaymersalsa Secretly trying to decrease the amount of killer snipers
[8:50:32] Darkwytchcraft: the get good mentality doesn't work for everyone
[8:50:32] Marknu: I have a build that proves you wrong iskall it takes no skill
[8:50:36] Lich_Kirby: It means that if it's too tough, maybe you can spend stacks?
[8:50:37] thiccmilkguy: @Attackeight nom
[8:50:38] fishtank2009: I agree
[8:50:39] StrangePanthers: Yes sir 😁
[8:50:40] krahnsters: If you don't want a hard cap on stacks, then create a maximum time reduction (eg ascention will never go below 10min)
[8:50:40] gaymersalsa: @mahik750 kekw understandable
[8:50:41] megafrox: 👍
[8:50:43] toasterburn809: if you are gonna do mob damage then do less time or not change the time
[8:50:43] pb_b: yes but maybe the time stops decreasing at one point?
[8:50:44] nathor092: sound amazing
[8:50:57] BlazeSpaceRl: left of protal time
[8:50:57] tkap_21: it would be cool if there was an ascension bonfire block that you put the crystal in to power it up instead on an anvil, and as you get more stacks the bonfire grows
[8:50:59] zebrainap: with the 20 sec thing there will already be a soft limit tbh
[8:51:01] Knew_It_Owl: @gaymersalsa  Emote idea: Make a emote with the seagulls from finding nemo, but instead of going MINE MINE MINE, they go GAMBA GAMBA GAMBA. Thoughts?
[8:51:01] kinoks: Do you consider to add skills or some kind of item for upgrade certain type of vault? like a skill for more elixir from coins etc
[8:51:02] JashinFanatic: I feel like if you need to balance the game around one build, it's not a good build for the game, because it will end up being the only build
[8:51:03] Crazedmonkey406: top coins!
[8:51:05] zeus_o9o2: i hate when pacifist leaves mmob behind that attack me BibleThump Keepo Keepo
[8:51:10] k1_setae: i still feel like it should remove all if not completing in time, its a cycle that cannot be milked to its max potential making all other vaults irrelevant
[8:51:15] montypythoncode: i mean if you want to target "ban" pasifists, you can speedbuff mobs the more mobs are alive nearby. tho that does not seem healthy
[8:51:21] freddyb8: Go back for paint room sir
[8:51:22] Buggy_Girl: wow, he is still going!
[8:51:29] tygo720: is there a cap of the removed time
[8:51:35] forelini: so no losing stacks
[8:51:36] Caren9593: I think there should be a cap on the time lowered.
[8:51:40] BlazeSpaceRl: paint room sir
[8:51:54] xMizzlefaShizzlex: @iskall85 having a limit isnt a bad thing just think in Diablo there is only a max tier dungeon you can do and if you get to that you feel good
[8:51:57] Batchz05: what if you get 2 if you do in the shorter time frame and 1 for doing it afterwards
[8:51:58] tygo720: because otherwise you eventually will just not have anytime left
[8:52:01] gaymersalsa: @Knew_It_Owl LOL
[8:52:01] BlazeSpaceRl: cha help get his attention
[8:52:08] Scarletcat09: Just making the game harder and harder makes it awful for people who dont game for a living. I have a full time obligations and family, gaming is something I get to do but not as often as people who get tons of practice. Remember that not everyone can play enough to enjoy a super challenge like professional gamers - Dont equate difficulty as the only thing that makes it  fun please
[8:52:10] BlazeSpaceRl: left of portal
[8:52:11] gaymersalsa: @Knew_It_Owl remind me later im half asleep
[8:52:17] VoidGenixia: tuned back in to the stream after a while, can someone fill me in on what is being discussed with ascension vaults?
[8:52:18] unagi18: rather than adding more chests, you can make it more item rarity and item quantity and for ores, you can copious..........
[8:52:37] thiccmilkguy: because it will be harder, will you add a way to get the soul flame back if lost at some cost?
[8:52:42] pb_b: wouldnt timer make it impossible to gain stacks after a certain level?
[8:52:42] gaymersalsa: @VoidGenixia timer going down by some seconds with every stack
[8:52:54] 64_Bit_Cake: @scarletcat09 that's what easy mode is for - don't feel bad for playing easy/piece of cake!
[8:53:00] Darkwytchcraft: casual players are a REAL thing, be careful not to create a situation where folks can't "get good
[8:53:01] kay_taureau_17: the visual is better
[8:53:05] zeus_o9o2: that gem will feel so loved he came all the way to mine
[8:53:06] Hyweed_: but that's the cake thing already no?
[8:53:06] BlazeSpaceRl: visual is better
[8:53:08] mahik750: Visual is great
[8:53:11] Gorbyas: how about increasing a chance for scav with every stack?
[8:53:11] zeus_o9o2: visual
[8:53:11] kot7k: cascading chests feels so amazing and rewarding even it it was the same
[8:53:13] pb_b: @unagi18 yes to solve the scav issue
[8:53:17] kibaz_x: don't listen to him, more chests are better
[8:53:17] HarcosMalac: nah, visual is better
[8:53:22] TAxels: also helps with scav problem
[8:53:22] Marknu: visual feel better
[8:53:23] ProfBits: there needs to be a way to reduce stacks, otherwise braziers are used to stack way higer then intented even with time requirement
[8:53:26] kibaz_x: chesties good
[8:53:27] thiccmilkguy: will you add a way to get soul flame back if dead?
[8:53:29] traeyan: visual is always better imo
[8:53:30] Heri_Man: It's not feeling rewarding
[8:53:33] slc_eyeorg: yuck......visual is better
[8:53:34] BlazeSpaceRl: chat lied to me
[8:53:34] Zinoba: doesn't the decimal problem average out over many pois though?
[8:53:36] Knew_It_Owl: Jabaited
[8:53:39] HarcosMalac: lol
[8:53:39] thiccmilkguy: rip believers
[8:53:41] zeus_o9o2: visual is better for experiencing
[8:53:47] Darkwytchcraft: you know what, people are worried about losing the casual you made for us
[8:53:49] Attackeight: lying is bannable in hrry's chat
[8:53:55] big_cube: Could you calculate the cascade on item quant and change chest amount based on that?
[8:53:58] Scarletcat09: i play on easy - still very difficult when I have an hour every other day to get anywhere. It is disenheartening to feel like devs feel like make it harder makes it fun, it really doesnt
[8:53:59] zeus_o9o2: rigged
[8:54:01] 64_Bit_Cake: @thiccmilkguy no that's the risk
[8:54:07] pb_b: it still solves an issue though?
[8:54:07] SuiteSunrise: cascading is better
[8:54:07] apaztick: i never even see it until i need it in RS
[8:54:10] RobUrHood: I use drawers and deposit upgrades on my bags, so i rarely see my loot
[8:54:15] Monatae: Cheer500 I do appreciate that VH has both a high skill ceiling and a low skill floor.  I love watching you or Pete or Etho run crazy difficult vaults, and I love being able to play on Easy and not die every vault. iskHeart
[8:54:17] noxe_jkl: The numbers are impersonal
[8:54:17] TAxels: true
[8:54:17] zebrainap: when i got 4 trinkets in a blacksmith today item quant and rarity felt good lol
[8:54:20] montypythoncode: it doesnt really show on the endvault screen like total chests looted
[8:54:23] KyokudaiZero: I like cascading better
[8:54:23] 64_Bit_Cake: @scarletcat09 tried piece of cake?
[8:54:23] pb_b: cascading makes scavs much easier over time
[8:54:25] toasterburn809: @Scarletcat09 sorry but I do not believe that this is the experience the game should be developed for
[8:54:28] mahik750: Is there a way to scale the difficulty of the objectives with the amount of stacks you get? More chests, but more/rarer items in scav, more elixir needed, more guardians and such.
[8:54:31] TheCykel: you could say at 5, 10, 15 and so on there will be more chests/ores
[8:54:34] kattykutie: Larger mob spawns
[8:54:34] thiccmilkguy: @64_Bit_Cake that is true but 50% of the stacks and a permanent negative curse would be fair
[8:54:41] verqix: Could do both, like every 10 levels you up the cascade, but you up the rarity/quantity as well with the chat message telling you
[8:54:42] zeus_o9o2: its 3 am here sorry for  my typos
[8:54:45] sportaflop104: didn't he just put on a wendar charm?
[8:54:45] Lich_Kirby: I think mob HP shouldn't go up from stacks, though.
[8:54:49] j4dice: but increasing mob difficulty does increase difficulty in maintaining
[8:54:50] HarcosMalac: You dont even look in the chest, so more chest feel so much better
[8:54:51] Stanbroek: so when do you lose your flame?
[8:54:52] CedH1: But with the timer you include a cap and it goes against the ascension feel dont you think?
[8:55:04] TAxels: it also lets you delay before completing if you want to stop climbing
[8:55:05] fortune85_: prediction
[8:55:05] pb_b: agree^
[8:55:07] Hyweed_: you can easily go into a high stack vault and farm if you feel like you are on your limit of stacks, and it's not that much stressfull, it's prob for the best
[8:55:08] tygo720: if you die does that mean you lose every stack or just 1?
[8:55:08] forelini: so how do you lose your stack
[8:55:14] 64_Bit_Cake: @thiccmilkguy permanent curse?! Tbh I would just throw away
[8:55:16] peppa_j: maybe can be different in difficulties
[8:55:16] Scarletcat09: @64_Bit_Cake I run a server - I cant nerf it for everyone else who would be bored
[8:55:20] Nightbot: Everything in VH 1.18 is very under development & things might change.. Just Trust the Process-- iskall & Devs
[8:55:21] KalunRS: It’s basically a run of cake vaults. Each stack, cake layer, gives more items, but also makes the vaults more difficult
[8:55:22] TheDifferenze: sounds like a skill issue
[8:55:24] Batchz05: what if every 10 stacks you add a negative modifier to the vaults??
[8:55:31] Darkwytchcraft: making it harder is great for a certain population, just don't remove the accessibility
[8:55:33] ProfessionalsOnly: That's a change of heart :) Earlier, you were adamant you want a unique way of difficulty scaling.
[8:55:33] ferrastar: that is still a hard cap on ascension though isn’t it?
[8:55:38] 64_Bit_Cake: @scarletcat09 yeah but there is local difficulty that just affects you
[8:55:47] BlazeSpaceRl: finish vault
[8:55:50] BlazeSpaceRl: g oto bed sir
[8:55:55] BlazeSpaceRl: lol
[8:55:56] skierbrenn: Lol I played 7 hours last night!
[8:56:03] Trall543: i think that having a rare chance to still gain ascension if you miss the time limit would be nice, that way it removes to overall cap and you could get insane stacks if you succeed long enough
[8:56:07] minipantalon: there is a piece of cake diff
[8:56:10] SuiteSunrise: definitely not true
[8:56:12] Marknu: getting easier
[8:56:14] tonTeufel: @Scarletcat09 You can always play on piece of cake. Also over the course of development on third edition there has been a massive power buff to players. The game is much easier thatn it used to be
[8:56:15] Nightbot: Support the devs & the pack.  https://www.patreon.com/VaultHunters
[8:56:15] Matias429: What do you think of a system like WoW's M+, where if you complete in let's say 20 minutes you get +1, if in 10 minutes you get +2 and if you complete it in 5 minutes then you get +3 to your ascension level?
[8:56:17] unagi18: if you add more items Q&Q  it will also help in objective  problem getting  easy
[8:56:18] SuiteSunrise: not getting harder
[8:56:28] PyderMandy: I think it has gotten easier and more inclusive
[8:56:31] rebelrose2310: I would personally add a limit how often you can fail a soulflame vault per day. Otherwise you can just run 10 omega vaults per day without any consequences
[8:56:34] k1_setae: this will be the meta
[8:56:37] slickrb: I tend to agree there seems to be a bias to harder that makes the game less approchable
[8:56:38] Scarletcat09: I dont mind taking a long time to progress - I do my vaults as easier but I cant really run with others... I do think overall there are a lot of balances and it is a great game
[8:56:42] noxe_jkl: It's getting more complex, not hard
[8:56:42] Marknu: There is always a meta
[8:56:46] gaymersalsa: omg i remmeber this
[8:56:47] bossdogone: wow iskall must never sleep
[8:56:51] toasterburn809: I cant wait to try this once the update drops!
[8:56:51] Teeldove: Yeah fro. Someone who can play only about an hour a week. The challenge is nice. Slow at times but that is not bad and there are so many settings that you can change to make the game different
[8:56:52] Crazedmonkey406: i dont see how this wont become meta
[8:56:57] TheImmortaldonut: This to me is a "challenge mode"
[8:56:59] Darkwytchcraft: I just want to make sure that folks with disabilities and those who are casual are left behind
[8:57:04] krostoffrosvik: outside of doing vaults i think that anyone can play at their own pace depending on how much time they want to spend
[8:57:05] norvillesdingus: I'm glad you are trying to avoid meta because I feel like the soul flame might become one.
[8:57:06] angrrrrydad: no it wasnt me
[8:57:11] gaymersalsa: @angrrrrydad hryLaf
[8:57:14] Nightbot: Watch iskall85’s VOD’s at https://youtube.com/@vodskall85
[8:57:16] thiccmilkguy: (like 9 hrs)
[8:57:18] zeus_o9o2: @angrrrrydad sus
[8:57:18] nelly2606: Nah I'm desperate to play vault hunters can't afford a decent pc just yet.   But I work full time have 2 young kids running about.   Maybe 5/6 hours to play.   But minecrsft is what I play.  I'm desperate to play.
[8:57:21] kenneth_432: I think there is a command for local difficulty over the server difficulty
[8:57:22] Scarletcat09: It also really helps to have friends who will run vault dolls for me - I LOVE vault dolls
[8:57:23] Rilude: i love watching you play. unfortunately I’ve not got a PC anymore, any chance of VH coming to xbox?
[8:57:25] ShadowDancer61: If you only have 1h to play every other day this might not be the game for you
[8:57:26] valkojam: apples to orange crayons
[8:57:29] Zinoba: @angrrrrydad i was about to tag you... LUL
[8:57:30] Monatae: I think it is very accessible!  Casual mode helps so much when you don't have a lot of time, imo
[8:57:31] tramuntanada: i was skeptical to play vh because im so bad at pve and change tools and that stuff (skill issue lol). but to my surprise i really enjoy it because ive chosen skills that benefit my playstyle
[8:57:33] ColeKaro: if anything, this Soul Flame ,potentially, makes things easier.
[8:57:40] tito_me_doe: it’s not a mobile game
[8:57:41] BlazeSpaceRl: finsh vault
[8:57:42] StanleyMcC: Comparison is thief of happiness
[8:57:44] BlazeSpaceRl: go to sleep
[8:57:56] 64_Bit_Cake: @rilude no sorry modding doesn't work on consoles
[8:57:56] Zinoba: ooo wels
[8:58:08] CedH1: When I see your video and discover ascension I felt really hype about trying to get the stack record and see what a vault looks like with a LOT of stack, but now the cap is a real feelbad don't you think ? @iskall85
[8:58:10] gaymersalsa: @Rilude most likely not, bedrock requires a different coding language
[8:58:11] Gorbyas: f believers
[8:58:11] zeus_o9o2: LUL LUL LUL
[8:58:12] kay_taureau_17: Yeah I play almost every day for hours and love it, but I am pregnant adn will have my first baby in late April. My play time will go WAY down but the game will still be fun. Even if i cant progress as quickly

[8:58:14] norvillesdingus: I found the one thing that helps me play ( I have 5 kids) is the free crystals.
[8:58:16] KingfisherStudios: how does the new soul flame work with multiple people? does each player gain a stack, or only the host
[8:58:17] abibernard: I was away, are we still ascending???
[8:58:18] HarcosMalac: nooo
[8:58:19] gaymersalsa: bet ?

[8:58:36] faker721: if he wants to vault let him
[8:58:36] d2g450: why stop at 9 hours when you can reach 10?
[8:58:36] damnsecci: halp

[8:58:38] chuckleslaughed: STAY WITH US FOREVER
[8:58:39] Darkwytchcraft: If you are happy and enjoying yourself do what you like
[8:58:39] noninja5: what is sleep ?
[8:58:39] Marknu: casual mode, free crystals are also great ways to make the game accessible if you have less time
[8:58:39] LoopTJ: sleep, don't sleep, you do you Iskall
[8:58:40] unagi18: if you add more items Q&Q it will also help in the objective problem getting easy...... because I play normal diff. and I am decent I guess and I complete 40% objective

[8:59:01] ramnite_tv: Mum is telling them to go to sleep, and they don't want to miss the rest of the stream, so they are hurryiing you instead hryLaf
[8:59:01] DrafonFly2278: It's 5 o'clock somewhere
[8:59:02] Marknu: loot rate increases etc all are options in the pack you can set which make everything easier
[8:59:04] gaymersalsa: 0 god altar completions?
[8:59:04] Attackeight: #yourenotmymom
[8:59:04] xMizzlefaShizzlex: 24 hours or until you literally fall asleep while playing
[8:59:04] thiccmilkguy: gotta get to 11 stacks I can still be alive for 30 moreminutes
[8:59:05] Teeldove: He will stop when he wants and he is having fun. That is important for mental health as much as sleep
[8:59:05] boss_siebe: They updated cake cault
[8:59:05] ltl_drumm3r_boy: would vault dolls be affected by these acension vaults xp wise?
[8:59:05] KalunRS: the xp definitely needs to be nerfed. 450k for a 15min elixer is too much haha
[8:59:05] LadyOuttaTime: makes me laugh. this is your job. Plenty of people work much longer hours
[8:59:07] nathor092: play your game as much as you want iskall

[8:59:08] TheLifeofL: do they tell people who work in an office day to go to sleep?
[8:59:09] Crazedmonkey406: salsa gamba
[8:59:10] boss_siebe: Whatttt
[8:59:10] Darkwytchcraft: you know when you explain it that way
[8:59:11] Scarletcat09: but yeah this is definitely a pack that requires time, which is why I started my own server - that way I can keep it up as long as it takes me to play
[8:59:11] candidcrafter: @zeus_o9o2  yep
[8:59:12] Attackeight: @gaymersalsa yeppers
[8:59:13] Nightbot: For everything Vault Hunters, check out the website! https://vaulthunters.gg/

[8:59:32] angrrrrydad: Iskall is a big boy .. only MAMSKALL can tell Iskall to  go to bed
[8:59:33] blackjacksepp: Why can't people just be happy about the content and watch the stream or turn it off if they don't want to? I really don't get it...
[8:59:35] diremars: Iskall why are u not completing the relics
[8:59:37] TobyButt89: Hey Mr streamer, I just watched one of the vids on Vodskall. You mention overstacking copiously from pylons. Will it only overcap from pylons? or can you overcap between tools and gear?
[8:59:37] KyokudaiZero: It is a bit weird to me that there is a lot of gaming culture has become comparing gaming expectations or even experience.  I have life commitments, and i play the games I like at the pace I like.  I think you are doing a great job on the development of VH, and i cannot wait to play it.
[8:59:37] gaymersalsa: gg doubters o6

[8:59:46] boss_siebe: You guys knew that they updated cake vaults lmao
[8:59:46] Knew_It_Owl: @iskall85  It would mean a lot to me if you could read my last bits donation..
[8:59:46] Darkwytchcraft: okay feelin a bit better because for some of us it can get worrisome that we might not be able to play anymore
[8:59:53] seglats: what you you drink like when playing like coke or energy drinks or saft...
[8:59:54] thiccmilkguy: its 4am but watching this stream. RIP me
[8:59:57] RachelElizabeth92: 1 more vault

[8:59:58] CanadianJet: I’m so excited to finally catch an Iskall stream! I’m west coast NA so rarely get this chance!
[8:59:58] unagi18: if you add more items Q&Q and will also help in the objective problem getting easy...... because I play normal diff. and I am decent I guess and I complete 40% objective

[9:00:00] LegendLarry1: if you want slow pace, put a plunderer's pearl on
