[0:30:31] emilyrose810: they don’t show up unless your close ish to them
[0:30:36] jennana: i never pick it up
[0:30:42] emilyrose810: you can still be kinda far tho
[0:30:46] sweet_cheeks51: your feet, hand, and head can still be sniped if your opponent is good enough
[0:30:51] HydraSZN: w ginder

[0:31:07] jennana: yeah, theyre pretty easy to counter
[0:31:24] GamerKiidPlayz: @sweet_cheeks51 Ion need ppl touching my toes
[0:31:27] emilyrose810: people often sneak up on you so be aware of that
[0:31:41] Larbear2007: hello!
[0:31:46] 88hybrid88: take bounties to see where players are
[0:32:02] Alinouri9: make sure you always crunch with the riot shield, so they can’t hit your feet
[0:32:15] Cheeseburger911: lol
[0:32:27] lispwriter: @sweet_cheeks51 nothing like being sniped in the toes
[0:32:35] 88hybrid88: tip #2: don't die
[0:32:42] Alpacapong: if they shoot the shield enough it stuns you
[0:32:51] GamerKiidPlayz: @88hybrid88 W Tip
[0:33:02] sweet_cheeks51: yeah i just dont touch it bc it isnt practical taking over a sniper
[0:33:23] the_mack_zoo: maddy if you read this, read my previous message
[0:33:24] doublemx2: doublemx2 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 4 months! Hi, Maddy! Good luck in the tourney!
