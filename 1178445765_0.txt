[0:34:21] mechoriet: bedrock is not that big KEKW

[0:34:23] M1k3D3l7a: like the dude with the patreon shader for mc?
[0:34:25] A_Sticky_Wicket: yeah imagaine, a big modpack like all the mods, $200 for a pack, like nty
[0:34:30] deathfurr: there will be a few millionaires but it would hurt small modders
[0:34:31] babyaddalyn: it will never hapen people will just not buy them then what

[0:34:42] podwe: if theres a marketâ€¦they will chargeâ€¦
[0:34:45] hustle21: mod creators should get paid
[0:34:46] bmoboy: it sounds cool but would crash hard
[0:34:55] AMGitsKriss: If it's easier to get into mods, and the creator gets paid, it's basically a self-employed SaaS job. Way better mod support and development
[0:34:58] IronGajeel: 200 for modpack, rip modded minecraft
[0:34:58] WaakkedOut: Itâ€™s kinda like that alreadyâ€¦ I just bought my kids skyblock from the market place on Xbox
