[2:18:56] Viaurora: Rythian you need to place the copper blocks with a gap of 4 blocks for it to work properly Cheer1
[2:19:08] RufusTheHairyCatWrangler: The problem with adding Pam's now is that none of the new stuff would appear in chunks already generated; so they would have to regen the world, which is possible with the right plugin but is a bit of a pain when they've explored so much
