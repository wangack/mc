[2:18:14] JBMiniatures: i always use buttons to stop spiders
[2:18:15] bigbearXBA: They need certain space to spawn and it looked like the spacing between was too small.  Also, the point of slabs or whatever on the flat was to prevent spider spawning which doesnt work anymore

[2:20:05] bigbearXBA: I still build my sky droppers based on 1.6 stuff and spiders still spawn occasionally now
[2:20:06] JoneKone: Rythian, I didn't see you build the thing, did you make sure nothing will spawn on the roof?
[2:20:07] Faaafv: wait and see if you get spiders
[2:20:11] drakegard: is rythian far enough away for mobs to spawn?
[2:20:12] bewarethechicken: Main problem you are having at the moment is there's much more space around B+K for the mons to spawn. Get everyone up there and you might see some action
[2:20:18] RedSnt: there are 2x2 spaces
[2:20:24] SK1LLzxR4ND0M: Friender Cam
[2:20:32] RovioFin: Apparently spiders need 3x3x1 space to spawn in.
[2:20:38] Napoleonflip_flops: Rythian didn’t pay his 8 Musk bucks so I can’t trust that it’s really him
[2:20:40] RedSnt: oh @RovioFin
[2:20:41] 3v1lc0w: it seems fine
[2:20:45] falla_softpaw: @limewood_ they're wondering why they're on 1.18 rather than 1.19, and if it's something to do with the mods
[2:20:57] bigbearXBA: You only need 4 slabs per quarter
[2:21:18] AlexWojtak: Might be the mob cap. Do you have a crazy number of endermen somewhere else?
[2:21:33] 3v1lc0w: @harri_just_harri I think it's the tame mod that hasn't been updated to the 1.19

[2:24:44] Voltzzocker: have you checked the light levels? diagonal corner between blocks can let light through
[2:24:48] Chapter_Master_Moloc: mobs spawn within a 128 block radius of the player, the most likely issue is just kirsty and briony spawning their own mobs

[2:25:29] lokkvic: These are also designed alot round a skyblock situation where there is literally no where else for them to spawn
[2:25:31] bigbearXBA: Kirsty and Briony are causing the mob limit to get hit
[2:25:32] Z0eff: @39SaltyCookies yogHands

[2:25:53] Partyowls_: He can learn easy enough
[2:26:15] Limewood_: I think mobs spawn 24 blocks away (up to 128), so they should spawn inside the farm at least in most of it.

[2:28:20] bigbearXBA: It’s the multiplayer aspect.  Minecraft has an overall mob limit per dimension and Kirsty and Briony being on the ground are causing those limits to be hit.  That’s why people do End Mob farms in MP.  Because very few people spend time there so the dimension doesnt hit its limit
