[1:02:13] kingraidzzmc: Amazing build, so far it has tons of bright colors, one trick I learned in my years of playing is that if you want to draw attention up you want to put dark colors on the bottom (maybe some type of foundation) and if you want the eyes drawn to the ground use dark colors for the roof. I'm sure you already know this just sharing in case others in the chat is curious.
[1:02:24] Normalguy2424: I don't like ariana grande a lot, I think she's always go for a high note in every song, not very diverse
