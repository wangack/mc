[0:45:28] BroCox1: Tango would need to kill and replace wardens constantly
[0:45:33] danieljpb2004: I would be scared that I wouldn't place him in the right spot
[0:45:34] kendi_artista: WOAHHH??

[2:18:14] lewkis01: Can source "waterlog" a block and would that work?
[2:18:14] shooouk: you’d have to use a fluid reader to check the source block

[2:18:24] BradXCo: love you captain, my hero <3
[2:18:45] shooouk: you can also check for the time source crystal instead

[2:27:17] shooouk: omitting the hopper would simplify it
[2:27:43] dragonmaster3707: the source is step 1, so if you have more time crystals than source, you only need to look for the source and can do what X33N said
[2:28:39] MattReverse: Can't you use the same item vault?
[2:28:45] jrb4562: you can use the same one as the time crystal
[2:28:58] jasnumbsdad: remember you don’t need another portable storage interface
