[2:06:55] vfxjess: got an advert for a cooking how is anyone hungry because ill cook them up a nice kebab meal for half price
[2:07:25] SupahMunch: That I would love too. Although 're-finding' the yogs after so many years was a great time too
[2:08:26] capoinkoink: @SupahMunch I almost forgot about them till I was talking about minecraft with a couple of my coworkers.
[2:08:57] capoinkoink: Made me stumble down the rewatching playlist hole a couple weeks ago.
[2:09:11] SupahMunch: @capoinkoink Did you also have an unintentional yog-break?

[2:09:57] capoinkoink: @SupahMunch 100% When they started doing more TTT I kind of slipped away.
[2:11:38] SupahMunch: Yeah TTT is not my favourite either. Not sure why it's so popular but most things are made for people younger than me maybe? and that's fine, as long as they keep going
[2:12:18] SupahMunch: ironically my fave stuff is the non-gaming vids they do

[2:13:48] capoinkoink: @SupahMunch I would believe so, I stopped watching a lot of content creators around that time and moved to more adult content types.
[2:14:12] capoinkoink: Less games and more irl life stuff.
[2:15:20] NEONSHOCK: aw man
[2:15:27] NEONSHOCK: back when yogscast used to be good
[2:15:36] NEONSHOCK: I miss simon
[2:17:51] SupahMunch: @capoinkoink Same. I do like how most of the yogs are around my age, and I like some of the gaming stuff on YT but the IRL stuff is the stuff I like

[2:19:33] SupahMunch: @capoinkoink I'll have to check that out. I like the HF boys but haven't watched much from them
[2:19:44] capoinkoink: Also, their old camping challenges were some of the funnest ones.
[2:20:07] capoinkoink: They have some pretty good content, in my opinion.
[2:20:24] SupahMunch: @capoinkoink That camping challenge was the video series that got me back into Yogs
[2:20:25] capoinkoink: old yogscast camping challenges*
[2:22:37] SupahMunch: Lewis overachieving by showing off his scouts skills while simon eats jaffas on a fire was a great dynamic
[2:23:28] capoinkoink: Those videos made my younger brother want to go camping so bad. I can almost remember him pestering my mother about it.
[2:24:03] SupahMunch: they had the same effect on me tbf
