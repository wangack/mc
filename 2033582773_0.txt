[1:14:03] MacGilleoin: Cheer100  Sup folks on this -20C day. Wither skelly farms that place slabs have GARBAGE drop rates compared to perimeters. Sadge that casual HC-gamer life and not wanting to spend over a year to dig it out.
[1:14:17] savagefeastyt: @gustifo PogTasty sounds like a good meal

[1:16:07] AudioFenix: it does
[1:16:11] savagefeastyt: peepoLeave
[1:16:22] bradydied: was looking to upgrade my raid farm but holy cow these ones that give good drops are WAY too complicated
[1:16:35] hippierosiee: LUL i recently killed 130 wither skellies for 6hrs NO SKULLS, Built a skellie farm killed 80 more No skull
[1:16:37] MacGilleoin: Yeah, true... I can live with it, just annoying cause the skull drop rate is maybe 20/hr?
[1:16:46] lovely_beez: peepoKittyHug im back

[1:17:30] hippierosiee: yea i am super puzzled and dont know how to fix this. i want a beacon LUL
[1:17:33] CraftyCat200: I just recently got my first beacon, only had to kill 68 wither skellies to get 3 skulls so i was pretty happy with that
[1:17:45] lovely_beez: crafty LUBBERS
[1:17:48] blackwidow_22347: That sounds funny but thats like so crazy!
[1:18:03] CraftyCat200: Beez! LUBBERS
[1:18:08] hippierosiee: what is RNG
[1:18:13] Wickednush: are you using a looting 3 sword
[1:18:14] thewolf1111111: I put 250 gaps for the bank
[1:18:24] hippierosiee: i am using a looting 3 sword
[1:18:26] lovely_beez: @thewolf1111111 nice Gladge
[1:18:39] Wickednush: @hippierosiee thats wild
[1:18:52] blkbetty907: @hippierosiee could the mob head pack you have be messing things up?
[1:19:02] hippierosiee: what is RNG
[1:19:17] gustifo: @hippierosiee stands for random number generator
[1:19:22] MandaLin: @hippierosiee RNG = random number generator - the process that it comes up with the chance of things happening
[1:19:25] Jamjames14: hello, it has been a while
[1:19:30] hippierosiee: betty i am planning on redownloading the mob hand pack to test it
[1:19:32] AudioFenix: ugh, I want a move in ready castle, not one of these fixer uppers
[1:19:34] blackwidow_22347: Random name generator or number depensing on whom you ask!
[1:19:46] hippierosiee: so i have 200 skellies killed and no head lol something is wrong
[1:19:48] Jamjames14: doing good, you?
[1:19:51] JulsCrafter: Wsp linkzzeyHi
[1:20:04] MacGilleoin: Yes, looting sword. All good, just putting out my experience for others. But agreed, I don't think the time investment for perimeter is worth it. It took me just over 4 months to dig a 6 x 6 chunk perimeter. I just don't play enough.
[1:20:06] Brixxii: Gladge I dont always have good RNG but when I do, it's not when I want to get it
[1:20:09] lovely_beez: @JulsCrafter linkzzeyHii
[1:20:15] MandaLin: if you're using the Vanilla Tweaks mob head pack, it shouldn't mess with the wither skellies mandal3THINK
[1:20:15] hippierosiee: will trying a different location help
[1:20:48] MandaLin: @hippierosiee nopers not if you're getting the wither skeletons - for some reason their drops just aren't happening on the skulls
[1:20:59] Jamjames14: what have I missed?
[1:21:10] JemmaGrl: the train is looking great, Link
[1:21:26] hippierosiee: @hippierosiee sigh @MandaLin i am so tired of killing skulls for no drops... Sadge
[1:21:42] Jamjames14: nice, nice
[1:21:49] MandaLin: cow catcher linkzzeyDerp
[1:22:29] hippierosiee: i did lol!! i squat down and said i am on my heads and knees please please... and i just get coal lol
[1:22:43] lovely_beez: @hippierosiee SadPiggy scammers
[1:22:50] Wickednush: @MandaLin it is something like 5% drop rate with looting 3... since its a vanilla drop; mob head datapack should not interfere whatsoever
[1:23:33] hippierosiee: yup!! i am puzzled and so annoyed ... never have i ever gone this far in a grind. i felt so defeated. but i am more determined to get one willing to try anything
[1:23:40] MandaLin: Toxic
