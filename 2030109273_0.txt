[0:18:33] Slimothy_Jimbles: how big hot doo doo, but still so fun
[0:18:35] CaseyJones77: @NightMyth06 they aren't, the perspective is from just down the stairs on a sloop... the cannons are on the sides like normal, the harpoons are in front of them

[0:21:32] Slimothy_Jimbles: i think the doll is sitting on the port merrick gold hoarders
[0:21:33] NightMyth: But it‚Äôs an Xbox/Microsoft game @schimmelbrot999. And people have been on and off talking about it happening for as long as I can remember
[0:21:33] CaseyJones77: new fancy skull is cool
[0:21:47] VerdanceWinterheart: Are those things next to the sword new coins?

[0:22:36] CaseyJones77: all blue/purple kinda themed
[0:22:43] themadone68: bottle in the front right
[0:22:51] schimmelbrot999: @NightMyth06 Thats true and I was surprised as well, but it would be highly appreciated, bringing this wonderful game to PS5
[0:22:53] themadone68: is that one of the blue ones from the merchant crate?
[0:22:55] CaseyJones77: I can't say much LUL

[0:53:13] themadone68: real gamers don't need no sleep! :D
[0:53:22] Swangarde: Yeah, could be @themadone68
[0:53:50] VerdanceWinterheart: They might still end up getting delayed, don't count it out yet LUL
[0:53:53] Slimothy_Jimbles: oh i finished the season pass without even noticing
[0:53:58] topendbuzza: I need sleep, guess I'm not a real gamer
[0:54:05] Swangarde: To be fair I‚Äôm mostly not ready because we keep watching The Traitors on our usual SoT night and also Alan Wake 2 is consuming my every waking thought
[0:54:07] topendbuzza: or I'm just old
[0:54:16] missmummy14: @topendbuzza snap üòÇ

[1:01:24] VerdanceWinterheart: I think they're called palanquin bearers
[1:01:25] azjolnerub: yo sup
[1:01:32] topendbuzza: not strong chatters
[1:01:36] Slimothy_Jimbles: does it come with health insurance
[1:01:39] mrc_147: Lol maybe a mouth guard for those Pittsburgh winter potholes
[1:01:39] topendbuzza: no*
[1:01:58] GyratingDog: i only accept my payment in dust covered beef sandwiches, sorry gyratiHELLO
[1:02:10] LeftistSquidward: *breaking down at the MicroMads human blood offering* I can't Palanquin Bear this any longer
[1:02:18] themadone68: kissing things better makes everything heal instantly :D
[1:03:05] Slimothy_Jimbles: but i need optical
[1:03:28] mrc_147: Oh that comment leads to way too many inappropriate comments
[1:03:29] TheJok3r95: micromadsLOL
[1:03:33] topendbuzza: being in Pitt while the steelers get knock out sounds like a blast
[1:03:39] VerdanceWinterheart: micromadsThonk
[1:03:41] Swangarde: I have eaten my last salted caramel Border biscuit. please observe 10 seconds of silence micromadsLost
[1:03:49] topendbuzza: sportsball
[1:03:57] VerdanceWinterheart: @Swangarde micromads7

[1:04:07] mrc_147: American football
[1:04:23] Swangarde: Thank you @verdancewinterheart for your help during this difficult time
[1:04:30] topendbuzza: they are in the playoffs
[1:04:34] mrc_147: It's not like Pittsburgh is Philadelphia or anything
[1:04:39] tetarchus: More of a mediocre owl
[1:04:42] topendbuzza: feb is owl
[1:04:50] VerdanceWinterheart: The handegg has to hatch before there can be a superb owl
[1:05:00] mrc_147: It is not the superb owl. First or second weekend of February usually
[1:05:18] topendbuzza: yes
[1:05:28] Swangarde: Perfectly Acceptable Owl
[1:05:29] Slimothy_Jimbles: OWL entry fights
[1:05:30] ItsUrBoySmitty: MaDS!
[1:05:41] mrc_147: I know this because I live in Phoenix and the garbage truck golf open is the same weekend like 90% of the time
[1:05:48] topendbuzza: philly roits go hard
[1:05:50] mrc_147: Philly is in Pennsylvania?

[1:06:05] Slimothy_Jimbles: yeah pittsburg steelers
[1:06:22] topendbuzza: philly is the eagles
[1:06:28] mrc_147: I know. Philly riots if they win or lose. Pittsburgh only riots when they win
[1:06:52] Swangarde: My fondest memory of being in Philadelphia was eating Philadelphia on a bagel for breakfast and reading ‚Äúmade in Chicago‚Äù on the label
[1:07:05] VerdanceWinterheart: Isn't Pennsylvania supposed to be famous for peanut butter cups or something?
[1:07:11] topendbuzza: riots keep you warm in the winter
[1:07:14] mrc_147: Lol Philly cream cheese is the best though
[1:07:20] Slimothy_Jimbles: god imagine riots in melbourne every grand final

[1:08:03] VerdanceWinterheart: @Roscotep micromadsEvil Orrery micromadsEvil
[1:08:05] mrc_147: I feel like summer nats is the Aussie car culture equivalent
[1:08:40] topendbuzza: there was a riot this year
[1:08:44] TheJok3r95: @mrc_147 the riots there this year was crzy out of hand
[1:09:04] Melongenes: micromadsBongo
[1:09:13] Slimothy_Jimbles: i did see some with weird post somewhere with someone saying that white culture has been so stripped that now sports teams has become what white culture revolved around now
[1:09:30] TheJok3r95: yeah security was knocking people out left and right i seen a video
[1:09:31] topendbuzza: what!?!?
[1:09:35] mrc_147: Lol that Ford versus Holden rivalry is strong
[1:10:17] mrc_147: You get to the majority of the US (what we call fly over states) you have the same issue. Nothing else to do
[1:10:30] TheJok3r95: must be a boring event too if that was the highlight
[1:10:38] Slimothy_Jimbles: there is no ford holden rivallry anymore they both left makinh cars in aus
[1:11:09] mrc_147: Yes!
[1:11:36] topendbuzza: <----- Mazda supremacist
[1:11:44] ChaddSexington: absolutely it is
[1:11:53] mrrreed: is anticheat system coming next seaso?
[1:11:57] schimmelbrot999: absolutely yea :D
[1:11:58] VerdanceWinterheart: Nascar is the end result of prohibition-era booze smugglers racing around to see whose car went the fastest
[1:12:00] Slimothy_Jimbles: nats and bathurst
[1:12:13] mrc_147: I will say, if you have never been to a NASCAR event. Go. It is one hell of a spectacle.
[1:12:29] Redrelian: Wow the ghost ships are leaving you alone.... last time I did a veil I spent more time fixing my ship than I did fireing at the fortress...
[1:12:29] Melongenes: funnt caveman noise
[1:12:34] StreamElements: If you like the stream, don't forget to drop a follow!
[1:12:36] Melongenes: fuck
[1:12:38] TheJok3r95: it did actually
[1:12:40] mrc_147: Honestly I prefer the Aussie V8 supercar series
[1:12:46] Swangarde: Please can you explain how a Veil voyage works? Cos it looks like a lot of
[1:12:50] mrc_147: But yeah it's redneck central
[1:13:43] Slimothy_Jimbles: i do love that an aussie showed up for a nascar race and smoked them all
[1:13:53] VerdanceWinterheart: You also get some swag for doing it 50 times
[1:13:54] mrc_147: People with car numbers tattooed on them. Everyone reveres the black number 3.
[1:14:06] Swangarde: So its kind of a Greatest Hits voyage, with some tornado/fort whacking at the end?
[1:14:07] topendbuzza: SVG is a kiwi not an aussie
[1:14:07] Monkeyd961: What up girl
[1:14:27] mrc_147: @slimothy_jimbles was it a road race? Oval track is a weird thing
[1:14:33] VerdanceWinterheart: 100 times, my mistake LUL
[1:15:03] Slimothy_Jimbles: @mrc_147 yeah was the first chicago rad circuit
[1:15:07] Swangarde: I like the look of it. might have to convince the crew to try one once I‚Äôm over the season ten ending butthurt
[1:15:15] Swangarde: Thanks for explaining
[1:15:18] WaxBitz: yoho yoho a pirates life for me
[1:15:38] Slimothy_Jimbles: oh yeah that shitshow of a race
[1:15:39] Monkeyd961: I have a Q, the commendation for 40 unlocks on the Skull of siren song, does the whole crew get the unlock or only the pirate unlocking it??
[1:15:42] topendbuzza: what a disaster that was
[1:15:47] TheJok3r95: voyages that involve cannon fights always better
[1:16:22] topendbuzza: manhole cover almost fucked the whole weekend
[1:16:37] BOBA2202: Can I see ur outfit in game PixelBob PixelBob LUL
[1:16:50] Monkeyd961: Oky beautiful, thanks
[1:17:02] mrc_147: @slimothy_jimbles aaah that makes sense. Oval track is weird. The thing about NASCAR that's cool from a car person aspect is that mascara have no electronics so all tuning is done by communication between the driver and crew. And there aren't any driver aides. Other than that. It's a giant shit show that's basically a redneck soap opera
[1:17:14] Slimothy_Jimbles: the ground wasnt even and a car nicked the cover
[1:17:30] topendbuzza: yes
[1:17:41] Slimothy_Jimbles: fucked the car up and couldnt use it
[1:18:27] mrc_147: Oh. Automod. Lemme rephrase
[1:18:28] Slimothy_Jimbles: @mrc_147 gotta keep the rednecks distracted
[1:18:37] Melongenes: 7
[1:18:37] TheJok3r95: when u make that noise all i see is caveman spongboob
[1:18:40] topendbuzza: yes
[1:18:40] FireChrysm: no
[1:18:42] LeftistSquidward: Monster trucks rock
[1:18:43] VerdanceWinterheart: Fun fact: The fastest human-made object ever was a manhole cover
[1:18:43] aciatla: no
[1:18:44] topendbuzza: shit is hype
[1:18:44] BOBA2202: üëé
[1:18:47] Swangarde: firm maybe
[1:18:49] icephoinex: No
[1:18:59] ChaddSexington: no, more redneck shit
[1:18:59] Dieks77: mwha... boring
[1:19:00] mrc_147: If you have ever been to Vegas, that tracks. 100%. I'm curious how they got traction over all the sex act fliers
[1:19:03] KarlAbj: maybe back when i was 10 years old KEKW
[1:19:04] StreamElements: <3 MADDIE'S SOCIALS <3 https://allmylinks.com/micromads <3
[1:19:10] AIConcept: it is a good concept
[1:19:10] KarlAbj: exactly
[1:19:11] aciatla: too much hype, maybe just because American
[1:19:17] LeftistSquidward: it's like ASMR, it's satisfactory to watch
[1:19:20] mrc_147: Monster trucks from an engineer aspect? Pretty cool. Can I watch it? No. Not at all
[1:19:20] Swangarde: Natural selection
[1:19:31] topendbuzza: ever seen a the monster truck front flip?

[1:20:13] mrc_147: @topendbuzza did you see Travis pastrana's back flip front flip thing?
[1:20:16] icephoinex: Monster trucks make the health and safety part of my brain start screaming
[1:20:53] topendbuzza: nope
[1:21:02] DannyMcSwanson: Who needs health and safety when big truck goes brrrrr
[1:21:19] mrc_147: It was actually pretty cool. It's sort of his last hurrah before he gets all his joints replaced
[1:21:39] SubZerotd: PopNemo DinoDance PopNemo DinoDance PopNemo DinoDance PopNemo DinoDance
[1:21:41] TheJok3r95: polls up chat vote on what to do next
[1:21:47] Burilla: It is crazy to think that someone thought, "I've flipped on accident before, I'll try to flip this on purpose"
[1:22:04] Burilla: for monster truck
[1:22:08] Burilla: *trucks
[1:22:30] DannyMcSwanson: Looks cool therefore worth it surely

[1:23:03] Melongenes: yo owlet got hired by rare!?
[1:23:31] mrc_147: @burilla I know! That's what I was talking about. They are having to make special ramps now
[1:23:37] Melongenes: The greatest thing ive seen today
[1:23:45] TheJok3r95: maybe now he can get a owl in SoT
[1:23:47] tetarchus: Perhaps now we get in game owls?
[1:23:50] tetarchus: LuL
[1:23:54] cuddlebudy: Oh hey nice shirt micromadsWiggle
[1:24:04] mrc_147: Aren't there owl sails?
[1:24:27] captainlogan356: hey got any tips on how to grow on twich ????????
[1:24:33] Dieks77: Many years ago there was a Monstertruck-show in town. Fenced off, high ticket price. Climbed a high building with overview of the area with other people, got removed by police :D
[1:24:36] DannyMcSwanson: @mrc_147 Like imagine thinking "Might make a ramp called a kicker where the end moves as the bike hits it so i can front flip easier" absoleutly crazy
[1:24:48] TheJok3r95: micromadsLOL
[1:24:56] Swangarde: what‚Äôs ttv?

[1:27:58] themadone68: Ooooh! I wonder if my art skills are up to the challenge - I made my own skin already :D
[1:28:05] mrc_147: Okay it's 4:30 and I have to at least get an hour before work. I have enjoyed my trip down bogan lane. Y'all have a good one

[1:29:07] themadone68: and lots of lapis too
[1:30:02] uriel_godfire: do you have a fletcher in the village? cheap arrows
[1:31:10] Slimothy_Jimbles: a guy that sells mending is always handy
[1:31:48] uriel_godfire: cook the netherack into red nether brick, i think, its been a LONG time
[1:33:47] topendbuzza: just kill him Kappa
[1:34:38] TheJok3r95: once playthrough is done is a micromads MP server on the cards?
[1:34:43] icephoinex: Fisherman?
[1:35:05] topendbuzza: hell yeaha
[1:35:20] Slimothy_Jimbles: id just say a mending guy and a arrow guy
[1:35:26] uriel_godfire: fisherman need a barrel
[1:35:30] icephoinex: Barrel I believe
[1:35:47] Slimothy_Jimbles: pedestal
[1:36:10] DannyMcSwanson: yeah its jsut a singular barrel placed next to one that doesnt have a job yet
[1:37:06] uriel_godfire: librarian and cartographer are cool
[1:37:25] icephoinex: Minecraft looks soo much easier on PC
[1:38:04] icephoinex: Do you have a farmer?
[1:38:10] uriel_godfire: barrell also double as storage device, like a chest
[1:38:41] khaos_rhythm: Need lecturn to make a librarian. But getting mending is an RNG game. Might take a while.
[1:39:12] fluffybaconunicorn: micromadsWave
[1:39:25] uriel_godfire: or just un build and re build and his trades change
[1:39:26] KarlAbj: you can also make a zombie attack the villagers to turn them into zombie villagers then cure them
[1:39:33] KarlAbj: this way you get massive discounts
[1:39:39] KarlAbj: for saving their lives
[1:39:41] KarlAbj: LUL
[1:39:43] itsjustpixels_: is this a Peter Griffen character?
[1:41:32] icephoinex: What texture back is this?
[1:42:30] icephoinex: Huh, guess they have changed since I played last. Stone looks a lot more detailed
[1:44:20] Slimothy_Jimbles: seems anywhere between 0 and -64 should be good
[1:44:32] DannyMcSwanson: How good is pizza
[1:45:31] Swangarde: Ok this is going to sound insane but I think this might be the first time I‚Äôve ever seen a Mine in Minecraft
[1:46:26] Deathus7270: That's nothing compared to a skeleton riding a spider!
[1:47:03] themadone68: @Swangarde there are actual mines with cart tracks and stuff ... this is just a hole in the ground :)
[1:47:15] Swangarde: This music seems oddly chill considering the horrors you‚Äôre facing
[1:48:06] Swangarde: Then I continue to live in waiting @themadone68
[1:48:15] DannyMcSwanson: Minecraft music is always chill and its great
[1:48:28] TheJok3r95: as soon as theres MC music i get sleepy
[1:48:40] Swangarde: La la laaa ZOMBIES ATTACK YOUR FACE la laaa
[1:48:43] Slimothy_Jimbles: just wait til the music gets aggressovly chill
[1:48:49] khaos_rhythm: Lapis follows the reduced air exposure rule. So basically you'll find alot more when searching in underwater caves or when strip mining vs caving.
[1:49:38] icephoinex: We play Minecraft music when we are packing as it keeps us chill
[1:49:44] MadHatt0r: I once tried to farm drowned cause I've read that they rarely drop Tridents - after Hours not even one FeelsBadMan

[3:33:16] Hzbro: Hey Mads. How's it going?
[3:33:16] DannyMcSwanson: How can you be mad at a floating octopus that looks like a marshmellow
[3:34:11] the_g_meister: Btw a fire resistance potion means blazes fireballs don't actually do anything to you
[3:34:42] the_g_meister: You can just stand in there and attack them and you'll only take damage if you bump into them
[3:35:28] topendbuzza: that's not even resistance, that's like fire Null
[3:36:08] Hzbro: I mean...
[3:36:12] Hzbro: That sounds pretty nice
[3:36:15] topendbuzza: being happy for anything is never sad
[3:36:26] DannyMcSwanson: tsk tsk tsk vegimete is a no no
[3:36:47] topendbuzza: boo this chatter
[3:37:07] DannyMcSwanson: Butter is supreme
[3:37:57] Hzbro: Vegemite is great
[3:38:24] ATControl_: Hi Mads!  Happy Friday
[3:38:25] DannyMcSwanson: 'Hot Take' It really is overhyped
[3:38:50] Hzbro: Hard disagree
[3:38:52] Hzbro: Yep
[3:38:56] Hzbro: She's right, most people shit on it
[3:39:05] Hzbro: It gets more hate than love fr
[3:39:18] DannyMcSwanson: All of my mates stan over Vegemite
[3:39:32] RonnyC2: would you try marmite?
[3:40:01] DannyMcSwanson: @RonnyC2 Dont even bring those letters in that combination into this equation'
[3:40:07] Hzbro: Marmite's kinda mid compared tbf
[3:40:15] Hzbro: And I used to LOVE Marmite before I tried Vegemite
[3:41:33] Hzbro: Also I'm still searching for this 1/10 chatter that would not recommend Micromads so that we can have...words
[3:41:48] Hzbro: LUL
[3:41:54] the_g_meister: Should be loads. Even for strength potions if you want those
[3:42:05] Hzbro: How was your Christmas/New Years btw Mads?
[3:42:10] the_g_meister: Maybe just farm until your fire resistance ends or something
[3:42:21] Hzbro: Fantastic
[3:43:04] StreamElements: <3 MADDIE'S SOCIALS <3 https://allmylinks.com/micromads <3
[3:43:12] the_g_meister: Do you want me to explain potions to you btw? You've got the basics by now but I can give you the specifics
[3:43:16] HawkNPackFFS: yep
[3:44:17] RagingPhoenix33: Your wlecome
[3:44:27] the_g_meister: For basically all potions you need nether wart, then an ingredient, then any modifiers
[3:44:36] the_g_meister: In that order
[3:45:02] V_0rt3_X: Hey @micromads micromadsHeart
[3:45:15] the_g_meister: For modifiers, redstone makes them longer, glowstone makes them shorter but stronger, and gunpowder makes them throwable
[3:45:42] the_g_meister: And fermented spider eyes "invert" the effect. Not that important though
[3:45:46] RagingPhoenix33: Yeah its one where you can choose who you want to give you a massage too! i dint know if you had a preference or not so you got a choice of like 10 different people
[3:46:11] MadHatt0r: so the old Question, what is better, longer or shorter and stronger? :^)
[3:46:45] the_g_meister: For ingredients, I'd recommend glistering melon for instant health, ghast tear for regeneration, blaze powder for strength and sugar for speed
[3:47:18] the_g_meister: Nah
[3:48:00] the_g_meister: Because instant health doesn't have a duration, you can only put glowstone in it to make it stronger
[3:48:21] amh7912: Goood morning angels. haleySip

[3:49:11] the_g_meister: And also note that while you can hit other entities and yourself with throwable potions, unless you throw it upwards, the effect and duration may be reduced from what it says on the bottle
[3:49:17] themadone68: bit rude - her skin is flawless
[3:49:22] the_g_meister: Potion charts really help, yeah
[3:49:45] LarsFL: Can subs send links?

[3:50:59] amh7912: I hate when I punch a hole in the ground trying to get a bottle of water.
[3:51:09] the_g_meister: A regen potion with redstone would be super helpful in the background for you during the dragon fight, maybe also some regen 2 potion for emergencies

[4:08:33] the_g_meister: Nah I don't think he'd have armour on
[4:09:13] amh7912: could he have stolen the armor from another villager when he turned?
[4:09:22] themadone68: that village is ripe for zombie invasion to be fair - you risk them all by not sleeping at night or building defenses
[4:09:34] the_g_meister: Nah villagers don't drop their inventories
[4:10:01] cubicstonks: Does a villager use its armor in its hidden inventory after it becomes a zombie villager?
[4:10:34] the_g_meister: Yeah but it wouldn't generate with it in there if it didn't generate as a zombie in the first place
[4:10:48] the_g_meister: And I don't think mads has converted any zombie villagers
[4:11:07] the_g_meister: It may generate as a zombie with armour when getting converted though.
[4:11:23] cubicstonks: Yes, you can convert them back.
[4:11:26] RagingPhoenix33: yes there is a potion
[4:11:45] the_g_meister: Your farmer isn't by his composter rn though right?
[4:11:54] the_g_meister: I think it's work hours
[4:12:26] Beni_boy00: Since your a certified minecraft streamer now you should get minecraft emotes micromadsLove
[4:12:51] amh7912: micromadsThonk
[4:13:23] cubicstonks: Dang.
[4:13:29] amh7912: I watch some frequent minecrafters and don't think they have emotes related
[4:13:39] the_g_meister: I'm surprised an unemployed villager hasn't come to claim his workspace though, it may be that your village is either low on occupants now or your farmer is stuck in a hole somewhere
[4:13:40] topendbuzza: getting close to the mini amount now?
[4:14:08] themadone68: hopefully you'll get a new wheat guy
[4:14:15] the_g_meister: Nah one should have come already if they're around
[4:15:16] amh7912: public harassment of NEETS chrisCry
[4:15:20] the_g_meister: That's what I mean right
[4:15:23] themadone68: unemployed villagers look the same as idiots who can't do jobs I think
[4:15:48] the_g_meister: Nah nitwits have their own model
[4:16:02] GiantLoop: ^
[4:16:23] themadone68: you threw an egg at one, remember
[4:16:39] the_g_meister: Either he's too far away or your farmer is stuck in a hole
[4:16:43] DannyMcSwanson: 1 has to do the work and the other tells everyone to be quiet
[4:16:44] amh7912: micromadsLOL
[4:16:48] GiantLoop: Throw a couple more beds down and give one of the villagers a couple stack of carrots. You will get some babies.
[4:17:17] amh7912: micromadsLOL micromadsLOL
[4:17:23] themadone68: whem a mommy villager loves a stack of carrots very much...? :D
[4:17:43] the_g_meister: They need food, buddies, time and beds

[4:20:20] korkoor123: oh i c
[4:20:21] GiantLoop: If you want to breed the villagers, they have to have line of sight with the empty beds.
[4:20:48] GiantLoop: You cant put a barrier between them and the empty beds.
[4:20:51] amh7912: there is a mod that fully chops down a tree when you cut the base
[4:21:05] GiantLoop: No. Just don't put a fence between them and the empty beds.
[4:22:33] Talimbur: Ahoy Mads<3 you made me play MC too xD hope you're having fun
[4:22:45] GiantLoop: So now that guy can't be used to breed.
[4:23:16] Talimbur: we had a server running all the time but i just wasn't active anymore
[4:23:57] amh7912: take the stack of carrots and place it somewhere he won't drop it
[4:24:00] DannyMcSwanson: MicroMadfs smp surely
[4:24:04] GiantLoop: If a villager has crops to give another villager they fall in love and breed.
[4:24:17] GiantLoop: As long as they can see empty beds.
[4:24:59] GiantLoop: Just drop the carrots at the villagers feet, they will pick them up.
[4:25:11] GiantLoop: Then they will try to gift it to another villager.
[4:26:02] GiantLoop: To drop a whole stack, ctrl+Q
[4:26:19] GiantLoop: Carrots potatoes and bread
[4:26:46] GiantLoop: You may not need a whole stack.
[4:27:34] amh7912: I can't wait for when Mads knows villager mechanics enough we get the villager sex dungeon. chrisGrin

[4:30:07] jpbrennan7: what was i talking about
[4:30:08] jpbrennan7: i wasn't listening

[4:40:09] the_g_meister: Weakness is the weird on, you put a fermented spider eye straight into a water bottle. No nether wart
[4:40:27] the_g_meister: Spider eyes, sugar and a mushroom I think?
[4:40:41] ya_boiijesus: Meow
[4:40:46] topendbuzza: we have enough end eyes right?
[4:40:54] the_g_meister: Also you gotta make it throwable with gunpowder

[4:46:41] topendbuzza: I like seeing gamers sweat

[4:47:47] ya_boiijesus: You do the segs? Disgusting
[4:47:48] themadone68: which would have made for a very short hardcore mode
[4:48:21] ya_boiijesus: $50* forgot the 0 chrisGrim
[4:48:58] topendbuzza: I don't want the sweat, I just wanna see it\
[4:49:07] themadone68: might as well kill him whilst he's alone
[4:49:34] ya_boiijesus: I can show you some sweat chrisLewd
[4:49:35] themadone68: only brown - no red?
[4:50:06] eijebong_: Fermented spider eye is a craft recipe
[4:50:14] themadone68: ignore me - I thought you were making something else
[4:50:37] the_g_meister: Then just brew it straight into a water bottle
[4:50:49] Slimothy_Jimbles: did you want me to put a brewing guide in the discord?
[4:50:51] eijebong_: And then you just put that in water bottles in the brewing stand
[4:51:08] eijebong_: You can do 3 bottles for 1 spider eye, saves you on resources
[4:51:28] eijebong_: Yep
[4:51:42] eijebong_: And then again, with a gunpowder
[4:51:48] topendbuzza: micromadsRave micromadsRave micromadsRave
[4:52:28] topendbuzza: I do miss that sinner song from that playlist micromadsSadge

[4:56:49] amh7912: am back. I start the day with coffee,  nobody in my life really introduced me to tea so I don't think I do it right, then later I may have a soda or some gamer energy power stuff
[4:56:52] ya_boiijesus: Hmmmm
[4:57:00] disaronn0sour: biscuit micromadsHeart
[4:57:03] the_g_meister: I'd recommend having a couple spare ender pearls so you can warp to the end platform if necessary
[4:57:17] ya_boiijesus: Lets go trade with the weed man chrisGrin
[4:57:36] GiantLoop: Oh! I missed it! Is that fair one you bred?
[4:58:04] eijebong_: Was that a jellie cat? chrisAww . o O ( chrisSad )
[4:58:12] DannyMcSwanson: Bring a bed aswell to place near the ender portal surely

[4:58:27] ReneePuzy: @the_g_meister cabt she just use chorus fruit?
[4:58:27] DannyMcSwanson: Incase the worst is to happen  during the fight
[4:58:32] GiantLoop: Nice. Once you get the cleric leveled up you will have so many pearls.
[4:58:53] Bunisher: micromadsWiggle micromadsWiggle micromadsWiggle
[4:58:55] Bunisher: Are we winning?
[4:58:57] the_g_meister: @reneeee94 how is she gonna get those?
[4:59:00] amh7912: micromadsSmug
[4:59:00] eijebong_: @bashattack Jellie is the name of a cat from a youtuber that got added to the game. She unfortunately passed away last week chrisSad
[4:59:01] themadone68: use search box?
[4:59:11] nog_eagor: you get a purple thing and use the crafting table
[4:59:37] GiantLoop: Want spoilers for shulker?
[4:59:37] amh7912: ender chest is a thing you can make. Shulkers are [redacted]
[4:59:38] DannyMcSwanson: 2x Shulkert shell and a chest
[4:59:47] GiantLoop: You have to kill shulkers in the end.
[4:59:55] GiantLoop: Beat dragon first.
[5:00:07] ReneePuzy: @the_g_meister ohh yeah lol. My bad, havent played in a long time
[5:00:10] Gerben__: only available after you kill the dragon
[5:00:11] ReneePuzy: You cant yet
[5:00:13] GiantLoop: Shulker mobs drop shulker shells.
[5:00:19] ReneePuzy: You dont have shulker shells
[5:00:21] DannyMcSwanson: Destroy shulkers and they wither drop 0-1 shulker shells, you need 2 for a shulker box
[5:00:31] DannyMcSwanson: either*
[5:00:36] the_g_meister: No worries, I was wondering if you could get them from a villager trade or something LUL
[5:00:41] eijebong_: Yeah pretty much
[5:00:42] DannyMcSwanson: correct
[5:00:43] Gerben__: yes
[5:00:48] amh7912: shulker box goes in your inventory, and you can put a box in a box
[5:00:49] GiantLoop: End chest can be placed anywhere. All ender chest will open to the same inventory no matter where they are.
[5:00:57] eijebong_: It's per person. And global
[5:01:02] DannyMcSwanson: big bran mads
[5:01:04] GiantLoop: But!!!!! You can only pick it up with a silk touch pick axe.
[5:01:44] DannyMcSwanson: So idf you maek one at home adn then place one at the end portal youll be good fo the final boss

[5:04:59] GiantLoop: How is SoT these days BTW? I grew bored of it awhile back.
[5:05:07] amh7912: fair
[5:05:39] GiantLoop: I heard something about Monkey Island?
[5:05:42] amh7912: nah i kinda think I got the same thing just not bad enough to think of going backwards
[5:06:01] GiantLoop: Maybe I'll revisit.
[5:06:54] Bunisher: Maybe Monkey Island should be on your list of games to complete this year? :D
[5:07:59] amh7912: Zelda Kappa

[5:08:22] themadone68: you should track them to the source and end it
[5:08:37] DannyMcSwanson: @sabrinathestump You know what they say about great minds
[5:08:54] the_g_meister: Mommy micromadsHey
[5:09:25] amh7912: I regret choosing my username when I was 9 but it's too late now.
[5:09:49] Harpie77: You can place water for safe
[5:09:57] the_g_meister: I like making nicknames for people
[5:10:40] amh7912: nah nah, 20 years of this, this is mine everywhere I care about
[5:11:06] DannyMcSwanson: Mistakes happen, it is what it is
[5:11:48] the_g_meister: I remember when I first started gaming I came up with a super generic and already taken name for runescape, and it recommended me the really awesome name Claywolf
[5:12:24] Darth_Blithe: you need your gold for a golden apple though dont you?
[5:12:36] bashattack: I was given the nick name Bash Attack in middle school and I've discovered since like three other bashattacks online and it weirds me out.
[5:12:51] LeftistSquidward: I‚Äôm p sure my first gaming name was smth like DragonSlayer666
[5:12:58] LeftistSquidward: which in retrospect was badass
[5:13:04] StreamElements: <3 MADDIE'S SOCIALS <3 https://allmylinks.com/micromads <3
[5:13:08] themadone68: golf is a rubbish material for armor anyway - not very durable
[5:13:19] amh7912: @bashattack your nickname is  now #4
[5:13:32] LeftistSquidward: I was exactly 10 Mads hahaha
[5:13:38] LeftistSquidward: you clocked me too hard
[5:13:51] Benaja: We going mining? peepoHappy
[5:14:14] Benaja: Also Heyy. How's your day and what we dong?
[5:14:15] Darth_Blithe: i used to go by Kloud or Kloud91
[5:14:19] angelaachan: my first habbohotel name was xX-Speedy-Xx üòå
[5:14:34] angelaachan: i was so cool
[5:14:36] the_g_meister: Angle LUL
[5:14:42] bashattack: MLG Habbo player
[5:14:43] DannyMcSwanson: How did you decide on "MicroMads:?
[5:14:52] ShxttyFrog: my first internet name used to be Lili138 lmaoo
[5:15:01] themadone68: this has always been my name...although usually without the number
[5:15:09] Darth_Blithe: i remember MSN i used to go by B-Man haha
[5:15:26] Benaja: My gamertags have always been Benaja. Because it's my name and it's usally never taken
[5:16:10] DannyMcSwanson: Nobody needs xbox anyways
[5:16:20] amh7912: xbox username campers micromadsGrump
[5:16:32] angelaachan: LMAO
[5:17:03] RagingPhoenix33: AYO
[5:17:07] Benaja: Stare
[5:17:20] Benaja: wat
[5:17:28] DannyMcSwanson: Yaou would say that but i met you on sea of thieves and therefore it still works to grow your audience
[5:17:29] the_g_meister: micromadsGazm
[5:17:35] Benaja: Thanks KEKW
[5:18:38] Darth_Blithe: i always put put trapdoors over the water so id ont have to worry about falling in
[5:19:16] Jonny__V: sporadic music was originally a bug and they kept it apparently
[5:19:18] the_g_meister: I used to put on playlists of mc music in the background to compensate
[5:19:19] GiantLoop: Mojang recently created a Spotify playlist for content creators.
[5:19:55] amh7912: You should put pigstep cd on loop in game to compensate Kappa
[5:19:57] Benaja: It's because sometimes it's nice to sit alone with your thoughts, and when you get to think about them. It's nic to get taking out of it sometimes
[5:20:09] Benaja: to get out*
[5:20:29] amh7912: (pigstep song is the only in game song that's DMCA claimed, don't actually do that)
[5:20:39] themadone68: they have a limit on how many times you can do a trade in a [timeframe]
[5:20:54] Benaja: HUH HEH
[5:21:27] Jonny__V: 12 for the portal right?
[5:21:28] Benaja: He'll get supplies in the morning
[5:21:30] GiantLoop: The villager has to access its workstation to refresh trades. They can do that twice in a Minecraft day.
[5:21:49] Jonny__V: think so
[5:21:51] GiantLoop: Up to 12. Random how many are already in it.
[5:21:59] DannyMcSwanson: 5 to get there and at worst 15-16 for the portal itself
[5:22:09] Jonny__V: my bad - sorry
[5:22:09] the_g_meister: 5 would be safe
[5:22:18] GiantLoop: 12 is correct.
[5:22:22] the_g_meister: Portal is 12 max
[5:22:34] IgniteNugz: its 3 per side so 12. and thats if none are lit already
[5:22:47] the_g_meister: Nah it's 12
[5:22:51] GiantLoop: No corners
[5:22:58] GiantLoop: 12 for realz
[5:23:04] the_g_meister: No corners 5x5
[5:23:07] themadone68: it is random - sometimes it needs only 1 extra
[5:23:11] Jonny__V: yep -= you are all good
[5:23:13] GiantLoop: But it's random how many may already be popukated
[5:23:28] GiantLoop: You could get luck and only need 1. Worst case 12.
[5:23:29] DannyMcSwanson: so 17 all up for a safe basis
[5:23:38] Jonny__V: 5 to get you there and 12 to populate
[5:23:43] DannyMcSwanson: includi9ng travel
[5:24:02] GiantLoop: Plus you may burn some while you are looking for the portal. They randomly break when you use the
[5:24:39] jpbrennan7: feenGasp we're so close
[5:24:41] DannyMcSwanson: yeah incase you get thrown too far from the dragon during the fikght
[5:24:45] ya_boiijesus: Get a couple more kitties just to be safe chrisPause
[5:24:46] GiantLoop: Once you get to the end, you can create a little hole to get tom
[5:24:51] angelaachan: you ARE doing so well maddie look at you GAMING
[5:25:19] angelaachan: angela89Clap
[5:25:23] the_g_meister: Are you gonna enchant stuff too? Those levels look juicy micromadsLurk
[5:25:49] the_g_meister: Right click to throw, they have some drop off, but you can get quite far
[5:25:51] Jonny__V: sword sharpness
[5:26:08] Jonny__V: silk touch is essential for taking an ender chest with you
[5:26:29] Jonny__V: ender chests are great for getting to all your stuff when you are out and about
[5:26:37] DannyMcSwanson: So you will want to keep normal enderpearls so you can Kobe yourself back onto the end island if you get thrown towards the void and you8 wont make it back
[5:26:38] GiantLoop: For the dragon. You want an infinity bow with power and flame enchants.
[5:26:40] the_g_meister: You need an extra bookshelf
[5:26:44] Jonny__V: they don't loise anything if you die
[5:27:00] the_g_meister: Also if you do the top enchantment on a cheap item it'll refresh the list
[5:27:03] jpbrennan7: chrisNotes mads is now canonically enchanting
[5:27:17] the_g_meister: The level requirement for each enchantment is in the bottom right
[5:27:18] GiantLoop: Ah
[5:27:24] GiantLoop: Early ge
[5:27:29] jpbrennan7: chrisGrin i'll give any compliment that doubles as a pun
[5:27:32] the_g_meister: You can grindstone that off if you want to reanchant it
[5:28:00] GiantLoop: Early game is fun to watch. I forget. I host an SMP so it's been a while since I played early game.
[5:28:10] the_g_meister: Oh sorry, one number says the level cost, the other says the number of levels that unlock the enchantment
[5:28:43] Jonny__V: DON'T turn to sugar by mistake !!
[5:29:52] mulhs82: mulhs82 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 11 months! Happy Friday Mads!!!
[5:30:38] jpbrennan7: feenPH he was trying to do some redecorating
[5:30:52] Jonny__V: :|
[5:31:04] StreamElements: <3 MADDIE'S SOCIALS <3 https://allmylinks.com/micromads <3
[5:31:58] jpbrennan7: feenT maybe the enderman was a nerd?
[5:32:01] amh7912: needed bookshelf
[5:32:18] themadone68: we honestly have no idea :D
[5:33:23] the_g_meister: Only check the bottom one
[5:33:30] Jonny__V: sets thing on fire / cooks meat instantly as you kill it
[5:33:53] the_g_meister: The bottom one has the best enchants
[5:34:02] the_g_meister: The top one is the cheapest to buy level wise
[5:34:18] baddestbean_102: 2 raiders from baddestbean_102 have joined! 
[5:34:47] jpbrennan7: smites? probably?
[5:34:57] Jonny__V: kills main mobs faster I thnk
[5:35:01] the_g_meister: Undead damage
[5:35:05] KarlAbj: more dmg vs undead
[5:35:09] jpbrennan7: smite is specifically undead apparently
[5:35:12] Jonny__V: yep smite is just on main mobs
[5:35:13] GiantLoop: Smite is additional damage for undead mobs
[5:35:14] the_g_meister: Only sharpness will help vs the dragon
[5:35:18] Jonny__V: creapers skellies etc
[5:35:29] GiantLoop: Skelly, zombie, wither, etc.
[5:35:54] themadone68: you get more than just 1 enchant on the 3rd level tho, I think?
[5:36:00] GiantLoop: Get a good bow too though. Much easier to hit dragon at range.
[5:36:05] the_g_meister: Sharpness IV on the sword would be great
[5:36:17] the_g_meister: You can use fire aspect to deter endermen too
[5:36:30] the_g_meister: But they may also set you back on fire if they hit you
[5:36:39] the_g_meister: I think a bucket of water is usually what people use
[5:36:48] GiantLoop: Yesterday I noticed your librarian had infinity book. Good for bow.
[5:36:59] DannyMcSwanson: 1 in 20 is rough
[5:37:14] Kieran1701: Old mc Mads had a farm.... micromadsLOL
[5:37:39] MikeC87: 15 years later,  the music in this game still hits the right spot
[5:37:40] DannyMcSwanson: ei ei no more chickens
[5:38:02] GiantLoop: Bring a bed.
[5:38:30] GiantLoop: Put it by the end portal before you go through. That way you will respawn near the portal
[5:38:40] the_g_meister: A bed to set your spawn by the portal is great
[5:38:41] Gerben__: first thing to do in the end is sleep to set respawn
[5:38:51] GiantLoop: If you die. But your not gonna die!
[5:39:00] jpbrennan7: it explodes you in the end
[5:39:01] Gerben__: you can
[5:39:02] GiantLoop: Bed will explode.
[5:39:05] Jonny__V: explodes
[5:39:08] the_g_meister: It does
[5:39:14] Jonny__V: sleep in the portal room
[5:39:18] Moly187: hullo
[5:39:23] GiantLoop: Exactly.
[5:39:23] jpbrennan7: although you can use that as an AOE attack if you're careful ffeenSmile
[5:39:29] Jonny__V: and keep the bed there
[5:39:37] DannyMcSwanson: Can only sleep in the overworld
[5:39:53] the_g_meister: Speedrunners use beds as a weapon buuut let's not go there micromadsLOL
[5:40:08] jpbrennan7: right click and they fly in a direction. that direction is the way
[5:40:10] the_g_meister: Try it out now
[5:40:10] Jonny__V: you throw them and they go in the direction of the stronghold
[5:40:13] GiantLoop: They gravitate in that direction when you throw them.
[5:40:15] Gerben__: they go in a certain direction when yoou use them
[5:40:19] DannyMcSwanson: when the dragon comes down to the "Portal exit" IS where people place beds to atack thje dragon when it cokes down to it
[5:40:22] Jonny__V: you can do maths to triangulate - but I don't know how
[5:40:36] GiantLoop: Just throw one and you will see. Do it now.
[5:40:44] KarlAbj: @The_G_Meister why not Kappa are you underestimating mads' skills?
[5:41:03] GiantLoop: Just throw one real quick. It will be easier to see.
[5:41:18] jpbrennan7: @The_G_Meister feenGasp this isn't a speedrun?
[5:41:20] themadone68: and watch where it land
[5:41:21] Xyliadragon: you do not have small brain
[5:41:23] the_g_meister: Yes Karl. Absolutely micromadsSmug
[5:41:25] Jonny__V: every one in 4 or 5 breaks
[5:41:26] KarlAbj: it has like 1/3 chances to break
[5:41:29] KarlAbj: i think
[5:41:32] KarlAbj: idk anymore
[5:41:33] Jonny__V: air
[5:41:35] GiantLoop: Up toward the air
[5:41:39] jpbrennan7: right click
[5:41:49] jpbrennan7: that is the way
[5:41:52] Jonny__V: behindyep
[5:41:56] GiantLoop: Now that is the direction you have to go. :)
[5:42:01] KarlAbj: dont overuse it, it can break
[5:42:03] the_g_meister: Straight in that direction
[5:42:04] Jonny__V: keep going that way - try again
[5:42:06] jpbrennan7: ffeenSmile off we go?
[5:42:14] Jonny__V: and keep doing it at some point it will go behind
[5:42:15] GiantLoop: Eventually you will pass it and it will go backwards.
[5:42:16] the_g_meister: It'll go towards the ground once you've found the location
[5:42:31] Bunisher: 50/50 chance that the eye will break when you throw it. If it doesnt break, it'll fall on the ground where it stopped.
[5:42:36] topendbuzza: WE ARE READY micromadsEvil
[5:42:40] GiantLoop: Could be up to 1600 blocks away.
[5:42:41] themadone68: gotta enchant that diamond armor :D
[5:42:46] DannyMcSwanson: so the tip is to throw an ender eye and follow its direction for a few 100 blocks or so and then throw another
[5:42:55] Xyliadragon: I mean.. -WE- are ready... -YOU- aren't LUL
[5:42:55] KarlAbj: feather falling only on boots
[5:42:55] Jonny__V: feather falling on boots
[5:42:58] the_g_meister: Enchanted armour would really help, especially feather falling IV on boots
[5:42:59] themadone68: fire protection sounds good to me
[5:43:02] Gerben__: feather falling on boots decreases fall damage
[5:43:15] the_g_meister: Fire protection is useless in the end
[5:43:19] angelaachan: feather falling is great
[5:43:24] themadone68: hit them!
[5:43:26] the_g_meister: Only normal protection will help
[5:43:26] themadone68: for the XP
[5:43:32] DannyMcSwanson: the directrion will either be the same or go backwards the way you came
[5:43:36] KarlAbj: some people like to watch the world burn
[5:43:41] KarlAbj: mads is one of them
[5:43:42] GiantLoop: Oh! Also bring a water bucket! There will be enderman everywhere, they can't go in the water if you throw it down.
[5:43:49] themadone68: maybe they come from that mob spawner to the right?
[5:43:51] DannyMcSwanson: if it goes backwards the you must be close to the portal
[5:43:52] mulhs82: At least they can't open gates
[5:44:00] themadone68: that really really dark place
[5:44:34] jpbrennan7: DinoDance light it up up up DinoDance
[5:45:22] Dieks77: gasp!
[5:45:30] DannyMcSwanson: #trainssuck
[5:45:30] jpbrennan7: feenGasp even when you told them you were going to fall out boy?
[5:45:52] DannyMcSwanson: thats even worse
[5:45:55] jpbrennan7: is that where you learned what sportsball is
[5:46:14] Jonny__V: kills spiders
[5:46:19] themadone68: bane of spiders
[5:46:21] topendbuzza: spider killer
[5:46:23] Gerben__: sharp 4
[5:46:25] DannyMcSwanson: arthropods is spider attack
[5:46:33] jpbrennan7: spiders, cave spiders, and i think silverfish
[5:46:51] jpbrennan7: oh also bees and endermites apparently
[5:46:56] DannyMcSwanson: dont confuse spiders with tuth
[5:46:56] Bunisher: They poison.
[5:46:58] Bunisher: And are super small
[5:47:18] jpbrennan7: ngl i forgot endermites were a thing
[5:47:22] Xyliadragon: they are half the size of the black spiders you see
[5:47:26] Jonny__V: yep
[5:47:26] themadone68: could always enchant that gardening implement which shares a name with something that gets me automodded :)
[5:47:27] Xyliadragon: they're fast, and yeah... poison
[5:47:33] Bunisher: Sharpness is always good on a sword.
[5:47:36] Jonny__V: 5 is best - this is good
[5:47:39] angelaachan: oooo that's good
[5:47:39] DannyMcSwanson: sharp 3 good
[5:47:49] DannyMcSwanson: 5 best but3 nice
[5:47:53] Jonny__V: ep - good
[5:47:59] Bunisher: 2 extra damage per hit.
[5:48:00] Jonny__V: *yep
[5:48:09] topendbuzza: micromadsBongo micromadsBongo
[5:48:22] amh7912: you can modify in unnatural stats. I had a sword on a server that basically dropped a stack of loot when it one shot monsters
[5:48:38] amh7912: Obviously I'm not saying to do that, but it's fun
[5:48:44] DannyMcSwanson: bow with infinity would be amazing unless youve got heaps of arrows
[5:49:04] Jonny__V: unbreaking 3 is good
[5:49:04] StreamElements: <3 MADDIE'S SOCIALS <3 https://allmylinks.com/micromads <3
[5:49:11] DannyMcSwanson: ok sweet
[5:49:17] Jonny__V: also thorns on the armour is good
[5:49:27] angelaachan: infinity bow with flame üòç
[5:49:50] Jonny__V: yep
[5:49:51] angelaachan: yeeee
[5:50:07] GiantLoop: That's a decent bow.
[5:50:17] DannyMcSwanson: good bow
[5:50:21] GiantLoop: You can also enchant books.
[5:50:25] Jonny__V: water bucket
[5:50:35] Jonny__V: LOADS OF BLOCKS
[5:50:38] amh7912: does the diamond armor upgrade add defense or is it just the lava proofing?
[5:50:38] GiantLoop: Bed.
[5:50:39] topendbuzza: food?
[5:50:40] Jonny__V: you may be on an island
[5:50:45] themadone68: potions?
[5:50:48] topendbuzza: blocks
[5:50:51] DannyMcSwanson: yeah any golden apples would make it easier
[5:50:54] jpbrennan7: can we put Roger in the chest for moral support
[5:51:01] GiantLoop: Dirt cobble etc
[5:51:05] Jonny__V: any for making a path to the end island
[5:51:13] GiantLoop: Just to bridge if you need. Or climb
[5:51:16] topendbuzza: building blocks
[5:51:16] DannyMcSwanson: golden apples for more health
[5:51:27] angelaachan: blocks for paths and maybe to build a safe place for endermen
[5:51:27] DannyMcSwanson: and block for bridge or clibimg
[5:51:32] DannyMcSwanson: climbing*
[5:51:35] GiantLoop: Good thinking.
[5:51:38] DannyMcSwanson: coblestonje or dirt is easy
[5:51:39] themadone68: dirt is good cos you don't need a tool to break them
[5:51:51] Jonny__V: yep - also if you go through the gateway to get elytra blocks are good for searching
[5:51:56] GiantLoop: Spare armor. Maybe a carved pumpkin or two.
[5:52:00] GiantLoop: Etc water
[5:52:12] amh7912: only 4 dirt, Mads keeps her house cleasn
[5:52:16] amh7912: clean even
[5:52:17] GiantLoop: Think about what you might do if you die and drop your inventory.
[5:52:22] DannyMcSwanson: yeah pumpkin in case you get smacked from ender to often
[5:52:28] DannyMcSwanson: endermen*
[5:52:55] DannyMcSwanson: pumpkins hide you frim endermen
[5:52:55] angelaachan: yeah you can put that on your head and look at them safely hahahah
[5:52:58] GiantLoop: If you wear a carved pumpkin, enderman don't agro at you if you look at them.
[5:52:58] jpbrennan7: if you wear a jack o lantern on your head the endermen won't get angry when you look at them
[5:52:59] Jonny__V: wear it as a helmet and the endermen don't care about you
[5:53:04] Jonny__V: even if you look at them
[5:53:05] GiantLoop: Agro*
[5:53:05] DannyMcSwanson: when placed on your head
[5:53:20] jpbrennan7: but it also limits your field of vision
[5:53:22] GiantLoop: But it limits your field of vision.
[5:53:45] Jonny__V: you need it for piling up for taking out the towers for the dragon too
[5:53:53] themadone68: after the amount of playtime you've had this week, I'd have at least 1 chest full of dirt *LOL*
[5:53:56] amh7912: @jpbrennan7 lizzBlind nah dude it's fine
[5:53:58] jpbrennan7: the more nefarious the pumpkin the better feenDoit
[5:54:00] Jonny__V: r are you playing java?
[5:54:03] themadone68: I do a *lot* of digging
[5:54:23] Jonny__V: ok - you can bow the ones in the iron
[5:54:23] DannyMcSwanson: always depends on how many you accidentally agro on your first try of beating the dragon
[5:54:29] Jonny__V: if you are below
[5:54:31] jpbrennan7: they really just going at it in the town square
[5:54:31] DannyMcSwanson: enderman that is
[5:54:33] jpbrennan7: good for them i guess
[5:54:44] Jonny__V: get all that tuff too
[5:55:33] Jonny__V: more blocks for bridging / pilihng
[5:55:49] jpbrennan7: shears
[5:56:01] jpbrennan7: i say things confidently and then immediately doubt myself but i'm like 95% certain it's shears
[5:56:13] jpbrennan7: yay i'm smart
[5:56:15] angelaachan: üéÉ
[5:56:29] angelaachan: silly game
[5:56:31] Bunisher: I hate how much it limits your vision. I never use it.
[5:56:33] DannyMcSwanson: perfection
[5:57:18] amh7912: @Bunisher you can modify the mask. Give yourself batman vision. Remove the filter. Switch it to a crosshair for sniping. etc
[5:57:45] DannyMcSwanson: boots and cats is the greatest edm mix of all time
[5:57:56] Bunisher: @amh7912 Ofc you can. If you start modding the game =p But if you're running vanilla you cant.
[5:58:13] Bunisher: Not enough experience to pay for the enchant.
[5:58:13] Xyliadragon: you don't have the exp
[5:58:14] themadone68: you need to be lvl 30
[5:58:15] Bunisher: Costs 30 levels.
[5:58:15] topendbuzza: level?
[5:58:17] theblaze47: you dont have enough levels
[5:58:18] Xyliadragon: green bar over your item bar
[5:58:20] DannyMcSwanson: not enouh XP
[5:58:23] Ferrothrax: Not enough XP. You're only level 26, need to be 30.
[5:58:24] themadone68: tyou're only lvl 26
[5:58:29] DannyMcSwanson: olny level 26 not 30
[5:58:45] the_g_meister: You need to be level 30 or above, specifically. The enchantment then costs 3 levels
[5:58:48] DannyMcSwanson: #Killmoreghasts
[5:59:27] topendbuzza: I've got to go, I'll watch the vod, so go beat the end micromadsBongo
[6:00:03] the_g_meister: I'd recommend another stream still LUL
[6:00:45] amh7912: there will deffo be another stream getting shulkers
[6:01:05] amh7912: But we *might* be able to beat the dragon today
[6:01:28] jpbrennan7: chrisCry we never named him?
[6:01:36] the_g_meister: Finding the stronghold and portal can take a while, but it can also be really quick
[6:01:59] jpbrennan7: that can be his last name but he still needs a first name so he doesn't get confused for all of the other Weedmans feenNo
[6:02:45] jpbrennan7: chrisHmm
[6:03:08] jpbrennan7: Montgomery
[6:04:44] Gerben__: just beat him up
[6:04:49] DaDoinkster: you need a boat
[6:05:34] DaDoinkster: you‚Äôre not a doctor you don‚Äôt have patience
[6:05:43] Beni_boy00: micromadsSweat
[6:05:45] DannyMcSwanson: Classic
[6:05:53] mulhs82: So much for patience
[6:05:59] Xyliadragon: micromadsBonk
[6:06:02] the_g_meister: Great save micromadsPOGi
[6:06:11] DannyMcSwanson: you wont break thsat gold or above you]

[6:07:16] DannyMcSwanson: steal its nintendo switch
[6:07:19] the_g_meister: NOOO NOT HIS GAMEBOY
[6:07:51] DannyMcSwanson: its too young it wouldnt even know what a nintendo DS was
[6:08:29] DannyMcSwanson: everyone asks what  VHS is and it hurts inside
[6:08:30] jpbrennan7: technically the switch is a handheld console
[6:08:30] amh7912: the switch is kinda hybrid enough
[6:08:38] amh7912: and the switch lite is handheald only
[6:08:44] Bunisher: Say you're happy instead. Makes you less sad.
[6:08:54] DannyMcSwanson: @amh7912 thats worse
[6:08:59] jpbrennan7: supposedly people who primarily utilize its handheld functions exist although i haven't met them
[6:09:10] jpbrennan7: that's not true my brother's gf has a switch lite
[6:09:34] DannyMcSwanson: @jpbrennan7 #Disowned
[6:09:42] DannyMcSwanson: jK jK
[6:09:57] jpbrennan7: that's fine i only have to see them once or twice a year anyway
[6:10:18] the_g_meister: I am a switch both in my handheld gaming choices and in the bedroom
[6:10:29] KarlAbj: extra regen and resistanc4e
[6:10:33] KarlAbj: and hearts
[6:10:37] DannyMcSwanson: No tv Mario party compatibility id as big let down
[6:10:37] themadone68: zombie villagers
[6:10:41] KarlAbj: golden apple good
[6:10:43] Gerben__: golden apple is just healing, but steak is already pretty decent
[6:10:50] KarlAbj: or to cure zombie villagers

[6:12:04] DannyMcSwanson: Hmmmm
[6:13:08] DannyMcSwanson: Roger is pretty great as a classic but
[6:13:24] DannyMcSwanson: Midori has been a pinnacle of some peoples weekends
[6:13:32] DannyMcSwanson: Tough decision
[6:14:33] Bunisher: I thought you should know. Your cats are plotting to take over your stream.
[6:14:37] DannyMcSwanson: ANOTHHER KITTY
[6:15:28] DannyMcSwanson: Farm needs more potatoes
[6:15:59] the_g_meister: Oh this may be a nitwit
[6:16:08] themadone68: that is a villager from a different biome?
[6:16:21] the_g_meister: Yes they are all that big brained
[6:16:41] the_g_meister: The villager variant that can't get a job
[6:16:56] angelaachan: he's just a useless homie
[6:17:01] themadone68: Nitwits wear green
[6:17:04] Bunisher: aka the original villiger.
[6:17:07] Bunisher: Villager*
[6:17:11] DannyMcSwanson: *Homeless man arrives* "Whys his head so big"
[6:17:25] the_g_meister: Do they always wear green?
[6:17:38] the_g_meister: I just know they look pretty different from the rest of the village
[6:17:40] themadone68: wiki says so
[6:17:47] angelaachan: yeah nitwits are always have green robes iirc
[6:17:51] themadone68: That looks like an unemployed plains villager
[6:17:58] the_g_meister: Otherwise it may just be an unemployed villager from a plains biome?
[6:18:03] the_g_meister: Yeah
[6:18:13] the_g_meister: Ahhh I think I know what it is
[6:18:45] themadone68: Savanna
[6:18:48] the_g_meister: I think you technically have two villages here, some of the villagers congregate on the hill in the evening instead of by the bell
[6:19:05] the_g_meister: One might be on the forest so, they had a kid and it grew up like this or something
[6:19:42] the_g_meister: It's not stupid just plainly clothed LUL
[6:19:42] DannyMcSwanson: Villager school lacking
[6:19:50] themadone68: you can shift click a trade to get max emeralds from it
[6:20:06] Beni_boy00: How many pearls u got?
[6:20:54] angelaachan: big attempt
[6:20:57] themadone68: take a bed with you, so you can sleep if you don't find it in one day
[6:21:55] mulhs82: Never got into this game so I have no idea what's going on, but I'm excited for it.  micromadsWiggle micromadsBongo micromadsWiggle micromadsBongo
[6:22:03] themadone68: I suppose you could put down the ender chest - but that wear downs whatever is required to unbuild it
[6:22:07] DannyMcSwanson: do you have a silk toc=uch pickaxe?
[6:22:11] DannyMcSwanson: touch*
[6:22:22] DannyMcSwanson: ok
[6:22:53] angelaachan: water for endermen
[6:23:02] angelaachan: they don't like to be wet
[6:23:05] DannyMcSwanson: it sounds random but everything in there will help with your quest
[6:23:44] DannyMcSwanson: Many hours
[6:23:46] DannyMcSwanson: Many
[6:23:53] the_g_meister: Word of mouth LUL
[6:24:14] Bunisher: Once upon a time there wasnt even a blueprint book where all your recipes were stored. You had to remember them. Or look them up on the interwebs.
[6:24:30] themadone68: Ask Jeeves? ;)
[6:24:36] the_g_meister: As kids I used to chat with my buddy. But then we found the wiki LUL
[6:24:54] DannyMcSwanson: When i first got Minecraf i didnt even know how to craft a crafting table until i watched good game spawn point with hex and bajo
[6:25:04] StreamElements: <3 MADDIE'S SOCIALS <3 https://allmylinks.com/micromads <3
[6:25:14] angelaachan: micromadsNoted
[6:25:27] the_g_meister: I'd assume a phone acts like a fin and falls straight down
[6:25:39] Beni_boy00: In the end u can put pumpkin on head so the endermen ignores uüéÉ
[6:25:45] dragonwh1skers: micromadsNerd
[6:27:19] Beni_boy00: Hi
[6:27:19] DannyMcSwanson: Hello'
[6:27:24] the_g_meister: Hey the cleric is doing nether wart for emeralds
[6:27:30] the_g_meister: You've got loooads of that
[6:28:47] the_g_meister: micromads7
[6:28:58] Beni_boy00: micromadsThonk
[6:29:14] the_g_meister: Could also smack some blaze rods in there in case of an eye of ender emergency
[6:29:37] the_g_meister: Strength potions next time too?
[6:31:09] the_g_meister: A decent bit, but it's hard to calc the armour in
[6:33:27] the_g_meister: Nothing useful LUL
[6:33:50] the_g_meister: Because it's a rArE iTeM
[6:34:00] DannyMcSwanson: definetly tomorrow worthy
[6:34:08] the_g_meister: You got this micromadsBongo
[6:34:10] DannyMcSwanson: what time we talking beaucse im dumb
[6:34:19] jpbrennan7: start to finish our journey to the end
[6:34:25] angelaachan: micromadsBongo
[6:34:48] DannyMcSwanson: Up tp you boss
[6:34:54] jpbrennan7: maybe find the portal today so we can just fight tomorrow? but other than that idk what there is to do
[6:35:02] DannyMcSwanson: Can get there and then continue tomorrow with a big hype
[6:35:12] the_g_meister: Nahh you're good tomorrow I think
[6:35:20] Bunisher: There's a high chance you need more than 5 eyes to find the place. And when you get there you're probably gonna need more than 5 as well
[6:35:27] Bunisher: Oh you had more :D
[6:35:29] Bunisher: nevermind me
[6:35:32] the_g_meister: You might as well get some enchants on your armour even if it's not what you want
[6:36:31] the_g_meister: Prot IV boots is a great start
[6:36:39] the_g_meister: Might as well use the level 30 on that
[6:36:40] jpbrennan7: did we say goodbye to Roger, Midori, and Montgomery Weedman?
[6:37:20] the_g_meister: You can enchant anything to sacrifice, tools work too
[6:38:16] bashattack: BINGO
[6:38:16] themadone68: still had it from 2023? :D
[6:38:17] jpbrennan7: it was my free spot chrisNotes
[6:38:51] tetarchus: @themadone68 Did you not get a new card, sorry I need to get better at admin
[6:38:57] gokublack2045: I had a 100 day world
[6:39:20] the_g_meister: Nah use your level 30 on something good, maybe some leggings or a hat if there's something decent?
[6:39:44] the_g_meister: Don't go for anything less than a level 30 while you have the levels, there's usually more enchantments you can't see
[6:40:06] the_g_meister: Lower levels are much less likely to have more than one
[6:40:22] themadone68: @tetarchus I could scrub out the 3 and put in a 4?
[6:40:47] the_g_meister: Fire prot is useless
[6:40:53] angelaachan: fire prot not really useful for the dragon fight though :(
[6:40:56] the_g_meister: So is blast protection
[6:41:06] GiantLoop: You don't need fire protection for ender dragon. Regular protection is best
[6:41:26] GiantLoop: Prot IV and Feather Falling IV
[6:41:47] the_g_meister: Protection, unbreaking, feather falling, thorns
[6:42:51] the_g_meister: Feather fall 3 may be worth
[6:43:04] StreamElements: <3 MADDIE'S SOCIALS <3 https://allmylinks.com/micromads <3
[6:43:13] the_g_meister: Fall damage from the dragon suuucks
[6:43:34] angelaachan: yeah he can yeet you quite high
[6:43:45] angelaachan: plus leverage for when you build up the towers
[6:43:52] angelaachan: and an oopsie happens
[6:43:59] the_g_meister: You van enchant everything else at lower levels now if you want
[6:44:08] the_g_meister: You might as well spend up
[6:44:28] jpbrennan7: feen9000 go time
[6:44:29] the_g_meister: Diamond chestplate too?
[6:44:36] themadone68: for death or glory! :D
[6:44:40] angelaachan: ccatHappy
[6:45:24] jpbrennan7: what if it's a glorious death
