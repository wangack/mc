[0:17:04] imTymp: yes
[0:17:19] subfin: he also said in the filing he will likely liquidate his 15% if the offer is rejected, further manipulating the price on that speculation
[0:17:29] NexX_____: man cant wait for him to turn into a super villan
[0:17:29] SolarisFall: he's already said he would reconsider his position as a shareholder if they didnt take his offer. So he's just going to sell after the price goes up from his offer probably
[0:17:33] ThatOnneGuy: he probably made big boy gains on an nft or shitcoin scam pepeLaugh
[0:17:45] priam__: LUL

[0:23:03] ThatOnneGuy: If the "normal" is 100, it's probably at about 75 now
[0:23:14] hisdue: PepLaugh 4/21
[0:23:33] mrchadiuss: KEKW
[0:23:36] Im_Axz: I still dont understand this boss, he sometimes grabs sometimes doesnt
[0:23:40] Im_Axz: Swear its RNG or im dumb
[0:23:47] Slymph: 3 stacks spin hurts KEKW
[0:23:50] rykk3r1: stagger happens every other slam
[0:23:53] imTymp: first is no grab
[0:23:56] imTymp: then its every other
[0:24:24] PTK9: ye the grab is kinda weird
[0:24:27] PTK9: its hard to get grabbed lol
[0:24:42] celadriel23: saw somewhere that you cant be moving if hes trying to grab you
[0:24:44] rykk3r1: u can also just sit in the purple fire on the ground till 5 stacks before doing damage, and it reduces your stagger damage
[0:24:46] Im_Axz: We joke in our guild that this boss is the hardest out of all of orehas KEKW
[0:24:49] rykk3r1: so no need to get grabbed
[0:24:50] celadriel23: idk if thats accurate, but the grabbing can be kinda weird
[0:25:22] celadriel23: this is the only boss with a real wipe mechanic, so i would say it is harder
[0:25:24] Thaalll: below his life there a bar.  when the bar is empty he gonna grab.
[0:25:51] hisdue: NOTED
[0:25:51] mrchadiuss: just dodge 4Head
[0:26:16] mrchadiuss: overgeard COPIUM
[0:26:19] DewDragon: idk why but he is the hardest boss in all of orehas
[0:26:28] rykk3r1: just take the purple debuff
[0:26:36] HostileLogOut: the second dungeon has wipe mechanics on the alast one only to
[0:26:44] DewDragon: well. clown messes me up too cause im colorblind
[0:26:50] Im_Axz: @HostileLogOut I swear that wipe mechanic never triggers
[0:26:52] Kryllyk: This boss is really hard on a Gunlancer
[0:26:54] b1gcheesey: The grab mechanic comes after he swings the his weapon 4 x, then does the large front attack. You then need to get up in his face as the hitbox is quite narrow. (just watched video)
[0:27:01] Thaalll: the wrose stagger of your group should be the one who get closer to be grab
[0:27:06] HostileLogOut: @Im_Axz its rare. but typically when your below 4 alive it happens alot
[0:27:31] Thaalll: he gonna slam before
[0:27:34] Jdubsx: waffleHey waffleLove
[0:27:34] Moobot: Come join the Waffle House Discord! <# https://discord.gg/fhGFtMuzdS
[0:27:37] rykk3r1: stagger bar has nothing to do with the grab NotLikeThis
[0:27:54] celadriel23: he grabs after the 2nd + attack
[0:27:57] Triz08: chat is dumb, the bar under his health is not grab....
[0:27:58] RamseyRinehaus: he grabs after every other of his big spin
[0:27:59] NexX_____: bar is stagger WTF your talking about
[0:28:13] celadriel23: when you clear hte stagger bar he gains a stack
[0:28:23] HostileLogOut: you have to let him grab to reduce the stack, when he does his attack where he swings his ball twice, he typically does the grab
[0:28:40] Triz08: well he dumb for typing that
[0:28:41] Im_Axz: Someone did say that
[0:28:43] MistaBleak: that guy was just wrong
[0:28:43] Im_Axz: but they were wrong
[0:28:51] edible_jesus: He only grabs every other
[0:28:54] Proxzyn: LUL
[0:28:56] rykk3r1: Additionally, purple fire on the ground gives a debuff that reduces your stagger damage. It stacks up to 5 times, so sit in it before doing any damage.
[0:28:58] HostileLogOut: it only does it now and then.
[0:29:01] NexX_____: if he does the direction thing just be in front of him every time
[0:29:02] ThatOnneGuy: FeelsWeirdMan
[0:29:03] Dagmoo: every time LUL
[0:29:03] Nilau: Where is the badge that displays your social score
[0:29:04] Im_Axz: KEKW
[0:29:11] MysteriousChallenge: he only  grabs every 9ther
[0:29:20] Jdubsx: or more of us are wrong than you think LUL
[0:29:40] HostileLogOut: whats the price of guardian stones in your @Giantwaffle server? atm in mine its 4 gold per 10
[0:30:10] Allmostdone: Nope not gonna do it. We want to hit you
[0:30:14] HostileLogOut: yea the blue T3
[0:30:14] Dagmoo: he grabs after every other time he does the cardinal direction slams
[0:30:30] SolarisFall: I swear I get hit by circles when I'm at least 2 steps out of it sometimes, and I have 16-30ms ping. it's such bullshit it feels
[0:30:33] sam1390: they should all be the same, market is cross server
[0:30:46] imTymp: yes if u stagger him after his 4 hits he no longer grabs
[0:30:48] celadriel23: if youre moving or no one is in front of him he wont grab
[0:30:48] imTymp: it resets him
[0:30:54] HonestJack: Everytime I watch someone play Lost Ark everything seems so "easy"? Mobs are just melting and people are just dancing around.
[0:30:58] HostileLogOut: the grab has a really short window after his eyes turns red
[0:30:58] NexX_____: yes even if hes does the attack you can stagger and fuck that mechanic
[0:31:02] Dagmoo: the grab resets the stacks he gains from purple bars
[0:31:10] b1gcheesey: When you stagger him ge gains a buff. When he grabs somebody it removes 1 x buff.
[0:31:21] b1gcheesey: If you stagger 3 x in hard mode he will one shot.
[0:31:31] thunderdan11: thats a user item
[0:31:40] b1gcheesey: So the grab is important to remove the stacked buff from him,
[0:31:48] Dagmoo: if he gets 3 stacks from purple bars then he enrages and one shots you
[0:31:52] kaos4666: yo @Giantwaffle  & chat waffleLove
[0:32:08] RamseyRinehaus: the fast one is the fake one
[0:32:20] Triz08: learn velganos and solo it
[0:32:25] PTK9: ye but everyone said those dungs were supposed to be hard and it isnt
[0:32:29] PTK9: velganos was supposed to be hard
[0:32:30] NexX_____: P1 argos was nice but people ar so bad at them took me 6hr yesterday
[0:32:31] kayle_chips: Try to do last guardian, then talk about hard lol
[0:32:33] PTK9: and i killed it in 5 tries
[0:32:45] Larklen: OMEGALUL
[0:32:47] PTK9: this game is just ez, i dont believe the new raids are gonna be much harder, i need to experience it :D
[0:32:50] DewDragon: oh dear
[0:32:58] Larklen: moon2TYPERS
[0:33:05] HostileLogOut: Velganos is the hardest guardian for sure. even harder then Argos P1 and P2 ngl.
[0:33:19] thunderdan11: waffle saved by his team
[0:33:23] punkgeek: Is this the king from Katamari Damacy?
[0:33:26] Mekto89: but Argos P1 and P2 is easy
[0:33:29] davethulhu: no, mechanics?
[0:33:34] ItsOnMax: morning Waffle and chattychatchat
[0:33:52] Allmostdone: That;s what I tried to tell her but she didn't believe me
[0:33:54] thunderdan11: "theres no mechanics in these fights" ignores the mechanics
[0:34:04] kaos4666: Argos is a pussy
[0:34:49] Larklen: Why you kill Lord Farquaad
[0:34:59] Larklen: everyone else was busy doing mechanics widePepeLaugh

[0:35:41] PTK9: its like 1k lol
[0:35:46] AceBlizzardz: its so expensive actuALLY
[0:35:47] HostileLogOut: u can easily get 2x 3 engravings. cheaply
[0:36:01] Im_Axz: Perfect stats with 2 engravings shouldnt be too expensive
[0:36:15] HostileLogOut: @Im_Axz yea like 5k tops lol
[0:36:20] PTK9: now check scrapper KEKW @Giantwaffle
[0:36:21] kurblet: engraving andys do shit dps
[0:36:24] samuraijac: just dont go perfect engravings and you can get 3/3 for around 1k
[0:36:29] thunderdan11: he loses out on a ton of dmg with that domination
[0:36:30] rykk3r1: 6/6 stone with 9/9 engraving, and full class engraving on gear with stats
[0:36:39] HostileLogOut: i am surprised that scrapper did so bad lol :D
[0:36:46] rykk3r1: he has spec
[0:37:00] HostileLogOut: Shock Scrapper needs Spec > Crit
[0:37:01] kurblet: shock is full spec
[0:37:03] PTK9: he has crit on spec build i think
[0:37:04] PTK9: thats why
[0:37:08] PTK9: they both have shit stats :p
[0:37:31] HostileLogOut: spec is the main way to get dmg as scrapper and he is missing like 60% dmg or so
[0:37:39] Senfik: Shock build is spec main
[0:37:43] Mandorake: these people need to go back and read the build guide again
[0:38:15] HostileLogOut: @Giantwaffle also getting 2x 9+ points for engraving books is not hard
[0:38:23] lennon7770: Whats the benefit of surge lvl3 vs lvl 1

[1:20:17] Idawn: combat stats > engravings
[1:20:18] Tamerlain: engrawes doing more
[1:20:19] the__Benji: Because most people in pugs only look at engravings and your dps doesnt matter because no one can see it
[1:20:26] zalarr: the swift for supports reduces the cooldowns so much it's the same as the DPS increase
[1:20:37] daemonaedryn: Waffle bout to offer Lost Ark tutoring widePepeLaugh
[1:20:37] AceBlizzardz: if i even get off engravings i will literaly have 0 gold

[1:20:52] Tamerlain: @DaemonSzyman imagine teaching chat

[1:20:59] Tolrak253: also peacemaker 3 ist a waste for gunslinger
[1:21:01] Venxuri: also peacemaker can be kept on lv1, taking it higher doesn't bring a huge advantage (from what I heard when Saint was reviwing his viewers)
[1:21:17] Tamerlain: @AceBlizzardz u doing good dont worry

[1:32:40] thunderdan11: in how they interact as a group ya
[1:33:01] sogerr: if a wolfgirl heard you say there is no difference between her and a foxgirl im sure she would be offended

[1:36:27] Theswift101: up to 32 days i think the ban from joining a guild is
[1:36:28] Y0kaa: 24h, 3days, 7 days, 15 days, its pathetic
[1:36:36] st3x_: it's because of the Guild shops
[1:36:37] alef9j: I used to leave guild because I couldnt pick one, I had a cooldown for like 1-2 week lol

[1:37:19] ThatOnneGuy: PogChamp I got a drop for a game I'll never play
[1:37:19] kappathirteen: Have you done the secret quest line that has Westworld vibes?
[1:37:23] Warkless: I really like the overall guildsystem and how you unlock stuff, but some things are just dated and not working well in different regions
[1:37:30] kurblet: Get your class engraving from books thats it
[1:37:33] kurblet: and maybe a stone with +5

[1:50:53] KrunkleDunk: it gets bound
[1:50:59] sogerr: library applied gear is bound
[1:51:06] Warkless: If you change out a whole ability, you can buy one from the AH and don0't fear erasing other stuff
[1:51:09] Blasian__: They do that to save a level 4 to inventory, then you place it on gear. then sell the tripod back
[1:51:10] AshraGunn: Does spec for Paladin only effect Holy skills?
[1:51:21] Blasian__: having them in order is fine until higher level tripods. then you just gotta make do
[1:51:23] Kenji_QQ: when you buy gear with 2 lev 3 tripods on AH as you should, its very hard to get the same skill on one imte
