[0:41:17] Racko5: didnt you use to have a working stream UI ingame built for a computer @Giantwaffle

[0:41:41] TrickyHi: Have you seen the video of the guy who played on the OTV MC server entirely through a turtle? @Giantwaffle
[0:41:52] W84M3: they create a script for each turtle you have
[0:41:58] W84M3: turtle/pc
[0:42:02] Akiron_rafa: add a comment
[0:42:07] Hurtwolf: might have to reload
[0:42:10] W84M3: you have to restart the computer i think
[0:42:11] W84M3: but yes
[0:42:13] pachvara42: @Giantwaffle did you ever played Duskers? You controll bot scrapping derelict vessels and can program their routes?
[0:42:15] Tabakhase: syntax error YEP
[0:42:23] lazyhot: coma seperated ....
[0:42:41] Akiron_rafa: use vscode YEP
[0:42:47] Akiron_rafa: with a lua plugin
[0:42:48] Hurtwolf: can you listen to changes? susHmm
[0:42:49] wonly: VIM

[0:43:09] Stormflare: indexed at 1 DansGame
[0:43:09] Racko5: D:
[0:43:11] Allmostdone: It’s just a place holder
[0:43:11] Hurtwolf: oh yeah
[0:43:13] Cutekuuh: vim filename
[0:43:13] Jakovski2670: do arrays start at 1 in lua god what the fuck
[0:43:15] mewmewmews: indexed at 0 DansGame
[0:43:17] Hurtwolf: u can make VIM look like vscode almost LUL
[0:43:19] W84M3: and then you can have a computer like a drive to store all your scripts and use a disk to pass it around other computers
[0:43:22] D_roi_D: ... who telling him he needs to use vim
[0:43:22] Harmar: its annoying but in long run it works real well for it to be like that
[0:43:23] Myekos: get a LUA extension for vscode
[0:43:28] SimonSez: Setup VSCode to work like VIM :p
[0:43:37] Cutekuuh: cd to folder and autocomplete with tab?
[0:43:41] Orin_The_Sly: Eww
[0:43:42] Mobiu5: I'd also recommend VS Code. It's good.
[0:43:44] Slowpoke101: Hey
[0:43:45] lcePops: it says fr fr too lmao
[0:43:49] Almatron: Is it. At the bottom u are doing an i+1? for the indexing on the screen.
[0:43:53] dylan0806: Open with -> vim?
[0:44:01] lazyhot: so vim knows it to -ld to show all and indeed autocomplete with tab
[0:44:03] Racko5: make it a var?
[0:44:08] lazyhot: -ls*
[0:44:11] W84M3: i used vscode with an extantion for computercraft with autocompletes and intellisence
[0:44:15] Almatron: Ah ok.
[0:44:19] Akiron_rafa: yeah need to skip a line
[0:44:27] Akiron_rafa: for the title
[0:44:35] CorSPACE: oh ya, vscode has an extension for computer craft
[0:44:41] D_roi_D: Can you use that board as a real bitmap?
[0:44:44] JoshuaACasey: @W84M3 I don't even code and vscode is my text-editor of choice
[0:44:58] Myekos: you mean display a graphic?
[0:45:02] waterlimon: can it run skyrim?
[0:45:05] DandieRandy: oracle SQL indexes at 1
[0:45:14] D_roi_D: you can control any pixel in a grid
[0:45:15] fisering1: I just run vim keybinds in vscode
[0:45:19] Akiron_rafa: does sublime has git integration?
[0:45:30] Harmar: i mainly used vscode as my main because of terminal danLUL i like it better
[0:45:33] JERICHOLOLO: i love #1 of todo list
[0:45:33] W84M3: computercraft is super dope, but then it uses lua so yeah LUL
[0:45:34] Stormflare: matlab isnt a real language dont @ me
[0:45:47] heatedblankit: @Harmar i agree
[0:45:54] Jolle450: Do they have compact machines in SB3?
[0:45:54] Hurtwolf: yeah u just download git on your pc, then use terminal
[0:46:04] lazyhot: sublime has his own git integration package
[0:46:16] Harmar: the hotkeys in sublime are amazing
[0:46:18] DX_Plates: IntelliGang
[0:46:37] praxiz: wait what? you've started early :O
[0:46:39] kylekersh: i cant figure out how to get string
[0:46:44] lazyhot: sublime is indeed powerfull in text editing but imho weak for coding in any language
[0:46:47] Hurtwolf: try scroll click
[0:46:49] praxiz: Oh right, daylight savings time in Norway
[0:46:50] lijmstik1: get modular storage
[0:46:52] mewmewmews: make a countdown timer for next task with tnt attached on the computercraft :)
[0:46:54] DarkbuilderX: Don't believe so
[0:46:58] krakennnn_: What we cooking tonight Mr waffle
[0:47:05] OMICRON: or use a cube and get lucky Kappa
[0:47:08] kylekersh: i couldnt find the rec
[0:47:09] DX_Plates: @praxiz He said all day yesterday he was planning on being on early today.
[0:47:11] Immp: Crooking dirt, not washing
[0:47:12] DarkbuilderX: Also comes from the crook
[0:47:16] Jordanmc24: bonemeal grass and break long grass
[0:47:18] kylekersh: it doesnt come from crooking
[0:47:29] Hurtwolf: @Giantwaffle i think u can sort with scroll click inside the inventory.
[0:47:29] praxiz: @DX_Plates : well I was at an office party all day yesterday
[0:47:36] Qbertman: hey waffle whatts the goal this modpack>
[0:47:41] McSauce: Bonemeal grass, get seeds. SeemsGood

[0:47:48] DX_Plates: Thats too much work party
[0:47:51] drebisdavid: you need to crook grass i think
[0:47:52] praxiz: my burps still smell of jalapeno pepper pizza
[0:47:58] jayrickson87: the lush world had grass that gave me seeds
[0:47:59] drebisdavid: nvm
[0:48:02] drebisdavid: im trolling
[0:48:08] Jordanmc24: bonemeal grass and break long grass
[0:48:08] Moobot: You can find Waffle's Youtube channel here - https://youtube.com/giantwaffle

[0:48:18] krakennnn_: Waffle r u going to a cooking bfast stream?
[0:48:25] Venxuri: open chance cubes Kappa
[0:48:25] Slowpoke101: or bonemeal grass
[0:48:32] Slowpoke101: and yes already fixed in dev
[0:48:35] praxiz: When is Minecraft coming to steam so i can finally try this game?
[0:48:36] kylekersh: ill try crooked grass then hmmm
[0:48:41] lcePops: it literally showed it
[0:48:41] Slowpoke101: I mentioned it yesterday but you missed it
[0:48:41] officialhunterx: did you update
[0:48:42] lcePops: lol

[0:49:04] lcePops: it showed sand
[0:49:05] Slowpoke101: its not live yet
[0:49:09] DX_Plates: LUL
[0:49:09] Slowpoke101: its fixed in dev
[0:49:10] Hurtwolf: LUL
[0:49:12] Jolle450: LUL
[0:49:14] McSauce: KEKW
[0:49:19] derekkeller: LUL
[0:49:23] Hurtwolf: Jebaited
[0:49:27] Dizz1227: @Slowpoke101 So it is not in version 1.0.1?
[0:49:31] lcePops: I cant cook my apples
[0:49:32] lcePops: smh
[0:49:36] ninopanda: @Slowpoke101 i started last night.  I really like the pack you guys have put together.
[0:49:37] Slowpoke101: best 2 ways to get string. bonemeal grass
[0:49:44] Apparentthreat: Slowpoke101 so only the rei isn't accurate?
[0:49:50] Slowpoke101: not while your in game
[0:49:56] Slowpoke101: crook dirt
[0:49:56] McSauce: Grass seeds yeah
[0:50:00] Slowpoke101: then get grass seed
[0:50:07] DarkbuilderX: You can still use Mouse 4 to go back, for some reason
[0:50:12] Slowpoke101: but easier way honestly
[0:50:15] Slowpoke101: spiders
[0:50:19] Slowpoke101: thats the fastest way
[0:50:22] Jordanmc24: open a chance cube for infinite dirt Kappa
[0:50:27] Jordanmc24: string*
[0:50:41] Slowpoke101: even once you get the seeds, without bonemeal, they take forever to grow
[0:50:50] Apparentthreat: yo let's talk about why reloading modded textures makes the game shit itself
[0:50:55] Slowpoke101: laserIO is stupid OP
[0:50:55] Dizz1227: needs quartz
[0:50:55] ItsBubo: was watching another streamer and had 18 ads in 20-30minutes... so now im here
[0:50:58] Slowpoke101: its a DW mod
[0:51:11] CoolReal: pipez
[0:51:13] TheRealNinjada: why haas, why? "Haas F1 Team Partners with OpenSea for Future NFT Collaborations"
[0:51:20] CorSPACE: its ok
[0:51:21] CoolReal: Pipez is pretty good
[0:51:22] Slowpoke101: pipez is decent
[0:51:23] McSauce: Pipez is nice
[0:51:26] bobolpwnz: Pipez is good for start
[0:51:28] icprincess: I couldnt get pipes to work with the auto hammers
[0:51:34] Dizz1227: yea pipez is good, need gold or diamond upgrade to filter though
[0:51:35] Slowpoke101: its a good entry item transport
[0:51:45] Slowpoke101: but you also have conveyors of course
[0:51:46] Akiron_rafa: pipes is good in the start yeah
[0:51:49] kylekersh: i would say use xnet but no string yet
[0:51:52] upgradecarton: its a good first gen logistics
[0:51:59] CoolReal: Diamond for filter, but that's not the problem, redstone is the only limiting factor early game
[0:52:12] Scopes64: could make a spider only spawner mob farm too
[0:52:29] Apparentthreat: pipez is good, but I'm kinda bored of it. integrated dynamics looks good. I couldn't figure out laserio and tutorials for it suck
[0:52:30] Akiron_rafa: conveyors would fit better in the theme
[0:52:32] Slowpoke101: redstone is pretty easy to get to. focus on 4 cobble gens and 10 auto hammers and your set
[0:52:35] lcePops: what tool is that?
[0:52:36] Hurtwolf: mc music is a vibe
[0:53:04] Slowpoke101: wait till you see the impact hammer
[0:53:06] Stormflare: stone hammer monkaHmm
[0:53:07] Slowpoke101: its stupid lol
[0:53:19] officialhunterx: impact hammes are sick
[0:53:21] Harmar: danHmm stone hammer or stone hammer
[0:53:37] DX_Plates: @Slowpoke101 Please tell me you need compressed air to use it or something
[0:53:44] Slowpoke101: nope
[0:53:56] kenshin2666: stone hammer and stonier hammer
[0:54:09] Slowpoke101: impact hammers were made by mikey who also helped with the direwolf mods, so stupid OP
[0:54:17] Slowpoke101: they should be repairable in an anvil?
[0:54:17] officialhunterx: its repairable in a anvil
[0:54:26] BossHog6295: Hi @Giantwaffle
[0:54:36] lcePops: anvils are hella expensive early on
[0:54:42] Apparentthreat: ok but should stone hammers even be repairable?
[0:54:50] Slowpoke101: they are pretty cheap to repair

[1:04:55] Slowpoke101: a little bias yes
[1:05:03] lcePops: huh it saves them on top, not replaces
[1:05:06] dennixfailalot: if i saw it correctly yesterday you can turn off the drippers (not sure tho)
[1:05:33] Addrax: any chance pg up and down changes the saved recipes?
[1:05:36] Jolle450: Imagine if you could switch between them.

[1:31:41] Apparentthreat: Juddo but yeah running games at 4k compared to 1440 may result in lower fps if you're not upgrading your graphics card at the same time, or if it's ultrawide you will just have the games in a smaller portion (windowed) and segment off the other parts of the screen.

[1:49:25] DX_Plates: EA
[1:49:36] Lightswordac12: I always had this conspiracy that riot took hytale so there wouldn't be a competitor for the League of legends MMO
[1:49:38] maccabeus: @Bombdog1244 it's a set date but basically none of the features will be available at that time
[1:49:41] birdoffire: can anyone tell me without any sarcasm is this modded or not ?
[1:49:47] Harmar: i have little trust it will come out just because of the team (atleast when they first announced)
[1:49:56] P3NGU1NSMACKER: glad they are doing that instead of all these delays
[1:49:59] Bombdog1244: interesting...

[1:51:53] Harmar: the original design of cube world was great, the rebuild destroyed it
[1:51:53] Roakie: Can you put a hopper on top of that to "automate" it?
[1:52:15] Apparentthreat: chutes are cheap

[2:17:26] TigerLuv: is*
[2:17:33] mrtraxx: i can't play Skyblock without building a base.
[2:17:36] Gh3ttoboy: i get bored of skyblock real quick because i like to see a pretty scenery
[2:17:53] Gh3ttoboy: and not just A VOID
[2:17:55] SlaskoCZ: 512 * 9 * 9 stacks
[2:18:07] Immow: do the pipes round robin?
[2:18:10] Apparentthreat: Gh3ttoboy gotta make a huge grass platform and put trees on the border, use some bonemeal too. NODDERS
[2:18:14] CanYouDigIt7: Does stoneblock have a surface?

[2:18:32] DX_Plates: @CanYouDigIt7 No
[2:18:33] maccabeus: above all the stone is a sea of lava, then sky
[2:18:34] Apparentthreat: CanYouDigIt7 technically yes but it's world height and can't build up there
[2:18:35] Obliviron: you need more in the front i think, not in the back
[2:18:47] Apparentthreat: DX_Plates oh. is my statement accurate?
[2:18:55] Nincy1986: go vertical and make the chain shorter and shorter
[2:19:00] TheIrishGuy: well you need more sand at the moment
[2:19:07] SlaskoCZ: do it without pipes directly touching with 10 auto hammers
[2:19:09] TheIrishGuy: or dust
[2:19:11] Caaked: you wont need to use pipez they will connect without#
[2:19:14] Shantrix: can you put a chest on top of the pipe and split it
[2:19:27] CanYouDigIt7: @DX_Plates @Apparentthreat Dang, it'd be cool if there was a layer of some blocks you need end-game tech to break thru, then your reward is access to the normal surface
[2:19:31] DX_Plates: Well I mean sure there is a "surface" but there is nothing up there and it isn't really accessible. There is no Overworld though.
[2:19:53] Nincy1986: yeah but  then you are limiting the throughput
[2:19:53] Gh3ttoboy: @iamlilcake he knows but the problem is it pulls the normal cobble not the 1x compressed
[2:19:59] Purecrew: im having a real bad time trying to get rune pl8 and kite shield in melvor right now lol
[2:20:10] SlaskoCZ: there are ores like 800 block from spawn

[2:21:43] 1willys1: Any specific reason to why youre building below the surface?
[2:21:51] PimentoLord: turn gravel pipe back on ? @Giantwaffle
[2:21:53] gtluszcz: @Giantwaffle don't go vertical since it will be harder to attach pipes to move items to storage
[2:21:55] Venxuri: fnatic
[2:21:56] david_boonty: imperial
[2:21:59] DX_Plates: @1willys1 LuL Look up Stoneblock

[2:28:42] Surge43: You need bigger feeder cables to handle it
[2:28:43] Harmar: only limitation is your provider
[2:28:45] dylan0806: Depends on the grid
[2:28:46] Zapper_777: 16A is max, before you need a new breaker box
[2:28:48] Gknock: Germany has 230v 16a so over 3500 watts

[2:29:25] Rocket970: Do you have backup power for your pcs?
[2:29:25] el_augusto: you need the infrastructure to have more amps, cables, posts, etc
[2:29:36] Harmar: most ive seen in a "normal" house was 300 amps, 100 amps for house, and 200 for a workshop/garage
[2:29:36] b0tmau: WICKED
[2:29:46] Argentwingss: Hey @Giantwaffle , just coming out of lurk to say that i'm adopting a great dane/saint bernhard and i thought you'd appreciate the information

[2:29:54] voopsy_poopsy: how big is that engine?
[2:30:02] SlaskoCZ: you need 9 cobble gens to keep up i think
[2:30:03] DX_Plates: *cough* 3 more cobble gens...
[2:30:04] TheNobody005: do another cobbel gen with pipes?
[2:30:07] sytar023: total for a house @Obliviron

[2:31:00] Beufff: first time i saw it. i thought it was a werewolf
[2:31:06] Salerodis: wuut. I have never seen big Samoyed. Ours isn't even that big. The best description of Samoyeds is, "I enjoy the peace and quiet but I am going to scream anyways"
[2:31:08] Argentwingss: A dog's behaviour depends on the owner
[2:31:09] then0ld: It's a medium-sized dog standard

[2:31:53] Dizz1227: maybe just make a chain for each individual resource?
[2:32:03] Ghoostie: how long have you been playing this MC mod?
[2:32:04] jackyboii: I know a family that had 4 leonberger dogs and they're big and fluffy
[2:32:16] Nincy1986: through put will be fukt
[2:32:27] CoolReal: Currently trying to figure out infinite lava loop
[2:32:29] W84M3: the math checks out
[2:32:32] ninopanda: do you have 3 block & 5 ingots of gold? you can then upgrade to Tier 4 cobble gen
[2:32:39] Ponzotron: hammers and cobble gen would need to be upgraded
[2:32:54] wontruefree: you can put 1 above and 1 below
[2:32:58] zynithtv: only 1 imput on hammers i thought
[2:32:58] Dizz1227: hammers are cheap to upgrade
[2:32:59] lazyhot: jeah think so
[2:33:04] SlaskoCZ: its so complicated for simple system
[2:33:23] JoxerTheM1ghty: Chickens are super op on this pack
[2:33:23] Royal_TRC: its also not that complicated
[2:33:28] Snah__: do et

[2:33:42] ok_juju: SUBprise
[2:33:43] Zapper_777: Auto the dust...
[2:33:52] lazyhot: Think that design should work, and then just boost your cobble input ...
[2:34:29] ilaj_vynneve: can you auto wash with the depot?
[2:34:31] Hellyy: that dust chest is going to fill up pretty fast
[2:34:43] xavier2119: i think you should make another fan setup for washing for now
[2:34:49] CoolReal: Can't compress dust
[2:34:53] SlaskoCZ: dust cant be compressed
[2:34:58] xavier2119: oh nice lol
[2:35:25] lorddud: how do you get belts?

[2:36:28] Osterr999: thanks bois
[2:36:57] Jaydepps00: have you decided on ae2 or the other one? @Giantwaffle
[2:37:17] Dizz1227: So is the goal with stacking to make gravel 4 times as fast, dirt 3x as fast and so on?
[2:37:19] Tuvy_007: What's Stoneblock about?
[2:37:31] Jaydepps00: @Tuvy_007 stone :)
[2:37:36] Kaijooie: We have the diamond cobble gen from the rewards chest :)
[2:38:00] Tuvy_007: @Jaydepps00 you are a comedian
[2:38:03] TheIrishGuy: if you have gold you can make tier 4
[2:38:19] TheIrishGuy: cobble gen
[2:38:19] DX_Plates: Cob gen
[2:39:03] xavier2119: holy shit I went to piss and you basically finished it lol damn
[2:39:04] Dumpified: bUrself wtf bro
[2:39:13] Jaydepps00: @Tuvy_007 ty ;) but for real, you can choose different spawns, the one waffle is on rn is the original start, your whole world is stone and beyond is nether and then end, goal is practically whatever you make it to be
[2:39:15] Joshuapetch: wassup
[2:39:23] MagnesiumOxide: Did you need to set to round robin still or did I miss that bit?
[2:39:37] ninopanda: @Joshuapetch hey buddy
[2:39:38] Jaydepps00: o/ @Joshuapetch
[2:39:39] Kaijooie: We have the diamond cobble gen from the rewards chest Kappa
[2:39:51] Joshuapetch: @ninopanda hey cutie, hows you?
[2:39:56] Joshuapetch: @Jaydepps00 waffleHOMIE
[2:40:04] Dizz1227: round robbin on the pipes?
[2:40:11] W84M3: just have all gens output to a drawer and then outuput to the system
[2:40:17] SlaskoCZ: just extract limit
[2:40:17] TheGeekPeek: the hammer runs out of durability mid break so it doesnt finish
[2:40:20] ninopanda: @Joshuapetch i am doing ok for the most part. been sucked into making the dnd campaign for the kkona crew
[2:40:39] Protonmat: having fun then
[2:40:45] floro9: stonecutter ???
[2:40:46] natsu130: why is Robin round?
[2:40:49] Joshuapetch: @ninopanda just seen, I gotta mute that channel real fast KEKW
[2:40:59] kylexy3: waffles favorite block, stone bricks
[2:41:06] ninopanda: KEKW or just join into the fun @Joshuapetch
[2:41:11] b0tmau: who is round robin?
[2:41:12] SARGEANTBONES: Waffle, there’s a mobile factory game called Builderment, you would love it
[2:41:14] Joshuapetch: @ninopanda haHAA no
[2:41:18] weightmaker: below outputs at max speed. pipes needs a lot of speed upgrades
[2:41:27] Obliviron: round robin is when the processing is staggered to use the most available processor
[2:41:44] CoolReal: The upgrades increase throughput
[2:41:44] Moobot: Come join the Waffle House Discord! <# https://discord.gg/fhGFtMuzdS
[2:41:51] SlaskoCZ: upgrade increases extraction speed
[2:41:57] DX_Plates: @Joshuapetch Josh can't imagine... LUL
[2:42:00] konflict0721: should look into laserIO not sure how expensive it might be but may be easier?
[2:42:12] weightmaker: it produces faster than pipe can output. putting it below will make it push whatever it produces up to the inventory above
[2:42:19] xavier2119: @konflict0721 laser io is great but it is very expensive :(
[2:42:19] CoolReal: Advanced does 128 items per sec
[2:42:19] maca134: more cobble gens more pipes more upgrades
[2:42:24] dylan0806: Isn’t the pipe 4 items per tick
[2:42:24] Joshuapetch: @DX_Plates I'm too drunk on weekends to play fuckin DnD OMEGALUL
[2:42:27] ninopanda: @DX_Plates Im excited for the tts game play tho.
[2:42:34] Immow: feed each machine per cobble gen at the start instead of round robin
[2:42:39] DbblD: Hey waffle when was the last time you cheked out your sub server?
[2:42:41] SlaskoCZ: basic extraction speed is 4items/20tick if i remember correctly
[2:42:44] konflict0721: @xavier2119 im assuming recipes got changed for this pack?
[2:43:09] CoolReal: Advanced is 32/5
[2:43:15] xavier2119: @konflict0721 I haven't got that far. but they don't need to be changed, laserio isn't meant for challenge packs like this though
[2:43:19] imNoxel: each cobble gen will have it's own extract, so it's fine, right?
[2:43:24] Meat_Skirts: This sounds like the outer worlds music
[2:43:27] Burshaz: the waila/REI shows the transfer spped
[2:43:42] MasterKraft: oh man i miss sorting in non modded minecraft.  They really need to ad that
[2:43:43] kane1941: Can you make iron tool station yet?
[2:43:50] konflict0721: @xavier2119 yeah i guess your right
[2:44:00] Surge43: 4 items 20 ticks it says on the pipe
[2:44:02] SlaskoCZ: there is no throughput limit
[2:44:06] MagnesiumOxide: When you hovered over the pipe, it showed it's extraction rate
[2:44:34] KingMidasNV: basic pipe is 4 items per tick. netherite upgrade is 64 per tick
[2:45:00] Tubberson: Is this song vanilla? I don't remember it
[2:45:06] baconburgerfries: dayoSPIN
[2:45:07] Chernobyl26: There an upcoming game list?
[2:45:10] KingMidasNV: dont have to shift hover
[2:45:29] DX_Plates: @Chernobyl26 Yes, but it is set in water...
[2:45:36] Purecrew: I think I would need auto eat 2 to afk rune knights lol
[2:45:42] CanYouDigIt7: Random Q: motherboard and GPU support PCIe 4.0, cpu is only PCIe 3.0, how much performance gain would i get with a pcie 4.0 cpu?
[2:45:48] baconburgerfries: rbeeSad
[2:46:08] Chernobyl26: @DX_Plates sounds moist
[2:46:14] CommanderUrsus: not from washing though
[2:46:20] Tamerlain: @canyoudigit7 depends on games but like 1-3%
[2:46:24] KingMidasNV: basic pipe upgrade is 8 items per tick.
[2:46:40] SlaskoCZ: i think you need 90 cobble/s to keep up with 4 auto hammers
[2:46:49] KingMidasNV: aye, i knowyou dont. just fyi
[2:47:13] DX_Plates: LuL There isn't a command or anything, he keeps a text document open in the background and occasionally brings it up. This pack will probably eat up some unexpected time though.
[2:47:14] Spikey770: is the middle gen working?
[2:47:16] cmmeth: MOAR PogChamp
[2:47:23] CoolReal: Quest book says the rates
[2:47:30] rubenco: @CanYouDigIt7 pcie has twice as much bandwidth, so depends if that is a bottleneck for you system
[2:47:34] Spikey770: I just don't see anything popping up
[2:47:46] Snah__: is it imputting it to the one above?
[2:47:48] xavier2119: they auto output to the top, you think that is messing with it?
[2:47:52] rubenco: pcie 4.0*
[2:48:04] CoolReal: It's overkill, 4 golds is enough
[2:48:04] Foooks: pipe only does 4 per sec right?
[2:48:20] ninopanda: @Joshuapetch i need 3 different numbers from you, a number from 1000 - 2000, a number 9 - 14, a number from 350 - 400
[2:48:47] Kintano392: You are at the maximum throughput of the pipe right now, right?
[2:48:49] maca134: just make another cobble gen + drawer for your own use
[2:48:53] DX_Plates: If that toggles off of redstone, you could probably use the lever there?
[2:48:53] Moobot: New here? Welcome! You can usually catch Waffle Mon-Sat at ~1400 UTC. Feel free to hang out in chat before the stream and/or join the !discord. waffleEgg
[2:49:03] CommanderUrsus: have to grind it
[2:49:08] Kintano392: 1 tier 3 and 2 tier 2 = 4/s
[2:49:16] haguex: just do abother drawer above each auto hammer and split the input 50:50
[2:49:17] trabadam: @CanYouDigIt7 gamers nexus did a video about it 2 days ago . tldr you don't lose much
[2:49:19] Dizz1227: Once you get into laser IO you can control the amount of items that get transferred per tick
[2:49:20] Salerodis: it feels like using the mill on gravel gives more iron
[2:49:51] SlaskoCZ: @Salerodis it does
[2:49:51] Moobot: You can find Waffle's Youtube channel here - https://youtube.com/giantwaffle
[2:49:57] xavier2119: i think its raw iron is the name
[2:49:58] CommanderUrsus: mill or grinding wheels

[5:26:37] ninopanda: @Tech actually not that easy to do with this pack
[5:26:42] Apparentthreat: Tech we don't want another screaming contest
[5:26:49] KanickKanack: yea ftb app is owned by overwolf
[5:26:52] Dead_Thinker: But FTB ap uses overwolf
[5:26:55] OishiisDelicious: you can do it with overwolf
[5:26:56] rentable_smile: ftb app is from overwolf @Giantwaffle
[5:26:57] WalrusPug: ftb app is based on overwolf

[5:27:03] Grimstar_: why does it matter?
[5:27:03] Tech: Just different names
[5:27:03] Apparentthreat: it's not curseforge

[5:27:06] xevos221: FTb App runs Overwolf in then background
[5:27:09] pipkin111: Did he have to go to the Nether to get quartz
[5:27:11] P05erThe: ETA to progress to lategame in this modpack?
[5:27:12] SanctumSkyfall: overwolf has to be launched

[5:27:16] SanctumSkyfall: to even have ftb up
[5:27:17] thebodge: what's the difference?
[5:27:18] Viduxx: FTB is in overwolf

[5:27:19] Apparentthreat: you almost rarely open actual overwolf... unless you do
[5:27:22] prairydog: ohhh
[5:27:24] Tech: FTB App is a cut down version of CurseForge App

[5:27:41] FinnYellowbelly: naaap.  gdlauncher works fine, it just cuts the FTB team out of ad revenue
[5:27:41] BoulderInDisguise: Or use ATLaucher
[5:27:42] Sir_Robbe_: it needs it
[5:27:45] Harmar: ftb app automaticly downloads overwolf and runs through it

[5:28:02] FlammAlpha: PolyMC is a fork of MultiMC and it works
[5:28:03] ryanforresterdev: imagine using a launcher KEKW
[5:28:04] Tech: GDLauncher should work, but only for mods that allow third party downloads
[5:28:05] officialhunterx: dont you need the overwolf app to get ftb app
[5:28:11] Apparentthreat: at least it's not the twitch app OMEGALUL
[5:28:17] Viduxx: Stoneblock 3 is not out yet
[5:28:19] FinnYellowbelly: overwolf is spyware, if they want my ad money, they need to dump that bullshit
[5:28:21] torontomario: Stoneblock 3 is on ftb launcher
[5:28:22] KanickKanack: waffle the mob masher lets light through, should put a light behind it

[5:29:50] SndR__: yes!
[5:29:52] Tamerlain: we need power first
