[3:47:40] MartinSable3235: @Azure18 Yup, most people here just know how to drive in the snow. (Most being a key word there) There are still plenty of people that panic here. I would say our snow plowers are also much more practiced than in the south
[3:47:40] BornNaked2: @JonBams That "Beekeeper" movie is with Jason Statham, and from what I saw its probably an action movie, with a story :)
