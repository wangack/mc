[1:09:16] SnoStorm: Granted the booster still has to be tested multiple times for Feb 28th isn't that much of an issue

[1:10:02] XxTeam48LowesXx: Mad*
[1:10:07] g1tsch: starlink almost took down chinese space station
[1:10:09] iivu1canii: is the starship just meant to hold more people ?
[1:10:09] CorSPACE: the delay is due to the amount of comments they got
[1:10:10] 7603: @Allmostdone Yeah ill have calc 1-3 that I have to have completed to graduate plus 1 other math class and I think 2 physics classes?  not entirely sure
[1:10:13] tripwires: long story short the issue is politics?
[1:10:13] blaksmil: oh ok
[1:10:16] Kaomie: China complained to ONU about Starlink
[1:10:16] g1tsch: they had to evade two times
[1:10:30] Kaomie: Because Starlink is threatening the CHinese Space Station
[1:10:34] MDrot: Yeah a satellite all most nailed it
[1:10:38] Fressure: sounds like a china issue lol
[1:10:40] SnoStorm: China is just paying politics. Starlink would allow internet without government control
[1:10:43] Allmostdone: @7603 It’s changed a lot from my time
[1:10:47] Krabas: starlink went down
[1:10:55] XxTeam48LowesXx: Sounds like China should of parked somewhere else
[1:10:55] Moobot: You can find Waffle's Youtube channel here - https://youtube.com/giantwaffle
[1:10:58] g1tsch: looked to me like some starlink went rogue but i dont know
[1:10:59] Kaomie: Probably
[1:11:00] kkisame2: why is starlink the same hight as the chinise spase station
[1:11:09] CaptainChipDaniels: captainchipdaniels subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 14 months! 
[1:11:14] Allmostdone: Maybe China is reporting everything
[1:11:14] Kaomie: But still I think the US kinda overstepped their authority
[1:11:16] Utael: @SnoStorm Its not politics SpaceX went out of their orbit and was on a collision course with the space station
[1:11:21] TheWonderLlama: and lets all pretend china wasn't testing space weapons creating more debris than starlink ever could...
[1:11:26] GFQPR1882: ello @Giantwaffle  n chat waffleLove
[1:11:26] daZonk: That is fake news. Yes China had to look to evade starlink, just like everything has to do at some point. But yeah the majority of that complaint to China is politics.
[1:11:27] Kaomie: Space does not belong to the US let alone to a private company
[1:11:34] 50shadesofpenguins: China details two instances on July 1st, 2020 and on October 21st, 2021 when the nation had to maneuver the core module of its space station, called Tianhe, out of the way of two separate Starlink satellites
[1:11:46] DraconicRahl: @Kaomie Weird take
[1:11:51] iivu1canii: i wont be suprised if aerospace engineering gets a million+ salary in the next 5 years or even £500,000
[1:11:51] CanadianLuke: someone forgot to carry the 1
[1:11:57] weekendflyer: Starlink satellites typically orbit at around 550 kilometers above the surface of the Earth, but the pair had lowered their altitudes, apparently as part of active deorbiting maneuvers at the end of the satellites’ life
[1:12:04] Kaomie: "But the FAA approved it" Okay but
[1:12:07] Allmostdone: Space belongs to the queen. Everyone knows this
[1:12:15] CorSPACE: couldve been a dod thing, spacex has been doing testing with them and starlink, also starlink uses the spaceforce database for collision avoidance and you bet that the station is in that
[1:12:18] duckboy200932: hello
[1:12:27] AbsurdddRS: The thought of a space station "Made in China".........
[1:12:40] MarquesCoding: @Giantwaffle can you put 'marquescam' in spectator?
[1:13:07] breakingn8: I'll only care what the Chinese government complains about once they stop oppressing the Uighur population and throwing them into camps.
[1:13:09] MarquesCoding: thx
[1:13:14] vXJ3SU5Xv: i thought all had to be at different heights?
[1:13:32] DraconicRahl: This sounds sus.. Where was this reported?

[1:16:48] MaxWeeman: it should not bc, every action has an equal and oposite reqaction
[1:16:50] subfin: then how do reaction wheels work?
[1:16:52] CorSPACE: orientation yes but nothing yes
[1:16:55] Immow: there is a way
[1:16:59] Tensei_c: look at cats in 0 gravity
[1:17:01] NeoMortis: yes you would be rotated, but wouldn't spin
[1:17:01] SheepsAholy: you could hit yourself
[1:17:03] aman36000: It isnt as ewasy as in shows
[1:17:04] seatea07: there is no air, the air resistance is what rotates you
[1:17:05] Kaomie: The overall momemtum
[1:17:05] RodriCraft93: you move your hand against what? theirs no air
[1:17:10] Koeckie: there is a video on youtube @Giantwaffle they tried it out

[1:17:29] Bobersale: reaction wheels or RCS
[1:17:36] Allmostdone: Don’t they start with a little motion?
[1:17:40] Obsidian_Vanir: no actions you do would affect it, equal and opposite nothing to react against
[1:17:42] onbc: you have to youtube this now
[1:17:43] nicnoz: there has to be an external force
[1:17:48] Noah_591: I think an astronaut did a video on movement on the iss
[1:17:50] waffleslapps: there is a YouTube video about an astronaut in the middle of the iss who is "stuck" in the middle and can't get anywhere
[1:17:50] NeoMortis: starting to swing your arm starts you rotating, but when you stop swinging your arm that will counter it so you stop swinging
[1:17:50] Kaomie: RCS is completely different
[1:17:52] RadCoolGuy400: waffleGun

[1:18:16] Tensei_c: look at cats in 0 gravity @Giantwaffle

[1:19:07] Obsidian_Vanir: He has air/atmosphere he's reacting against
[1:19:08] borschig: yeah but it's INSIDE
[1:19:08] JKMGR33N: but the flailing of the arms doesnt rotate you
[1:19:10] nalp777: Because there is air in the spaceship.
[1:19:10] Shantrix: but he has AIR with him
[1:19:11] borschig: not in vacuum

[1:19:25] sam8825: it is
[1:19:26] borschig: yes
[1:19:26] RhinoWrEcKs: @Giantwaffle you would need to be spinning already for angular momentum to transfer
[1:19:26] nicnoz: oo its just the same as a cat rotating in its air to land on its feet
[1:19:27] SheepsAholy: its momentum not air
[1:19:27] Christian1298: yeah
[1:19:30] DrGimpfeN: its because the air resistance
[1:19:31] mooaben: yes the air
[1:19:32] CorSPACE: bro, reaction wheels....
[1:19:32] NiIIaes: he's pushing against the air
[1:19:34] borschig: in space you can't
[1:19:34] GaQu: its not because of air its because of inertia
[1:19:37] wondox: no air in space
[1:19:37] KritterIsBack: the side turn couldn't be just air resistance
[1:19:38] kachinga404: rewind?
[1:19:39] sjefm: It's not the air
[1:19:40] knowledge_within: if the air was causing it, he could "swim"
[1:19:40] C0ldPlasma: way too much movement for it to be the aier
[1:19:42] C0ldPlasma: air
[1:19:42] dan_will91: also his center point doesnt change
[1:19:43] Obsidian_Vanir: He's pushing against air
[1:19:43] nicnoz: if you watch a video of a cat falling and rotating in slow motion i think its the same thing
[1:19:43] HelvetianHobbit: he could rotate without air
[1:19:44] kommendorfindus: the air has far too little resistance to make him spin like that
[1:19:46] DeMayon: its torque
[1:19:48] Kaomie: chat is so ignorant right now
[1:19:49] Allmostdone: Will outside you are hitting rather
[1:19:50] philip0524: There is no air in space? Kappa
[1:19:50] Foodprint: There's not enough air resistance, otherwise he'd be moving and not just rotating. The rotationg is purely momentum.
[1:19:50] HeyAFrozenZebra: moment of inertia
[1:19:52] mephisto__ttv: without air you d be stuck
[1:19:52] aledantee: its not air you fucking pepegas
[1:19:53] ShinyBadger: littery a a swimming pool just diffrent dinsity
[1:19:54] iivu1canii: If the water inside of you was say in a bathtub water the water inside help rotate ?
[1:19:54] CorSPACE: its called moment of inertia
[1:19:59] metalwrath22222: can you swim in lava
[1:20:05] ZyrnUwU: It's like how gyros self right themselves
[1:20:05] Kavokane: Space engineers -> Gyroscopes
[1:20:07] joshfee: Reaction wheels
[1:20:08] Cyberwire69: he can rotate but not get to a wall
[1:20:08] Krabas: after complete analysis of what have been said i think its about 50% waffle is right
[1:20:08] ChalkLicker: Not the air, it’s the torque that changes as you move your arms closer and further from the body
[1:20:09] mephisto__ttv: explain how Giantwaffle
[1:20:13] brewerdc: It absolutely workes without air
[1:20:15] TheDancu: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cRb0xvPJ2M&ab_channel=utexascnsquest
[1:20:15] ShemWhistler: Don't planets rotate in a vacuum?
[1:20:16] Panda_Blade_: reaction wheels similar right?
[1:20:17] Utael: metalwrath22222 if you could survive the heat then yes
[1:20:18] g1tsch: ask scott on twitter
[1:20:18] theKixter: basically like in water but much less dense environment, so the movements are very small
[1:20:22] TheWonderLlama: Angular momentum
[1:20:23] Kaomie: Waffle is right from the start
[1:20:24] Jamswhat2: how? Susge
[1:20:25] ReySteaL: and on the iss you arent at zero Gs right ?
[1:20:27] CorSPACE: spooky action La[[a
[1:20:27] DrGimpfeN: imagine beeing stuck in an spacestation KEKW
[1:20:28] kommendorfindus: "without air he'd be stuck" by that logic thrusters should not work in a vaccum
[1:20:29] CorSPACE: Kappa
[1:20:30] Kaomie: (cannot believe I am saying that)
[1:20:31] aman36000: @Giantwaffle Conservation of angular momentum only works if you have angular momentum to conserve
[1:20:35] RhinoWrEcKs: yeah but its force already spinning
[1:20:39] Slymph: @Kaomie KEKW
[1:20:40] RhinoWrEcKs: not starting from stop
[1:20:44] wardux1: your center of mass stays in the same spot
[1:20:45] Shroadie: Then why do they latch to the space station? Wouldn’t they be able to “swim” back
[1:20:45] kylexy3: Bridge is looking thiccc
[1:20:45] AnesthesiaFC: like the bike tire on a spinning chair, yes

[1:20:50] ericnivek: @Giantwaffle some early rockets/satalites used extended long booms to stop/slow rotation
[1:20:51] Utael: @Giantwaffle that wouldnt because there isn't enough kinetic energy stored
[1:21:01] NeoMortis: accelerating your arm, will accelerate body in the opposite direction, but then you decellerate your arm it will decelerate your body, attitude change
[1:21:01] vXJ3SU5Xv: need to already be moving
[1:21:01] Kaomie: I am closing chat
[1:21:04] Slymph: susHmm
[1:21:04] nicnoz: are we allowed to post links? theres a video of smarter every day explaining this with cats

[1:21:09] brewerdc: KEKW
[1:21:12] D_Roxxxx: Kaomie ikr
[1:21:13] Pl9bob: i found the video with the symmetric thingy that turns in space
[1:21:15] BewitchingHex: This conversation is too smart for me
[1:21:17] Christian1298: you stopping would counteract the starting, wouldnt it?
[1:21:18] MarquesCoding: @Kaomie chat 2 head
[1:21:18] Mitchellmay: So you are only asking if you can twist. Not move
[1:21:19] GFQPR1882: @Kaomie waffleLove SeemsGood LUL
[1:21:19] mephisto__ttv: Giantwaffle only if you can accelerate yourself

[1:21:24] CorSPACE: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Js5x4NhUxU scott manley time
[1:21:25] MayhemMooseS97: you're thinking about moving in gravity too much. A lot of that doesnt apply in a vacuum
[1:21:25] brewerdc: We have to get to the bottom of this wizardry
[1:21:26] Kaines: i wish i could undestand that :D
[1:21:26] TheWonderLlama: Except you dont have to slow down in the exact same path as you moved it....
[1:21:40] isockSillies: thrusters to compensate
[1:21:41] Kaomie: Which is correct
[1:21:44] 7603: if the angular momentum is incredibly small the small amount of molecules in space should provide some resistance/friction, now its incredibly low friction but it is there
[1:21:45] Fressure: my smooth brain cant keep up with this convo lol
[1:21:46] Bobersale: all the astronauts move to the other side while they let panels out. lol
[1:21:47] Dagmoo: yeah have scott manley explain it for us NODDERS
[1:21:47] GFQPR1882: they must have tried this in space before tho no ?
[1:21:48] DrGimpfeN: normal ppl argueing in an 5Head conversation KEKW

[1:21:59] nalp777: Only one thing to do. Test it in KSP
[1:22:00] theKixter: is it symmetrical? maybe it balances itself?
[1:22:03] jimmy_vaughn: are we talking about minecraft?
[1:22:05] ryanforresterdev: what if we use 100% of our brain though
[1:22:05] Kaomie: lolz
[1:22:06] NiIIaes: you can rotate but you can't start spinning @giantwaffle
[1:22:07] ontoppofit: The astronaut can move their arms and legs and head independently of the center of mass of the body. If the astronaut swings their leg, their leg has angular momentum. To comply with conservation of momentum, the rest of their attached body has the opposite angular momentum and thus rotates
[1:22:14] Christian1298: on webb? they do have thrusters to "unload" the gyros @Giantwaffle
[1:22:16] NarwhalArgy: @Giantwaffle The body isn't a rigrd, The astronaut can move their arms and legs and head independently of the center of mass of the body. If the astronaut swings their leg, their leg has angular momentum.
[1:22:16] Lupic: KEKW

[1:22:19] CorSPACE: sure.... galacticcraft Kappa
[1:22:31] D_Roxxxx: Chat is confused between their opinions and facts LUL
[1:22:37] randyf69: Eventually the reaction wheels are moving too fast, so they need to slow them down, and they do that with the reaction thrusters.
[1:22:45] TheDancu: cross product
[1:22:51] ryanforresterdev: "ignore the thing causing the rotation" KEKW
[1:22:52] brewerdc: Yes it is
[1:22:54] Pl9bob: Dancing T-handle in zero-g, HD         this also shows things can turn in space

[1:23:17] kachinga404: you'll be trippingg
[1:23:17] philip0524: NASA should invest some money in better cams
[1:23:23] Kaomie: Farting is completely different it's like RCS, you are losing mass
[1:23:24] nicnoz: would going to the bathroom in zero g move you then?
[1:23:26] wardux1: his center of mass cannot move
[1:23:27] kommendorfindus: that's one of the reasons why the ISS is so tight. the Gemini capsules were larger but astronauts would get stuck
[1:23:29] Jamswhat2: @philip0524 drue LULW
[1:23:31] Svegoul: grapple hooks should be useful there
[1:23:35] brewerdc: Yep

[1:25:11] TheLaj: You can still move by using angular momentum by swinging your hands and feet. There is a video on youtube
[1:25:12] JKMGR33N: I'm just a guy, not a physics expert
[1:25:13] philip0524: If you're stuck in space just enter spectator mode
[1:25:17] script_terror: ironman it
[1:25:21] Obsidian_Vanir: The concept of twisting your top to spin wouldn't work, your bottom would react equal and opposite
[1:25:24] 5ameold: rip your arm out and throw it?

[1:25:34] Skarpis: Just a guy, being a dude.
[1:25:37] Kaines: @Svegoul you wont be able to shoot, there is no air=no burning
[1:25:42] Obsidian_Vanir: Again, oxygen

[1:25:47] Obsidian_Vanir: and atmosphere
[1:25:48] Kuroiorb: go back in vod. he talked about it in the beginning of stream @eddyyzfpv
[1:25:50] kachinga404: basically like stuck in quicksand?

[3:09:03] LUCIFER_RA: @Giantwaffle i think the height of towers should be as high as the arch is and wall lower
[3:09:09] DeadeyeWolff: build the walk one block above the arch of the main gate to walk across to the other side
[3:09:10] Speedglass: dont bogart the blocks man
[3:09:30] M1k3D3l7a: maybe draw it it paint?

[3:10:22] Drujica: @Giantwaffle maybe double doors like on Counter Strike doors in Dust 2 maps
[3:10:23] daemonaedryn: Trevors is good but it feels really intimidating, this one feels more of a medieval castle feel
[3:10:25] warlock_1984: first pylon on mid of mountin
[3:10:51] Cherokee__Chief: how many blocks tall is the gate wall?
[3:10:55] HammerssC: his seems like a giant cave or abandoned structure
[3:11:00] Speedglass: i watched a show on disney+ about the red sea rift valley fascinating

[3:11:33] KadMan04: use stairs for sure

[3:11:40] Jayouz: Make it taller!
[3:11:43] Speedglass: LUL
[3:11:45] nxusr: yeah stairs would do
[3:11:48] Gusschou98: you should make it 10 wide so that the scale fits the build... :-) @Giantwaffle
[3:11:55] Notikk: KEKW

[3:12:10] daemonaedryn: @NothingEverLoss interesting monkaHmm so a monster city?
[3:12:16] lvyEartman: why would you light up the wall?
[3:12:35] Drazer_: -the trap doors or have the trap doors recessed
[3:12:35] Moobot: You can find Waffle's Youtube channel here - https://youtube.com/giantwaffle
[3:12:41] RodriCraft93: give it more light

[3:15:00] RodriCraft93: is the city gonna be more white with wood? if not, ill start getting grey and black concreet
[3:15:14] Surge43: what about iron fence?

[3:15:23] Deepcast: can do the cross in white
[3:15:28] then0ld: Yeah, what about iron?
[3:15:28] Beufff: what about that new white block that spawns in geodes?
[3:15:38] Speedglass: buttressing looks cool but the design needs to be repeated to get the full effect
[3:15:40] fishphlem: obsidian
[3:15:46] daemonaedryn: If your still going by the photo from LoTR inspiration, a white wall would fit
[3:16:17] Purdymouf: minas tirith?

[4:47:28] theknightpaco: light up the inside
[4:47:36] TarmonSeikkailu: It's a big build anyways, might as well take the few extra steps to make it perfect
[4:47:37] razgrizGG: spruce would like so good
[4:48:06] Venamah: oak slabs set on the bottom of the stripped logs will ade more depth
[4:48:07] tommyfod: there is a stone wall block which might be good
[4:48:11] Ardrago: make it 1 block higher
[4:48:20] Mick_: your last wall segment looks to be one block shorter than the rest

[4:48:24] totally4us: Why don’t you do block then stair or ontop then just stair?
[4:49:02] L707644: Widen the wall by 1 block for like 3 blocks up and then put roof overhanging by 1 slab?

[6:05:17] ZyianDev: I don't think there's a check for that
[6:05:20] KritterIsBack: it probably just checks radius, not if you have LOS @Giantwaffle
[6:05:20] TheBobtheDoctor: it makes u be in range to place
[6:05:21] AshhanX: I don't think it works if it's not also installed on the server
[6:05:21] JoniSusi: blus blinted? 👽
[6:05:25] fahrenheit462: It’s just code I guess
[6:05:26] Kevincav: May not be checking it
[6:05:30] lange__: I guess the server hust checks if the block location is within reach and then just places the block
[6:05:30] AlexTroy20: saving time! no cheating!
[6:05:33] officialzip: Yeah you move around to place them
[6:05:35] pure_fire: you have to select the right block to place them
[6:05:36] ravi981: he moves forward
[6:05:38] TheBobtheDoctor: it checks ur range and places
[6:05:44] LostEpoxy: doesn't creative mode have a slightly larger range of reach than survival?
[6:05:46] Kaomie: Don't tell chat, but the server still trust the MC client for block refresh, so you can literally inject blocks
[6:05:46] PandaZRE: hes in creative and you have more reach in creative mode
[6:05:47] mechoriet: minecraft has 0 to none anti cheat KEKW
[6:05:49] PxlSauce: litematica can also be used without this autoplacement, then it's just a nice help

[6:05:51] TheWanil: how do you make the blueprint though?
[6:05:57] ZwuenieBoyy: we have HANDS
[6:06:01] DanologyUK: DanologyUK subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 8 months! 
[6:06:03] Kevincav: There's a randomizer mod I saw sevadus use.  Where it would randomly place the blocks in your hotbar
[6:06:04] simplelucas: i used printer on servers and it depends on the anti cheat but some can tedect every block u look at others dont  really care where u place it and if u look at it
[6:06:06] fahrenheit462: Yeah for anti cheat, but if it doesn’t have anti cheat nothing happens to the player
[6:06:10] officialzip: @TheWanil You can download them or copy builds from creative
