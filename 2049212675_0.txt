[1:53:27] sidsn_: Well i guess at this level you will be switching armor so much that doesnt metter rerolling no ?
[1:53:58] vadskamanta: @soeperpoeper His most common response is "Build your following on other platforms than Twitch first, and then bring them to Twitch, because getting followers on Twitch is hard"
[1:54:14] cineeleo: Also at low level u change gear really fast
[1:54:20] soeperpoeper: @vadskamanta okay thank you so much!

[1:55:51] BigFlameWolf: @MikeChoq It's fixed based on a test. Not sure when gamba's being done.
[1:56:03] MixedSignal87: Pick
[1:56:22] sidsn_: Do you have specific build you going into or just winging it for now?
[1:56:26] MikeChoq: gotcha. I was just hoping he wasn't gonna lose this gear we just pogged about

[2:02:15] SlizeDK: You can compress the carbon and such by pressing Shift+K over them.
[2:02:22] shantypioneer: it is apply plunders pearl to crystal
[2:02:30] BigFlameWolf: Plunderer's Pearl lets you modify a crystal so that you don't gain EXP from the vault run.
[2:02:34] sneakypete55: i think in update 13 there are more dungeons

[2:21:42] Neverlie2u: @sidsn_ yea i'm way past that but that took even longer
[2:22:03] vadskamanta: At least we don't have cursed locked vaults anymore hbomb94LUL
[2:22:04] strandberggg: There was alot of obsidian @P3pp3rF1y
[2:22:06] P3pp3rF1y: oh, you were getting the extra modifiers?
[2:22:12] P3pp3rF1y: lol
[2:22:13] sidsn_: @neverlie2u i m level 60 still didnt find one Sadge
[2:22:13] BigFlameWolf: @P3pp3rF1y He entered a vault and it was Locked Collapsing.
[2:22:49] celinabena: "god they're so nimble!" PrideLaugh
[2:22:58] P3pp3rF1y: so for these cases I would say it's fair to use /the_vault debug vault_kick HBomb94
[2:23:13] celinabena: HACKERMANS hacking
[2:23:45] vadskamanta: hbomb94LUL
[2:23:55] pb_b: yes
[2:23:59] sidsn_: Assume  the consequences
[2:24:06] P3pp3rF1y: yeah just kicks you out of the vault as if you bailed, works with locked as well
[2:24:33] strandberggg: yes you didnt have the jewels quests? So I think its the wrong version
[2:25:26] Mera_212: Wait when’s vault hunter season 4 coming?
[2:25:29] sidsn_: Does anyone knows when the update 13 gonna be live ?
[2:25:54] cineeleo: @sidsn_ we hope this Sunday?

[2:27:47] Ryumizu: aye, that it was
[2:27:54] actual_supernova: wifi in mothers room is much better then mine
[2:28:01] BigFlameWolf: @cineeleo Pepper's also a dev, and they just said potentially today or tomorrow, so might be sooner than weekend, even.

[2:29:48] luke_sch02: Seren!! peepoHey
[2:29:51] strandberggg: Is there capacity left on the tool? Can add more mining speed if you find more jewels in these vaults
[2:30:06] BigFlameWolf: @strandberggg There's 2 capacity left, I believe.
[2:30:06] Ryumizu: that's a cool POI
[2:30:19] xerminator2k: I am trying to also do a HC skyvaults world but on Impossible vault difficulty
[2:30:22] strandberggg: @strandberggg Gonna be hard to add something then :)
[2:30:31] sidsn_: @strandberggg 2 capacity left
[2:30:37] cineeleo: @strandberggg just 2 left
[2:30:49] IcyVulpixie: +
[2:30:54] 64_Bit_Cake: 2? I'm a oerfectionist, always has to be 0 for me
[2:30:56] strandberggg: its not
[2:31:02] 64_Bit_Cake: *perfectionist
[2:31:06] BigFlameWolf: 10 is the minimum, so it's not.
[2:31:24] vadskamanta: OMEGALUL
[2:31:31] BigFlameWolf: To stop and get another double-pouch or two?
[2:31:37] cool_minion14: A word
[2:31:39] strandberggg: 1 point into dash Prayge
[2:31:40] cineeleo: A word? About what kekw
[2:31:44] vadskamanta: Hmm, is an emote a word monkaHmm
[2:31:44] B4n4n4zrgood: hey HBomb94 have you ever played this mod called Vault Hunters it’s very fun
[2:31:47] xerminator2k: W O R D
[2:31:48] BigFlameWolf: @strandberggg He doesn't like dahs.
[2:31:50] BigFlameWolf: *dash.
[2:31:54] P3pp3rF1y: I guess just testing that the fall damage is still off
[2:32:00] vadskamanta: @b4n4n4zrgood that sounds interesting, what's it about??
[2:32:06] SerenityUwU99: Word
[2:32:07] BigFlameWolf: @P3pp3rF1y Elven Air trinket.
[2:32:08] sidsn_: Something funny happened to me in the early levels i made super paxel with 60 mining speed only to ralise i had 9 capacity left and didnt add wooden affinity on it Smoge
[2:32:11] samwich1991: gaymer68YayVaultHunters
[2:32:15] B4n4n4zrgood: it’s about hunting vaults
[2:32:18] Ryumizu: IDK, don't think you'd like it H
[2:32:21] vadskamanta: GGs
[2:32:26] bas3j: Gg
[2:32:27] sidsn_: Gg
[2:32:28] Vex_Vx: GG
[2:32:32] 64_Bit_Cake: Gg
[2:32:33] strandberggg: they are adding vaulting to vanilla minecraft its joever
[2:32:34] BigFlameWolf: GG!
[2:32:42] cptcinnabunny: GG
[2:32:51] strandberggg: burger Pog
[2:32:51] KingPurpleMoon: GG!!
[2:33:18] sidsn_: Consider unlocking drawers ?
[2:33:18] Xarallon: also picking up more stuff too, the junk
[2:33:22] thereal4thewin: add filters to pouches?
[2:33:29] Streamlabs: Have you followed yet? If not, make sure you hit that follow button to get notified every time H starts streaming! It's very helpful to the channel and we really appreciate it! hbomb94Love
[2:33:42] strandberggg: Its not
[2:33:43] 64_Bit_Cake: @sidsn_ yeah this organisation is crazy... How tall is that stack?
[2:33:55] P3pp3rF1y: pouch with void upgrade
[2:33:58] jammanty: let the chest monster GROW!
[2:34:00] cineeleo: Soon we unlock giant chests
[2:34:03] strandberggg: Filters for your pouches is free
[2:34:04] P3pp3rF1y: set to overflow and filtered for the junk
[2:34:30] xerminator2k: @P3pp3rF1y There is more junk than the void upgrade allows
[2:34:33] maloki: saaame
[2:34:40] P3pp3rF1y: I know that it just works, trust me
[2:34:41] sidsn_: All hail the chest towers
[2:34:42] BigFlameWolf: It scares me to, so I probably won't ever use it with the backpack mod.
[2:34:49] cineeleo: He is gonna end like iskall voiding 6 7 trinkets
[2:34:50] 64_Bit_Cake: His storage is in alphabetical??
[2:34:50] Xarallon: Im more of an axe_5 kinda guy
[2:35:01] cptcinnabunny: personally I felt axe_3 was rather derivative
[2:35:01] Ryumizu: "it just works!" - Todd
[2:35:20] sidsn_: Ppppft axes who uses them anyway
[2:35:25] B4n4n4zrgood: I’m more of a axe_2 guy myself
[2:35:53] 64_Bit_Cake: I'm more of a douwsky's swousky guy
[2:36:01] sidsn_: I wouldnt reroll much the gear you will upgrade next vault anyway
[2:36:38] Ryumizu: why did you do this, now you have to choose
[2:36:46] 64_Bit_Cake: Check defense stat
[2:36:57] Mera_212: just check def stat
[2:36:59] vadskamanta: @sidsn_ H likes rolling gear, almost as much as he likes chests
[2:37:15] 64_Bit_Cake: They are same :p
[2:37:24] sidsn_: Fair enough
[2:37:46] 64_Bit_Cake: How does resistance even work? Is it a chance?
[2:37:54] sidsn_: No pickles D:
[2:38:05] tyto13alba: what makes you think he likes chests vads? there's nothing on his base that would give that away
[2:38:09] 64_Bit_Cake: @sidsn_ 40 more levels till that...
[2:38:43] vadskamanta: I'm getting flashbacks from season 2 Alba hbomb94LUL
[2:38:52] cineeleo: I think resistance just lowers dmg u get by that %
[2:38:54] cool_minion14: Quest
[2:38:59] kowbieee777: expertise maybe
[2:39:06] 64_Bit_Cake: @cineeleo oh that makes more sense
[2:39:09] tyto13alba: arrows are tough in skyvaults
[2:39:16] sidsn_: Fletcher ?
[2:39:19] Ziltion: villagers?
[2:39:23] strandberggg: ask ur fletchers for arrows :)
[2:39:26] tyto13alba: or mob farm
[2:39:39] cineeleo: @64_bit_cake yeah,  but I'm not sure
[2:39:45] cool_minion14: Pog
[2:40:26] 64_Bit_Cake: We're they always that cheap?
[2:40:39] cineeleo: This small island makes me nervous
[2:40:44] BigFlameWolf: @cineeleo It reduces incoming damage by that %, after other reductions (armor/enchantments).
[2:40:46] cool_minion14: Don't forget the door quest
[2:40:57] vadskamanta: pog peepoClap
[2:40:58] samwich1991: scav POGGIES
[2:40:58] Mera_212: why not have the orange in a bag?
[2:40:58] sidsn_: Pog
[2:41:06] samwich1991: pog POGGIES
[2:41:06] sidsn_: We got Pog Pog
[2:41:17] 64_Bit_Cake: PogChamp PogChamp
[2:41:23] Ryumizu: I like that
[2:41:44] cineeleo: @bigflamewolf ty, that's what I though.. iskall also said it's capped at 80%, am I right?
[2:42:17] sidsn_: @cineeleo not its not capped at 81
[2:42:28] sidsn_: 80%*
[2:42:29] BigFlameWolf: @cineeleo That's a vanilla cap, so probably?
[2:42:34] Ryumizu: @cineeleo vanilla enchants are
[2:42:49] kowbieee777: i think it's capped at 50
[2:42:51] P3pp3rF1y: advanced refill has the extra settings
[2:43:04] 64_Bit_Cake: 80% sounds a little too strong to me
[2:43:07] Neverlie2u: you have to have cobble in that pouch
[2:43:17] P3pp3rF1y: basic refills anywhere in the inventory
[2:43:47] cineeleo: Or the defense stat it's capped at 80%? I really remember something about this number and armor =)))
[2:43:59] BigFlameWolf: @cineeleo In vanilla, both are 80%.
[2:44:10] ChaoticDinacesaur: I think block chance is capped at 80
[2:44:16] kowbieee777: @cineeleo cooldown reduction is capped at 80% maybe it's that
[2:44:21] 64_Bit_Cake: I always name my pouches is that wierd?
[2:44:44] sidsn_: Pretty sure 80% is too much
[2:45:20] sidsn_: Dye them
[2:45:23] cineeleo: So u can get 100% defence stat? With like legendary resistance or armor?
[2:46:03] 64_Bit_Cake: @cineeleo idk - that sounds too unbalanced and boring to exist
[2:46:16] cool_minion14: Block soul crystal
[2:46:23] 64_Bit_Cake: They probably have it just under 100
[2:46:37] strandberggg: u colored the band
[2:46:40] strandberggg: on the pouch
[2:46:41] luke_sch02: its positional, no?
[2:46:44] queenchazzy_: its where you put it
[2:46:46] maloki: Oh yyou only colored the stripe
[2:46:49] xButter: made red trim need to put red in different spot on crafting grid
[2:46:55] P3pp3rF1y: yeah it depends where you put the dye
[2:47:00] sidsn_: Left top one  will dye the whole pouch
[2:47:13] tragon_cita: @cineeleo i think its impossible since legendary res or armor has diminishing returns so the more you have the less each point will matter
[2:47:16] P3pp3rF1y: there's main and trim color
[2:47:28] P3pp3rF1y: above / below pouch changes both
[2:47:33] 64_Bit_Cake: Above or below dyes while pouch, I know that
[2:47:39] 64_Bit_Cake: *whole
[2:47:54] luke_sch02: LETSGO

[2:51:18] sidsn_: This vault is so pretty
[2:51:23] 64_Bit_Cake: Take 1 spore blossom to dupe later with mods!
[2:51:53] P3pp3rF1y: they can crit more often than other mobs that's why
[2:51:59] vadskamanta: @64_Bit_Cake You're watching HBomb, in case you forgot, he doesn't do mods hbomb94LUL /j
[2:52:35] Vex_Vx: LUL
[2:52:38] strandberggg: mojang
[2:52:38] maloki: lol
[2:52:38] luke_sch02: walia YEP
[2:52:38] P3pp3rF1y: I mean thanks Iskall, right?
[2:52:39] SerenityUwU99: hbomb94LUL hbomb94LUL
[2:52:41] jammanty: A good offense is the best defense?
[2:52:41] sidsn_: Darng spiders
[2:52:41] ChaoticDinacesaur: mojangs
[2:52:48] 64_Bit_Cake: @vadskamanta LUL this is my first time in a while watching him play vh - last time was in vh2!
[2:52:54] Taticles: Probably Iskall, if in doubt, blame Iskall
[2:52:59] PercentZER0ZER0: Thanks, Jason!
[2:53:12] 64_Bit_Cake: Blame douwsky
[2:53:15] get_d0wn: is it just me or is raw magnetite just useless
[2:53:24] vadskamanta: @64_Bit_Cake I want to say that he uses mods more now than in S2 but... he really doesn't hbomb94LUL
[2:53:30] bas3j: Noo defenetfy dowski
[2:53:36] Ryumizu: this vault theme makes me want VH to have a copy of the sporespawn boss from super metroid
[2:53:47] sidsn_: Suffering from taking  damage ? Dont get hit duh ( jk jk )
[2:54:15] Taticles: After how easy Iskall found frag difficulty the other day, he’s probably going to make it harder too
[2:54:26] jammanty: ohh, me-ignite
[2:54:31] 64_Bit_Cake: @vadskamanta LUL tbh I agree that vh is just as good without mods. Can't wait for the vanilla thing iskall talks about to come out!
[2:54:42] Xarallon: honey block for the bottle
[2:54:43] Ryumizu: @jammanty panicBasket
[2:54:43] maloki: pick up some spore blossom if you haven't
[2:55:03] vadskamanta: He has spore blossoms NODDERS
[2:55:09] sidsn_: @64_bit_cake dont remove my drawers Sadge
[2:55:09] maloki: Goood
[2:55:16] maloki: I also forgot they are in raw vaults :D
[2:55:46] Neverlie2u: dont forget you have no fall damage
[2:55:48] 64_Bit_Cake: @sidsn_ dw he said he's keeping that kind of storage stuff and I couldn't live without those!
[2:56:09] sidsn_: Happy Me
[2:56:26] maloki: have you seen the new brazier vaults?
[2:56:55] Ryumizu: @maloki those look like a great design
[2:57:01] olewk: you got the arm
[2:57:18] vadskamanta: paper
[2:57:21] luke_sch02: ripped pages
[2:57:21] olewk: pages
[2:57:34] 64_Bit_Cake: @maloki I keep seeing hermits run them and thinking " I wanna do one of those" so I open vh and realise they are not out yet
[2:57:58] 64_Bit_Cake: Copium
[2:58:04] maloki: I know!
[2:58:12] maloki: Soon though I think! soon™
[2:58:20] 64_Bit_Cake: @maloki LUL
[2:58:33] maloki: It's been soon for a few weeks now. :D
[2:58:34] sidsn_: @p3pp3rf1y quick question something happened rn and happens to me too makes me wonder like sometimes u got affinity on the tool but breaking a chest ( living , ornate , gilded ) takes time like doesnt go brr ? Does it happen for reason ?
[2:58:47] maloki: but I've learnt that iskall's "this weekend!" means another month.:)
[2:59:06] olewk: coins and ornate left
[2:59:24] luke_sch02: @sidsn_ have you enchanted it?
[2:59:25] Neverlie2u: @sidsn_ it has something to do with you changing in Y value, so try not to fall or jump while mining chests
[2:59:25] tyto13alba: @sidsn_  its a minecraft glitch
[2:59:35] 64_Bit_Cake: @maloki he's normally near enough to the time but there must have been a lot of bugs and he was busy with Etho of course
[2:59:51] sidsn_: @luke_sch02  yes
[2:59:56] Neverlie2u: @sidsn_ or whenever you get that bug punch some random block around the chest and it resets
[3:00:16] P3pp3rF1y: @sidsn_ vanilla logic where if you were falling at the time you start breaking you will continue to have a bad break speed. hitting different block helps to reset that
[3:00:20] maloki: @64_Bit_Cake I saw some of the bugs when they were streaming etc, it was nasty
[3:00:30] Neverlie2u: also getting 22 mining speed on that tool will let you get rid of the bug
[3:00:34] maloki: and I've gone through release cycles where the bugs were just horrendous and like you couldn't figure out where it came from
[3:00:35] sidsn_: @neverlie2u i m sure i didnt move but will keep that in mind
[3:00:45] 64_Bit_Cake: @maloki NODDERS
[3:01:19] sidsn_: Okay thanks  everyone peepoHappy
[3:01:36] actual_supernova: henlos?
[3:01:43] Neverlie2u: @sidsn_ it might also happen when you go from a full block to a slab while breaking, you still kinda change in Y value
[3:02:17] Xarallon: @P3pp3rF1y could "air affinity" fix it? Cant remember what mod has though
[3:03:02] strandberggg: Coins up there Sadge
[3:03:25] ChaoticDinacesaur: there were
[3:03:26] sidsn_: Spiders monkaX
[3:03:29] Streamlabs: Have you followed yet? If not, make sure you hit that follow button to get notified every time H starts streaming! It's very helpful to the channel and we really appreciate it! hbomb94Love
[3:03:36] B4n4n4zrgood: why did you clutch you have the elven air or whatever right?
[3:04:11] Ryumizu: @b4n4n4zrgood theraputic foot bath
[3:04:13] sidsn_: U loose 2 sec when u water bucket NOOO
[3:04:19] B4n4n4zrgood: I was just wondering if you forgot or if there was a different reason
[3:04:53] 64_Bit_Cake: Poor spider just wanted some honey
[3:05:40] strandberggg: middle to the right
[3:06:14] Ryumizu: imagine how much a cubic meter of honey would cost  *~*
[3:06:15] sidsn_: How do you navigate threw the vault ? Like you got straight then go next and come back or in circle or what ?
[3:06:39] olewk: 1/4 jars
[3:06:42] strandberggg: you get alot of gold :)
[3:06:58] 64_Bit_Cake: @sidsn_ he marks the rooms - see that cobble he places at the doorways? That s how he tells where he's been and which way home is
[3:07:32] 64_Bit_Cake: @sidsn_ also that compass helps a lot
[3:08:07] BigFlameWolf: @sidsn_ He typically goes north (or one other specific direction), then once he reaches the end, goes one room east/west, goes south until he can't, rinse and repeat.
[3:08:09] Mera_212: how many does he have rn?
[3:08:20] vadskamanta: And he generally moves in one direction, so north until he can't go north any more, then he goes one east for exampel, and then continues north if he can and so on and so forth
[3:08:32] sidsn_: Yah i noticed but whats the efficient way ?  Or just go randomly at any room ?
[3:08:34] strandberggg: Pog

[4:03:40] strandberggg: @Ablation87 nah
[4:03:46] BigFlameWolf: @Ablation87 No. The archive is the one that gives you more modifiers for it.
[4:03:47] smash7711: Could make a bunch of crystals now, then level up and running the lower crystals for the dungeons.
[4:03:58] Mera_212: speed?
[4:04:00] Astarotish: Javelin conduit
[4:04:03] Zach010: Good idea
[4:04:20] BigFlameWolf: @smash7711 I mean, plunderer's pearl makes obsolete needing to do that since you won't Level from them.
[4:04:24] smash7711: Storm arrow
[4:04:40] Zach010: Treasure javelin?
[4:04:48] smash7711: Storm arrow helps with the dungeons
