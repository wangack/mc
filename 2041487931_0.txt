[1:41:59] drokuuu: Jesus LUL
[1:42:14] scoutybear: someone said 49ers winning Super Bowl. I‚Äôve been summoned
[1:42:17] camblgl: 2 championships for the state of michigan is only right
[1:42:30] imagine0229: why do you think that @camblgl
[1:42:40] imagine0229: why did yoy think the lions are beating niners
[1:42:52] scoutybear: because they‚Äôre better
[1:42:59] imagine0229: how‚Ä¶?
[1:43:00] ScubaSteve8114: HUH why didn't you teleport when you threw that pearl?
[1:43:06] camblgl: @imagine0229 cuz michigan teams never win championships so now im super happy
[1:43:17] scoutybear: @camblgl you from Michigan?
[1:43:18] techoiii: when you win in the polls do you get double the channel points like gambling?
[1:43:28] totheskylar: depends on the ratio
[1:43:31] imagine0229: exactly, never win championships‚Ä¶ they‚Äôre not gonna win lol
[1:43:44] scoutybear: what does that have to do with anything
[1:44:01] camblgl: @imagine0229 they already won college
[1:44:21] Quickscopingg33: Chiefs beating Ravens, I don‚Äôt know about Lions 49ers, it‚Äôs going to be great game
[1:44:22] scoutybear: Detroit highschool won it all. Michigan won it all. now time for lions
[1:44:26] imagine0229: I don‚Äôt see them beating niners
[1:44:32] HermanatorPC: @scubasteve8114 he lowered his render distance
[1:44:39] scoutybear: @imagine0229 they played so bad against packers
[1:44:39] Ericaxhh: cizzW
[1:44:48] HermanatorPC: @scubasteve8114 so he only teleports when the pearl is within render distance
[1:44:52] Quickscopingg33: @imagine0229 bro the lions are STACKED too
[1:44:59] imagine0229: bc the packers are good, and who still won?
[1:45:08] scoutybear: way more stacked than 49ers
[1:45:12] scoutybear: and have drive and motivation
[1:45:21] scoutybear: and new players coming off injury with no game film on them
[1:45:26] scoutybear: and Zach ertz just signed
[1:45:27] Quickscopingg33: Man I want to know where the cowboys fans in chat are that were talking crazy beginning of the year in here LUL LUL LUL LUL
[1:45:40] ScubaSteve8114: @HermanatorPC NOTED I see... so, why did he throw it
[1:45:45] imagine0229: purdys first sb win. that‚Äôs not motivation?
[1:45:50] camblgl: lions already beat the chiefs so they can beat anyone in the league they just gotta show up ready to play
[1:46:05] scoutybear: @imagine0229 he‚Äôs gonna get sacked first drive and be shivering the rest of the game
[1:46:13] Mflesc0704: @camblgl they got dismantled by the ravens lol
[1:46:16] Quickscopingg33: that was the first game of the year, so much has happened since @camblgl
[1:46:20] scoutybear: he‚Äôs good when he‚Äôs protected. but not when there‚Äôs pressure
[1:46:20] Mflesc0704: people still underestimate that
[1:46:24] HermanatorPC: @scubasteve8114 he threw it early so he can finish in the bastion and teleport whenever he wants with out having to go back out and throw it
[1:46:34] HermanatorPC: Saves time
[1:46:46] camblgl: @Quickscopingg33 wdym they are in the palyoffs
[1:47:09] imagine0229: stafford gonna choke lol
[1:47:10] ScubaSteve8114: Oh, so if he increases his render distance, he'll teleport to where he threw it? @HermanatorPC
[1:47:11] xxwazayxx: hey chat ,what did I miss
[1:47:19] Quickscopingg33: @camblgl I know that, but no team stays or plays the same since game 1. that‚Äôs just common sense
[1:47:31] scoutybear: @imagine0229 Stafford?
[1:47:57] imagine0229: sorry goff
[1:48:13] camblgl: naw goff is really him

[3:06:42] ascension9779: checking the coords for the stronghold
[3:06:57] justsmoothment: ahh okay
[3:07:04] PrimeExamples: why the certainty so low?
[3:07:10] justsmoothment: and how can you see that?
[3:07:17] ascension9779: then he will go back is the nether and use the 1 block to 8 method to run faster to the coords. port into the stronghold and go for end
[3:07:45] Chend0_jonghuu: hi there my man
[3:07:47] ascension9779: Its more so something you just gotta know about minecraft
[3:08:02] ascension9779: Eye of Ender = Tracker to stronghold.
[3:08:19] phantomheart73: simply a skill issue
[3:08:31] justsmoothment: yh thats the thing I know but how can you check where the coords are just by throwing it 1 time?

[3:09:06] iDini: use tall macro
[3:09:08] vanzman1: lack of pp poo poo check
[3:09:37] ascension9779: Cause in the nether he finds an approx close to the stronghold then does this calculation to get the exact. This is a rough explanation ofc.
[3:09:56] justsmoothment: ahh Okay I think I get it
[3:09:57] justsmoothment: ty
[3:10:06] ascension9779: Hes also using a program that calculates the % of accuracy as to if the stronghold is under that pearl
[3:10:31] justsmoothment: yhh I just saw that
[3:10:38] ascension9779: np but the ai will almost never miss.
