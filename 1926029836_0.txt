[2:14:49] Dr_Cool_Jedi: yeah alignments are antiquated but most systems are doing away with it
[2:16:01] silentp13426: Warhammer roleplay is not heroic fantasy in that way

[2:18:04] lookimapengu1: one of the things that drives me nuts w/ 5e is how meaningless going unconscious is, i was playtesting something for a friend recently and my character literally went down every round and the healer spent every turn getting me back up so i could go right back down next turn
[2:18:42] silentp13426: lookimapengu1 yeah the 'jack in the box' bouncing up and down from unconscious is an issue with 5e

[2:21:46] silentp13426: the problem with death being the only mechanical consequence is a problem in itself though
