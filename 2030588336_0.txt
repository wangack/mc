[4:46:53] Daniel_H212: if they backport nvidium to 1.16.1, do you think it will be allowed for speedrunning?
[4:47:11] Daniel_H212: its like insane for performance at high render distances
[4:47:19] incompetatintart: hi
[4:47:38] Daniel_H212: i think it basically puts your chunks and stuff in VRAM instead of normal RAM?
[4:47:39] incompetatintart: VoHiYo VoHiYo
[4:47:39] Daniel_H212: which is faster
[4:47:44] Daniel_H212: but idk a lot about it

[4:48:09] tattedweelamb: YAPPING
[4:48:10] rachel__red: @incompetatintart hi
[4:48:11] Daniel_H212: i mean it allows render distances in excess of 64 chunks which is clearly not vanilla so that part would be disallowed

[5:00:46] castlebeki: how difficult is it to do all effects if there is no water at spawn? is it easier to bring the chulker to the closest river or is it easier to build a custom water pool?

[6:04:48] anthoniosr: you don‚Äôt have to agree with a strat but that doesn‚Äôt mean you should lose time as a wr contender just to be stoic
[6:04:48] Daniel_H212: well all the calculations are doable its just that it would take longer than the rest of the speedrun combined, the mods just allow it because theoretically it wouldnt be igt

[6:04:54] Daniel_H212: thats what i think at least?

[6:38:09] Inkiiy: @eGay valid LOL, didnt know if it did anything
[6:38:15] iansonofthor_: @eGay since the end cities are unloaded but the item frames, which are entities, are, we used a flying machine to make an ice bridge to catch the falling elytra

[6:39:40] chaitea04: end shack
[6:39:43] iansonofthor_: @eGay we found out that using a very small render and sim distance actually unloads the entities until like just over the machine so we can catch it easily, otherwise it would just fall very far away lol

[7:26:21] caseykits: @PSIRanch getting XP while already above ~10 (?) is worth less. major advancements (most biome advs) give decent XP, so you'd rather save them for when your XP is lower. no idea if this is what fein was mad about but it's my only guess.
[7:26:38] PacManMVC: not 4 netherite ingots ResidentSleeper
[7:26:40] caseykits: something something quadratic/exponential scaling on XP idk
