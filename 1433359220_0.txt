[1:36:58] tizom: alts are better in every way
[1:36:58] gnomeseleven: pepeLaugh
[1:36:59] Archelonde: I mean theres only so much you can do on an alt as well

[1:37:24] Triz08: its refreshing playing alts

[2:19:15] stormblaz: Redbull got the short end of the stick
[2:19:30] Xeroxbeta: this just in, merc to just replace cars with bounce house on wheels
[2:19:36] Tamerlain: the F1 race itself is a big question at this point too
[2:19:38] stormblaz: I never knew f1 cars had to be approved by the board and there is allowable modifications
[2:20:02] Chronoes: Man, the harp sounds are somewhat irritating. it sounds so discordant
[2:20:02] DemonicHell3: @Giantwaffle have you looked at not too complicated 2 mod pack? It looks like it has a bit more content than enigmatica 6. Tho it is a sky block so not sure if that's something you are interested in.

[2:22:09] stormblaz: why so odd
[2:22:12] Exxii11: im really disappointed in AM. hulk is usually very honest if he makes a mistake so him saying he had a good quali lap and that putting him p17 is concerning

[2:23:33] FarmPeaches_FreePalestine: i remember when mercedes in the offseason said alot of the f1 teams will not get the new car design right. looks like they ate that one
[2:23:49] stormblaz: mercc has those new mirrors
[2:24:16] stormblaz: Im gonna be honest they got VERY good drivers
[2:24:17] Kausivesi: haas said that they considered the tiny sidepod design at first but went with wide sidepods because they performed better
[2:24:24] stormblaz: Merc has great drivers so idk
[2:24:25] sam1390: I wouldnt be that mad if the fastest design is the sidepods from ferrari, they look so good
[2:24:30] stormblaz: it might be car issue
[2:24:35] stormblaz: and team organization
[2:24:59] stormblaz: Ferrari just eating it lately
[2:25:04] sam1390: the merc design just doesnt look great

[2:25:56] Xeroxbeta: are you saying it is competition when redbull cars cant cross the finish line, and merc is driving in a bounce house
[2:26:01] FarmPeaches_FreePalestine: 100%, hes one of the hardest working managers
[2:26:01] st3x_: btw is there gonna be another Drive to survive season?

[2:36:12] AsHackDM: you can agroo but you cant %100 sure you gonna get agro all the time
[2:36:25] stormblaz: Idk how they could improve gun lancer cuz it is a requested party calss
[2:36:27] stormblaz: class*
[2:36:37] TritonXXXG: hey look its our favorite boss from anguished island KEKW
[2:36:44] Kryllyk: I'm not enjoying my Gunlancer in T3 as much as other tiers, but I won't give up on it, might need to change up my setup
[2:36:56] stormblaz: it feels a bit clunky
[2:36:56] Moobot: You can sub to Waffle by clicking this neat link -> twitch.tv/giantwaffle/subscribe
[2:36:59] stormblaz: compared to others
[2:37:02] emanymanheman: From my research, it seems like gunlancer is the closest you can get to tanking through some of its abilities
[2:37:03] Artoosa: her death animation is uhhhh something
[2:37:38] Akaihon: @stormblaz improve GL ? its only con is that its slow
[2:37:41] kaztrogaming: there are supports too
[2:37:51] stormblaz: bard sound effects sounds like what I would do on a harp
[2:38:00] stormblaz: it sounds jarring
[2:38:11] emanymanheman: teh bard sound effects sound like they were ripped straight from Sona's abilities
[2:38:20] TheWonderLlama: Do the thing!
[2:38:22] stormblaz: @Akaihon yea it is a bit slow but im sure it can be improved with skill
[2:38:30] Idawn: Gotta stand in the golden cricle, yea
[2:38:33] stormblaz: @emanymanheman Probably but sona has more harmony
[2:38:38] stormblaz: this sounds like a child mashing a harp
[2:38:48] kaztrogaming: and as support you will get MVP like 90% of the time lol
[2:39:10] emanymanheman: what do you just not do what the dolls do?
[2:39:22] AsHackDM: point is that ydo you need to do same moves or different moves
[2:39:29] Guidaux: i'm trying out heavy armor level 3 on my bard
[2:39:46] stormblaz: This is dam creepy
[2:40:22] emanymanheman: another topic, I keep getting small cuts in the tip of my index finger after cooking with a knife but I feel like I'm not touching the blade. Do you have any idea what coudl be going on?
[2:40:33] stormblaz: Is it true bard struggles to get to max level the most ?
[2:40:37] Nexhunter: should have brought in willing for this one KEKW
[2:41:15] Artoosa: orgasm death
[2:41:17] stormblaz: fan service

[2:41:32] xMom_: wild
[2:41:33] emanymanheman: even for fan service, that's a fairly short animation
[2:41:38] Nexhunter: she not dead cause she better giver me a star sodaMad
[2:41:39] EunWol: Josh famous words: "Don't ask, just enjoy"
[2:41:47] Guidaux: everything just seems to run away or come back from the dead
[2:42:09] stormblaz: Honest speaking lore wise is FF14 better?
[2:42:13] Akaihon: u using Rhapsody instead of Oratorio for solo content ?
[2:42:22] deathfroma6ove9: deathfroma6ove9 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 17 months! KEKW
[2:42:35] emanymanheman: so like poe lore?
[2:42:43] emanymanheman: at least in regards to lost ark
[2:42:43] stormblaz: Ahhh I dint know that disconnection
[2:42:47] stormblaz: I though some were invested
[2:42:51] Akaihon: change your ULT
[2:42:52] Akaihon: for dmg
[2:42:54] Akaihon: ?
[2:43:01] stormblaz: so no youtubers focus on the lore side?
[2:43:18] NexX_____: id had the problem today that Lost  Ark would freeze on Start, so i had to switch to DX9 start the game go from EUW to EUC than switch to DX11. cant make that shit up WTF
[2:43:34] Artoosa: How is you chat box so big waffle

[2:44:08] nxusr: probably the shader cache got fucked
[2:44:11] NexX_____: i reinstalled everything that was so weird
[2:44:27] stormblaz: @Giantwaffle probably a corrupted data file
[2:44:28] NexX_____: i straight up swaped to an AMD card too
[2:44:52] Nexhunter: @stormblaz it was a corrupted shader file cause well streaming textures pepeLaugh
[2:45:02] stormblaz: that does make sense

[2:46:11] Chronoes: Make sure you mount the Monaco flag the right way up, otherwise people will question the Polish simping
[2:46:11] DexxonGaming: the flames right under the flag got me Shook.
[2:46:16] Yogithebaer: gamba on which flag is up each day\
[2:46:39] daemonaedryn: Ignoring that its not even a fireplace KEKW

[2:47:58] gikei: well it depends. some fireplaces are reserving and meant to heat the house.
[2:48:12] stormblaz: Carlos sainz will win grand prix dont @ me
[2:48:15] Chronoes: @NexX_____ to use as a background for streams KEKW
[2:48:19] Archelonde: the t3 abyss dungeon was so damn easy
[2:48:20] ItsOnMax: lmao F1 in the Netherlands had 700k less viewers than last years start of the season, thanks to F1 going to a streaming platform
[2:48:22] DX_Plates: Another Boeing Crash? geez

[2:49:34] sexyartdodo: @giantwaffle I have watched Korean streamers do that dungeon and it’s insane
[2:49:49] fominte: I hit a +8 purple Awakening stone on my Soulfist T3
[2:49:49] stormblaz: Can a house have a indrustrial grill like they use in restaurants?
[2:50:21] fominte: Only 1 negative too. It's like the one lucky thing thats happened to me in this game lol
[2:50:22] ItsOnMax: @stormblaz still a pretty big drop when the total viewership of last years start was 2.1m
[2:50:30] stormblaz: Oh shit i dint know

[2:52:04] myDuckIsFat: This is the first time I've listened to any of the punika questline in english, it sounds so weird
[2:52:05] Wiz4rdo: Yo Waffle, how do you feel about the international waffle day coming up snowryThinking

[2:52:46] DetusX: i hope susHmm
[2:53:01] kdarith: on the 31st pepeLaugh
[2:53:02] Xev_00: If we don't get a roadmap this month at all that's gonna be a really bad sign imo.
[2:53:02] Moobot: Come join the Waffle House Discord! <# https://discord.gg/fhGFtMuzdS
[2:53:12] stormblaz: How important is the road map
[2:53:14] RoboticRexkek: they technically have next week also to complete the roadmap KEKEW
[2:53:19] stormblaz: or do you rather have a transparent company
[2:53:21] LaurenLore: they had mentioned on the forums that its taking longer than expected
[2:53:32] stormblaz: I dont doubt it
[2:53:36] stormblaz: road maps are core
[2:54:08] RoboticRexkek: it's probably not approved yet by higher management
[2:54:12] Assure__: I think they did have one, but they realized they needed to adjust it
[2:54:21] Yogithebaer: i want to know when classes are expected to come out
[2:54:35] stormblaz: @Giantwaffle Im 100% sure road maps are ruled by the executives or money making investors
[2:54:39] Karlishes: @Giantwaffle they don't want to fuck up again so they are scared and want to be sure before they release a roadmap
[2:54:45] TheRoseGuard: TheRoseGuard subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 22 months, currently on a 19 month streak! I make about 200-300 a day at the pizza restaurant I work at
[2:54:48] emanymanheman: is there anything that could be slowing them down besides localization delays
[2:54:53] zigs2114: they said they are accelerating class releases
[2:54:58] zigs2114: since the leak
[2:55:00] Warkless: iw ant the mto release one, and if they think they need to change something, change it and explain why it needs to be changed "EXPLAIN"
[2:55:05] Shangun: 2 a month is already slow
[2:55:08] stormblaz: They released some skins that make no sense
[2:55:08] fominte: Just try to keep in mind that LA Korea has a good f2p experience. They just need to make some adjustments on pacing and increasing material sources and we'll be in good shape.
[2:55:09] EunWol: It feels like they want to do what Gold River wants, but it seems like the for bussiness purposes they want to still delay some content.
[2:55:10] stormblaz: and sold badly
[2:55:41] warmwalrus: it's the second day before reset woohoo
[2:55:46] stormblaz: the game made some questionable decisions
[2:55:50] stormblaz: Yes a distributing center
[2:55:52] stormblaz: correct
[2:55:58] stormblaz: nop
[2:55:58] DX_Plates: When I worked at Round Table one guy would come in early every monring to prep all the dough for the day.
[2:56:10] emanymanheman: I know some little caesars will go and pick up some DiGiorno's if they're running low
[2:56:12] stormblaz: the dough maker
[2:56:17] warmwalrus: did you hit 1370 waffle?
[2:56:18] TheRoseGuard: we make our own dough and sauce in house and pizzas are made to order
[2:56:23] Tokinstaffel: isnt that making a pizza every like 1.2 minutes?
[2:56:28] stormblaz: @emanymanheman Prob better than their own dough
[2:56:30] warmwalrus: PogBones
[2:56:34] warmwalrus: that's yuge
[2:56:34] Nexhunter: sodaMad stop bragging about that one shot
[2:56:42] Akaihon: they said TLDR: we had a roadMap but with the new data we had to bring someone from SGrpg to USA so we could talk about new adjustments. --- if what they said is to be believed they r talking about bringing more classes, QoL improvments and a workaround for honing be on par with day1 released content for 20% of player base.
[2:56:47] DX_Plates: @stormblaz For Sure it is LUL
[2:56:47] warmwalrus: WHAT
[2:56:51] Nexhunter: i am on the 2nd pitty of the day sodaMad
[2:56:57] emanymanheman: not for me. @stormblaz I love little caesar's dough
[2:57:04] fominte: He's basically the luckiest MFer just for that
[2:57:05] stormblaz: Hot and ready
[2:57:18] Xev_00: @Akaihon, Where did they say that?
[2:57:27] stormblaz: @Giantwaffle You gotta understand road maps take time and research so makes sense
[2:57:32] DX_Plates: No Sauce
[2:57:34] stormblaz: its a lot of back line
[2:57:36] emanymanheman: big good or big bad
[2:57:38] warmwalrus: where's the source? monkaHmm
[2:57:48] Xev_00: I browse the forums every day for updates and I haven't seen anything like that
[2:57:52] stormblaz: A lot of games go down by not following the road map
[2:57:55] Yogithebaer: is that a trust me bro source
[2:57:56] Exxii11: sauce PauseChamp
[2:58:00] EunWol: @Akaihon Yeah, Gold River really wants us to be in the same spot as Korea, but I guess they still didn't know how often they wanted to release said content.
[2:58:00] Nexhunter: wtf
[2:58:04] Namsayn: i just hit 1370 right now! f2p
[2:58:06] Nexhunter: where the fuck is my 30% gain sodaMad

[3:22:33] AsHackDM: i dont like it too much
[3:23:04] myDuckIsFat: What, T2 gems are still useful until you get level 3 T3 gems
[3:23:13] myDuckIsFat: Roughly anyway
[3:23:14] Nectariine: You still get 50% of this effect :s
[3:23:20] kaztrogaming: ya they are still useful just 50%
[3:23:39] Warkless: You could give them to an alt and the fuse them for their benefit

[3:25:02] AsHackDM: what do  you mena i make 2-3k per day
[3:25:04] gitykins: no its 50 crystals and you get like 3k+ worth of leapstones so
[3:25:07] Triz08: ive transferred about 60k worth of gold to blue

[3:25:48] warmwalrus: i converted so much to crystal
[3:25:53] Riwaz: I had max 3k LUL
[3:25:56] inVINCEble__: Can you convert blue crystals to gold?
[3:25:56] Moobot: You can sub to Waffle by clicking this neat link -> twitch.tv/giantwaffle/subscribe
[3:26:05] DexxonGaming: you arent doing this for the skill point thing are you?
[3:26:08] TritonXXXG: they buy low and sell high
[3:26:11] TritonXXXG: that simple
[3:26:14] thunderdan11: well some of them sold a cerb mount
[3:26:18] stormblaz: @Giantwaffle They bought gold when it was dirt cheap from sites
[3:26:18] Triz08: im unemployed and play all day tho
[3:26:20] gitykins: people who have hundreds of k are doing something weird
[3:26:33] stormblaz: I read somewhere most high end players bought gold
[3:26:37] stormblaz: from the survey
[3:26:40] Xev_00: Selling bis accessories.
[3:26:42] Ditchem: get lucky with good accessories and you are set on gold
[3:26:44] DexxonGaming: ahhhh gotcha
[3:26:59] Baysyxx: some dude on reddit showed that he has 6 alts all t3... 700+ hrs in the game
[3:27:11] stormblaz: Im gonna be honest
[3:27:13] ninopanda: i totally have not dropped 550 on the game
[3:27:14] TheWonderLlama: WICKED 💳 Swipe harder!
[3:27:14] stormblaz: bots are still an issue
[3:27:16] stormblaz: in some areas
[3:27:19] realJokoWidodo: and rmt andy LUL
[3:27:20] Triz08: im opposite, i have no job and just free to play all day and just as far as the whalse
[3:27:43] Venxuri: @Baysyxx possible with swiperino if you knew what you were doing right from the start
[3:27:50] Venxuri: without*
[3:27:59] Desepti: you can do the lopang reputation really fast btw, all quest give you rep per day
[3:28:14] gitykins: anyways a +1 daily task pass from mari is like 50 crystals but you make way more in that from 4 or 5 great honor leaps
[3:28:14] TritonXXXG: i feel like swiping for gold is prob the worst way to do it
[3:28:23] TritonXXXG: all the things that you could get in the shop
[3:28:25] GymLeaderKevin: @stormblaz so far past rohendel there minimum bots
[3:28:27] Baysyxx: @Venxuri ya he claimed he only bought 1 gold and 1 plat pack and used that levl 50 chest in the shop and thats it.. but i believe it.. especially haveing 700+ hrs in the game
[3:28:33] TritonXXXG: buying straight gold seems wasteful
[3:28:37] DexxonGaming: lopang on t1 alts just doesnt seem worth.
[3:28:45] stormblaz: @GymLeaderKevin I noticed too yea a bit less
[3:28:54] BlancoPollito: @DexxonGaming still profitable tho
[3:28:57] stormblaz: That is ridiculous
[3:29:00] gitykins: you can use the value row on that calc to figure out when its worth to use solars
[3:29:04] daemonaedryn: Oh fuck that
[3:29:06] BaTu016: AND İTS AVERAGE KEKW
[3:29:17] BaTu016: if u get unlucky ur fucked
[3:29:34] stormblaz: @Giantwaffle Do uthink the game would benefit from a housing market like Diablo 3 did early where people could sell for real money?
[3:29:40] Triz08: it aint worth
[3:29:45] Baysyxx: great honor leapstones on NA west is 900
[3:29:50] EunWol: It's like Warframe. You can swipe to rush, but the exchange is so not worth it that it's jsut better to grind KEKW
[3:29:52] Yogithebaer: just get lucky
[3:29:57] Jerod5_: what is that site you were looking at?
[3:29:58] Venxuri: I just try to sell all of my upbound shit to buy it back when its 1/3 the price
[3:30:01] stormblaz: leap stones are the hot stuff lately
