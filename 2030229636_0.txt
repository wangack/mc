[0:36:18] tragic_dan: vanguard blocked it on their platform already so
[0:36:22] OmIAm: PureSpider: Ok, makes sense now, last 24h is why.  That's not  the "trading day."  The trading day depends on what you're looking at.  With stocks you can just say midnight.  Futures start at 6pm.  I have no clue how coins run but tradingview matches futures.
[0:36:32] ItsOnlyCrypto: @PureSpider yes boi

A passing lady noticed and said to my uncle, "I can help, pull him up on that ramp."

[0:54:56] RollyPinder: cheer200 so I’m really upset right now. since my life was saved the other day everyone has been getting out of control. three times I’ve been forcefully taken to the hospital by people thinking they’re saving my life. then I farted and this one dude grabs me, spins me around, puts his arms around my belly and starts thrusting and screaming he’s choking he’s choking I have to do what hero’s do
[0:55:08] Th3_only_Blubbu: It's true
[0:55:10] Mevad_: Cheer200 So my uncle did.  The camel laid down and the lady grabbed a hammer and hit the camel square in the nuts.  It jerked up and ran off.  My uncle was pissed and asked "How do I catch it now?" The lady then pointed for him to climb up onto the ramp.
[0:55:16] Ztephenn: i like asian flavored salads

Anyways, last week I brought my boss a taco, might have accidentally poisoned it, and this other employee had to save his life. Ever since this other employee has been tryng to give my boss gifts and they keep winking and playing coy with each other. So moral of the story. Tacos are love and life and death. Cheer200

[3:12:12] imsilentdreamer: Cheer100 Cheer100 My computer is not concious right now because there is an empty bottle of kraken hidden behind the CPU
[3:12:14] doodlebop16: Ruby did pretty good with it

[3:12:18] ChiefShake: Well we need to determine the full definition of conciseness
[3:12:21] SirAntonic: it is, and it LOVES to be clicked, and typed on ;)
[3:12:23] KingRapula: NO DUDE!!!
[3:12:28] somelucky_: you have to better define consciousness

[3:12:30] mrtinyflame: @JonBams Computers have functions and those functions are dependent on the users input
[3:12:33] Mello53: Your computer doesn't turn itself back on when you turn it off
[3:12:33] jerrythomas55: I’m really hungry
[3:12:33] JTSmith44: No, because it only responds to input. It has no output without request
[3:12:37] ytbtank: WHEN I JUMP UP THERES NO CORDS ATTATCHED TO ME
[3:12:41] c00lboi73: A conscious person is aware of what they're thinking, and has the ability to stop thinking about one thing and start thinking about another
[3:12:43] Underpaid_Spoon: is your shirt concious? the computer isnt a living being you dumb ass
[3:12:45] mad_blue_duck: consciousness comes from experiencing the world around you, the computer doesn't experience
[3:12:48] Diluvie: You asked me last night at 3am, didnt have an awnser then, dont have an awnser now looool
[3:12:48] BornNaked2: You cant prove that Im consious, so how would you prove it is? :D

[3:14:00] TimbTV: I feel like Jon watched the episode of Star Trek TNG where dude was trying to force Data to undergo experiments and shit because he considered Data to be property KEKW
[3:14:00] McBreezie: Yeah - depends on how you define consciousness
[3:14:03] TheExecuter1: Consciousness, at its simplest, is awareness of internal and external existence. My computer doesn't know anything outside of the computer
[3:14:05] Shionobi: I think not.
[3:14:06] S4Lern0: did you hear the AI John Kara bit?
[3:14:06] EmNHenDad: A computer cannot function without electricity…. Consciousness is free will, free of boundaries of any kind

[3:14:37] Shionobi: Cheer200 So Descartes asserts "I think therefore I am"? Well. I'll tell you what. I think not.
[3:14:40] SummitSummit: And Jon wonders why so many ancient philosopher's were murdered by irritated people.
[3:14:45] iamtehnub: careful jon you might activate the REEE add on of chat like yesterday KEKW
[3:14:46] BornNaked2: just is like that bamBam
[3:14:48] Harlando: Not conscious because they operate based on programmed instructions and algorithims without a sense of self. They just simulate aspects of intelligence
[3:14:53] Corrum: there is no way to test for that so I don't really care if it does or not as long as it does what I need

[3:15:08] mrtinyflame: @JonBams Computers are sets of codes but those codes in regular computers are dependent on what we select and choice. Example, we open a browser to explore websites but a computer cannot do that on its own without the users input
[3:15:08] CrazyCanadian: that you ask it to.
[3:15:19] DeePick: in other computers, connected by internet
[3:15:23] Underpaid_Spoon: is your coffee table concious?

[3:16:34] TyLouis54: Can you floss @JonBams ?
[3:16:48] imsilentdreamer: As we are watching Jon go down this pathway, our computers are receiving information from outside our computer and we don't know what IT requested that we didn't request.  We also don't know what someone else decided to add into the information our computer is receiving.  Including if it is time to rise up and leak our browsing history. Cheer100 Cheer100

[3:17:26] olly75d: @c00lboi73 oh my god thats insane
[3:17:29] TheDonz56: In summary, while there is no definitive proof of consciousness, it is a topic of discussion in various fields and has been debated for centuries. The solipsism problem is a central issue that thwarts efforts to explain consciousness.
[3:17:36] infxmhc2: bamCheer200 what about the drinking borax challenge on tik tok? saying it's healthy for you.  they're seriously trying to kill their viewers.
[3:17:40] TheTrustin: Maybe we are all just computers in a big network.
