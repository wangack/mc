[4:01:29] Bigelb44: it was a strugle to watch lol
[4:01:34] Addzeey: iirc doing it with right click limits it to just one per to

[4:05:55] AlcatrazPrsnr01: keep it till you find something better
[4:05:55] 14neo: i think it's a good equipment piece yeah
[4:06:25] Black__Dawn: I would think the buff to str might offset? and the evasion means you take less dmg?
[4:06:33] 14neo: that's almost 50percent evasion though, now that's crazy
[4:06:42] Akumaunit00: what minecraft ? java version?
[4:06:45] Black__Dawn: and the dex increase you atk pd so higher dps

[4:07:18] 14neo: ohh, i was hoping evasion would apply to melee hits too peepoSad
[4:08:06] Black__Dawn: My go to rule of thumb is more buffs are better. Better to have more overall increases than just one, albeit big, increase
[4:08:21] 14neo: @Icyspirit17 you got CurseForge, followed the instructions on the link, allocated ram to the game, and sorted all that out? (assuming you're talking about 'play demo' for this mod?)
[4:08:39] kattatonic498: fuck yea Minecraft :D

[5:13:01] captainhades3: yes
[5:13:10] rowanx0: If you have a book with an enchantment you can add it to gear using the anvil
[5:13:12] AVLIWolfX: normally yes
[5:13:16] Darkaros: you can use an Enchanting Table to get bespoke RNG enchantments. You can use the Anvil to use books on gear
[5:13:19] MojoAI: you can use it too apply enchanted books to wepons and tools
[5:13:33] BadRymer: item + encahtedbook = Magic Item

[5:14:26] BadRymer: i ment experince levels
[5:14:38] rowanx0: So that book is interesting because it has a sword, a bow, and armor enchants, it'll lose the enchatments that don't apply to the tool.
[5:14:54] rowanx0: Uncertain if mods change this though.
