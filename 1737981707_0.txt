[0:17:50] HTxNighthawk: @loganpod2000 wonder why he changed?
[0:18:02] loganpod2000: @htxnighthawk what do u mean change?
[0:18:08] LambdaRail: THose looked shopped
[0:18:11] Kjoelby: Space is so big the chance of them randomly hitting you is so small
[0:18:15] HTxNighthawk: @loganpod2000 The law degree instead?

[0:19:38] mechoriet: KEKW
[0:19:58] iAmpersin: might even wanna go slower at first
[0:19:59] loganpod2000: This better take 16 attempts lol
[0:19:59] maccabeus: how did that engine debris move?
[0:20:03] iAmpersin: to reduce heating and drag
[0:20:07] Mr_2_kills: Why is the planet prettier?
[0:20:08] officialhunterx: heat shield is under you right?
[0:20:12] Narcotical: The only excess weight now is Bob and Bill Kappa

[0:21:40] MachineFreak: that is crazy slow to lift off
[0:21:55] iAmpersin: that is too fast LUL
[0:22:01] arcticfranky_2: here comes the flip COGGERS
[0:22:06] iAmpersin: Pog volumetric clouds
[0:22:12] Poodmund: Yeah you dont want to ascend to fast in the lower atmosphere as drag is so high, you're effectively wasting fuel trying to punch through it.
[0:22:13] MrGuwee: MAX Q REACHED PogChamp
[0:22:23] officialhunterx: is the white heat
[0:22:25] charliscz: Hi chat and waffle LuvSign

[0:22:51] silv: the engines WAYTOODANK
[0:22:53] iAmpersin: That was a flex
[0:22:53] Yakobro: do a flip KEKW
[0:22:54] maccabeus: PauseChamp calculated roll
[0:22:54] kommendorfindus: lol, do a cool flip
[0:22:54] Barracuda_DIO: a flip rofl
[0:22:55] jilly_bean_31: flip for style
[0:22:56] et10080: style points
[0:22:56] sogerr: style points
[0:22:56] Tabakhase: its around 60ms at sealevel btw pepeLaugh
[0:22:58] ConspiracyStoryTime: nope
[0:22:58] friesengeist: aerospike for the LUL
[0:23:01] Mr_2_kills: imagine not having added those extra engines and just spikes xD
[0:23:02] GoodOldXijan: victory flip
[0:23:03] Duckie__: Pretty cool tbh Lmao
[0:23:05] iAmpersin: flexing on eve LUL
[0:23:06] imissautoattacks: do a barrel roll

[0:23:09] Narcotical: It stops on a dime though
[0:23:10] ForgottenTime: COGGERS
[0:23:14] loganpod2000: 1
[0:23:16] Accuboormachine: Dropping KEKW
[0:23:17] SomGui: but is it bad?
[0:23:19] hbboia: no aerodynamics
[0:23:22] mechoriet: 1
[0:23:29] GubaGauvie: 1/400
[0:23:29] IAmJester: Two hours later...
[0:23:34] Abyssal_Hawk: I guess we needed fins
[0:23:35] silv: Prayge 15 more
[0:23:38] Tabakhase: your first stage should do about double pepeLaugh terminal velocity Sir
[0:23:40] MrGuwee: @Giantwaffle dont steer just move UP
[0:23:42] friesengeist: i mean if you head wings
[0:23:42] iAmpersin: heavy drag and less aerodynamics/control
[0:23:44] ForgottenTime: 1 shot one attempt? KEKW
[0:23:45] espi: I believe
[0:23:48] iAmpersin: yeah wings would help a TON here
[0:23:50] authorized411: @Giantwaffle open the TWR of each engine stage to help
[0:23:52] espi: full send
[0:23:54] MrGuwee: already called it :D
[0:23:55] CanYouDigIt7: Keep that twr low bro
[0:24:01] jackmilan123456: Go up until out of atmosphere
[0:24:05] Kandarjr: Start the second stage slowburning
[0:24:09] MachineFreak: Get out to space first, get out of the atmosphere
[0:24:14] officialhunterx: lock gimble
[0:24:19] friesengeist: yes have the aerospike help
[0:24:22] 0_joonaa_0: what is the challence
[0:24:23] IAmJester: Just tow it beyond the environment.
[0:24:27] iAmpersin: get out of the blue part and u can then move
[0:24:40] Poodmund: Going slower will cause less drag so flipping will be less likely.
[0:24:40] Moobot: You can find Waffle's Youtube channel here - https://youtube.com/giantwaffle
[0:24:41] bandani: cant wait for him to filp
[0:24:42] espi: KEKW
[0:24:45] Mr_2_kills: lmao
[0:24:46] GubaGauvie: i think KER has a terminal velocity readout
[0:24:47] iAmpersin: def need to go slower
[0:24:49] mechoriet: KEKW top heavy
[0:24:49] iAmpersin: go much slower
[0:24:55] MachineFreak: The aerodynamics gets tougher the faster you go...
[0:25:02] Aldizzert: Keep the boosters? are they adding stability?
[0:25:13] kommendorfindus: why does it want to flip so hard? is your center of mass this low?
[0:25:25] hbboia: maybe engine and decouplers in the same time?
[0:25:25] Mr_2_kills: because it making sense would be rediculous
[0:25:26] MrGuwee: because reasons
[0:25:28] jackmilan123456: Thats why they are making a new game
[0:25:28] iAmpersin: weird coding LUL
[0:25:31] Barracuda_DIO: I dont even know what a gimble is
[0:25:32] GubaGauvie: space magic
[0:25:33] bandani: america explain
[0:25:35] authorized411: change stage to decouple and start engines so no delay
[0:25:37] Xicer_TV: spaghet
[0:25:38] MoreShotsPlease: programmers are crazy
[0:25:39] jilly_bean_31: File a bug or send them a PR :-P
[0:25:40] StAult: Spaghetti code!
[0:25:40] CantTouchDisNow: one is a slider one is a button
[0:25:45] iAmpersin: aye they prob didnt think that through
[0:25:51] FinnYellowbelly: in case you want one on/off separately?
[0:25:55] maccabeus: @Barracuda_DIO it means the engine can tilt to change direction
[0:25:57] LokiRulez: it was done friday before a holiday, everyone knows that
[0:25:59] Poodmund: 2 different devs and neither confidently knew what they were doing LUL
[0:26:06] iAmpersin: IN FACT i wish the symmetry didnt work for lights/colors of lights
[0:26:09] jackmilan123456: @finnyellowbelly, Then you can disable symmetry
[0:26:16] Mr_2_kills: settling time
[0:26:19] bandani: waffle explaining PID again
[0:26:26] MachineFreak: too much correction
[0:26:26] darkhouse54: or one was a bigger problem so they retro added that turning off does not apply to all engines but forgot that might be useful for other settings
[0:26:29] kommendorfindus: classic sigmoid
[0:26:29] Aldizzert: More I in your PID
[0:26:30] AleXanDreMau: @Giantwaffle maybe they forget to ctrl + c and Ctrl + v on the gimble class for all on the code!
[0:26:39] maccabeus: PauseChamp x3
[0:26:40] jackmilan123456: Stock SAS is just not a very good PID
[0:26:43] 11_343: noooo i just had to study thios gorbage for a whole semester PepeHands
[0:26:44] Talon_Jasra: From what I understand, the symmetry coding is very jank. It was basically done the worst way possible. Its what you get from a dev that wasn't a game dev originally.
[0:27:11] MrGuwee: @Giantwaffle you had
[0:27:14] Yakobro: too fast still?
[0:27:18] Mr_2_kills: 4 yes
[0:27:20] iAmpersin: try to go MUCH slower like
[0:27:21] MrGuwee: your sas on .... radiao something
[0:27:25] loganpod2000: 4 yes
[0:27:27] bandani: you could use some fins too
[0:27:35] mechoriet: seems like the top is super heavy compared to the bottom
[0:27:40] MachineFreak: the faster you go through the air, the harder the correction needed
[0:27:40] officialhunterx: express shippinh
[0:27:42] Poodmund: Fins = Drag = dV losses
[0:27:44] Aldizzert: Doesn't that adjust the gymbal limit, not the rate of movement?
[0:27:49] mechoriet: so it want's to flip naturially
[0:27:51] bandani: send a rescue mission with fins KEKW
[0:27:55] CanYouDigIt7: TWR
[0:27:55] jackmilan123456: You shoulde definetly hotstage
[0:27:59] Tabakhase: exc -> revert to vab - add fins YEP
[0:28:03] iAmpersin: aye this looks good
[0:28:16] mechoriet: then lower thrust KEKW
[0:28:17] CanYouDigIt7: HODL

[0:28:29] MachineFreak: just keep it there
[0:28:31] BDowningNA: thank you!
[0:28:35] MachineFreak: need to get 20-30km
[0:28:36] Talon_Jasra: mach effects. Thicker atmo = lower speed of sound
[0:28:39] CanYouDigIt7: Expand next stage
[0:28:43] Tabakhase: more than twice terminal velocity pepeLaugh
[0:28:44] Mr_2_kills: that is surface speed xD
[0:28:48] bandani: they are the same
[0:29:07] bandani: twr

[0:29:20] CanYouDigIt7: Lost a lot of speed
[0:29:21] silv: monkaX
[0:29:25] hbboia: 8.2k was the release
[0:29:25] Dioxinn: too fast?
[0:29:26] Kavokane: astraoMVPness
[0:29:27] elkarr: 3Gs
[0:29:28] elkarr: lol
[0:29:35] Mr_2_kills: too much
[0:29:42] CanYouDigIt7: That was good
[0:29:44] ToTheMato: gotta feather your boost
[0:29:47] iAmpersin: it flips right when the atmosphere gets thinner LUL
[0:30:00] GubaGauvie: just like when neo popped out of the clouds in the matrix
[0:30:15] Mr_2_kills: less from the spikes more from the gimble is good
[0:30:19] MrGuwee: Clap that's 3 i guess
[0:30:21] lvyEartman: two was over 2
[0:30:27] Mr_2_kills: 5
[0:30:28] Dagmoo: good attempt tho Clap
[0:30:32] loganpod2000: On 5
[0:30:46] bandani: gimble is symetric but not thrust
[0:30:54] Ezeus6969: Maybe we just need a better pilot
[0:30:55] CanYouDigIt7: F5
[0:30:59] Ezeus6969: It's about the pilot not the rocket
[0:31:00] turtles844: your throttle would probably need to be around 65-70?
[0:31:00] Mr_2_kills: F5
[0:31:00] Poodmund: It was a lot better ascending at around 125m/s though.
[0:31:11] CanYouDigIt7: Changing them
[0:31:17] MachineFreak: keep it under 200m/sec
[0:31:21] bandani: no I meant the gimbal changed all of them, but not the button and not thrust KEKW
[0:31:37] Aldizzert: Yeah but you were stable at that speed
[0:31:44] Tabakhase: thats still double of terminal pepeLaugh üí®
[0:31:50] Poodmund: Yeah, when the atmosphere is sooo thick, drag losses are higher than gravity losses, so ascending slow is better
[0:31:50] bandani: but its 'in symmetry'
[0:32:08] turtles844: this is the one boys
[0:32:16] CanYouDigIt7: @Tabakhase Would it be best to stay less than or equal to terminal V?
[0:32:25] bandani: crazy how much fuel you burn here
[0:32:36] vaccaflacca: you where going like 130 the last attempt
[0:32:53] Tabakhase: @CanYouDigIt7 ideally you ride it bang on / slighly below yep

[0:33:02] kylexy3: uuuuuuge
[0:33:10] CanYouDigIt7: Aerospike thrust at 50 too?
[0:33:18] Durabull: did you change 2nd stage to 50%
[0:33:24] CanYouDigIt7: Sweet
[0:33:28] bandani: well yes it makes sense but its still so strange compared to kerbin
[0:33:41] CanYouDigIt7: I would like 400k points Waffle, you got it
[0:33:48] chaoskub: I think the thrust are linked because he used symmetry to create them. The gimbals, he added manually
[0:34:08] silv: @CanYouDigIt7 remember he has to orbit too :)
[0:34:15] EpicTitan232: $4 clouds
[0:34:16] FinnYellowbelly: thicc
[0:34:22] suicidebolt: I love watching you burn fuel and the delta V keep rising
[0:34:22] Accuboormachine: I can think of something else that's thicc Kappa

[0:34:54] hbboia: 8.2k was the releaselast time
[0:35:04] vaccaflacca: i think your distance off planet increased also like 2k m
[0:35:09] CanYouDigIt7: Honestly.... Not bad
[0:35:17] bandani: need about 1.05 to maintain speed

[0:36:57] WolfKnight85: EC?
[0:36:59] bandani: almost like you staged KEKW
[0:37:02] elkarr: sabotage
[0:37:04] Luxen77: thrust lever got stuck
[0:37:05] G1rafFique: Its only 25k altitude, sure its early
[0:37:08] MrGuwee: double space
[0:37:13] warcake: skill issue?
[0:37:13] Fooker: They're going the wrong way
[0:37:14] maccabeus: was that a disconnected engine?
[0:37:15] Darkguenter5: oof
[0:37:16] LVL97Magikarp: its an nbt issue @Giantwaffle
[0:37:16] friesengeist: dont turn with the aerospike stage
[0:37:17] Aripa: i think you got seperated and had no control on the last stage?
[0:37:17] bandani: double staging KEKW
[0:37:18] CanYouDigIt7: Deep breath
[0:37:22] Contestest: OMEGALUL
[0:37:28] Poodmund: Pitching over at 20km on Eve is like starting a gravity turn at 4km on Kerbin
[0:37:31] CanYouDigIt7: Leaves now?
[0:37:34] 0_joonaa_0: what is the challenge
[0:37:35] GoodOldXijan: just never turn :D
[0:37:39] Mr_2_kills: don't turn at all
[0:37:40] MrGuwee: @Giantwaffle when you turn dont get the marker outside the green prograde thing
[0:37:42] AleXanDreMau: 7?
[0:37:44] hbboia: after the decoupling
[0:37:45] ShayeBlackwood: After dropping stage 2 maybe?
[0:37:47] Mr_2_kills: lets see if you can escape without turning first
[0:37:49] Mr_2_kills: 7 yes
[0:37:49] waterlimon: check stagings
[0:38:01] Dioxinn: Aerospike stage was already at 30%, just finish it
[0:38:02] Mr_2_kills: lower the 3rd stage aerospike thrust
[0:38:09] GuardMoony: Up the aerospike a little ? 55%
[0:38:10] shzbr: @Giantwaffle wait until leaving the second atm stage
[0:38:12] Fishinchips9: "Uh mr strimmer you're suposed to be going up" :)
[0:38:13] MrGuwee: @Giantwaffle go up all the way..then intercept with another craft !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
[0:38:16] warcake: what if you pitch over straight away?
[0:38:17] bandani: @Mr_2_kills you have to go straight up on eve for quite a bit because of the atmosphere
[0:38:18] CanYouDigIt7: 55
[0:38:22] plattnotpratt: staging issue
[0:38:22] Dagmoo: it is different for Eve though right
[0:38:35] waterlimon: the atmosphere so dense, if you empty all tanks, you will float to the top
[0:38:38] MrGuwee: @Giantwaffle go up all the way..then intercept with another craft !!!!!!!
[0:38:45] GuardMoony: 1 is off
[0:38:47] loganpod2000: What attempt we on?
[0:38:51] GuardMoony: nice
[0:38:54] authorized411: what not have the limiter at FULL then control the thrust regularly?
[0:38:58] Dagmoo: 6 right?
[0:38:58] Bumblebeeman_: this is 8
[0:39:02] chaoskub: Middle?
[0:39:03] Ving3fyr: F5
[0:39:04] Dioxinn: f5
[0:39:05] Dagmoo: oh
[0:39:06] MrGuwee: @loganpod2000 first..what do you mean ?
[0:39:11] bandani: honestly, if you could take off 2 of the aerospikes and leave em there, you dont seem to need them in that stage
[0:39:15] EpicTitan232: you really can't make a grav turn till 34 km ish
[0:39:16] loganpod2000: Lol @mrguwee nice try
[0:39:16] 0_joonaa_0: what is the challenge now
[0:39:20] Tabakhase: the straigh-up thing is actually not even THAT inefficent in the grand scale LUL
[0:39:25] Poodmund: @Dagmoo A gravity turn is a gravity turn no matter where you are, the differing factor is atmospheric characteristics, a thicker atmosphere requires a more vertical ascent profile.
[0:39:30] silv: grav turn at 25K Prayge
[0:39:32] Troupster: it's jebs fault
[0:39:33] GubaGauvie: oo thats an interesting idea bandani
[0:39:37] Contestest: Prayge
[0:39:42] ConspiracyStoryTime: @0_joonaa_0 leaving
[0:39:43] Veru_Smol: Stability is set to radial?
[0:39:46] GubaGauvie: he ditched the ladders already tho
[0:39:55] vaccaflacca: do the engines get smaller as you stage off or is it just the tanks that make it look like it
[0:40:05] bandani: cause aerospikes are heavy AF it sucks to have 6 at 60% when you could have 4 at 90-100%
[0:40:06] Tabakhase: narrator: or so he thought...
[0:40:13] 0_joonaa_0: @420munk i mean is it still to land on all five jool moons
[0:40:17] CanYouDigIt7: @bandani Smaht Smaht
[0:40:22] Dagmoo: @poodmund yeah thats what i was thinking. his brain is so programmed on whats best at Kerbin and Eve is different because of atmosphere
[0:40:24] warcake: those engines were getting even more efficient the higher you went too
[0:40:31] Poodmund: You can see how high the drag is because even at like 1.25 TWR your speed is staying the same i.e. you're wasting 20% of the thrust/fuel on drag
[0:40:32] Thegrinch6: F5?
[0:40:35] cozyntoasty: @Tabakhase yeah its how we all got to orbit the first few times before we found out what a gravity turn was
[0:40:42] MachineFreak: 30m/sec better than last time
[0:41:09] silv: spin to stabalise :)

[0:41:18] DoublesConches: launching through thick soup today I see
[0:41:21] SirKrall2: is this a lot of atmosphere to get through?
[0:41:21] MrGuwee: now press and hold q
[0:41:28] MachineFreak: out of the blue strip on the atmosphere, then start think of turning
[0:41:29] bandani: speed is scary tbh
[0:41:34] Thegrinch6: F5 now?
[0:41:35] friesengeist: up up up
[0:42:07] maccabeus: we can probably turn nowish and be safe
[0:42:15] GuardMoony: 26.5k on the spikes not bad

[0:42:16] Dagmoo: PauseChamp

[0:44:00] Mr_2_kills: AGAIN
[0:44:07] friesengeist: i would have used a pod too
[0:44:07] Tabakhase: there was a BIG if in that sentence tho pepeLaugh
[0:44:17] MrGuwee: @Giantwaffle you are falling mahdewd :D
[0:44:20] Poodmund: Might want to ensure that you after pointing exactly prograde on staging, i.e. 0 degree angle of attack
[0:44:21] Tro95: Do you have a reaction wheel?
[0:44:22] warcake: id keep the speed lower in the atmo, you were gaining so much DV as you gained alt
[0:44:30] GuardMoony: the 3rd stage needs a bit tweaking
[0:44:57] ConspiracyStoryTime: seems like 3rd stave was to strong
[0:45:07] bandani: @Giantwaffle what about taking off 2 of the aerospikes to save weight
[0:45:09] maccabeus: could we manually spin to help this?
[0:45:15] hbboia: what if you could go super vertical until you left the atmo
[0:45:28] MrGuwee: leave 1 kerbal on eve to reduce weight Kappa
[0:45:34] sogerr: last stage has a lot of delta v, maybe go straight up until last one and go horizontal when out of atmo?
[0:45:37] Mr_2_kills: Rapid deconstruction time
[0:45:37] Ving3fyr: we told you bro !
[0:45:40] ConspiracyStoryTime: can u spin for stabilization
[0:45:41] Zucate: he cant let the kerbals out of the seats no anyway

[0:45:59] Nexhunter: how many failures have I missed
[0:46:02] lvyEartman: slightly turn and go programed, really ease into it
[0:46:06] bandani: they might be too heavy, but you would have to go back to an earlier save for
[0:46:07] MrGuwee: @Giantwaffle set it to 69
[0:46:11] mechoriet: @Nexhunter KEKW alot

[0:46:48] Mr_2_kills: we do a bit of gaslighting
[0:46:49] CanYouDigIt7: Eyes only on TWR
[0:46:49] Tro95: Are you able to induce a spin to increase stability?
[0:46:51] Troupster: you can hit f9 to check Kappa
[0:46:53] loganpod2000: Attempt number?
[0:46:53] 1killersquirrel: @authorized411 didn't hit F5 himself OneGuy
[0:46:54] imissautoattacks: man I'm about to install this game again
[0:47:04] Mr_2_kills: attempt 8 pretty sure
[0:47:05] willi7sej: waffleBoi
[0:47:12] arnnav7: I am amazed at the large difference between eve and gilly
[0:47:14] bandani: the open cockpit saves weight, but i wonder how much drag its producing
[0:47:20] willi7sej: waffleboi
[0:47:26] Tabakhase: while i fully belive that you pressed the button --- im also 100% certain you would have fully ignored a "CAN NOT SAVE WHILE xYZ" error on your screen YEP
[0:47:30] CanYouDigIt7: Rough
[0:47:35] bandani: cause its flipping the craft every time
[0:47:43] MachineFreak: that was a -30m/sec transition compared to last time
[0:47:43] GuardMoony: that's gone hurd lost so much speed
[0:47:44] authorized411: F12 aero drag help you with this?

[0:59:22] Squeedlee: turn on phase 2 right before dropping first?
[0:59:24] press3forcookies: maybe burn them all at once before dropping the stage?
[0:59:28] Ksolo24: can't you fire stage 3 first, then detach
[0:59:30] Mr_2_kills: I think you should go slower still
[0:59:35] Tabakhase: gotta go real slow... 50ms or so, 100@10k, 200@20k...
[0:59:36] MrGuwee: when you stage first time
[0:59:43] Ehemil: are you streaming the statship launches this year? :D
[0:59:44] ZonkedSr: you lose speed, you have to stay on the throttle longer to get the speed back up, less fuel per stage
[0:59:45] MrGuwee: thats what i was trying to say :D
[0:59:46] Nemotodd: is this planet is so nasty or the construction problem?
[0:59:47] cozyntoasty: PauseChamp

[1:00:53] MrGuwee: @Giantwaffle isnt radial out constantly trying to calculate and that might be an issue because he moves slightly ? ? what if you put sas only up ??

[1:01:23] Poodmund: @Giantwaffle you could set the fuel priorities on the tanks to drain the tanks from bottom to top for each stage, having the CoM high will be more stable.

[1:05:38] Talon_Jasra: The verniors can be seperated from the main throttle
[1:05:42] Exordium_world: 1.7 and suddenly 2.7
[1:05:43] AleXanDreMau: @Giantwaffle it jumps the dv from 1.5 to 1.7 to 2.5 or above!
[1:05:50] Poodmund: I wanna suggest the fuel priority trick again but dont wanna spam :D
[1:05:52] deadgolfer: right now it is at 2.3
[1:05:52] omar_i_: try to switch stage before reaching that low fuel level
[1:05:56] 1killersquirrel: The problem is you are top heavy, when you don't have enough fuel you can't balance the center of gravity @Giantwaffle
[1:05:56] deadgolfer: and climbing
[1:05:57] Immp: TWR was less than 2. when it flippped it jumped...
[1:06:07] warcake: if you go slower, can you reduce the aero forces on the ship?
[1:06:07] deadgolfer: TWR is 2.6
[1:06:11] Poodmund: @1killersquirrel Top heavy is good, draggy at the top is bad.
[1:06:11] MrGuwee: @Giantwaffle please after you stabilize change sas and dont leave it on radial out ...

[1:07:51] Twin5un: double
[1:07:54] Twin5un: what you ahve
[1:07:56] DJ_ZG: lol
[1:07:59] silv: nice sounds
[1:08:00] StAult: The current ascension mid-flight profile works till Alt 24km. at24km mid-flight adjustment for Gimble, thrust might be needed
[1:08:01] ÂÜ∑Âáç„Çπ„Ç§„Ç´: seqS
[1:08:01] 0omkins: Did we land on eve yet did I miss it?
[1:08:01] Nemotodd: Dank
[1:08:02] mechoriet: WAYTOODANK these engine sounds holy
[1:08:03] Arcinae: WAYTOODANK
[1:08:03] MontySmilez: WutFace
[1:08:05] maccabeus: monkaHmm
[1:08:05] MrGuwee: how high can you go ?
[1:08:06] Tabakhase: harmonics are go YEP
[1:08:06] CowofJustice: welp, we're ending this with a bang
[1:08:07] LethalBro: Bwaaaah
[1:08:08] Mr_2_kills: you need to do it at like 100k not 120, that little bit of height takes so much
[1:08:08] TigerLuv: val, come get us?
[1:08:08] cmmeth: lawnmower WAYTOODANK
[1:08:09] namesnonames: the sas was being weird because it switched to orbit mode. the "normal" vector means something completely different in orbit mode
[1:08:09] MrGuwee: go only up ?
[1:08:14] LVL97Magikarp: well thats why, your engines sound broke lol
[1:08:24] SailorWS: how high vertically can you get?
[1:08:26] mhewx3: brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
[1:08:27] Poodmund: @1killersquirrel A rocket is stable when the centre of thrust is at the bottom and the centre of mass is as high as possible. The reason it is flipping is because the centre of pressure (drag) is so high and large and the centre of mass of the stage is so low.
[1:08:38] CanYouDigIt7: ^^^
[1:08:40] nighttron: You lost like 1km in the first stage @giantwaffle
[1:08:43] Mr_2_kills: now jetpack into orbit xD
[1:08:52] daedmissica0: 150k time to do flight by
[1:08:54] granularbit: if the atmosphere is so thick then why not a plane?
[1:09:02] MachineFreak: @Poodmund and its continiusly getting lower as well as the fuel is burned
[1:09:06] MrGuwee: 163
[1:09:13] SheepsAholy: game autosaved
[1:09:14] Poodmund: @MachineFreak Exactly
[1:09:15] CanYouDigIt7: @Poodmund has a great suggestion
[1:09:23] Cassius038: can u get the kerb in orbit with the jet packs
[1:09:25] AleXanDreMau: so 14 it is!
[1:09:28] loganpod2000: On 14
[1:09:39] Mr_2_kills: maybe hardsave?
[1:09:40] gamabunt: darn did i mis the start?
[1:09:44] Poodmund: So setting the fuel tank priorities to drain from the bottom to the top will keep CoM high on each stage and make it more stable.
[1:09:47] mhewx3: softsvae?
[1:09:52] Defu: never did trust no autosave
[1:09:57] Talon_Jasra: So, those verniors can be removed from the main throttle. That might help
[1:10:06] MurderusTemp: @Poodmund that makes sense
[1:10:08] AleXanDreMau: @gamabunt still in the same place so you did not lose mutch only 13 atemps
[1:10:09] Mr_2_kills: try turing on a few of the top engines at the 4th stage?
[1:10:12] 1killersquirrel: @Poodmund Hmm, I think I get it now, I was having a brain fart
[1:10:16] Tabakhase: @Cassius038 jetpack has around 600ms dV i think
[1:10:26] AleXanDreMau: @gamabunt now on the 14
[1:10:30] StAult: Bet if we are gonna get further than 24km alt without flipping! :D
[1:10:33] gamabunt: TrollDespair
[1:10:33] Tro95: When do you consider a rescue mission?
[1:10:34] Tabakhase: might be from before the patch?
[1:10:45] Mr_2_kills: its 600
[1:10:50] copperspikes: it is around 500-600 dv for jetpacks
[1:11:12] Xicer_TV: take it out of radial and put it on stability assist
[1:11:20] SailorWS: is it worth lowering the thrust more on the first stage? Idk how ksp works
[1:11:21] zooloo10: anyone know what version of ksp he is using? I tried to install the modpack but got some version errors one every 1.12.x version
[1:11:23] MrGuwee: take it out of radial and put it on stability assist
[1:11:23] Poodmund: @1killersquirrel Thats cool, imagine balancing a broom on your hand and pushing upwards, your hand is the rocket motor. When the heavy broom head is at the top, its more stable to push the broom up. When the heavy broom head is on your hand, the broom is very unstable and hard to balance. Its all about torque moments.
[1:11:27] MrGuwee: @Giantwaffle please take it out of radial and put it on stability assist
[1:11:33] AleXanDreMau: if he sends rescue it +5 to gamba and Its Payday time!
[1:11:35] Alamose: honestly, I look forward to that, since it sounds like fun to watch content
[1:11:36] CanYouDigIt7: Prograde
[1:11:37] Tabakhase: @zooloo10 thats expected
[1:11:41] ProjectBeeks: have you tried rolling to make a ballistic trajectory without SAS?
[1:11:43] TigerLuv: Where is Val? Chat
[1:11:44] SmileyVR: A spaceplane would have an easier time on eve.
[1:11:44] Aldizzert: You're gonna match a suborbital loft?
[1:11:47] MrGuwee: i saw that but the ship was also fighting ....
[1:11:54] ProjectBeeks: Eve's tough no matter what tho
[1:12:08] copperspikes: jet packs have a lot more delta v than you think they do
[1:12:09] spotchious: can we watch drag?
[1:12:21] Mr_2_kills: reduce all the aerospikes manually
[1:12:24] Mr_2_kills: not the gimbals
[1:12:26] CanYouDigIt7: RMB on gimbal engines
[1:12:32] namesnonames: be aware of switch to orbit mode when using radial out
[1:12:33] GubaGauvie: you can action group that probably
[1:12:35] zooloo10: @Tabakhase 1.12.3 seemed to give me the least problems with only palettes being bad probably good enough?
[1:12:36] DrunkOrNah: Can you set up a control group?
[1:12:40] CanYouDigIt7: Yeah that
[1:12:42] Mr_2_kills: yes
[1:12:46] CanYouDigIt7: Doit
[1:12:48] lvyEartman: that seems smart
[1:12:57] StAult: Gimble change at 20km alt?
[1:13:01] spotchious: can you drain from the top first?
[1:13:05] hbboia: can you use the top engines as a gimbal helper?
[1:13:31] spotchious: maybe change fuel priority?
[1:13:31] weasel9999: COGGERS weeeee
[1:13:31] Moobot: You can find Waffle's Youtube channel here - https://youtube.com/giantwaffle
[1:13:34] StAult: 23.5 km this time :D
[1:13:43] Aldizzert: Maybe stage early?
[1:13:48] Dioxinn: It's only a 100dv, you can stage early?
[1:13:49] MrGuwee: @Giantwaffle what if you turn now ???
[1:13:58] MrGuwee: uh ok
[1:13:59] CanYouDigIt7: @MrGuwee Flip
[1:14:15] 112nuno112: maybe you can try not emptying the fuel tanks so the center of mass does not rise up to the point that it makes you flip
[1:14:18] Twin5un: I feel like there is a gravity turn somewhere at some point before reachign space
[1:14:22] MrGuwee: @CanYouDigIt7 next stage..this one seems to have control
[1:14:27] AleXanDreMau: @MrGuwee no good still have atmo. grav turn only at >60k or even 70k
[1:14:34] JordanMilly: @Twin5un There is, yes
[1:14:35] TylerPythonic: Can you not do a gravity turn at like~27k? atmosphere seems to be not that heavy?
[1:14:38] Gbusrt: think the kerbils are dead they not moving or reacting
[1:14:40] maccabeus: PauseChamp
[1:14:41] zooloo10: what if you stage it so it only uses 3 engines and 3 tanks, then drop those and turn ont he other 3 so the CG doesnt get all wonky?
[1:14:41] Tabakhase: @zooloo10 pretty sure hes on latest - mods yelling about not being tested with "this" version is pretty normal and generally not an issue these days (not much movement in the code anymore)
[1:14:48] cozyntoasty: @Giantwaffle still need 2.6k delta v to orbit
[1:14:48] GubaGauvie: this might pop out into space
[1:14:50] silv: @Wave4Anal pepeLaugh
[1:14:53] Talon_Jasra: being the 1400 tanks. draining from the "top" isn't a thing sadly :(
[1:14:54] 1killersquirrel: @Giantwaffle Have you tried to have the craft rotate as you go higher and start the gravity turn during max rotation speed?
[1:14:55] zooloo10: ok thanks :)
[1:14:59] TigerLuv: if you used the top set of thrusters, before the ones below it, that would keep the mass down?
[1:15:00] spotchious: ur in space
[1:15:07] fuhlavaflave: we're doin it
[1:15:10] spotchious: ur ap is in space
[1:15:18] philip0524: @Giantwaffle have you watched for all mankind?
[1:15:19] cozyntoasty: dont have enough delta v to orbit now :/
[1:15:21] HipHopsicle: we're all in space
[1:15:22] Poodmund: 90km is Eve atmo limit, spotchious
[1:15:36] ZonkedSr: If you're out of atmosphere, why would the ship be so unstable?
[1:15:46] silv: @ZonkedWSU gravity
[1:15:55] lvyEartman: ap is getting high
[1:15:56] SmileyVR: 90k
[1:15:57] DecoyOcelot: PauseChamp
[1:16:07] Poodmund: Kerbals weigh 60kg
[1:16:07] Dagmoo: normal now?
[1:16:07] Narcotical: Technically in space now arent you]
[1:16:12] JordyOnTheForge: Sit still Jeb!
[1:16:14] MrGuwee: @Giantwaffle leave 1 kerbal on the planet
[1:16:15] DecoyOcelot: kick one out
[1:16:15] YepLucky: too many snacks
[1:16:17] ailelol: they ate the fourth one
[1:16:19] omar_i_: leave one behind Kappa
[1:16:19] Karnaxx: Shame we can't trim
[1:16:19] ImNotDonut_: sacrifice one...
[1:16:21] ranroll: lean LEFT
[1:16:21] Tabakhase: why did you put 4 and not 3 seats btw?
[1:16:23] Daxstyle: How dare you call Jebediah mentally unstable
[1:16:23] TigerLuv: and they aren't spread equally
[1:16:24] ranroll: lean RIGHT
[1:16:24] Noblez_: You could yeet one out
[1:16:25] Mr_2_kills: collateral
[1:16:25] DatoPotatoDato: its time to push jeb off
[1:16:26] arkun_: Time to start drawing straws
[1:16:27] LethalBro: PauseChamp
[1:16:27] ranroll: lean BACK
[1:16:28] Ksolo24: sacrifice one
[1:16:28] mhewx3: leave one
[1:16:30] Dsdoggos: Kick one out:)
[1:16:31] GubaGauvie: you could shut down an engine to balance it out
[1:16:33] Squeedlee: sacrificeeeeeeee
[1:16:33] Kellorian: It's like the Kerbals are riding a bullet
[1:16:33] spotchious: @Giantwaffle could we rebuild their seats as a triangle on Eve?
[1:16:34] ImNotDonut_: we will close our eyes if you do
[1:16:36] ZonkedSr: have you looked for another kerbal on planet?
[1:16:36] mechoriet: @Noblez_ D: WOT
[1:16:38] Aldizzert: To save one for the rescue mission KEKW
[1:16:39] Biskit427: Haha time to stack them all on top of each other in the middle of the ship :D
[1:16:41] Regzz03: sacrifice all of them and it will balance out PogChamp
[1:16:41] SheepsAholy: let the kerbals pick straws on who stays and who goes
[1:16:44] Jerryspringernl: Add a dummy
[1:16:45] fuzzehpanda1: have the kerbal that's throwing the weight off cling to the top of the rocket
[1:16:46] MrGuwee: over 300 Clap
[1:16:48] MrGuwee: almost
[1:16:49] gamabunt: Did Waffle try to go Slower to go faster.? 1-part atmo below 100 m/s 2 part below 170 m/s 3 part 250 m/s after 65 k 100% thrust.?
[1:16:49] MrGuwee: heh
[1:16:55] GubaGauvie: thats rescuable
[1:16:57] Noblez_: @mechoriet For the sake of the others!
[1:16:57] mhewx3: what would you do? all 3 dead or leave 1 and save 2
[1:16:57] Xicer_TV: use the engineer to redistribute the seats!
[1:17:00] Mr_2_kills: you can do better
[1:17:02] authorized411: in order to get to orbit, you'd have to do gravity turn with the last 3 stages based on the remaining dV alone
[1:17:09] Nexhunter: if you don't flip you can hit the 300k KEKW
[1:17:10] SailorWS: can you move seats with engineer
[1:17:12] SailorWS: ?
[1:17:21] zooloo10: use their jetpacks to get you into orbit KEKW
[1:17:21] orangecreamsicle3: PauseChamp
[1:17:23] wraith303: Timing the encounter will be tough
[1:17:24] slyjedi: Final boss hard
[1:17:25] helioph0b: leave one behind
[1:17:28] Aldizzert: Even if you intercept, your speeds will be wildly different
[1:17:29] Dagmoo: the problem is they will be going so slow at ap right?
[1:17:30] silv: ice ASMR
[1:17:32] Squeedlee: put a bag of rocks in th 4th seat
[1:17:34] SailorWS: ditch 1 seat and have it even weight?
[1:17:35] brightcandle: You are only going to get maybe a minute in rescue time, that is a lot
[1:17:35] AleXanDreMau: 15 ?
[1:17:38] MoreShotsPlease: matt damon could do it
[1:17:38] Poodmund: Yeah could you remove 1 seat and then reposition the seats at 120 degrees?
[1:17:39] Xerlean: Slingshot it back home
[1:17:42] CardboardBoaner: can you stage early so you arent flippin around getting you higher
[1:17:42] spotchious: might as well jetpack one and see where it gets you :D
[1:17:47] loganpod2000: What attempt does this not count?
[1:17:47] sogerr: eva rcs to push?
[1:17:50] ripper998: no shot your getting this in space dude
[1:17:54] redaccs: drop stage before you start flip ? @Giantwaffle
[1:17:55] NexX_____: yeah good luck with that
[1:17:55] GubaGauvie: oh ye not rescueable with that craft. you need one with giga twr
[1:17:56] Nemotodd: Do you have satellite here? Can you transfer Curbs one by one to other vessel?
[1:17:57] Nexhunter: kerbal will go splat
[1:18:00] RoninStorm: the deltaV to make that catch will be insane
[1:18:03] bandani: you need a craft with something like 7k dv
[1:18:09] DecoyOcelot: 400 and dropping, it will be closer to 0 at apo
[1:18:16] Squeedlee: a biiiig net
[1:18:19] Tabakhase: and all of that in under a minute or so - so we gotta claw, no eva KEKW
[1:18:19] bandani: and you have to be in the area
[1:18:20] CardboardBoaner: put jeb out and push with jetpack
[1:18:20] Mr_2_kills: I feel like you could get quite a bit more verticle speed
[1:18:22] mhewx3: sounds like a plan
[1:18:23] daedmissica0: just mark watney the shit out of it
[1:18:24] Aldizzert: Krakentech could do it NODDERS
[1:18:25] SmileyVR: Gonna have to rendez-vous at 91k
[1:18:27] Mr_2_kills: what if you just get a lower orbit
[1:18:28] echoJjonas: Aerospike engines are cool on Eve, but a Vector engine is almost mandatory. The high gimbal capability is what is gonna make your ship stabe at about 30km, which is where you should start your gravity turn
[1:18:31] Gamledrengg: Is it possible to start gravity turn at like 55k? or 60k
[1:18:37] Fishinchips9: How much dV to circularize here
[1:18:39] aundros: Go back and design a better ship for this task? But add a refuel from space before entering atmo for eve before?
[1:18:40] Jerryspringernl: You actually must fall into the planet for a moment and then back orbit again
[1:18:43] JordanMilly: Basically, it's going to fly by at over 2km/s to not make him a smear on the windscreen
[1:18:47] VirtualVoyager: just got here... is this the first try?
[1:18:51] Mr_2_kills: lower orbit you have much more verticle velocity, which is a much easier rescue
[1:18:57] gamabunt: @Giantwaffle Did Waffle try to go Slower to go faster.? 1-part atmo below 100 m/s 2 part below 170 m/s 3 part 250 m/s after 65 k 100% thrust.?
[1:18:59] Dagmoo: just send a double rescue mission. 2 crafts one to catch them and get back in a circular orbit, and a second to get home
[1:19:05] Dioxinn: Just stage early
[1:19:07] loganpod2000: On 15
[1:19:07] Tro95: You could send another craft with an engineer and extra parts to land and fix this craft
[1:19:09] SailorWS: deadgolfer youre good.
[1:19:10] daedmissica0: you stage with 100dv lefr
[1:19:13] TigerLuv: can you throw out that 4th seat, and spread the others around (balance)
[1:19:13] daedmissica0: left
[1:19:20] authorized411: @Fishinchips9 8000 dv under perfect conditions. more like 12,000 dv
[1:19:23] silv: this is nr 16?
[1:19:23] CardboardBoaner: stage early so it doesnt become unstable
[1:19:24] SailorWS: oh is ironman banned?
[1:19:26] SailorWS: KEKW
[1:19:33] loganpod2000: 15
[1:19:34] AleXanDreMau: 15

[1:19:57] silv: @SailorWS its the ... in there

[1:19:59] VirtualVoyager: try 15? damn i missed some crashes.. XD
[1:20:08] ok_juju: i think you need to throttle down in lower parts of the armo to have more fuel higher up for more efficency
[1:20:17] Squeedlee: ironman
[1:20:17] Rawb_: KEKW
[1:20:18] DrunkOrNah: lol

[1:27:10] Yakobro: can you grav turn a little sooner? idk
[1:27:11] Dioxinn: lower the orbit?
[1:27:15] 1killersquirrel: Waffle factor should've been 45% not 30%
[1:27:16] DrunkOrNah: If all three pushed at once.
[1:27:17] aundros: Im sure you can find 600dv from somewhere
[1:27:18] authorized411: on the last 3 stages you have a bit over 4000 dV, you'd have to start turning then.
[1:27:19] SailorWS: Can you just orbit the kerbals by themselves?
[1:27:22] Gamledrengg: maybe if you keep the speed lower you can turn early
[1:27:23] Gamledrengg: ye
[1:27:24] Mr_2_kills: what was the verticle speed? at apo
[1:27:25] SailorWS: and catch them solo?
[1:27:32] felipe2p2: maybe you can improve your launch and get it to orbit
[1:27:33] Tabakhase: optimized ascend may just do it... gotta go about half the speed - and then throttle out
[1:27:34] Webmaster2001: maybe sacrafice a lower orbit for a better escape vector? @Giantwaffle
[1:27:34] CanYouDigIt7: Yep, being off by 600 isn't much
[1:27:38] CanYouDigIt7: Plus lower orbit
[1:27:40] CodyAsano: you can sqeak a little more out i believe
[1:27:42] Nemotodd: @SailorWS That would be amazing :) Space grapes

[1:27:46] CanYouDigIt7: 90,500
[1:27:52] ok_juju: try less throttle lower in the atmo
[1:27:54] authorized411: 91 for safety
[1:27:57] AleXanDreMau: 16 ? PauseChamp ? pay out?
[1:28:00] press3forcookies: staging before dropping could keep you from losing deltaV
[1:28:01] Tro95: You could remove a few engines from the 1st stage
[1:28:03] SailorWS: youre best stage 1 was 9.8 km i think
[1:28:07] ramzie0: does circularizing at 90k give you much room for a rescue?
[1:28:07] loganpod2000: On 16 payout

[1:47:00] Narcotical: @Spoopy_Ghost That's a lie all women tell
[1:47:08] Dagmoo: yeah can you use engi to rearrange seats to 3 symmetry?
[1:47:12] Poodmund: an aerospike uses the atmospheric pressure to effectively create the shape of the engine bell.
[1:47:16] CanYouDigIt7: 14k
[1:47:18] Aldizzert: 14k
[1:47:19] Tabakhase: NODDERS
[1:47:21] Mr_2_kills: it do be insane hole damn
[1:47:25] HipHopAnonymous23: Kerbin's atmo is soup
[1:47:34] Tabakhase: gotta go real slow... 50ms or so, 100@10k, 200@20k...
[1:47:39] Squeedlee: chicken soup?
[1:47:41] DonGromus: Sea Dragon PogChamp
[1:47:46] Webmaster2001: oatmeal
[1:47:46] Squeedlee: Wedding soup?
[1:47:46] Mr_2_kills: what is kerbin vs earth?
[1:48:00] iAmpersin: the flip happens right when the atmosphere gets extremely thin and thats on programming tbh D:
[1:48:01] SailorWS: youre losing stuff to drag
[1:48:04] TigerLuv: Tilts head... could we float up?
[1:48:11] kasetv: test it
[1:48:11] silv: decent 1st stage
[1:48:13] lvyEartman: is eve comaprable with venus?
[1:48:14] SailorWS: your best stage 1 was 9.8 km
[1:48:20] iAmpersin: @lvyEartman aye it is venus
[1:48:21] Mr_2_kills: drag = X*v^2, so higher speed always much worse
[1:48:28] Tabakhase: its not like its up to you to decide that pepeLaugh
[1:48:31] nighttron: 10km was your best
[1:48:36] Narcotical: A game theory
[1:48:38] authorized411: this is when you bring some liquid helium and a baloon
[1:48:46] Mr_2_kills: bad theory
[1:48:48] Brianmose12: COGGERS
[1:48:59] Poodmund: @Giantwaffle your verticle velocity low down is staying consistent yet your TWR is like 1.3, so you're wasting like 25% of that thrust (and therefore fuel) to fight drag losses.
[1:49:01] Slash_Ignore: LUL
[1:49:01] authorized411: aero overlay?
[1:49:02] SailorWS: that one was 8km
[1:49:03] Jaydepps00: i wonder, is there's a graph for optimal m/s per altitude? PepoThink @Giantwaffle
[1:49:04] 1killersquirrel: Let's try the slow and steady method
[1:49:05] Betelgeussse: Do the highest thrust will be most effective in that atmosphere pressure?
[1:49:06] nighttron: 8,5
[1:49:11] WolfKnight85: Rescue mission inc
[1:49:38] echoJjonas: Keep below mach speed on Eve, which is about 200m/s
[1:49:41] wraith303: I think it should be under 150 for stage 1, under 200 for stage 2
[1:49:42] Squeedlee: I like the bubbles
[1:49:47] TigerLuv: can we get in one of those bubbles, and float up?
[1:49:58] Mr_2_kills: bubbles or clouds?
[1:50:02] Barracuda_DIO: What are the bubbles made out of tho
[1:50:03] wezo_: Is there any metric in-game that tells you your fuel consumption by speed gain?
[1:50:05] Rahst: has he tried spin stabalization?
[1:50:18] insmett1elf: 2$ bubbles confirmed Kappa

[1:50:44] Strider1515: KEKW
[1:50:44] WolfKnight85: Flip stabalization works too
[1:50:50] jackmilan123456: There is also gravity loss
[1:50:51] Slash_Ignore: back to the pit
[1:50:53] TallicDragon: low TWR = gravity losses
[1:50:55] HipHopAnonymous23: You need to get up and out
[1:51:00] Rahst: really learn spin stabalization with RP-0
[1:51:05] VirtualVoyager: fast first stage and than control second stage under 200 m/s
[1:51:07] Mr_2_kills: just keep experimenting
[1:51:10] Webmaster2001: use up your dV while you have the kenetic energy

[1:51:57] Slash_Ignore: 166
[1:51:57] Derpingston00: mach's crazy drag, you need as little of that as possible
[1:51:58] HarbingerNo9: after 5k go 200
[1:52:09] vaccaflacca: what day did you build this rocket so i can watch vod? anyone know
[1:52:18] CardboardBoaner: 150 then 180 after stage
[1:52:18] Airels: Good morning @Giantwaffle , why do you, Lirik and Shorty not do night streams anymore?
[1:52:19] Mr_2_kills: I never thought about the speed of sound being different in a different atmosphere
[1:52:23] Mr_2_kills: yesterday lol
[1:52:24] ForgottenTime: when the planet starts mocking you shrug
[1:52:28] HipHopAnonymous23: Might be useful to have the aero display up. Shows dynamic pressure
[1:52:35] Barracuda_DIO: What if you do something like 150 and then increase by 10 every 1000 meters
[1:52:36] ForgottenTime: @airels, its been like 4 years bro
[1:52:42] HarbingerNo9: punch it
[1:52:45] RegDenied: oh god still in the thick part

[1:53:11] zooloo10: 9.5/6
[1:53:13] SeriousPotatoBot: Prayge
[1:53:18] CardboardBoaner: got to 180
[1:53:21] SailorWS: now 180?
[1:53:23] Brianmose12: POGGIES
[1:53:28] Mr_2_kills: but thats gas to liquid, not gas to gas
[1:53:44] HipHopAnonymous23: Were you taking off from sea level?

[1:55:43] HTxNighthawk: @Nexhunter so where do i start
[1:55:49] ArJacksonn: @HTxNighthawk yeh problably don't get into coding because you want to be a game dev, a lot of companies give really shit work/life and have a lot of pressure on you
[1:55:49] Mr_2_kills: lol
[1:55:50] RegDenied: I'd start turning a bit earlier
[1:55:51] vaccaflacca: @HTxNighthawk 100% c++ if you want to game dev, not easy to start but if you master it

[1:56:39] ForgottenTime: prepare your COGGERS chat

[1:58:26] Dagmoo: 8.9
[1:58:36] CardboardBoaner: 9.6 vs 8.9
[1:58:36] Dagmoo: 9.6 last time
[1:58:39] Mr_2_kills: try 140 then
[1:58:39] HarbingerNo9: i think it took you too long to accel
[1:58:46] Dioxinn: Took you a long time to accelerate there
[1:58:54] TheWonderLlama: Drag eating all mah lift D"
[1:58:55] Fettor: @HTxNighthawk Funny you ask, I work both in C++ and Python these days, Python is easier to learn yes, there are a lot of similarities between C++ and Python. If you just want a job programming Python is a great place to be right now, but if you're passionate about programming then you'll most probably learn both :)
[1:59:01] TuxLafitte: Brave Kerbals are away! danF
[1:59:01] ForgottenTime: just a thought what if you keep the same plane with the third Kerbal like hes on the top and you only gimbal in that axis. strictly for balance

[1:59:42] Nexhunter: @HTxNighthawk cause if you wanna just code for coding sakes then you do elite hacker bs and shit but if you want to be serious start with planning a project either be like a calculator for dV calculations for KSP or a minecraft inventory system then go from there to figuring out okay what language can I use and what is "easy" to understand cause it super high level
[1:59:42] ForgottenTime: it would have been if you never tried KEKW

[2:02:50] suicidebolt: He would have to make his rescue by somehow getting this down to where he can touch space and get his horizontal speed maxed and then picking up the kerbals with another vehicle while he is in space briefly. To do that he needs to know the timing he will hit and a predictable path of travel. Will be extremely cool to watch if it comes to that

[2:24:07] Muster_: @Aldizzert that'd be sick
[2:24:13] MrGuwee: @giantwaffle when u burn retrograde shift it slightly in the opposite direction. that way you push the marker on the target

[2:24:59] Scerion_TX: RCS Build Aid still a thing? Was the best mod for balancing RCS

[2:27:14] Weblay: the flip is nominal
[2:27:15] SirApocalipsys: flip = celebration that you are still in atmo
[2:27:17] Aldizzert: The flip is an ullage maneuver to settle the fuel in the tanks.

[2:28:02] echoJjonas: some people have played already
[2:28:17] TheRealWaz_: Squad gave some KSP streamers early access to the game and they said it's in great hands

[2:42:54] Mr_2_kills: anything under 1 is negligble
[2:43:23] SirApocalipsys: the deltav for plane change in higher orbits are less expensive
