[0:59:48] RaniWasACyborg: Getting your stuff back, finding a huge iron ore deposit and finishing a really cool building and just standing inside it to admire it all = 3 best feelings :D

[1:01:11] 0ntan1o: and that's fine
[1:01:50] True_Chord: I see shaders, but I’m guessing no actual “mods”.
[1:01:50] Azuremoon13: so how is the Minecraft going?
[1:01:51] RaniWasACyborg: @True_Chord My luck with those is so terrible that I'm starting to suspect my friend is just making them up LUL

[1:02:52] Azuremoon13: literally if you can think it… there probably is a mod
[1:03:06] TheeeToxicAvenger: am i a also a title?
[1:03:12] True_Chord: @raniwasacyborg there’s a y level where diamond deposits spawn most frequently. I usually just mine straight down to that level and strip mine.
[1:03:29] TheeeToxicAvenger: ok ill try my bestest
[1:03:35] TheeeToxicAvenger: im good, how are you?
[1:03:35] VoxTheBanshee: @0ntan1o is there actually one that hasn't been smacked down by nintendo?
[1:03:49] RaniWasACyborg: @True_Chord I really need to try strip mining, but my attention span never works in my favour for it
[1:04:14] 0ntan1o: @VoxTheBanshee yuh last I checked there still was but it was a few months ago
[1:04:41] RaniWasACyborg: Sadly it's getting late here, so I need to head off to bed. Goodnight and have a great rest of the stream! VirtualHug
[1:04:45] True_Chord: Strip mining like that is the only reason I ever find diamonds. Takes too long any other way.

[1:13:46] VikeXIV: it's a nice head empty vibe to craft in XIV
[1:13:48] VoxTheBanshee: my head is a mess today
[1:13:51] True_Chord: I play with a Mac and a magic mouse, so…
[1:13:57] VoxTheBanshee: I'm hangin in there
[1:13:58] SteeleX: Play with a guitar hero controller
[1:13:58] buttsbot: Play with a qtertar hero controller
[1:14:07] SteeleX: qtertar
[1:14:20] VoxTheBanshee: I'm better than this morning but not great
[1:14:27] VikeXIV: could never hit all the buttons on the qtertar controller
[1:14:40] TheeeToxicAvenger: who do we have to fight voxie?
[1:15:03] VoxTheBanshee: some people can't even find the buttons on the qtertar controller let alone hit them smh my head
[1:15:04] 0ntan1o: @VikeXIV apparently there's a button called clitoris but I can never find it
[1:15:19] VoxTheBanshee: LMFAO ONTANIO us with the same thought
[1:15:20] SteeleX: You've gotta go on an Indiana Jones style adventure to find it
[1:15:30] 0ntan1o: LOL
[1:15:50] TheeeToxicAvenger: i dont even know
[1:15:52] SteeleX: The red button wym what are we talking about
[1:16:08] VikeXIV: is that the orange one? @0ntan1o
[1:16:23] SteeleX: I hope it wasn't actually the blue one
[1:16:51] Benwee_: that's goat poop
[1:17:04] Azuremoon13: braveeee cass
[1:17:05] 0ntan1o: @VikeXIV idk I never found it
[1:17:07] True_Chord: Curious behavior to mine dirt with a pickaxe when you have a shovel.
[1:17:14] BrandonTheGr8: is this real life
[1:17:30] VoxTheBanshee: it's me in the water come gimme a hug
[1:17:37] Benwee_: aw your house is cute
[1:17:51] BrandonTheGr8: pretty good
[1:17:53] VikeXIV: lmfaaooo
[1:17:56] TheeeToxicAvenger: it looks better
[1:17:57] BrandonTheGr8: nah panes are better
[1:18:01] 0ntan1o: you should be
[1:18:09] Benwee_: glass pain
[1:18:10] BrandonTheGr8: its THREE D
[1:18:13] TheeeToxicAvenger: k
[1:18:31] BrandonTheGr8: im about to clean my room for an hour then play palworld
[1:18:33] True_Chord: The panes are cheaper than the blocks.
[1:18:34] Benwee_: adds LAYERS
[1:18:38] VoxTheBanshee: it's the way you can use glass to break glass in this game that breaks me
[1:18:51] BrandonTheGr8: have you played the world of pals yet
[1:19:07] Benwee_: @VoxTheBanshee I used the glass to destroy the glass
[1:19:24] TheeeToxicAvenger: you didnt need 45 torches
[1:19:38] VoxTheBanshee: is anyone enshrouded
[1:19:39] BrandonTheGr8: my first time launching the game, i ended up playing for 13.5 hours straight and went to be at 8am
[1:19:40] TheeeToxicAvenger: k
[1:19:46] BrandonTheGr8: its worth
[1:19:48] Benwee_: you can never have too many torches
[1:20:00] BrandonTheGr8: also i think its very similar to games that you enjoy
[1:20:02] 0ntan1o: the irl dodges after every hit is whats good
[1:20:04] BrandonTheGr8: so you would enjoy it
[1:20:18] BrandonTheGr8: has many valheim-like elements
[1:20:48] BrandonTheGr8: fair
[1:20:50] HereticWolf: there are no other games, only Palworld.
[1:20:58] Tarek97_: Love the irl dodges LUL
[1:21:02] HereticWolf: beeeeLOL
[1:21:08] VoxTheBanshee: I personally am uninterested in palworld (not judgy just not interested) I am instead in the grips of enshrouded
[1:21:22] Tarek97_: Also irl peeking Kappa
[1:21:26] Tarek97_: but what do I know
[1:21:30] Thalenias: It's a special tree
[1:21:35] TheeeToxicAvenger: Candy Crush has me by the throat
[1:22:05] Benwee_: @TheeeToxicAvenger classic Avenger
[1:22:13] Zapafaz: enshrouded is great, have been playing it
[1:22:24] True_Chord: That looks like an azalea tree. The logs are just oak, but you can get flowering azalea…saplings? They’re the most different type of plant in the whole game.
[1:22:45] BrandonTheGr8: saw some enshrouded gameplay and preferred palworld personally katlieBobafroggo
[1:22:48] chelsymm: I love candy crush, its a gave of mine.
[1:22:51] Tarek97_: Hello herothy ThankEgg

[1:24:19] True_Chord: So you have the stuff for a shield?
[1:24:43] BrandonTheGr8: is your goal to beat minecraft?
[1:25:02] True_Chord: Oh, I love the mushroom hat on your skin!
[1:25:50] BrandonTheGr8: ez

[2:06:35] StreamElements: Don't make suggestions, don't ask "have you seen [insert anything here] yet?" and don't answer questions that Cass asks unless she specifically says "chat, please answer this question." Cass plays at her own place, is skilled at gaming, and learns through failure and her own successes.
[2:06:44] True_Chord: Yeah, I think the setting for that are n the Options menu.
[2:06:45] buttsbot: Yeqter, I think the setting for that are n the QTERptions menu.
