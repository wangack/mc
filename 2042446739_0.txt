[0:16:07] yukii_hikari: yes!
[0:16:07] nordicseven: yup
[0:16:08] YoMummaClaire: yes
[0:16:09] BlossymWyrm: Cats will just bring you random gifts like feathers, chicken and even phantom bits
[0:16:10] Daphness: Kitters brings presents at night after hunting!
[0:16:11] Another_JT: it's been a thing for a very long time

[0:16:16] Liamblie: yes when they sleep with you they give you gifts in the morning
[0:16:17] avonay: sometimes when you sleep and wake up, there is a possibility they will bring you something
[0:16:23] sanastratus: I had no idea either lol that’s awesome
[0:16:25] space_fishie: cats give you presents if you sleep but leave them wandering!
[0:16:28] BlossymWyrm: I think its only one gift though. Not an army of cats
[0:16:30] Daphness: Sometimes string, rabbit leftovers, things like that!
[0:16:39] TeaRoseMacaron: cats only bring gifts if they're not sitting down
[0:16:47] damp42: sleeping with cats is a good thing for random items
[0:16:56] MissMoni71: Yes if cats arent sitting, and you go to sleep, they will sleep too...and maybe get you a gift as well
[0:16:57] Another_JT: Cheer100 It's always so much fun to see Ren rediscover this game
[0:16:59] nordicseven: Zedaph gathered all items from cats last Hermitcraft season
[0:17:15] jonosmithers: Hey Cyberdogs o7
[0:17:19] Another_JT: Yes, you can make a cat farm, but you'll only get one gift a night
[0:17:21] ThingamabobMC: slow falling potion for dragon fight
[0:17:22] fufie_32: Nah sadly not
[0:17:26] TeaRoseMacaron: the trouble is they gotta be free to roam
[0:17:28] statickatz: only one gift at a time
[0:17:31] BlossymWyrm: I think its only one cat at a time
[0:17:33] Galeanami: hi @jonosmithers
[0:17:35] damp42: @nordicseven correct
[0:17:42] Daphness: As soon as you sleep the cat brings you a prezzie from their hunting during night. String, rabbit leftovers, etc.
[0:17:48] avonay: It's not everytime tho
[0:17:50] MissMoni71: Hello everyone...*waves*
[0:17:57] fufie_32: First one to sleep on you /I think/
[0:18:02] mayfire1900: Hello @jonosmithers
[0:18:03] belloelloo: u can’t take advantage of the cats 😂🥲
[0:18:22] bfsb90: by hey, membrane means slow falling potions for the dragon fight ;)
[0:18:31] Another_JT: Non of their gifts are particularly valuable. It's a good farm for a peaceful world
[0:18:33] cha0s_system: LUL LUL
[0:18:39] mcsallie: o/
[0:19:01] MissMoni71: Ibwish my neighbor's cat would stop bringing me half mice as gifts outside every nite...*not gonna lie*
[0:19:07] Another_JT: but you'll still need to kill a phantom (if you haven't already)
[0:19:22] Another_JT: And you have to sleep
[0:19:40] asmiles: HypeHai
[0:19:40] TeaRoseMacaron: it's just a nice little bonus
[0:19:43] daredevil2300: hi REN had to leave for a bit. have we discussed local weather yet?
[0:19:43] Raynj12: One night is worth 3 slow falling potions?
[0:19:44] Another_JT: You still only get 1 item
[0:19:48] avonay: prolly not?
[0:19:52] fufie_32: I don't think that will work as like, it's first to lay on you
[0:19:54] damp42: Well you can get rabbits foot- they are OP
[0:19:59] Raynj12: Per membrane lol unless you got one of the other drops
[0:20:07] belloelloo: I think the cat has to lie with u or something like that
[0:20:11] cezero11: hi frens rdtvGigaheart1 rdtvGigaheart1 rdtvGigaheart1

[0:20:43] PeanutGallery76: Rabbit foot is great, but I miss Moses.
[0:20:46] bfsb90: unless it gots patched i'm pretty sure scicraft made a way to get a gift from every cat in a farm, can't remember how they did it though
[0:20:47] sanastratus: @cezero11 rdtvTiddles rdtvTiddles rdtvTiddles
[0:20:51] blondebeauty_96: Hi @cezero11 👋
[0:20:56] kuruasu: wait seriously
[0:21:00] titanac: I think Zedaph do a zedvancement with cat gifts?
[0:21:01] sanastratus: definitely causation and not correlation
[0:21:10] cha0s_system: :o
[0:21:16] fufie_32: Oh nice. I think we found rens lucky charm
[0:21:19] avonay: Recently I beat the dragon in under 10 minutes and what's good is you don't need much stuff, just good enchantments
[0:21:20] Another_JT: @bfsb90 scicraft made a cat farm to guarantee a gift every night
[0:21:21] cezero11: @DeltaicZap @fufie_32  @beouwolfe @MissMoni71 @sanastratus @blondebeauty_96 @PeanutGallery76 rdtvGigaheart1 rdtvGigaheart1 rdtvGigaheart1 rdtvGigaheart1

[0:22:29] belloelloo: I don’t think I’ve killed the endear dragon once I always get lost in the nether 😂😭
[0:22:33] Admirari: rdtvGigaheart0
[0:22:45] sanastratus: I haven’t fought the dragon before and I would be terrified lol
[0:22:46] PeanutGallery76: @cezero11 rdtvTiddles
[0:22:53] Another_JT: I remember the first dragon. Took me a while to build up for it
[0:23:24] MyCatsHere: I’ve never beat the dragon. But then again, I always play on peaceful, playing Minecraft like it’s the dang Sims.
[0:23:31] ThingamabobMC: I died 42 times my first dragon fight lol
[0:23:32] FruityBruno: i think the first time (I remember) fighting the ender dragon I was playing a heavily modded pack so a bit skewed lol
[0:23:32] daredevil2300: I remember as a noob tuning into my first enderman. no prior knowledge of anything Minecraft. also. middle of the night for extra creepy points
[0:23:36] blondebeauty_96: i honestly can’t remember the first time I fought the End Dragon.
[0:23:50] fufie_32: The only time I fought the dragon in survival was the day I joined the patreon and honestly like, I am so happy people exist because unless its almost static, I suck xD

[2:26:51] c4r8_uk: you row the wrong way
[2:26:54] nl_multicaster: Also depends where you live (tipping). In Holland we tip when the service is very good / or you want to give the server something extras.... but the servers are paid also normally
[2:27:01] keybordspielerin: Imo them being optional is betetr cause that means the waiters alrady earn a living wage and the tips are just extra on top (That´s how it works here in Germany)
[2:27:04] c4r8_uk: you should be facing the other direction.
[2:27:42] beouwolfe: @c4r8_uk minecraft physics are weird. don't think about it...

[2:28:43] c4r8_uk: @ocorrigan07 i literally noticed it today, and I can't unsee
[2:28:49] coolspacecatt: @itslodi timezones are weird  lol it's afternoon for me, hey anyway tho
