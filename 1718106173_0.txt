[0:25:22] MagnesiumOxide: I think there's two for every tier
[0:25:25] 1killersquirrel: there are multiple for most of them
[0:25:45] Purecrew: Amps difference
[0:26:09] SeanTKE: it explains it in the quest book but it's because there are more amps in the gregtech alloys and cheapest cost in the enderio alloys
[0:26:12] banshay3: who is this young man in the bottom right? peepoShy

[0:26:40] IlsaGold: Pati has used way more
[0:26:50] 1killersquirrel: patterns are in the same interface probably and using the same processor
[0:26:51] PureSpider: buffer chest also works
[0:26:53] dylan0806: More co processors?
[0:26:54] Morlega: Molecular assemblers might be busy with other stuff

[0:28:03] 1killersquirrel: blocking mode? won't that work?
[0:28:14] PureSpider: no, insert into interface
[0:28:18] Morlega: interfaces don't auto-suck
[0:28:20] BallisticChrome: gotta input directly into the interfafce
[0:28:21] PureSpider: yes
[0:28:24] kane1941: any interface
[0:28:26] Daryl_Kay: yup
[0:28:29] DaFez_: or just into the drawer
[0:28:33] Morlega: Another interface is fine
[0:28:35] PureSpider: into the actual interface, yea
[0:28:36] rofl1436: that works
[0:28:36] Morlega: Import bus also works
[0:28:39] DaFez_: actually the drawer won't work i think
[0:28:40] SeanTKE: into any interface
[0:28:43] ondorin: could output into the drawer
[0:28:43] PureSpider: doesnt need go to into the SAME interface
[0:28:44] MagnesiumOxide: into any interface would work I believe
[0:28:47] PureSpider: just into *a* interface
[0:28:51] primo_qwe: it does
[0:28:58] Morlega: It just has to enter the network, whether through *a* interface or an import bus
[0:28:58] primo_qwe: it just expects items into system
[0:29:08] PureSpider: @Morlega this
[0:29:12] SeanTKE: the me system only cares that the stock goes up it doesn't care how it gets inserted
[0:29:23] PureSpider: @SeanTKE as long as it's not manually, yea
[0:29:58] PureSpider: does one craft use 36?

[0:43:09] dylan0806: Fuzzy export and then put the dog in the export bus
[0:43:10] DecoyOcelot: to use the ore dict bus, you would need to defrag the drives

[0:43:12] bcdmonkey: Can you move the mod to its own drive?
[0:43:13] RogueLightning_: How did Ci do this?
[0:43:13] meller127: find the disk its on and  start there

[0:43:49] officialhunterx: ci still causing chaos
[0:43:50] LuciferSpirt: just remove drive one at a time then look into me system to determine which drive has the dog
[0:43:54] TelRehiad: ME chest is actually a good idea
[0:43:55] dylan0806: Fuzzy export and then put the dog in the export bus
[0:43:56] CareBear_1643: But you did it
[0:43:59] Morlega: @Giantwaffle all LittleTiles combinations are the same "item" but with different NBT. Fuzzy card should ignore the NBT, hence put a non-dog one in an export bus with a fuzzy card
[0:44:00] TheWonderLlama: Just find the drive with it and pull it
[0:44:02] Lufcthorpy: Why’s it only just become a problem now?
[0:44:04] meller127: find the disk the item is on?
[0:44:06] GGoodGGuy: rewrite game with better language :D

[0:44:15] jdimango: thats the trashcan lol
[0:44:19] buji_bujinson: Can't you drag the item from JEI into an export bus with a fuzzy card?
[0:44:22] ronswagson98: Does it break when touched in JEI? Cause you can drag and drop into filters if now
[0:44:25] jdimango: when you press t it hides and unhides it
[0:44:27] DarkKnghtt58: that's your trashcan, type multi into JEI
[0:44:27] Rozz161: ME chest with the drive containing dog
[0:44:28] primo_qwe: try F3+H for advanced info
[0:44:34] Butterwhales: Hold shift over an item to see if it has ore dict
[0:44:37] PureSpider: waffle what are you using to export into the freezer?
[0:44:40] FishhNado: F3 + H ?
[0:44:44] DecoyOcelot: im worried even exporting the item is going to crash the server lol
[0:44:52] sorefingers: *@LittleTiles maybe
[0:44:53] Intohimos: what happened?
[0:44:53] FishhNado: u can see the name
[0:44:53] Morlega: @Giantwaffle all LittleTiles structures are the same "item" but with different NBT. Fuzzy card should ignore the NBT, hence put a non-dog one in an export bus with a fuzzy card
[0:44:55] GummiKu: "Multi-" does not work?
[0:44:56] dylan0806: Fuzzy export and then put the dog in the export bus
[0:44:57] omar_i_: afterwork someone (possibly Ci) made a "dog" and put it in sotrage, its too big and crashing the game if they take it out
[0:44:59] GGoodGGuy: did the dog broke server?
[0:45:00] Simon04090: You can fuzzy nbt on any other little tiles thing and it will match it

[0:45:51] Morlega: @Giantwaffle all LittleTiles structures are the same "item" but different NBT. Fuzzy card should ignore the NBT, hence put a non-dog one in a regular ME export bus with a fuzzy card
[0:46:01] jjvanl: Can you defrag your drives through a crate to export all but that mod?
[0:46:10] shifty_keyz: Disable the mod maybe
[0:46:21] PxlSauce: that's what chat has been saying
[0:46:25] Rozz161: ME chest with the drive
[0:46:26] huskiefreak: as stupid as i am. what about removing the drives until it isnt in the system? i know it doesnt really fix anything
[0:46:29] DigitalVortex92: An unknown problem occured :)
[0:46:30] GGoodGGuy: hahahah
[0:46:32] tragic_dan: @Giantwaffle you could just take all the drives out, find which drive it is in, and then export the me system with just that drive in it and then boom can delete them
[0:46:36] Morlega: Create a new one of like 2 tiny tiles

[0:48:19] ecnerw4l: whats happening xd
[0:48:37] MisterRabbitHead: @Giantwaffle ci said trashcan can't handle them and you need to throw them into lava
[0:48:43] arkun_: @anesthesiafc endgame - “figure out JVM garbage collection”
[0:48:46] drmabusee: that why endgame takes so long with 2 fps
[0:48:46] flameofazure: Can you put lava on it

[1:53:18] Morlega: Cancelling shouldn't consume resources
[1:53:28] stickman_02: are they stuck in the crafter?
[1:53:28] DecoyOcelot: did the tier 9 use them?
[1:53:29] WARHERO322: They are in there
[1:53:33] Morlega: Maybe the injectors only got partially loaded though

[1:54:36] DecoyOcelot: patti made a tier 9 after you cancelled right? that takes 4
[1:54:40] Simon04090: That you dont need
[1:54:45] SeanTKE: the draconic core is being crafted

[2:02:05] Blitzonite: you get 1 creative tank, and then you make several big tanks to store molten stuff in
[2:02:06] AnesthesiaFC: but you will need a sizable amount of tanks

[2:23:56] xDeadBringerx: A factory game is a massive undertaking. Just look at Satisfactory, and complexity wise Gregtech overshadows that.
[2:24:16] hiposlipo_: good
[2:24:32] daedmissica0: ye api is rdy
[2:24:39] hiposlipo_: hard to make a sandbox game now days that isnt 10 times better with modding
[2:24:42] daedmissica0: there saying
[2:24:45] DX_Plates: Yea, trying to shoehorn modding in after the fact leads to much jank.
[2:24:45] Glacial_Indifference: Or Rust your mods Kappa
[2:24:47] Morlega: Sharpen the C sharp NODDERS
[2:24:49] lava4o4: did you say that you were  going to develop applications for ksp?

[2:24:50] Mandorake: @Giantwaffle you have to finish the tank today
[2:24:52] TheUnrealOculus: WOGGERS
[2:24:58] Blitzonite: @xDeadBringerx its mainly the base game that is a crazy struggle to do, if you have a decent base game it gets so much easier, though still very complex
[2:25:01] dariomtc: @Giantwaffle you can finish the tank tomorrow
[2:25:05] Allmostdone: great to de-rust your C just use Rust. lol
[2:25:09] Morlega: Lua wouldn't be too surprising
[2:25:10] SimonSez: If they are still using Unity, modding support is pretty easy to implement
[2:25:14] Blitzonite: there's a big reason for why indie game dev isn't very profitable for realistic projects
[2:25:18] daedmissica0: if you cant mod it ksp 2  will die day 1

[2:25:52] SimonSez: You'll go insane
[2:25:59] TelRehiad: rust devs are like vegans. they try to recruit you
[2:25:59] Deadlisins: Deadlisins subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 25 months! 
[2:26:01] PureSpider: fucking rust is hip right now, it'll either be dead and gone in five years, or still here . and then you can consider learning it
[2:26:03] YoungDoesGaming: is microminers one time use??/
[2:26:03] DatoPotatoDato: what is rust even used for?
[2:26:05] Glacial_Indifference: Rust is interesting from a compsci perspective. Limited actual use cases from what I have seen.
[2:26:09] Blitzonite: c++ GOOD rust YEP

[2:26:37] TelRehiad: to be fair.. rust *is* the new cool language.
[2:26:40] PureSpider: people are like "wow rust can do all this cool theoretical shit" with no actual use for it lol
[2:26:46] Allmostdone: Rust can make you rusty
[2:26:49] Slash_Ignore: pepeSmoke  1waffle hour
[2:26:49] Blitzonite: just learn a bit, but its deffo very bait because its hip
[2:26:55] Intohimos: rust cli tools are super cool
[2:27:04] TelRehiad: DOD is actually starting to force companies to use rust due to the security implications
[2:27:14] DX_Plates: How can you tell a dev is a Rust Dev? They'll tell you all about it.
[2:27:16] Archie8300: could you double up on some of the patterns?
[2:27:20] arcticae: rust is cool. but the number of edge cases covered by syntax is scary
[2:27:25] Umoeder1: Waffle do you watch guilinor games on yt?

[2:27:58] lava4o4: like what type of programs do you build with rust?
[2:28:01] xDeadBringerx: All polar opposites
[2:28:05] DaddyDiddy: look at the infinity solar panel that's where the bulk of it is goes to
[2:28:08] DX_Plates: LuL fishypooos
[2:28:08] Shame625: nothing really, its just hipster language like Haskell @lava4o4 , they think it will replace C/C++, which is deslusion
[2:28:10] PrototypeTrousers: @Giantwaffle i'm being held hostage and the kidnappers are demanding a creative tank. can you help me? You have until the streams end :~

[2:29:59] WhiteBearGaming360: rip Pluto
[2:30:00] Shame625: @lava4o4 not to say, Rust is still worth checking out, there have been some big changes in Android codebase, with google swapping some stuff to Rust. Its a hard language to get grasp of, you really do need to know C, to know what Rust is fixing
[2:30:20] Exordium_world: pluto will always be one of my favorites
[2:30:23] Feist_: I'm going to see Neil Tyson in April

[2:31:09] Blitzonite: @Feist_ why would you go through that
[2:31:17] DX_Plates: Need to rename one of the 7 dwarfs Pluto.
[2:31:20] Feist_: he makes me laugh
[2:31:22] DragonApoc: How do you automate those dusts
[2:31:25] daedmissica0: @Giantwaffle whats your first misson in ksp 2?
[2:31:29] Blitzonite: remember to look up the dictionary definition of everything before uttering any word you say
[2:31:41] CanYouDigIt7: How close to pack finish?
[2:31:46] xDeadBringerx: @lava4o4 at work we have a flow. Some applications in Java or Go where performance is critical are getting rewritten to Rust for pure speed. Saving 5-10% CPU time and 10-15% saves tens of thousands of €
[2:32:22] SebastiaanO: horse?

[3:01:59] winulff: tank in the middle?
[3:02:00] Morlega: Or just a storage bus on the tank?
[3:02:01] DaddyDiddy: you can't fluid storage bus the creative tank, you have to output it into a tank
[3:02:01] GameDadel: Just add a supertank under?
[3:02:05] KnightofObv: Ender conduit between it
[3:02:08] Rtonne: Just put between the creative tank and solidifier?
[3:02:08] mrleonehart: Just do fluid pipe into tank and into
[3:02:09] IveBeenWandering: tank in middle or ducts
[3:02:10] KnightofObv: So you can have 2 exports
[3:02:11] Dagmoo: didn't the patreon server team have like 5-7 days after they got the creative tank?

[3:03:44] THEgoodCOW: Fluid storage bus on the creative fluid in ?
[3:03:45] coolcake2: just store fluids in ME drives :)
[3:03:50] Joshuapetch: why not put a tank under the Creative tank to then go into the machine
[3:03:50] Twin5un: @Giantwaffle will you make the base look good tho ? :)
[3:03:59] KnightofObv: sign
[3:04:10] thecodealive_original: why even store fluids in ME? just strap a creative tank wherever you need the fluids
[3:04:18] Morlega: Crea tank -> Storage Bus then Export bus -> Solidier or whatever NODDERS
[3:04:21] Ras2709: why luv and not better?
[3:04:22] mysts_07: can u not make uv solidifiers
[3:04:30] DaddyDiddy: because you have infinite indium tin barium cuprate so you might as well use it lmao
[3:04:37] sorefingers: maybe tech towards the 256x paralell hatch @giantwaffle
[3:04:40] GuardMoony: wiring is still pretty clean
[3:04:40] mrleonehart: @Giantwaffle WAIT!!!! DUDE SEAL YOUR ARMOR!!!!!
[3:04:46] mrleonehart: Its free now
[3:04:54] winulff: Damn
[3:05:04] sorefingers: probably good to go to the drawing board and look at tasks and plan ahead
[3:05:26] Ras2709: no but the things for bountys you can now LUL

[3:06:57] Enforcer__: Yo dawg, we heard you like drawers!
[3:07:38] Makaheehee: Isnt that a later waffle problem? Kappa
[3:07:49] winulff: Have you seen the way Threefold did his post creative tank base?
[3:08:01] WARHERO322: Why not put a quantum tank on top of solidifier and then put the creative tank on top of that and then a storage bus on the quantum tabk
[3:08:18] DaddyDiddy: need to update the version
[3:08:18] Moobot: You can sub to Waffle by clicking this neat link -> twitch.tv/giantwaffle/subscribe SUBprise
[3:08:37] Morlega: I assume the crea tank also accepts the fluid back in it and "voids" it, in which case storage bus onto the crea tank is much better
[3:08:43] lilgangstagoth1: dang i missed it
[3:08:45] Morlega: otherwise need fluid storage cards for excess Despairge
[3:08:53] Morlega: drives*
[3:08:57] DaddyDiddy: @Morlega you can't storage bus the creative tank unfortunately
[3:09:05] SeanTKE: dont make a list mace recipes
[3:09:08] SeanTKE: make*
[3:09:08] officialhunterx: you can make unlimited clay now
[3:09:10] Surge43: Iron for buckets
[3:09:13] Morlega: @DaddyDiddy why not? TOP says it has a tank?

[3:09:32] Enforcer__: unlimited dirt NODDERS
[3:09:34] felipe2p2: infinite water
[3:09:36] Wazepas: unlimited sand and gravel PogChamp
[3:09:52] IveBeenWandering: unlimited COPIUM
[3:09:55] DaddyDiddy: @Morlega it doesn't technically have an inventory to pull from, trust me i've tried, you have to output it into a tank and then fluid storage bus the tank
[3:09:58] KnightofObv: Need a transciever on the 16amp
[3:10:11] Morlega: @DaddyDiddy Despairge
[3:10:16] GameDadel: dont melt the cable
[3:10:27] lava4o4: whats your plan after finishing this modpack?
[3:10:27] cansley123: converter not connected
[3:10:47] Simon04090: Why do they not have power
[3:10:48] xDeadBringerx: @morlega it’s because even though it has a tank internally it instantly outputs it. So it never has anything stored.
[3:11:03] Snah__: diamonds?
[3:11:20] Morlega: @xDeadBringerx I expected it just be like crea tanks from other mods where it's contents are "locked" to 50% or whatever
[3:11:42] Surge43: tear down all the EBFs
[3:11:56] jdimango: whats the drive defragging machine called?
[3:11:56] sorefingers: whiteboard session is a great idea @giantwaffle
[3:11:59] GameDadel: do everything :D
[3:12:15] DaddyDiddy: yeah that's what you'll end up doing, you'll start upgrading infrastucture and you'll go "i'm out of this ingot" and then just tank it and then move on
[3:12:16] chaoskub: glass
[3:12:17] Dvaina: fans

[3:12:48] lilgangstagoth1: vector blocks

[3:13:58] Dreamlettuce: So gaudy.
[3:13:59] PureSpider: creative tanks sponsored by corsair
[3:14:13] Blitzonite: rgb makes it faster
[3:14:23] itsIffy: the rgb makes the solidifying faster :)
[3:14:30] Tapeman83: Kreygasm
[3:14:35] jdog0616: i remember you building a walkway with those RGB blocks years ago
[3:14:39] 5n4keyes: Put the corner bottom ones into the ground, so its less blocky
[3:14:56] JERICHOLOLO: giga wall
[3:14:58] peepthesheep: make it like a sever room where cold rows then hot rows
[3:15:02] DigitalVortex92: need more
[3:15:06] PODD: do a hallway
[3:15:12] Morlega: GIGACHAD my line
[3:15:13] Narcotical: The Wall of Fame
[3:15:14] Schutter07: the last line
[3:15:17] Blitzonite: inb4 you need over 100 of those
[3:15:18] Minelmonia: a tunnel
[3:15:21] Altephfour: Should be a hall on either side

[3:15:27] Simon04090: Left and right
[3:15:31] winulff: @RCscopes206 yes
[3:15:31] PistolPeteHogan: Copium 2.0 line
[3:15:33] johantenenbaum: hallway with two sides covered with creatives
[3:15:40] Stonan: Why not just have them back to back?
[3:15:41] 1killersquirrel: The Wall of TrollDespair
[3:16:28] sorefingers: dont put them too close together if you stack them on top of each other. Some fluids you might need both fluid and solid so a supertank with a storage bus on top of the solidifier would look slick
[3:16:29] Moobot: Come join the Waffle House Discord! <# https://discord.gg/fhGFtMuzdS
[3:16:45] inforv: Titanium asap. Cause fuck titanium lol
[3:16:58] Purecrew: Are you guys almost out of fluix cables?

[3:18:27] Koeckie: could you put the tank ontop of the drawer?
[3:18:29] Dagmoo: copy paste gadget
[3:18:35] Ras2709: why not use the back of the tanks to pump fluid out of?
[3:18:36] Bulltank: @fun390 curseforge
[3:18:40] DonGromus: Its bugs out sometimes @Dagmoo
[3:18:42] Fun390: @Bulltank thanks
[3:18:43] primo_qwe: just put creative tank with extract only?
[3:18:49] thecodealive_original: why do you want fluids in me?
[3:19:08] lazyhot: Or you move the drawer one row back with trim and you can make one long wall that is not interupted by the controller
[3:19:42] Dagmoo: @dongromus ah ok i wondered why he wasn't using it all the time. that makes more sense
[3:19:52] thecodealive_original: and why does the tank size matter if you're going to fill it almost instantly?
[3:20:24] Surge43: 4% did

[3:22:11] Blitzonite: tutorial is just the creative tank, I personally say I finish packs when i'm able to make 1 creative item, but really a different game begins then
[3:22:17] Blitzonite: one i'm not the more keen on :D
[3:22:26] sorefingers: i still believe 256 paralell hatch should be the first priority
[3:22:28] ih_shevtsov: do liquid fish
[3:22:50] Simon04090: Why cant you do 6 stacks -> 1 stack?

[3:24:13] thenaylander: can you rotate tank faces to face inward?
[3:24:13] maccabeus: this factory has actually killed a quarter-million fish so far
[3:24:15] Makaheehee: Isnt it crazy that as soon as they made one creative tank, they can easily duplicate them to make hundreds..
[3:24:22] Wazepas: Fish oil dead fish Madge
[3:24:26] Alamose: could use an enderIO tank below to show the liquid
[3:24:28] warriordev1: @Giantwaffle do the terminal faces have to face up?

[3:27:11] Morlega: I highly doubt 2mb vs 200000mb will matter for lag
[3:27:13] broseph_larz: waffleWave  TakingNotes
[3:27:26] sorefingers: if you think about it, most of the time consuming tasks are assemblers/assembly lines. you probably want to investigate what resources you need to produce, my guess is millions of gem drones of all tiers
[3:27:34] IveBeenWandering: higher amount higher tick sounds better
[3:27:36] GameDadel: 200000 for every 10 sec?
[3:27:38] lazyhot: Or you put on the overflow nerver storage capacity issue ...

[3:32:56] Beergrillz: smaller tanks are better here you dont need so much storage it insta refils annyway
[3:33:05] Morlega: The real problem is whether it can render light-weight and not look weird with lighting etc Despairge
[3:33:15] sorefingers: would be great if you could use Papyrus on signs for the meme
[3:33:24] Jedi2113: nano cpus get made at the intel factories obviously

[3:34:08] DarkKnghtt58: you need nano CPU
[3:34:12] mrleonehart: You disabled it
[3:34:16] splix661: would placing buckets with the DE placed item from the p key cause lag as much as frames?
[3:34:25] sorefingers: you will want to upgrade all the wafers to neutronium soon as well
[3:34:32] primo_qwe: its on other cleanroom
[3:34:35] primo_qwe: at left corner
[3:34:37] Morlega: At some point YEP
[3:34:46] kane1941: there is an upgrade to make multiblock machine have "clean environment"

[3:41:14] Coredinator: if i recall correctly a way 2 reduce lagg is to build a factory horizontally not vertically ;)
[3:41:20] grid_space: new base would be good
[3:41:34] Morlega: With channel limits disabled you didn't have a reason to subnetwork though
[3:41:35] mrleonehart: Pati took away the ME cable for the Storage
[3:41:48] sofalord_: everytime you disconnect a part, teh network reloads,  that looks like power issues
[3:41:49] Morlega: When Pati cuts a ME cable, the ME system takes a few seconds to recalibrate
[3:41:56] Simon04090: It might be because pati is disconnecting stuff
[3:41:56] Moobot: New here? Welcome! You can usually catch Waffle Mon-Sat at ~1400 UTC. Feel free to hang out in chat before the stream and/or join the !discord. waffleEgg | Use !thisweek for any changes.

[3:42:31] inforv: Do you have battery buffers?
[3:42:38] Bulltank: That poor little energy acceptor. So much responsibility for 1 little block.

[3:49:32] Morlega: There's like cardboard tape to move a whole drawer with its inventory intact
[3:49:38] Minelmonia: Use the bucket monitor for other items? @Giantwaffle
[3:50:01] Morlega: @Giantwaffle JEI "@drawer tape"
[3:50:10] mysts_07: well u would be wasting time
[3:50:31] SmokeyMcPo7: cut the power too

[3:51:36] HuntingButcher: The legacy code has really caught up with us

[3:52:02] Archie8300: draconium conduit to pwer ME?

[3:52:03] Alamose: might need dense energy cells as a buffer
[3:52:10] boogerbomb01: More energy cells
[3:52:12] Simon04090: It is pati disconnecting stuff
[3:52:19] primo_qwe: youre only using basic energy cell, use denser ones

[5:53:41] MagnesiumOxide: the building gadget has stuff like that built in doesn't it?
[5:53:42] banshay3: is he spitting on you?
[5:53:49] sorefingers: if you create 64 fish per tick it will still take you 270hours to create a Billion fish 🤔
[5:54:04] jegkanikkelidetwitch: i think you can hold alt for the build mode thing
[5:54:07] arondayo: the alpacas really seal the deal
[5:54:09] JasonDM_: arches remind me of weddings and aqueducts
[5:54:20] SmokeBaIl: I think pati used the compass, to measure blocks
[5:54:22] GoodOldXijan: make the ceiling full of tanks as well
[5:54:29] TheWonderLlama: Llama abused D:
[5:54:30] poppyg15: put the rgb blocks around the base , maybe ?

[5:54:57] arondayo: you see this *slaps fish generator* this generates 1024 fish per tick
[5:54:59] Yohan460: you won't be able to see it from the top if you cover it up
[5:55:04] Yohan460: I'd recommend using glass
[5:55:33] Yohan460: make the arch +1 wide on each side to see the top of the block?
[5:55:34] Dagmoo: using copy paste tool PogChamp
[5:55:39] sorefingers: its wild how if you use 64vending upgrades it will still take 4.2 hours haha thats a lot of fish maine
[5:56:26] Orin_The_Sly: RGBs in the middle up top?
[5:56:27] Morlega: or make it glass monkaHmm
[5:56:29] Stonan: use a tinted glass
[5:56:29] deadgolfer: use neutronium blocks
[5:56:38] GoodOldXijan: we need more RGB!
[5:56:44] Darsholt: You could do more tanks and solidifiers for the arch
[5:56:45] MasterKraft: I thought the building gadget had the ability to link to ae storage, or a chest for blocks
[5:56:48] FlaminJurr: is it me, or does it seem a little off center? might be wasy the blocks are placed down LUL
[5:57:01] Mythrillo: bring the middle 2 block 1 up?

[5:58:23] slowPulse_: you could also replace the blocks right ?
[5:58:26] cmmeth: the archmakes the wall look a bit smol
[5:58:43] mysts_07: use other types of futura
[5:59:11] Lightning00Blade: The inner arches may look good as futura block as they will add the infinity hallways effect, don't you think?
[5:59:23] GamesWithJT: it would look like Freemont Street Vegas LOL
[5:59:35] Orin_The_Sly: Looks good

[6:01:37] Morlega: Massive skill issue sounds like your middle name though YEP Fire
[6:01:41] DaddyDiddy: @masonthicks yeah that's not breaking, that's upgrading. DME is way better than DML, the tools are a lot better and they changed some recipes which for them in tank doesn't change anything
