[0:27:54] Bmatic86: right
[0:27:54] LethalBro: NODDERS
[0:27:55] Nothrim: electrons are vibrating but not moving the field is moving
[0:27:57] GoRilla2015: @pr0gz but if u like complex .. well then go for it :) honestly its great and fun for me tho ... even i dont fully understand it right now way to much to learn :D
[0:27:57] stormblaz: Like battery cells
[0:28:00] Nexhunter: they don't move pepeLaugh
[0:28:01] StOrMy1100: NOTED
[0:28:06] warmwalrus: just had like 0 mA pepeLaugh
[0:28:06] Nexhunter: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHIhgxav9LY @Giantwaffle there the video KEKW
[0:28:07] Deadlisins: Deadlisins subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 24 months! Happy Christmas Waffle
[0:28:15] pr0gz: @GoRilla2015 yeah i think i will
[0:28:17] Racko5: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHIhgxav9LY
[0:28:18] stormblaz: So what is the current that we are seeing?
[0:28:18] Hino_ken: "Sometimes, the electrons in an atom's outermost shells do not have a strong force of attraction to the protons. These electrons can be pushed out of their orbits. Applying a force can make them shift from one atom to another. These shifting electrons are electricity." @Giantwaffle
[0:28:23] LethalBro: Here we goooo! pepeLaugh
[0:28:27] Racko5: whoops
[0:28:30] stormblaz: If electricity doesnt move, then what is the current we see?
[0:28:33] orillion: KEKW Clap only took 28 minuites for derailing
[0:28:37] Noblez_: That didn't take long
[0:28:38] maccabeus: isn't this video full of comments about how he's wrong/misleading?
[0:28:40] Nexhunter: @stormblaz well pay attention to the video
[0:28:43] CultOfNeurisis: light behaves as both particle and wave. the answer is not absolute, it's "it depends and contextual" which was what threw scientists for a loop, because we presupposed all knowledge is absolute not contextual. But technically even a particle is a wave just really tiny (wave packet)
[0:28:55] gamabunt: D
[0:28:55] Nexhunter: @maccabeus there follow up cause bozos got it wrong still KEKW
[0:28:56] NoisyPlays: how msny C4 did you buy wtf KEKW
[0:28:57] Tabakhase: thats a somewhat bad video yea... there been way better follow-ups
[0:29:01] Racko5: pepeLaugh
[0:29:01] weasel9999: none of the above YEP
[0:29:03] warmwalrus: 1/c pepeLaugh
[0:29:04] StOrMy1100: F
[0:29:07] stormblaz: But thats assuming lighjt is electricity
[0:29:08] Jugohuber: That theory is proven wrong, right?
[0:29:08] LethalBro: PepLaugh
[0:29:11] FlipFlipFlaparoo: No idea
[0:29:12] AlphaSchnauzer: depends on cable?
[0:29:13] Wakeuphate: pepeLaugh
[0:29:14] cmmeth: its made of wire
[0:29:17] Gear_Knight: LUL
[0:29:17] Furiak: assumptions
[0:29:19] Sentinel1_9: 1/ci? why we dividing by ci?
[0:29:20] Bmatic86: no resistance
[0:29:22] Spirevipp: ElNoSabe
[0:29:25] Maherishi: It’s wire wire
[0:29:26] TheMatate: Yeah, Wire!
[0:29:34] shadowoflight_: I would assume it's instant because it pushes electrons like super string?
[0:29:36] Nexhunter: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI_X2cMHNe0 also follow up video cause other youtubers got angry widePepeLaugh  @maccabeus
[0:29:38] MrMoneybagMan: Is instantly
[0:29:40] Racko5: YEP
[0:29:42] Nexhunter: just pay attention YEP
[0:29:42] Maherishi: E
[0:29:43] gamabunt: yes and no.
[0:29:44] Mandorake: you tell us mr big brain
[0:29:45] ShionSinX: it should be
[0:29:46] AlphaSchnauzer: 0 Yup
[0:29:47] stormblaz: Are they moving?
[0:29:48] gamabunt: so E
[0:29:56] K3ll06s: this video was controversial, you ne ed to watch the follow ups @giantwaffle
[0:29:58] rofl1436: rare sunday stream Pog
[0:29:59] silv: answer is root2 :)
[0:30:01] stormblaz: Arent the electrons throughout the cable just idle until exited?
[0:30:01] MrMoneybagMan: Yes
[0:30:04] Nexhunter: @stormblaz just watch
[0:30:05] The_Holas: what i know electrons are already there cause they just push each outher then its instant ...
[0:30:06] fistmaster2k4: happy hogswatch chat
[0:30:07] TooManyBadgerss: I would bet on instant
[0:30:12] StOrMy1100: monkaHmm
[0:30:12] stormblaz: @Nexhunter True
[0:30:12] AlphaSchnauzer: Like a conveyor belt. imagine electrons are already there
[0:30:13] Racko5: brain meltage on that one
[0:30:15] hypeyo_: you have to treat movement of electrons like links on a chain
[0:30:17] LUCIFER_RA: HUH
[0:30:22] NoisyPlays: PepoThink
[0:30:25] rofl1436: HUH
[0:30:26] bobolpwnz: No
[0:30:26] stormblaz: I think they are  already all over the cable idle
[0:30:27] ramzey69: no
[0:30:29] Purecrew: You would break space and time
[0:30:29] Nexhunter: @K3ll06s you need to watch the follow up of the follow ups KEKW https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI_X2cMHNe0
[0:30:29] ramzey69: time stops
[0:30:30] FairePlaie: none of the above ( this is too long )
[0:30:32] ShionSinX: hboxBrain hboxBrain hboxBrain hboxBrain
[0:30:34] ramzey69: you move the same speed
[0:30:39] Soul12eaver: how much would it weigh? thats a lot of energy to get it to move
[0:30:41] ramzey69: thats why its a constant
[0:30:44] GoksiiLija: its only the distance between cables
[0:30:45] CultOfNeurisis: the speed of light is by definition the upper limit, nothing can be faster without breaking physics as it currently is instantiated
[0:30:46] bobolpwnz: pushing is creating a distortion wave in the pole
[0:30:52] FairePlaie: the no more tension in the wire
[0:30:52] Anwedie: I get it there LUL
[0:30:57] McFlannel: greg tech was enough of a ball buster, i cant compute electricity
[0:30:59] frainsbreeze: no one ever said that speed of light is the max limit. we just can'T detect anything faster yet
[0:31:00] stormblaz: Fun Fact a electric plant costs 20 billion roughly
[0:31:12] bar10dr: Electromagnetism
[0:31:23] MisterRabbitHead: @Racko5 thank you for the distraction racko TrollDespair
[0:31:24] Duh_real_scrub: If your car was moving at the speed of light can you use the headlights? Like can you see in front of you?
[0:31:34] Anwedie: Magnemotive force is the strongest force in the universe imo
[0:31:34] Moobot: Come join the Waffle House Discord! <# https://discord.gg/fhGFtMuzdS
[0:31:35] MJKalas: didnt know i was in school when i have christmas week off KEKW
[0:31:40] sytar023: volateg drop on that line would be so high, unless you push thousands of volts in that cable, the bulb wouldnt light up, the resistance of the cable would be far greater than the resistance of the light bulb
[0:31:41] ShionSinX: electroboom said this video is wrong, and he explodes so I go with him
[0:31:44] Nexhunter: chat
[0:31:44] InTheLittlePro: merry Christmas everyone waffleHOMIE
[0:31:49] Nexhunter: electroboom was wrong also KEKW
[0:31:49] Racko5: @MisterRabbitHead how tf do you have a reply to that still KEKW
[0:31:51] stormblaz: So electricity = heat?
[0:32:03] Nexhunter: there is a follow up to watch that goes into even more depths of hell dwjftSuffer
[0:32:06] Maherishi: CaitlynS
[0:32:08] fuzzyfuzzjr: D: wrong
[0:32:13] stormblaz: Electrical power posts
[0:32:14] CultOfNeurisis: @frainsbreeze in relativity, the speed of light being constant in all reference frames is axiomatic. has nothing to do with what has been measured or not, if we >do< measure something that breaks this, we would break relativity. which is fine, but it's currently axiomatic
[0:32:16] my_hawkbig: BAD TEACHER
[0:32:22] weasel9999: they are magic monkaS
[0:32:32] kingasasin177: Ohhhh, is he talking about things like voltage, inductance, etc?

[0:37:12] HarrySeaward1: theres a good steve mould video on that
[0:37:22] Tabakhase: the problem is that the "correct" answer depends on "from where you view it" - and that ofc NONE of this is actually REAL as its all about concepts to make a human understand things...

[0:41:03] Dagmoo: same i didnt care about E&M when i wanted to specialize in astrophysics. had to jump ship to econ/business LUL
[0:41:12] shadowoflight_: here's my issue with this theory... so if you were to build a faraday's cage around the battery the bulb should not light up right
[0:41:14] b3nk3nobi: HUH
[0:41:14] kingasasin177: @ReindeerPolice You do astrophysics?
[0:41:34] Nexhunter: nope cause the wire has to leave the cage @shadowoflight_
[0:41:38] stormblaz: Astronomy and Astrophysics graduates face a zero percent unemployment rate.
[0:41:38] Gelil: That vid is crazy
[0:41:38] Mandorake: @Giantwaffle he has a second video

[0:41:46] kingasasin177: This is getting a bit out there ngl
[0:41:49] stormblaz: Astrophysics has a 0% unemployment rate
[0:41:49] TarmonSeikkailu: this video was called out by many electricians to be BS
[0:41:49] GasperTheFriendlyFart: i need a nap now
[0:41:52] Nexhunter: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI_X2cMHNe0 it is KEKW there is a followup
[0:41:56] Nexhunter: cause of folks going Pepega
[0:42:04] ReindeerPolice: That's what I am doing my PhD in @kingasasin177 Need to finish my masters first!
[0:42:05] ForgottenTime: It’s not really at least for high voltage power
[0:42:12] sytar023: yet here you are still watching this video even though most ppl in chat already told you it was wrong
[0:42:14] Tabakhase: gotta watch bigclieves 15 minute response - then EEVblog 45minute discussion, and follow up by vertasiums OWN 25minute followup KEKW you got into a rabbit hole there Sir
[0:42:17] ForgottenTime: Coming from a electrician
[0:42:23] kingasasin177: @ReindeerPolice Awesome. I'm in undergrad and I'm hoping to go into that field
[0:42:24] Mandorake: @sytar023 its not wrong, its debated
[0:42:25] stormblaz: To become a professional astrophysicist you need to do an undergraduate degree in physics, with an honours year, and then do a PhD (a doctorate).
[0:42:29] stormblaz: Y do u need a PHD :c
[0:42:45] sytar023: @Mandorake no. its wrong
[0:42:45] Mandorake: He's in a book
[0:42:50] ReindeerPolice: Anything in physics you basically need a PhD @stormblaz
[0:42:52] Mandorake: @sytar023 no. you're wrong
[0:42:53] Skafo222: KEKW
[0:42:56] AnesthesiaFC: f scott fitzgerald?

[0:42:59] kane1941: Same name Writer?
[0:42:59] Mandorake: it has an eye on the cover
[0:43:02] orillion: hes not wrong Kappa
[0:43:02] Gelil: You might be thing of F. Scott
[0:43:04] kingasasin177: @stormblaz honours year?
[0:43:04] wonly: thats f scott fitzgerald
[0:43:05] mn_sisu: superior*
[0:43:05] Nexhunter: lorentz fitz contraction
[0:43:10] stormblaz: yea :c
[0:43:25] Hino_ken: FitzGerald is known for his work in electromagnetic theory and for the Lorentz–FitzGerald contraction, which became an integral part of Albert Einstein's special theory of relativity. A crater on the far side of the Moon is named after him @Giantwaffle
[0:43:42] stormblaz: Quantum computing engineer seems like a really good career to get into
[0:43:55] LethalBro: Ah, Lorentz-Fitzgerald NOTED
[0:43:56] Anwedie: To a point, XLP is covered for trees
[0:44:00] Tabakhase: uhv with 1meter diameter cables LUL
[0:44:00] Anwedie: but its expensive
[0:44:03] Nexhunter: fuck no KEKW
[0:44:20] mullner93: @Giantwaffle will you play House of da Vince 3?
[0:44:27] birdoffire: Fire Causes Everything.
[0:44:30] Mandorake: now we run those through neighborhoods
[0:44:30] Stonan: Its much easier for maintenance as well.  Could you imagine digging all of that shit up every time there is a break?
[0:44:49] InTheLittlePro: didnt he do a whole experiment on this?
[0:44:56] Nexhunter: yep @InTheLittlePro https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI_X2cMHNe0
[0:45:03] InTheLittlePro: Ok cool I thought so
[0:45:07] sytar023: his wire is not as long as he says it is, otherwise the bullb would line up with this mall amount of voltage
[0:45:10] InTheLittlePro: Nex youre on top of that shit
[0:45:13] sytar023: light up*
[0:45:17] stormblaz: O.O
[0:45:35] stormblaz: Like a batman signal
[0:45:39] rofl1436: Stonan why would it break tho? we have a LOT of buried HV cables here in Europe and ive never heard about major problems
[0:45:41] Bmatic86: nope
[0:45:43] BMYGRLFRND: fair comparison
[0:45:44] warmwalrus: mm no
[0:45:48] LethalBro: The "speed" of shadows NODDERS
[0:45:48] kingasasin177: This get's into causality and stuff
[0:45:49] 0xCAFEF00D: Not sure how this compares at all.
[0:45:53] NoisyPlays: @stormblaz Moonman
[0:45:56] Stonan: @rofl1436 One dumbass with an excavator.
[0:45:56] BeardLongo: Information can be faster then Light
[0:45:57] stormblaz: Woulnt you be dealing with theory or relativity?
[0:45:57] Noblez_: Yes you're just "spraying" the light
[0:46:00] Tabakhase: you forgetting that the light itself "flows" there
[0:46:00] TheMatate: It would lag behind your movement
[0:46:05] Shelkad: So what, if the circuit is a perfect square of the same wire length it will take longer to lit up?
[0:46:05] InTheLittlePro: tangent?
[0:46:11] stormblaz: Is relativity though how light travels in a vacuum
[0:46:15] catch___22: monkaHmm
[0:46:16] birdoffire: there's nothing what is counter-intuitive.
[0:46:22] it_barry_ping: I like these Waffle knows times i learn a lot.
[0:46:22] my_hawkbig: i just heated up some pizza
[0:46:23] Tabakhase: your hand has twisted LONG before it starts moving on the surface
[0:46:24] hades_cross: won't the light drage behind the flash light
[0:46:28] sytar023: wow he actually mentioned it
[0:46:34] DDPrime: DDPrime subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 7 months! physics for christmas HypeSquawk
[0:46:36] ReindeerPolice: Caltech hype!
[0:46:40] Greedyro: check the second video on this topic.. he corrects some of the things here @giantwaffle
[0:46:44] Nexhunter: pepeLaugh https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI_X2cMHNe0 @Giantwaffle here the followup
[0:46:47] aimACTUALLY: there are theoretical speeds greater than c, but dont yet have a real world  equivalent
[0:46:50] guniu: and he did
[0:46:56] rofl1436: Stonan HV lines are more then clearly marked so nobody can pierce them or hit them, because that would be certain death and would mean power loss for a lot of people
[0:46:59] Tabakhase: gotta watch bigclieves 15 minute response - then EEVblog 45minute discussion, and follow up by vertasiums OWN 25minute followup KEKW you got into a rabbit hole there Sir YEP
[0:47:01] georgebv: he was, it has a follow up

[0:48:10] stormblaz: Ah yes 30 nanoseconds
[0:48:17] stormblaz: and the first 5 picoseconds
[0:48:18] Mandorake: this is how you science
[0:48:31] sytar023: scaled down wont prove it though, he doesnt realise the cable itself has a resistance
[0:48:39] Twin5un: pog

[0:49:02] Lord_Royalty: This guy is mad
[0:49:09] warmwalrus: wtf
[0:49:14] Nexhunter: that why caltech is brought in cause they have a scope that is sensitive enough he didn't @sytar023
[0:49:24] wonly: love electroboom
[0:49:24] stormblaz: What do you do about leaky currents?
[0:49:26] kingasasin177: Leave it to Electroboom to speak the true facts
[0:49:37] Kaanuynk: Just light a candle god dammit
[0:49:37] Gelil: Leakage is the current drawback to our wafers
[0:49:38] Twin5un: LMBC pepeW
[0:49:41] Mandorake: @stormblaz duct tape
[0:49:44] stormblaz: Can you control the leak on a very specialiced sensitive equipment?
[0:49:50] ShionSinX: Electroboom is just so good it got me into this shit because he makes it so damn funny to watch KEKW
[0:50:07] stormblaz: So the electrons are moving
[0:50:08] rofl1436: WAYTOODANK make it stop
[0:50:17] sytar023: @Nexhunter i see, it would indeed be very small, so small in fact the light wouldnt light up at all, since it has a minimum volateg requirement that wouldnt be met
[0:50:32] Nexhunter: @sytar023 YEP that why the lightbulb is a red heering
[0:50:37] Furiak: this is great timing, just waiting for me certus quartz crystals to grow in water while watching
[0:50:51] sytar023: @Nexhunter mustve missed that part lmao my bad
[0:50:52] stormblaz: Some Genious figure that out long ago with little machines and no pc
[0:50:54] NoisyPlays: peepoPooPoo
[0:51:06] BlackPanda123305: Yes yes i see, very interesting. Don't know what is happening

[0:51:42] GuardMoony: Yep he's so going to finish the pack before new year
[0:51:44] Soul12eaver: how do magnets work?
[0:51:48] CraazyDude: Isn't that the magnetic field that the cable emits?
[0:51:49] CultOfNeurisis: the field is more fundamental than the particles. the electron is an excitation in the field
[0:51:53] headtr1ck: welcome to quantum field theory
[0:51:54] kaos4666: PepoThink
[0:51:59] stormblaz: Isnt it created by the circuit magnetic material
[0:52:04] NoisyPlays: PepoThink
[0:52:04] helldelta99: Dude I’ve watched this video it’s insane. the field is emitted from the battery and to the light

[0:52:44] stormblaz: But how is it started if energy isnt created only transfered
[0:52:48] dollar_cave: there couldn't be a charge gradient or the ends of a long wire would be like little lightning machines
[0:52:51] shadowoflight_: that makes sense

[0:58:48] Phantoney: its the resistance in the wire that matters?
[0:58:50] Grumpage: hello mr waffle, just popping in quick to wish you and chat a merry christmas. Thank you for all your wonderful streams this year
[0:58:50] marmolada2137: conductivity = better when the atom has more free electrons
[0:58:52] cswowko: @holdfastt117 yeah he is so smart
[0:58:53] Spirevipp: electric field =/= electromagnetic field
[0:59:08] RenegadeWizard: I think the conductivity has to do with the valence level of the metal. Hard to remember grade 12 science right now.
[0:59:21] lakinator: heyo
[0:59:22] slayerman_x: what I want to know is if this is going to be in the finals ?

[0:59:53] Nexhunter: @Kinichiiro do we need to watch a video on how railguns work pepeLaugh
[0:59:55] stormblaz: Thats what I though, the wire carried it
[1:00:01] ShionSinX: @Kinichiiro no cuz the electrons dont move in a direction all the way
[1:00:02] bobolpwnz: planes are a metal cage btw
[1:00:03] Gelil: Works like water, path of least resistance
[1:00:12] stormblaz: Like nano leds or somethin
[1:00:17] kingasasin177: electron wells right?
[1:00:26] my_hawkbig: thats beacasue the wire itself is conductive so its technically always active
[1:00:27] stormblaz: Isnt that why most phone screens cant get too dark before they are off
[1:00:27] Francisco_Scaramanga: NP junctions
[1:00:45] Grumpage: 4nm chips are tricky
[1:00:45] stormblaz: Mini-LED and nano LED tvs control leakeage well

[1:53:05] Hurtwolf: the firefox dev browser works great
[1:53:08] fakehumanoid: Because Chrome sucks
[1:53:11] AnonWithLove: Enable "No caching"
[1:53:14] WDForty: all tabbed browsers will eat up lots and lots of memory if you never close them and open lots of tabs
[1:53:15] Trollsamaa: it doesnt, Chrome just dropps all the wrappers on the ground and never picks it up till the room is overflowing
[1:53:15] kenshin2666: chrome using your comp to mine bitcoin Kappa
[1:53:16] Glacial_Indifference: Manifest 3 coming soon! GG adblocking on chrome.
[1:53:17] TigerLuv: history?

[1:53:21] lizard__lips: I use operaGX
[1:53:23] MetalBBA: well it opens like a dozen+ processes and probably holds every cookie in existence
[1:53:27] Woogyface: does waffle has a vod channel? i like to watch this from the beginning but i have not enough time to watch 6 to 8 hours a day
[1:53:29] NicelysBabyGirl: not until you close the full chome it stays in background
[1:53:32] IlsaGold: Ive got the same usage on FF and CH
[1:53:37] natediggadoggity: I've started using opera gx, and I've been impressed.
[1:53:42] 0066: chrome had issues and i transferred all my files into mozilla and its equally as bad im thinking about microsoft edge now
[1:53:43] Tabakhase: no
[1:53:44] Goldern: 32gb costs $200 cmon
[1:53:46] jambag00: @AJ_Tupman KEKW
[1:53:46] Siluminate: I've switched to Opera GX
[1:53:47] Ichigolo: im on the edge of swapping off chrome too
[1:53:52] NicelysBabyGirl: explorer is the same way
[1:53:53] MayhemMooseS97: every tab is treated like a unique browser, but garbage collection is based on the browser
[1:53:54] Kardiiac: theres extenstions that suspend tabs so it doesnt chew through ram
[1:53:55] Techniker32: Surely there is a addon  to fix that
[1:53:57] pbtpbtPBT: isn't caching on disk and not in memory?
[1:53:59] kenshin2666: bad memory allocation from most browsers, they dont free up the memory
[1:54:00] awesomefreak72: its for fast opening of closed tabs
[1:54:00] rinrn: @Giantwaffle, unused memory is wasted memory. If windows call for more memory webbrowser be it chrome or firefox will free some memory.
[1:54:01] Boisss: You can disable the refresh on background thing in chrome to save up some memory
[1:54:02] WDForty: close all of crome, then do the "open last cosed" on the group
[1:54:03] LUCIFER_RA: yea i use opera gx as well
[1:54:06] bismarcksd: Netscape ?
[1:54:07] Goldern: $60?
[1:54:08] SpecialAgentSqueaky: isnt each tab a process nowdays?
[1:54:08] 0066: my 32gb corsair vengeance was 110$
[1:54:10] Mr_Alloy: is that opera gx browser any good?
[1:54:12] Akunin_EQ: I think all browser tabs are instanced to protect from other tabs, no shared components = more memory usage
[1:54:14] WalrusPug: @Giantwaffle hit F12 and check the "Application" tab to see all the caches and service workers and coockies and and and
[1:54:25] LokiRulez: just use netscape and call it a day
[1:54:28] WDForty: DDR5 isn't exactly cheap right now
[1:54:29] headbang3rboogie: DDR5 worth it?
[1:54:35] Trollsamaa: @AJ_Tupman Edge is built off chromium. it basically doesn't matter what you use as a browser, basically all of them are chromium
[1:54:38] NicelysBabyGirl: watch open a tab look at the chrome in task manager close tag it says the same
[1:54:42] IlsaGold: @AJ_Tupman Edge is chrome
[1:54:44] wondox: I use firefox
[1:54:45] Urovah: yeah
[1:54:46] Llyin_: fast as fuck boi!!
[1:54:48] Harmar: pepeLaugh im still on ddr3
[1:54:49] headbang3rboogie: so factorio works ok now?
[1:54:50] Shibiuza: photoshop is the same, the more memory you have the more it uses
[1:54:52] WDForty: i got 32gb ddr5600 CL34, and that cost me $250 CAD
[1:55:00] MetalBBA: its quad rate
[1:55:06] Nexhunter: there some advantages to edge vs pure chromium until MS upstreams all memory changes
[1:55:10] 0066: @AJ_Tupman edge changelog says it is designed for low resource

[2:04:25] IlsaGold: Polyamid
[2:04:26] Jugohuber: Polyamide 6.6
[2:04:30] kaos4666: (C12H22N2O2)n
[2:04:32] kingasasin177: It's strange but not too crazy

[2:04:56] Nexhunter: oh god it 5 years ago for nilered nlyon video
[2:05:05] skel66: amide links
[2:05:10] kingasasin177: It's a polymer with amides in it
[2:05:11] 619srt: 5Head
[2:05:14] bugsplatter23: it's a family like polyethylene or polypropylene
[2:05:16] Maximus439: an amide is a kind of carbon molecule and poly just indicates its a chain
[2:05:16] a_brink: Amide is a functional group with N in it
[2:05:18] dotsin: Nylon 66 is a type of polyamide or nylon. It, and nylon 6, are the two most common for textile and plastic industries. Nylon 66 is made of two monomers each containing 6 carbon atoms, hexamethylenediamine and adipic acid
[2:05:23] MrKekster: NH
[2:05:33] kingasasin177: One of the key nitrogen groups
[2:05:43] Nexhunter: can we learn about how evil nilered is to his friends OMEGALUL
[2:05:46] dotsin: Formula: (C12H22N2O2)n
[2:05:48] Jugohuber: 6.6 is basically the number of chain elements. 6 Cs in the amide chain, 6 in the acid chain

[2:08:20] 1killersquirrel: I asked ChatGPT (1/5): "Nylon is a synthetic polymer that was first developed by the chemical company DuPont in the 1930s. It is known for its strength, durability, and versatility, which makes it useful in a wide range of applications. Nylon is a polyamide, which means it is a polymer composed of repeating units of amide groups."

[2:08:38] Nexhunter: wtf has DuPont not made Susge
[2:08:40] 1killersquirrel: I asked ChatGPT (2/5): "One of the key properties of nylon is its ability to be molded into a variety of shapes and forms, making it useful in manufacturing processes. It is also resistant to abrasion and wear, which makes it a popular choice for use in products that are subjected to high levels of stress or friction."

[2:42:08] cjthedjdolphin: Exactly
[2:42:10] Techniker32: I mean, true... but signal integrity, loss etc. is a MAJOR issue. That's why 5.0 MB are soo much more expensive. 6.0 needs totally new ways of engineering
[2:42:17] elkarr: yeah they said already like 15 years ago that 5 ghz cpus aint possible cuz of speed of light limit, then dual core cpus came

[2:43:18] Trollsamaa: in fairness, there was responsibility on both ends, it was neglegence on the user end but negligence that was supported by a poor plug design that did not offer any meaningful feedback or retention.

[2:44:43] iMelon: Merry Christmas y'all waffleHeart
[2:44:44] Gamernxc: a little overkill
[2:44:50] Blitzonite: btw waffle I meant an actual physics based limitation to just how much information can actually be moved and how fast it can, not even about transistors. After a certain point, the raw information is treated like matter being moved xd its weird, but really we will only see this as an issue when we get to quantum computing stuff
[2:45:02] Rhenotic: the cover for the ram was made out of metal so when i was putting it back on it touched a chip

[2:46:05] Blitzonite: its pretty cool
[2:46:07] BMYGRLFRND: @Nexhunter it's a pretty nice package, but a bit unfriendly to upgrades due to you needing to throw it out entirely to swap it

[2:47:00] BMYGRLFRND: @Nexhunter yeah, but with how much surface it has, it would kinda defeat the whole purpose of it

[2:47:31] Miniluva: I've sent one in a twitchchat with 2k people KEKW
[2:47:33] Sentinel1_9: yet
[2:47:33] Nexhunter: well the real purpose is to kill the stupid ass SODIMM connector which should have never been invented ReallyMad @BMYGRLFRND
[2:47:35] Jeramu: I tend to click the submit button instead of enter because of that rooKek
[2:47:36] yuhikyaku: matxRip

[2:47:51] ChromaCym: I've also been burned for having the wrong terminal selected and having typed into the wrong one :l
[2:47:56] Glacial_Indifference: If they do, it is probably through chatty so timeout wouldn't do anything.
[2:47:57] Nexhunter: you fucked up @Jayouz

[2:48:06] AshhanX: password manager is the best money ive ever spent
[2:48:14] WalrusPug: if youre not using a pw manager in 2022, its your own fault
[2:48:15] Nexhunter: speaking of that shit
[2:48:17] LethalBro: Length > Complexity NODDERS
[2:48:17] Fufcia: i had coworker that typed her password on Teams convo KEKW

[2:48:24] Nexhunter: if you have used lastpass in the past or use it now
[2:48:26] Glacial_Indifference: Bitwarden and keepass if you want local control.
[2:48:27] Nexhunter: FUCKING ROTATE YOUR PASSWORDS
[2:48:29] AshhanX: 1password gamer
[2:48:29] WDForty: last pass just got hacked
[2:48:29] Blitzonite: oh last pass :D
[2:48:32] Glacial_Indifference: Lastpass if you want online
[2:48:32] ChromaCym: Bitwarden and 1password are the best regarded as of late
[2:48:34] Jeramu: LastPass had that data breach not too long ago
[2:48:34] ninopanda: I love bitwarden
[2:48:35] Gamernxc: didn’t last pads leak

[2:48:35] Farnite: lastpass keeps getting hacked
[2:48:35] Nexhunter: @Giantwaffle ROTATE YOUR FUCKING PASSWORDS
[2:48:36] Dr_Alori: los pass
[2:48:36] Purecrew: Why would you assume software developers know Security standards?
[2:48:36] wondox: lastpass is not nice lmfao
[2:48:38] ChromaCym: KEKW
[2:48:38] Dexy2811: KEKW lastpass more like leakpass
[2:48:39] Blitzonite: KEKW
[2:48:46] Nexhunter: rotate those passwords anyways
[2:48:49] LissXIV: Oh god lol
[2:48:52] NTiernagan16: LostPass
[2:48:53] AnesthesiaFC: uhhhhh.....
[2:48:53] WalrusPug: lastpass had a breach in august
[2:48:53] Ohmec: @Giantwaffle LastPass does not keep your passwords. It's all stored locally
[2:48:54] ChromaCym: I hear Bitwarden nice KEKW
[2:48:55] ayaya_prime: you should
[2:48:56] Tabakhase: not rly...
[2:48:56] HostileLogOut: just dont use a password manager at all.
[2:48:57] imTymp: i use a different password for everything important
[2:49:01] 0x000000: keepass is nice if you don't trust cloud services
[2:49:03] GuardMoony: run your own password server ez
[2:49:04] ChromaCym: also remember chat
[2:49:05] Kudasauce: back to notebooks LUL
[2:49:05] Moobot: You can sub to Waffle by clicking this neat link -> twitch.tv/giantwaffle/subscribe SUBprise
[2:49:06] imTymp: and a base password for stuff not with my info
[2:49:07] Techniker32: Rotate? So i type them backwards? @Giantwaffle
[2:49:08] Nexhunter: OMEGALUL thinking lastpass is local only
[2:49:10] Maximus439: i just autogen passwords and use a local password manager
[2:49:11] SimonSez: I use selfhosted Vaultwarden
[2:49:15] HostileLogOut: 2FA i use for everything.
[2:49:15] Harmar: i use to do crazy shit like this ";#1%$42ge%3" but alot of services dont like so many symbols anymore LUL
[2:49:17] Jeramu: @Ohmec They keep the encrypted values. The encryption key is stored locally on your machine
[2:49:17] dollar_cave: as long as your master password is good, the password vault can't be decrypted
[2:49:18] MrWaka27: Remember to enable Authenticators guys.
[2:49:19] elkarr: yeah If possible use 2FA
[2:49:25] itzSimondr98: My password is 13 random letters KEKW
[2:49:25] ChromaCym: having different passwords for everything and having the encrypted passwords leaked is STILL BETTER than using one password for everything and having IT get leaked
[2:49:29] holdfastt117: same passowrd for everything, i live on the edge
[2:49:29] KaizokuKing7: rotate? i still use the same childhood password on most of my accounts
[2:49:31] Jayouz: Most things are forcing 2FA these days
[2:49:32] Flamewolf13: last pass has a different way of securing it, so there would still be an insane brute force to try and guess your master password in order for them to try and get your other passwords
[2:49:36] officialhunterx: can we watch dosh
[2:49:37] Twin5un: NODDERS
[2:49:40] AleXanDreMau: @Giantwaffle i use a simples python code to print the leng and what i want so random pass every time!
[2:49:42] kikakeki: factorio videos
[2:49:44] dylan0806: What do you do when you lose your phone with 2fa?
[2:49:45] BallisticChrome: Dosh video NODDERS
[2:49:49] Nexhunter: @Flamewolf13 yea and most master passwords are already in the dictionary KEKW
[2:50:04] Sentinel1_9: @Giantwaffle are there facades in this pack
[2:50:05] bugsplatter23: you always end up doing these team server games by yourself after 3 days
[2:50:06] KaizokuKing7: NOTED

[2:50:24] dylan0806: Shouda, woulda, coulda?
[2:50:26] TheWonderLlama: OMG without channels you can have as many as you want?! My mind is blown!
[2:50:29] Baske_T: don't fireproofs safes usually not actaully prevent stuff frmo inside burning?
[2:50:35] Smithii: Rent a bank vault NODDERS
[2:50:35] Jolle450: Imagine crafting something, leaving it in one of those crafting terminals and then forgetting where you put it KEKW
[2:50:36] BunniVooDoo: Aye nice did the same thing
[2:50:36] BronzKneeeCap: @Giantwaffle thoughts on those c4 drinks? were they any good

[2:50:38] slyjedi: That’s a 2hr fire protection fire safe.

[2:50:42] Techniker32: Where are those locations?
[2:50:42] Fufcia: 321 rule

[2:50:44] Techniker32: Kappa
[2:50:48] MadWolf1290: offsite*
[2:50:48] Larklen: oh hi Waffle
[2:50:50] dav3yb: I've been using Bitwarden recently, also deleted my lasspass account recently due to their data breach
[2:50:50] Harmar: depends on the safe, there is alot of fake and cheap ones
[2:50:53] Yakobro: @TheWonderLlama you still want to minimise inport/export busses, to lower lag
[2:50:55] SilverSnowFFXIV: They are rated in time.
[2:50:56] elkarr: here its usually rated for 3 hours fire
[2:50:57] Smithii: They prevent fire, not melting
[2:51:03] AnesthesiaFC: fireproof safes, keep the fire INSIDE the safe
[2:51:12] KaizokuKing7: NOTED can u be more specific waffle on the location?
[2:51:12] imTymp: yea i have a biometric gun case too
[2:51:13] TinaCarlysle: a safes fir rating will tell you at what temp and how long at that temp it will work.
[2:51:17] Jolle450: Your BB-gun? Kappa
[2:51:20] Yakobro: COPIUM I got the good one
[2:51:21] elkarr: so to steal waffles gun, cut his thumb
[2:51:24] GuardMoony: lockpick lawyer :D
[2:51:24] J0hanAndersson: i bet LPL can pick it
[2:51:26] piiixxx: is biometric good? cant a thief just cut ur finger off and open it?
[2:51:27] NexX_____: we had a safe safe safe
[2:51:28] Glacial_Indifference: Active cooling safe?
[2:51:29] BunniVooDoo: @Giantwaffle What's your thoughts on Black Desert Online, weird question I know but it gets such a bad wrap so curious what your opinion on it is
[2:51:31] GarlicJelly: He went through Lockpicking Lawyer's whole catalogue just to make sure it's safe Kappa
[2:51:31] MadWolf1290: you watched LPL before choosing your safe? LUL
[2:51:33] Necto_gck: lockpickinglawer here
[2:51:34] memothegreat: LPL Kappa
[2:51:39] Blitzonite: just make a cryogenic fire-proof safe :D
[2:51:41] HostileLogOut: put a fire proof safe inside a nuclear proof safe inside a electromatic proof safe.. inside a safe.
[2:51:43] Nexhunter: LPL gonna need to do fire rating testing KEKW
[2:51:49] TinaCarlysle: LPL is a sham lol
[2:51:50] imTymp: locks prevent honest people not criminals remember that
[2:51:54] Harmar: @GuardMoony pepeLaugh so many "perfect" items... opened with a paperclip or a magnet
[2:51:54] AnesthesiaFC: safes are rated on how long it takes to open them, no safe is completely unbreakable
[2:51:56] memothegreat: it s a fluke
[2:51:57] elkarr: sometimes picking the lock takes less than using the key lol
[2:51:59] SimonSez: All locks are bad. It's just a deterrent
[2:52:00] LUCIFER_RA: luckily i am poor enough to not care about things getting stolen
[2:52:03] Jayouz: 300? Did you order it from aliexpress? :D
[2:52:06] ThomK114: Did you see the vid of him shooting a lock with a 50 cal? LUL
[2:52:08] natsu130: biometric is bad because when you die nobody can open the safe BibleThump
[2:52:10] neb31: LPL's april fools vids are pretty funny too
[2:52:11] Necto_gck: he opens locks with coke cans
[2:52:13] Trollsamaa: if a LPL video is more than 30 seconds long, thats basically an endorsement
[2:52:14] GuardMoony: or just screw on the hinges you can undo
[2:52:16] memothegreat: locks keeps friends away
[2:52:18] Larklen: @natsu130 scissors can fix that
[2:52:24] Typicalbox: as someone who can pick locks, LPL is 100% real.
[2:52:30] Eriberry: lock picking lawyer opening motorcycle locks is oof, but a lot of motorbike locks really just buy you time and deter but ppl still will get through a lock if they want it bad enough
[2:52:31] Techniker32: Bulletproof glass it is then
[2:52:33] Kadotettu_: Locks keep honest people honest
[2:52:38] CurbSerpent: Locks stop crimes of opportunity.
[2:52:40] Harmar: most it will do is take 5 minutes of a very annoyed thief to break into anything physical
[2:52:45] KaizokuKing7: i loved watching him fondle his coq
[2:52:46] Twin5un: OMEGALUL
[2:52:58] Larklen: KEKW

[2:53:06] SimonSez: lol
[2:53:07] oohoo3: HUH

[2:53:21] GuardMoony: I loved the self-build unpickable locks he got send
[2:53:23] traemonsta666: I’ve seen a video of a dude taking a Walmart security camera off and buying it from Walmart
[2:53:29] Helegal07: backdoor one was good too
[2:53:30] Necto_gck: there was a trial here in the UK where they put a cardboard cutout of a police office in a shop window and it did reduce shoplifting
[2:53:31] EvilSicSlayer: Presence sponsers fear
[2:53:35] holdfastt117: walmart had a study done, that they spent more money employing security than merchendise was stolen. so alot of there stores are going security-less
[2:53:57] ChromaCym: lmao the self storage place near me has a cardboard security guard in the window
[2:54:02] ChromaCym: he's always on duty
[2:54:10] bitflips: Shrink
[2:54:11] Larklen: and most of its from internal anyways KEKW
[2:54:19] samuraijac: its mostly the feeling that your being watched keeps most people from stealing
[2:54:21] Dodgers0n: I worked LP for a big box and it was fucking hell
[2:54:22] weasel9999: most loss prevention focuses on employees anyway
[2:54:26] Nexhunter: company pays shit take from the company YEP
[2:54:26] The_Holas: just raise prices Kappa
[2:54:28] Invariantly: So steal :)

[2:54:34] BunniVooDoo: Didn't Target lose like $450 million dollars from theft over the past 2-3 years?
[2:54:37] theRealWesty84: It’s like when cops park empty patrol cars near stretches of road known for speeding
[2:54:41] Brandar711: I had the police says that to me when my house was broken into. We had a french front door and the police said....this is an opportunity crime. The French doors were easy to kick in and given the opportunity, a criminal will do it.
[2:54:42] DarkKnghtt58: turn on hover mode KEKW
[2:54:43] 1killersquirrel: terraria minecraft
[2:54:43] Nexhunter: no
[2:54:44] ChromaCym: when loss prevention takes the merch themselves bc it's ""evidence"" KEKW
[2:54:44] Techniker32: Can't you turn on hover mode or so?
[2:54:45] Harmar: costs more in salary then a place will lose after insurance LUL
[2:54:59] jim_from_high_school: do you have access to the giant castle you made like 8 years ago?

[2:55:01] TallicDragon: place scaffold?
[2:55:13] Nexhunter: Target lost profit by completely redoing stores in the midst of a fucking pandemic
[2:55:16] BunniVooDoo: Waffle you missed my comment on BDO, what are your thoughts on the game? It gets a bad wrap but what's your opinion
[2:55:18] YOUCEP: why do you hate hover mode
[2:55:26] Zucate: a friend of mine did lost prevention for like 30 years and there were a few times that he did so well at a store caused them to cancel their contract with the security company only to be brought back a few months later
[2:55:30] Sentinel1_9: get out of here with your logic
[2:55:32] Nexhunter: the targets near me were completely redone in the pandemic KEKW
