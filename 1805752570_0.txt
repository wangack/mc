[0:47:17] Speederzzz: I know q good one, but since it's so long is quite q bother to tell so I'll summarise: a man visits a farm and sees a pig with 1 leg. He asks how the pig lost its leg. The owner tells several heroic stories where the pog throws itself into danger but survives whole. In the end, he asks "okay but why the leg?" The farmer replies: "oh such an amazing pig, you dont eat in one go"
[0:47:18] Dresdenfalls: you reminded me of another genie dad joke   -  The Genie asked "What's your first wish".   Steve says "I wish I was rich".  The genie nodded, "what is your second wish".   Rich replies "I want lots of money".
