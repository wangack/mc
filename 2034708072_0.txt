You always make me smile and laugh with your humor and gameplay. You're super fun to watch since you're an incredible streamer and it doesn't hurt that you're very beautiful. Thank you for all the laughs and good times you, Henry, Kai, and Yuki have brought me with the streams and videos. Thank you for making my birthday extra special.
