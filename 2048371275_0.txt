[0:35:21] honeysie: BAHHAHA
[0:35:22] joshdabozz123: there‚Äôs 2 new roles
[0:35:27] Paanda_Cat: OOP
[0:35:28] susana7613: a tribunal means you get 3 quick votes, and the person voted up is killed immediately
[0:35:32] honeysie: noooooo
[0:35:34] XCosmicEmber: omg
[0:35:38] ParanoidDandroid: shubbleSalute
[0:35:41] simply_tab: what was that??
[0:36:00] joshdabozz123: like last week
[0:36:01] Paanda_Cat: I‚Äôve never played this idek what‚Äôs going on
[0:36:02] aubreezie: they came out last week
[0:36:06] aubreezie: tab im exhausted
[0:36:08] marceline236: That was eventful
[0:36:12] susana7613: marshal is a new role, the other new role is a socialite
[0:36:27] susana7613: socialite means everyone can talk to each other at night i think
[0:36:27] Moobot: Follow me on instagram and twitter: @shelbygraces
[0:36:33] aubreezie: marshal makes it so the next 3 voted will be executed
[0:36:39] suki_eros: Arg, ye walked thar plank
[0:36:44] simply_tab: @aubreezie same work stuff as usual?
[0:36:44] Paanda_Cat: what‚Äôs the marshal do?
[0:36:45] foggy_rain101: HI SHELBY I MISSED YOU IVE BEEN AWAY
[0:36:48] dr_noahfence: they throw parties essentially at night
[0:36:51] joshdabozz123: the other new role socialite where they basically make night time another discussion
[0:37:05] joshdabozz123: and it disrupts evils private chats
[0:37:05] dr_noahfence: everyone but jailed and jailor can talk there
[0:38:11] simply_tab: doesnt this role sound too op?
[0:38:11] Moobot: Shubscribe to my YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/shubble
[0:38:13] joshdabozz123: u vote three people up
[0:38:19] joshdabozz123: they get auto hung
[0:38:30] simply_tab: yeahhh thats op
[0:38:34] joshdabozz123: basically
[0:38:37] smoshkate: HI
[0:38:47] joshdabozz123: they voted up kara
[0:38:49] Paanda_Cat: so if you vote someone your trying to kill them that‚Äôs really.. odd
[0:39:00] valhas0nolife: did town of Salem get an update?
[0:39:05] joshdabozz123: yeah, 1 by 1
[0:39:22] marceline236: shubbleRage
[0:39:26] Paanda_Cat: I thought they just died when they got voted in so confused
[0:39:38] joshdabozz123: that‚Äôs correct
[0:39:48] Paanda_Cat: but that‚Äôs not what just happened
[0:39:57] valhas0nolife: how many new roles are there?
[0:40:04] joshdabozz123: 2
[0:40:19] valhas0nolife: oh so the marshal and what?
[0:40:34] joshdabozz123: Socialite
[0:40:42] PixlFox_: party
[0:40:49] valhas0nolife: what do they do lol?
[0:41:01] dr_noahfence: parties at night, everyone talks there except for the jailor and jailed
[0:41:04] joshdabozz123: they disrupt the evils night time discussions by making night time a day discussion
[0:41:20] valhas0nolife: ohh that‚Äôs cool
[0:41:59] joshdabozz123: really easy to find jailor if there is one in the same game as socialite
[0:41:59] Moobot: Follow me on instagram and twitter: @shelbygraces
[0:42:07] Paanda_Cat: see they got voted and didn‚Äôt die why? isn‚Äôt that what is supposed to happen?
[0:42:11] joshdabozz123: because Hailie won‚Äôt be able to speak in the party
[0:42:14] joshdabozz123: jailor
[0:42:23] joshdabozz123: not stupid autocorrect
[0:42:30] Dirge_Zero: they make it so everyone can talk at night like during the day, instead of just coven being able to talk
[0:42:33] dr_noahfence: theres also only 2 parties per game
[0:42:33] joshdabozz123: UGHHH FORGOT IT. I hate autocorrect
[0:43:06] valhas0nolife: so the marshal has to activate his tribunal power then everyone who gets voted in immediately killed??
[0:43:16] joshdabozz123: yes
[0:43:16] Moobot: Shubscribe to my YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/shubble
[0:43:31] valhas0nolife: got it, thanks lol!!
[0:43:32] Paanda_Cat: wait that last 3 days or they can kill 3 people in that day?
[0:43:33] joshdabozz123: they only voted late up when they did that tho; which was smart
[0:43:39] joshdabozz123: 3 people in one dsu
[0:43:46] joshdabozz123: day*
[0:43:50] Paanda_Cat: ohhh that helps Ty
[0:43:59] joshdabozz123: sometimes I hate typing on phone in twitch char
[0:44:18] dr_noahfence: theyre coven
[0:44:25] joshdabozz123: Kara kinda basically said heck was traitor I think. I remember seeing her say in dead chat GO HECK. maybe I‚Äôm wrong tho
[0:44:26] Paanda_Cat: @joshdabozz123  struggles fr
[0:44:30] dr_noahfence: but have a town role
[0:44:36] LoliTheBlobfish: They're coven but they have a town role with town powers
[0:44:56] suki_eros: traitor has town role but their coven yeah
[0:44:56] PixlFox_: and they still show up as innocent etc like a normal townie
[0:45:07] joshdabozz123: every role can be traitor
[0:45:36] Paanda_Cat: i am so confused rn
[0:45:56] joshdabozz123: they have to kill everyone
[0:46:05] Paanda_Cat: who?
[0:46:21] joshdabozz123: because technically everyone is a townie, just one of them is a townie who is evil
[0:46:26] joshdabozz123: no they can‚Äôt kill
[0:46:45] PixlFox_: TT can't kill so it's just luck of the vote now that all the other evils are out
[0:46:45] Moobot: Please don't backseat game or send spoilers! If I need help, I'll ask for it!
[0:46:52] dr_noahfence: depends on traitor's role on if they can kill, like traitor vigi or smth
[0:47:11] Paanda_Cat: what?
[0:47:11] Moobot: Follow me on instagram and twitter: @shelbygraces
[0:47:28] joshdabozz123: they have three days to find the trader once all coven are dead
[0:47:34] joshdabozz123: traitor*
[0:48:01] Paanda_Cat: what‚Äôs town traitor?

[0:49:13] joshdabozz123: and if they die you choose another the next night
[0:49:30] joshdabozz123: just gotta get them voted up during the day and hope they don‚Äôt die
[0:49:35] ParanoidDandroid: Poor Vikram is Easy Mode for Exe
[0:49:50] Paanda_Cat: you don‚Äôt want people to kill them you want they to be voted okay
[0:50:35] joshdabozz123: oh seer was nerfed as well if you get it at all today
[0:50:49] joshdabozz123: or if you fake claim it
[0:52:55] Paanda_Cat: so is neutral evil like your trying to win or you also win if the town wins
[0:52:55] Moobot: Follow me on instagram and twitter: @shelbygraces
[0:53:11] joshdabozz123: you win by yourself, not with anyone else

[0:58:43] joshdabozz123: not sure if this would work as a late TI claim is sus but this is a chilled lobby
[0:58:44] Paanda_Cat: I think someone said you can if they get voted (but I‚Äôm not the person who should answer this)
[0:59:30] marceline236: Sprite fountain sounds great. Good idea Kara!
[0:59:41] joshdabozz123: I think if I remember correctly they can only change target if they did not by being hung. might be wrong here.
[0:59:41] Moobot: Shubscribe to my YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/shubble
[1:00:18] joshdabozz123: I feel like chilled will know it‚Äôs you if you try to push vik.
[1:00:39] joshdabozz123: since he knows vik is an exe target
[1:00:44] joshdabozz123: apparently
[1:01:29] xalouz: I missed the start of this, how does being traitor work?
[1:01:54] joshdabozz123: they are a townie that wins with coven
[1:01:54] Moobot: Please don't backseat game or send spoilers! If I need help, I'll ask for it!
[1:01:59] Paanda_Cat: no clue

[1:03:32] joshdabozz123: that‚Äôs how it works
[1:04:05] xalouz: which one, the first or the second
