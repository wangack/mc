[2:14:56] gloncs: @fudge1 technically wouldn't the probability of thunder sub 2:30 be lower on runs bc if he gets weather in the first 30-60 mins (before trident), wouldn't that ruin the run?
[2:15:11] lion4202: @TakeshiYukiRyu with looting 3, that would be 0.115 x 0.17 = 0.01955 = 1.995% chance
[2:15:36] rachel__red: need more rockets dinkDonk
[2:15:43] Daniel_H212: @lion4202 but then how many drowneds have both a trident and a shell?

[3:43:50] betyoumc: chat you know what time it is? blowing up village time
[3:43:52] TheRealZimmShady: Taziey also gold is generally not the bottleneck in the run so its not a big deal
[3:43:53] SAMS300FOXES: TNT THE GARDEN LETSGO
[3:43:58] BurperFish: why blocking water sources ?
[3:44:00] CompleteDeception: why blocking water??
[3:44:08] Leo_Lapis: the crops NOOOO
[3:44:08] CurtisDN_: @taziey theres no iron farm that's low enough effort and high enough rates that makes it better than gold when the run is this fast
[3:44:11] KindPlays: @CompleteDeception so it doesnt flow all over the place when he uses tnt
[3:44:12] samm35_: Kreygasm

[3:44:26] CurtisDN_: Maybe if your run is 10 hours then an iron farm is good enough for all the beacon blocks
[3:44:30] TheRealZimmShady: this village deserves a drought, they've had it too good for too long
[3:44:33] CompleteDeception: @fuzzycousin lmao
[3:44:38] betyoumc: good monument prox?

[3:45:55] BurperFish: oh both yes and no
[3:45:58] CurtisDN_: But you need it then to not count towards the raid
[3:46:02] penguinsandstuff: paus
[3:46:04] samm35_: Drake
[3:46:05] CurtisDN_: Which is a strat, but usually slower

[4:39:10] Jonathinater: @camman18 the advancement range from pick up a dirt to get a stack of every block and item and do arbalistic with like elderguadian, witch, endermite, brown mushroom or smth insane like that
[4:39:11] CurtisDN_: pac why did we make the same joke kinda

[4:40:25] smobrayden: last run of today?
[4:40:26] TalkingMime: it wouldn't be impossible, we prob just need 4 people who really know what they are doing, cuz there's a couple things that are like cycle based that need to be done quickly, and let all the other mofos do random shit that makes them happy
[4:40:29] frisk_is_agender: only a stack of any
[4:40:34] Pritce: all versions aa would be wild
[4:40:37] PacManMVC: i think mime should do the blue axolotl
[4:40:37] SirIronOW2: hi mime
[4:40:45] frisk_is_agender: ya egaps are easier than compasses i have like 3 stacks now
[4:40:47] TalkingMime: not necessarily cycle based, just like need to be started early
[4:40:49] Novamb: and you force one poor fella to just build the necessary farms
[4:40:50] frisk_is_agender: trims are a pain
[4:40:52] penguinsandstuff: 21 gold already?
[4:40:53] penguinsandstuff: wtf
[4:40:54] the_man_in_gray: that would take like a day
[4:40:55] MEverts: What was the end time on that run a little bit ago? I had to head out while Fein was mining netherite
[4:41:00] Moo_God41: yes uh
[4:41:00] babybeeeeeee: paus
[4:41:03] Novamb: trims are fine since you can dupe
[4:41:03] tjthings: @TalkingMime you'll beat the co-op as long as you start sleeping as soon as realistically possible
[4:41:03] penguinsandstuff: paus
[4:41:07] Daniel_H212: paus
[4:41:07] garymcharry: A stack of each trim seems a tad rough

[4:41:30] haydenisadopted: i wish there was more motivation to run coop bac back but being pacelocked by sleep :(
[4:41:30] garymcharry: But perhaps crafting them wouldn't be too bad if you found a decent source of diamonds
[4:41:31] infer_n0: 2:32:48 thunderless or something
[4:41:33] the_man_in_gray: Stare
[4:41:35] frisk_is_agender: i did trims but took way longer than i needed too cause i wanted to loot more than dupe for fun

[4:42:00] penguinsandstuff: +2 dimon
[4:42:00] frisk_is_agender: the only ones that would be crazy without duping for trims is silence but dune is rough as well with new desert gen
[4:42:15] Novamb: just need one silence
[4:42:17] penguinsandstuff: bro is just Stare ing at that piece of gold
[4:42:19] Novamb: and 63*7 diamonds

[5:07:43] penguinsandstuff: hes just gonna be there now
[5:08:12] gloncs: @fishybear987 i was doing some research that the first weather event is tied to the seed. if someone can make a calc to see when first thunder is based off seed then it could at least help cut down on thunderless runs... i'm also stupid so don't listen to me
[5:08:54] skywalker31415: @gloncs you're not allowed to determine seed
[5:08:54] byugoi_: knowing the seed is illegal for runs though i think
[5:09:02] penguinsandstuff: @gloncs if it is possible for that its illegal
[5:09:07] penguinsandstuff: @byugoi_ because of this
[5:09:09] gloncs: true but there might be something there
[5:09:27] Novamb: also it always thunders before 2:30, but it also has to rain at the same time
[5:09:35] gloncs: i'm just doing braindead chat scheming
[5:09:46] skywalker31415: maybe there is any other game mechanic that uses the same rng value as thunder, like divine
[5:09:52] skywalker31415: prob not

[5:10:41] byugoi_: i think thunder is a interesting mechanic that makes aa runs feel more special and more thrilling when you do get it
[5:10:41] CurtisDN_: Even if you knew when it was gonna thunder, it wouldnt be that good for speed cause youd wanna route around it
[5:10:49] penguinsandstuff: @byugoi_ MHM
