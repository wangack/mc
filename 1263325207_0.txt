If you don't unlock a skill you can't do that skill or complete tasks. 1 skill = 10 renown I think. There's different levels of tasks, if a master task (endgame) is only 5 points, you need to complete 2 master tasks to unlock 1 skill... to those asking for clarification

[0:43:07] RighteousBru: i think that if poe competes with lost ark it will be a good way to make poe get into third gear

[0:43:52] T_Eggy: I've played both I love both, wouldn't say they're very similar though
[0:43:55] kefyrasFTW: 11th
[0:43:57] merscever: poe sucks because you have to start over every league
[0:43:57] Allmostdone: I don't see the similarities. Kapa
[0:43:59] TexxLive: there is also a new class in Lost Ark. but not for the West release for now. The Artist
[0:44:08] Kaomie: CHat every 3D isometric games are the same
[0:44:11] RighteousBru: lost ark is also much slower than poe
[0:44:17] kamer0x: reminder that lost ark is censored AYAYA
[0:44:19] Harmar: if lost ark does similar update scheduling it might win, push updates and add content constently
[0:44:20] Ataiu: Whenever i play PoE, i love it, a friend and me always dream of an auction house.
[0:44:20] Andy_975: Wait these are different games?
[0:44:27] TexxLive: yes
[0:44:34] TexxLive: is mean this video of him
[0:44:34] ZyianDev: They might be similar combat, but that doesn't always mean they're competing, though can't deny the overlap
[0:44:37] ChrispyZombie: I feel like poe is starting to die out
[0:44:38] Gingerosis: @giantwaffle itâ€™s horizon Forbidden West, not zero west LUL
[0:44:39] Allmostdone: Yea look at that new game icometric pong
[0:44:40] fistonparon: Did you ever tried ICARUS?
[0:44:42] xD_Ghost: lost ark has a 3 day head start thing too right?
[0:44:45] wiadroglowy: Lost Ark skill system is boring AF, PoE is much more complex in almost every aspect
[0:44:47] VertVelocity: I feel like lost ark is closer to D3 in terms of skills and such, could be way off though
[0:44:58] DanologyUK: fistonparon he has played it LOADS on stream
[0:45:00] MT__Chair: Lost Ark  pvp is wild

[0:45:21] T_Eggy: @wiadroglowy PoE combat is super boring though while LA combat is way more engaging
[0:45:31] third_ender: Never have I picked up an upgrade from the ground as is
[0:45:41] E6BAV8R: The PoE skill system is horrid
[0:45:41] RighteousBru: obfuscation
[0:45:55] DeadlyBrother: poe is all about 1 skill lol
[0:46:03] T_Eggy: Fun detected? I think not
[0:46:03] wiadroglowy: @LordDusk true, i prefer PoE at this time but will try LostArk full game for sure (i playd beta)
[0:46:04] SlayerCro: sounds like warframe and its devs tbh
[0:46:10] mitmiter: PoE just seems over complicated way to click 1 button
[0:46:12] Kaomie: So far it worked though
[0:46:15] gutter54: I tried to play poe and noped out once I saw the skill tree -- it is not new person friendly
[0:46:18] Sevrene: The players don't know what they want COPIUM
[0:46:23] Mheruy: that's what happened with me and PoE, i burned out super hard PepoThink
[0:46:33] thebodge: Lost Ark has parties right? With a tank and healer?
[0:46:34] RighteousBru: when you're playing poe you're not playing your class, you're playing your build. in most other games you're playing your class.
[0:46:35] Scrapped: unless you use the auto flasks
[0:46:38] third_ender: you dont have to piano flasks anymore due to enchant
[0:46:50] ryanforresterdev: you don't piano anymore in poe
[0:46:53] wiadroglowy: tank vs dodge
[0:46:55] wiadroglowy: for sure
[0:46:55] T_Eggy: or kill the whole screen 1st

[0:47:54] DeadlyBrother: the space dodge on lost ark feels so good
[0:48:04] Kaomie: We are screwed
[0:48:09] ryanforresterdev: Play a dex build and then it's about dodging KEKW
[0:48:15] SusesuS: after supreme calamitas you are inmune to lost ark
[0:48:15] thebodge: when is Lost Ark?
[0:48:38] DeadlyBrother: have you seen the 2part videos from saintone on lost ark raiding? @Giantwaffle
[0:48:43] BiJay0: after Terraria I have small doubts on Waffle's ability to dodge in Lost Ark
[0:48:44] xD_Ghost: yessir
[0:49:00] Brodih_: what class are you going with ? Sorry if you already mentioned it @Giantwaffle
[0:49:06] ZentilBlight: wish there was more trash to kill, love that about poe
[0:49:10] Larklen: susHmm weak
[0:49:11] Sevrene: what kind of MTX does Lost Ark still have? Is it basically pets/mounts/cosmetics?
[0:49:13] Allmostdone: Do they hire the same artist?
[0:49:24] Jakosin: hopefully it comes out with dx11 :)
[0:49:32] W84M3: why having alts?
[0:49:43] Brodih_: and you get a free pet to pickup your loot!
[0:49:43] SolarisFall: lost ark encourages alts
[0:49:52] ryanforresterdev: removed almost all p2w mechanics
[0:49:57] SlayerCro: just seen the painter class, looks so good
[0:49:57] third_ender: there ARE p2w mechanics in Lost Ark. Doesnt mean you have to, but they ARE there
[0:49:58] ItIsJQ: Cant play lost ark in the netherlands and belgium, rip :( @Giantwaffle

[0:50:44] JommyBee: you should have more gear chances
[0:50:46] BenjoTV_: There is even gear and non normal gear pvp
[0:50:47] that_creecher: I think its lame to timegate areas but offer the ability to bypass it with alts
[0:50:51] quazaka: Because why not just play a moba then.
[0:50:53] Jakosin: go play archeage if you want to be like that LOL
[0:50:56] JommyBee: thats what elo/rating is for
[0:50:58] T_Eggy: cuz more time should = win and not more skill
[0:51:00] T_Eggy: Kappa
[0:51:01] ItIsJQ: @Hurtwolf as far as I know I cant, because of the laws arround loot box gambling
[0:51:10] E6BAV8R: There are also non-normalized PVP arenas
[0:51:10] Individuum69: PVP is supposed to be skill gapped not gear dependable.
[0:51:25] Jakosin: If I have more gear I should win. not better player = winner :) ok dude
[0:51:31] ryan_tokki: any life skilling?
[0:51:34] mahajimbo: NOTED lost is the ark and the ark contained how to describe this game

[0:52:29] Individuum69: There are PVP/GVG island where your gear matters
[0:52:36] Sevrene: It's a good thing you didn't decide to add Shadows of Abbadon to your Terraria plathrough then, there is a big bad spider in that that is creepy af
[0:52:41] quazaka: But thats how it is in Runescape, Path of exile, Diablo 2,
[0:52:41] ItIsJQ: @Hurtwolf Yeah I might be ble to play with a vpn! But I really dont like using a vpn, it slows down your internet..
[0:52:44] The1ceCream: Yep
[0:52:49] Kaomie: GW2 *cough*
[0:52:51] T_Eggy: now when you're talking PvE then yeah that should be gear dependent

[0:53:19] BiJay0: diablo 2 pvp is a thing
[0:53:20] Wattanabeoutto: Lost Ark pvp is also horrendous KEKW
[0:53:21] quazaka: D2 pvp is a thing
[0:53:24] Harmar: d2 not really, its mainly only speedrunners now
[0:53:24] 1TMat: osrs pvp has a lot of pretty standard builds tho
[0:53:25] miracore: only pvp poe really has is the royale they just introduced
[0:53:25] Amnisia: d2 pvp is somewhat revived now with D2 Resurrected
[0:53:29] 1TMat: and LMS is normalized
[0:53:33] ryan_tokki: d2 pvp is common
[0:53:40] Individuum69: D2 PVP was a huge think atleast back in the days. Was broken tho and literally getting 1 shot by everyone
[0:53:51] 1TMat: Lol yeah some mod banned 300 bots
[0:53:52] Wattanabeoutto: Lms is only good for pking supplies
[0:53:56] miracore: mod twisted EZ
[0:54:01] miracore: banned they all in one go
[0:54:05] Harmar: Tylana all it took was one person doing cow king to wipe everyone LUL
[0:54:17] 1TMat: Also real pvpers just wait til Deadman and its hype
[0:54:26] Allmostdone: Why make so many bots?
[0:54:30] Wattanabeoutto: YEP maxed iron here

[0:55:08] Doodliedie: what do u plan to play today?
[0:55:10] Jakosin: Just don't buy gold 4Head
[0:55:10] ThatOnneGuy: it's gamblers that buy gold
[0:55:12] miracore: im playing a main and its just fine idk
[0:55:13] ThatOnneGuy: they're addicted
[0:55:22] 1TMat: And because buying gold is against osrs terms but not illegal at all in real life
[0:55:31] mitmiter: Why would i want to limit myself?
[0:55:31] Otschboh: Same with tarkov ... there wouldnt be as many cheaters if RMT wouldnt be possible Sadge
[0:55:35] Allmostdone: Well they could blockchain the gold and shut down the sellers
[0:55:37] miracore: why does that matter for a main though
[0:55:38] Aldiron: I use to enjoy buying things off the GE, but once I swapped to my group iron, I'll never not play ironman again.
[0:55:39] Orin_The_Sly: I stopped playing :)
[0:55:43] Ziiked: Tax update helped abit on that
[0:55:44] Aarimous: Did I miss a POE conversation?
[0:55:48] Jakosin: marketplace in ffxiv has bots as well. scripting usage of retainer and undercutting.
[0:55:51] Kaomie: ANYWAY

[0:55:55] wonly: obviously you didnt play OSRS during runebot
[0:55:56] lvyEartman: is it easy to sciprt in ORSR?
[0:56:04] 1TMat: Lost Ark looks sick, first ive seen of it
[0:56:04] disserno: @lvyEartman yes
[0:56:05] Kuroiorb: yes @Aarimous
[0:56:11] Tsikio: I don't play ironman because i like the convenience of buying a cake for a quest in ge, rather than spending 30 minutes making one

[0:56:36] Individuum69: Give Lost Ark a try. You will be suprised how good it is. Loads of content and fluid combat system
[0:56:36] Etwas77: waffleAYAYA waffleAYAYA hello
[0:56:38] Aldiron: @Kingia for me personally, it feels so much more gratifying getting the items myself (or via members of my group in this case) and I actually feel more accomplished after grinds. Dopamine because of the grind basically.
[0:56:40] DewDragon: only thing i was dissapointed with lost ark was the mages lack of damage
[0:56:42] Kuroiorb: peepoBox Josh
[0:56:47] miracore: poe2 better bang.. or im losing hope for GGG
[0:56:48] Zinbar: @Giantwaffle would you recommend ppl Looking for a guild now to have a better social experience?

[0:57:36] freerolling16: that was Everquest for me, Wow was good for its time though
[0:57:37] Scrapped: nah 1999 Everquest.
[0:57:39] BiJay0: WoW is the best social platform but not the best game then
[0:57:39] IDdeathdanish: I recently started playing Hardcore Classic WoW. Its pretty fun. A new twist on the classic I played as an 8yr old
[0:57:39] yshouldeye: Sitting in Org trying to find groups and talking with guilds

[0:57:44] E6BAV8R: Every persons first MMO is that way, to them
[0:57:47] ryan_tokki: why didn't you try out project zomboid multiplayer? it's been out for weeks
[0:57:50] Kingia: @aldiron That's how I feel about it as well. I've not a group for group Ironman but the thought of a cooperative grind is awesome to me.

[0:58:55] JReyUhhh: lmfao
[0:59:00] Leg0lasse: counter strike 1.0 or even before that was solo but after 1.3 when you got into a team it became a social thing also. That's why I ignored wow for years
