[0:32:35] JustPepeDontBeMad: @SmoothBlizzard they can set the magic switch to do other things as well, depending on what they've set their rotatories to. So it's not just "brake magic button" it's "magic button". Sometimes they use the magic to change settings in specific corners to help them corner.

[0:59:16] isot0nic: nice minecrafting bro
[0:59:18] Joshuapetch: HUGE
[0:59:20] D3athKai: its more like gigawatts LUL
[0:59:21] YOhodges: what are we watching
[0:59:22] boogerbomb01: The most surprising news in this launch is that Sirius XM is still a fucking thing?
[0:59:23] Pixelsalt: widepeepoHappy
[0:59:23] rofl1436: no way
[0:59:25] pewdiepiesson: idk maybe because there's no atmosphere to absorb any of the energy from the sun rays?
[0:59:27] aman36000: It may have battery and just outputs at peak times?
[0:59:28] Joshuapetch: KEKW
[0:59:29] JaguarOne: thats what she said
[0:59:29] subfin: solar energy is more powerful in space?
[0:59:31] thatguymarckonov: thats what she said
[0:59:45] Rob_Kebab: the entry burn is so fascinating
[0:59:50] Joshuapetch: Change the title to, Might get to MC eventually Kappa
[1:00:07] YOhodges: @subfin should be you dont get the filtering that the atmosphere does
[1:00:08] CorSPACE: picture of the sat https://everydayastronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/SiriusXM_SXM_8_1-2-683x1024.jpg
[1:00:09] masztufa: solar energy is in range of 1300-1500 W/m^2 at earth's orbit
[1:00:13] Joshuapetch: Damn, we lose that cam
[1:00:19] exo_pho3nix: sicko mode
[1:00:21] leo_k4n: @Giantwaffle did they say that the satellite produces 200 MW of power?
[1:00:23] espi: that's hot
[1:00:26] Joshuapetch: wtf that image!
[1:00:28] espi: don't touch that chat
[1:00:30] masztufa: even at 30m x 30m solar array can't possibly make anywhere close to 20 MW
[1:00:46] Tabakhase: 30MW of radio aint that hard
[1:00:50] Renny_S: do they build the satellite in its extended position? or do they assemble it in its folded position 🤔
[1:00:56] D3athKai: 2MW
[1:00:57] masztufa: how much did they say? 73 dB of power?
[1:01:02] Garzilla: I feel like im watching paint dry
[1:01:02] n8level: bit of green in that exhaust
[1:01:12] Joshuapetch: hodl signal
[1:01:14] masztufa: if yes, them MW range sounds right
[1:01:17] orangecreamsicle3: monkaSTEER
[1:01:22] D3athKai: first time no camera cut out during landing LUL
[1:01:24] YOhodges: lmao an offshore windturbine generates 6MW or so
[1:01:25] Joshuapetch: PogChamp EZ
[1:01:26] Mike190Twitch: -0 KEKW
[1:01:27] n8level: @Garzilla we love space paint here

[1:02:05] kinglouisxvii: No
[1:02:10] Mike190Twitch: Witchcraft!
[1:02:11] D3athKai: glad we no need wait 25 mins  LUL
[1:02:13] sogerr: @GlipGlop no, its a drone
[1:02:19] leo_k4n: to make 20MW of power if the solar erray transforms 100% of solar power into energy it would have to be 121mx121m big which is waaaaaaaay too much (and especially heavy)
[1:02:28] Bracaster: i have a seiko watch
[1:02:40] n8level: going to geo?
[1:02:44] CorSPACE: it has to push ap to 36k km
[1:02:44] Joshuapetch: big boost
[1:02:47] mechoriet: confirmed not a small burn
[1:02:51] fci_: apparently SXM-7 the previous SiriusXM satellite was declared a total loss.
[1:03:00] Mike190Twitch: Propane Accessories?
[1:03:08] JadedOnyx19: yes i use to work for a propane place
[1:03:09] Bolt_Vanderhuge_: Hank Hill is intrigued
[1:03:11] Lazermage23: I have seen generators that use propane to fuel themselves
[1:03:12] Tabakhase: there are sooooooo many rocket "fuels"
[1:03:15] Mike190Twitch: Hank Hill has entered the chat
[1:03:20] G0Free: i use it in my kitche tho Kappa
[1:03:23] JadedOnyx19: all our truck ran on propane
[1:03:24] BennyF_Jr: Like a Fork Lift engine?
[1:03:28] Joshuapetch: pepeJAM
[1:03:29] Pixelsalt: pepeJAM
[1:03:31] orangecreamsicle3: Hank Hill has entered the domain
[1:03:40] dr_Griff: Book called Ignition! is a really good read for chem nerds
[1:03:41] Lazermage23: And also fork lift trucks that use them as well
[1:03:44] ItsOnMax: Everything can be rocket fuel, if you just compress the explosion enough
[1:03:56] JadedOnyx19: you can run an engine on both gas and propane with a switch over
[1:03:57] CorSPACE: JRTI is being outfitted currently to go back to the west coast
[1:04:05] DmtryZhkv: her hands man, they have mind of their own
[1:04:07] boogerbomb01: Is this camera not good neough to pick up background stars?
[1:04:07] Moobot: You can find Waffle's Youtube channel here - https://youtube.com/giantwaffle
[1:04:08] Joshuapetch: PeepoClap
[1:04:09] D3athKai: the payload is huge
[1:04:19] mechoriet: the payload is massive
[1:04:32] RazorOPS_: woah
[1:04:34] ItsNodens: HandsUp
[1:04:37] xdomisx: massive load gachiBASS
[1:04:39] ItsOnMax: A banana for scale
[1:04:40] BlainL: @boogerbomb01 there are no stars in space
[1:04:41] madseed15: banana for scale
[1:04:41] Tabakhase: the balustrade is good scale
[1:04:51] CrankyHerk: that ladder is probably 10ft
[1:05:01] leo_k4n: at least 2kg
[1:05:03] Kompreni: a football field
[1:05:04] Atzgee: poles maybe a 1 meter
[1:05:09] koalalava: look at website
[1:05:10] CorSPACE: 7-8 i think
[1:05:10] itamarb77: isnt it like 30 tonnes?
[1:05:13] Tabakhase: 8ton
[1:05:19] kefyrasFTW: your mom weight ?
[1:05:21] Lazermage23: 5,500 kg (12,100 lb) to GTO when the first stage is recovered
[1:05:23] LymePlays: 5.5k kg
[1:05:25] jdude20202: 8.3 tonnes
[1:05:41] xaytana: @Giantwaffle did some digging on the satellite, the million watts statement was meant to be thousand, it's a 20kW solar array as stated by other media outlets
[1:05:56] omar_i_: whats you feeling today Waffle, games wise?
[1:05:58] BoldVenture: from NASA space flight To power the satellite, two large solar panels will generate more than 20-kilowatts of power
[1:06:08] Lazermage23: if they dont recover, Falcon 9 can lift payloads of up to 22,800 kilograms (50,300 lb) to low Earth orbit (LEO)
[1:06:18] vordican: you have to look at the conversion. decibels don't work how you think
[1:06:29] Shadow_of_Pain: did you ever look at the ride along options on the spacex site? 1 million lets you send something aboard a falcon 9
[1:06:30] ItsOnMax: nuclear solar reactor
[1:06:36] CorSPACE: this is a great website to go down rabbit holes, its like a wikipedia for spacecraft https://space.skyrocket.de/doc_sdat/sxm-7.htm
[1:06:46] orangecreamsicle3: !permit masztufa
[1:06:46] Moobot: @masztufa will not get timed out for the next 3m (@orangecreamsicle3)
[1:06:49] peacekeper24: weird
[1:06:52] orangecreamsicle3: post it again
[1:07:00] sumophlux: 20MW is what a lot of data centers use for an entire data center that is decently sized....that is a lot of power
[1:07:02] MikeTheTechLead: Tesla’s Model 3  peak kW is 366kW btw, just for comparison
[1:07:12] masztufa: thanks! (it was basically a 2 MW diesel generator that's bigger than the entire sattelite)
[1:07:14] SmoothBlizzard: spacex should make their own space station
[1:07:17] masztufa: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frDYWKbdY08
[1:07:27] blrwllm: did you talk about the unreal engine 5 release?
[1:07:31] LymePlays: aerospikes?
[1:07:32] BrandonBuilder: neat
[1:07:41] YOhodges: @SmoothBlizzard the commercialisation of space is not something I look forward to
[1:07:47] daemonaedryn: Did you see the Superman clip of Unreal 5?
[1:07:52] CorSPACE: @Giantwaffle you watch everyday's video on small sat launchers?
[1:07:56] Kompreni: @SmoothBlizzard They wont go far. We need to do it with a lot of countries, it's the best for space exploration
[1:08:03] ChilledNightmare: think the demo for the ue5 engine was like 100gb or something like that
[1:08:19] LymePlays: firefly is awesome
[1:08:24] MediocreStream: That was a good show
[1:08:32] blrwllm: I saw a 1.5 hr video of a complete guide to a small scene using UE5. pretty neat

[1:10:45] tinspin: :S
[1:10:47] Lavaman94: what position is that?
[1:10:48] DodieTheBasic: yyjYikes

[1:11:45] Crizzle777: DaGMC the fuck?

[1:12:02] Zoinx: "Basic computer skills with ability to use e-mail and associated MS office programs" KEKW
[1:12:08] Crizzle777: do you realize all of the shit frontend needs to know?

[1:12:29] Arcovius: Federal Way shout out
[1:12:37] aicoa: but why are there so many apartments in Seattle then
[1:12:39] DaGMC: @Crizzle777 if your a senior dev ops thats not a big problem
[1:12:39] Lavaman94: the domain is really nice, i like that area
[1:12:40] Tomthegamer: @giantwaffle It isn't fine if you give away your address. Super easy
[1:12:40] kurtbarlow: Firefly aero is back from dead ? they havent done shit in 6 years since they last emerged. And it's known that they pay like shit.
[1:12:42] licdic: why do so many streamers live there?
[1:12:48] RaInGotMe: I live in LA :)

[1:13:43] D3athKai: you should aim for spacex
[1:13:47] omar_i_: they want a Network Engineer PogChamp
[1:13:49] DmtryZhkv: lets make all use Austin
[1:13:56] DmtryZhkv: us*
[1:14:02] Bulva: no
[1:14:03] Chronoes: sounds stupid
[1:14:04] MoonTory: That's not normal no
[1:14:08] MadkingMatt: that seems low
[1:14:08] kurtbarlow: Waffle, google them, they are borderline scam company
[1:14:09] ADVANTAG3OUS: You could get by with less im sure
[1:14:09] wompfox: 3:1 is pretty normal in my experience, yes
[1:14:11] Chronoes: work experience >>>> education
[1:14:13] Crizzle777: That shit isn't that strict. It's just stuff they say. You can always just apply
[1:14:13] Lazermage23: For Gov't style contracts, Yes
[1:14:13] dasmako: django been outa while
[1:14:14] WebDeveloperGuy: django is old
[1:14:14] BlackholeYeti: isnt that saying they want that much experience only if you dont have education
[1:14:15] masztufa: looks like an "elite" place
[1:14:17] Bulva: 2 to 1 ratio more normal
[1:14:18] MoonTory: You could probably get the job with 5 years and a solid portfolio
[1:14:19] oxiough: django was ~2005
[1:14:20] JBourden: you need to get a shit job for a few years to get your foot in the door somewhere then move up internally
[1:14:21] WebDeveloperGuy: like 13 years or os
[1:14:21] ExcelsiorVFX: Django has been out for a while
[1:14:22] ZyianDev: Django was 2005
[1:14:23] Lavaman94: jango has been around for a long time
[1:14:25] brewerdc: Experience > Education
[1:14:26] the_mosm: @Giantwaffle 2:1 is a bit more normal. Indirect experience that you can tell a good story about counts too.
[1:14:27] Lavaman94: no I agree
[1:14:27] Pekter: most of it is bullshit
[1:14:27] brewerdc: Yes
[1:14:30] aicoa: its the typical "18 years of experience, only 19 year olds please!!!!" .. manager BS
[1:14:30] Crizzle777: Those requirements are not a hard fast rule
[1:14:30] masztufa: yes
[1:14:31] qoob: that sounds like "just get a degree doofus"
[1:14:32] aur1so: yes
[1:14:36] boogerbomb01: Thats them acknowledging that experience matters more than a piece of paper.
[1:14:37] SmoothBlizzard: how can you have 12 years of school
[1:14:37] PanKalmarek: no
[1:14:38] MadkingMatt: yea
[1:14:40] MadkingMatt: i agree
[1:14:40] Lavaman94: Experience is way better
[1:14:44] zebadrabbit: reading those requirements, they just want a fluffed up web admin
[1:14:44] Rob_Kebab: 6 years of education = 18 years experience (which is more years Ive been alive)
[1:14:44] ggantija: if you have a solid portfolio your good to go
[1:14:46] WebDeveloperGuy: That's true.
[1:14:46] JacobSolo: Yeah this is true
[1:14:47] MoonTory: 100%
[1:14:48] Pokesaurus_rex: @Giantwaffle It's normal because this is just a hard filter remember the resume gets you the interview THE INTERVIEW gets you the job
[1:14:49] omar_i_: true
[1:14:50] Lazermage23: Degree means you can follow rules properly, experience means you can actually do it.
[1:14:52] Gnepcoyi: Depends so much on the job
[1:14:54] BrandonBuilder: Expereience Trumps Education
[1:14:58] licdic: i learn more from youtube tutorials than school
[1:14:59] ItsOnMax: But experiance is not knolage
[1:15:03] Munschmann: Its a different kind of knowledge.
[1:15:06] Lavaman94: that is fact 1st year on the job is what trained me the most in web programming
[1:15:09] ba_nanananananana: the requirements are usually dumb to keep people who just started from applying
[1:15:12] DmtryZhkv: i worked a month in a vet clinic and learned about 4 years of stuff in that month
[1:15:14] Gnepcoyi: Making coffee for your boss is not experience for some jobs
[1:15:15] wompfox: for what it's worth, US Immigration defines the 3:1 rule @Giantwaffle
[1:15:16] ZyianDev: This is totally an entry level position, requirement aside
[1:15:17] Rob_Kebab: 4+12=16 whole years of your life
[1:15:20] dasmako: yep
[1:15:25] WebDeveloperGuy: It is when the company isn't ran by a boomer
[1:15:37] DodieTheBasic: the most I learnt from Telecomunications Engineering = learning capabilities
[1:15:38] twistedsense: Aren't you worried that your job as a streamer will affect your possibilities?
[1:15:43] Rob_Kebab: Great movie
[1:15:45] D3athKai: flash?
[1:15:45] WebDeveloperGuy: I work in django right now and it sucks
[1:15:46] ExcelsiorVFX: It's pronounced Jango, no D
[1:15:47] JacobSolo: Checkout FastAPI @Giantwaffle
[1:15:48] omar_i_: some certain things you will never learn only while working in your field
[1:15:49] MoonTory: That is like mid dev requirements
[1:15:53] Crazyfox55: lol
[1:15:55] Pekter: Rust is a game Kappa
[1:15:57] JustPepeDontBeMad: Guys, is it unchained KEKW
[1:15:58] Crizzle777: REST is a type of communication
[1:15:59] itamarb77: api stff
[1:15:59] masztufa: first year at work is better than first year in university, HOWEVER third year at work is less than what you get in a third year of university
[1:16:00] dasmako: rest is just api to communicate
[1:16:01] Chronoes: fine either way
[1:16:02] ZyianDev: REST is the modern communication protocol
[1:16:03] Fidelinfidel: Sequel works too
[1:16:03] Wibit: Either or
[1:16:03] Crazyfox55: sequl
[1:16:03] brewerdc: sequel
[1:16:03] omar_i_: its S.Q.L
[1:16:03] DecoyOcelot: REST is a common API framework
[1:16:04] D3athKai: sequel LUL
[1:16:04] ExcelsiorVFX: It's Sequel and Jango
[1:16:04] DKFrits: Rest is an api thing
[1:16:05] MadkingMatt: everyone says sequal
[1:16:05] dasmako: i say sequel
[1:16:05] imAWMan: Rest is the type of communication
[1:16:05] WebDeveloperGuy: it's whatever you want it to be.
[1:16:05] ruccoa: REST is easy, you could spend 15 minutes in python and figure it out

[1:27:34] the_mosm: @Giantwaffle with desired they want at least analogous experience. Like for RabbitMQ, they'd take ActiveMQ or IBMMQ experience instead
[1:27:35] WebDeveloperGuy: glassdoor is where people review previous jobs and report their salaries
[1:27:35] MoonTory: glassdoor is a website to look at industry salaries
[1:27:35] Allmostdone: linkin
[1:27:37] Crazyfox55: This will not pay that much
[1:27:46] IdiotCodie: UK software Dev pay is shit if interns in US are getting 6 figures
[1:27:53] kausley: @Giantwaffle did you saw the latest coding adventure of Sebastian Lague ?
[1:28:00] Crizzle777: no they will ask you in depth react questions
[1:28:02] WebDeveloperGuy: That's garbage pay for that much experience. 12 years experience for 100k? lmao
[1:28:10] subfin: this would be 50k MINIMUM
[1:28:11] Moobot: Support Waffle by using his Epic creator code: Giantwaffle
[1:28:12] Crizzle777: it's better to know react than to know vanilla JS
[1:28:15] Crazyfox55: Yea 50k not 100k
[1:28:26] Crizzle777: Cracking the coding interview is the bible for interviews man
[1:28:27] MushuTushu: varies per area
[1:28:37] Lavaman94: it should pay at least 80 k
[1:28:37] Crazyfox55: ~60k maybe 65
[1:28:40] Lavaman94: it wont
[1:28:41] zombietaint: @Crizzle777 I've always worked for companies where the frontend was 'dumb'. It's only used for api calls and displaying data. There isn't any real logic/complexity behind them. So in that sense they were not complicated
[1:28:43] Gelil: I would think this is probably 85 - 110K
[1:28:45] Allmostdone: 50k? Don't even try it. That's McD's
[1:28:46] JacobSolo: This role is probably ~80k
[1:28:59] WebDeveloperGuy: This role is worth 115-130 in texas
[1:28:59] Lavaman94: haha you think they are hireing multiple
[1:29:03] kefyrasFTW: Is waffle planning on quitting streaming and switching to programming?
[1:29:13] Tiggaboo: 2k hours a year
[1:29:15] DodieTheBasic: they ask, for a job, what they need from a whole department
[1:29:16] MushuTushu: for context, I do fullstack JS work and make 155k. but its adjusted for cost area
[1:29:20] zombietaint: 160 hours for full time
[1:29:20] bazketcase: why don't you apply? you'll learn a lot about what they are looking for if you get an interview
[1:29:20] JacobSolo: 2080 iirc
[1:29:21] ZyianDev: I don't think you'd get 100k starting in Austin
[1:29:22] Crizzle777: zombietaint yea I work for a new company like that since my previous company got acquired their front end is like that I hate it
[1:29:22] Myekos: that explains why I didn't hear back from them.  priced myself out
[1:29:24] MattyMcCall: hmmm how many years for this job?
[1:29:24] London_Monarch: 2080
[1:29:27] yildizYUSUF: 208 hours I think
[1:29:28] Lavaman94: no no no they are gonna hire one then complain they pay them too much and have them do everything
[1:29:29] 747Overcast: 160 hours
[1:29:42] Crizzle777: 100k is entry level in austin buddy
[1:29:45] JacobSolo: Austin is getting their is Cal COL
[1:29:48] WebDeveloperGuy: In austin starting is like 60-80
[1:29:53] Allmostdone: only if you are a senior
[1:29:57] Stillglade: 100k entry level dev in Charlotte
[1:29:59] Crizzle777: WebDeveloperGuy really? That's surprisingly low
[1:30:05] zombietaint: @Crizzle777 why do you hate it? let the frontend do fancy/pretty frontend things. let the servers do the heavy lifting/complicated stuff. Makes life SOOOOOOOOOO easy
[1:30:06] Crizzle777: Similar to Ann Arbor
[1:30:19] DodieTheBasic: 5Head EZ
[1:30:24] MakerOfThingys: wow
[1:30:25] Lavaman94: IT and programming is so undervalued. It is criminal, actually.
[1:30:26] London_Monarch: SELL
[1:30:29] WebDeveloperGuy: @Crizzle777 It's been a year since I looked, but it's not much different from dfw (where I'm at)

[1:30:48] somepalegamer: Sell and buy the dip PogU

[1:31:13] Gelil: @Giantwaffle Have you started your move to El Salvador yet?
[1:31:23] WebDeveloperGuy: I sold and am renting for a year.
[1:31:26] Myekos: you bought before the massive spike, you're good
[1:31:36] mikwitty: yeah but even if you sell your house, don't you also need to buy one? so net is neutral?
[1:31:46] Larson21: What is the site that he always uses to chart cryptos and stocks?
[1:32:03] Hariga: kentucky?

[1:41:05] Cyberwire69: its on YT
[1:41:11] RusUrtel: They did have a crash, but that was pretty long time ago. Keep in mind this is probably the most affordable space experience we will get any time soon. IMO
[1:41:18] AsHackDM: in 15 tim apple

[1:42:30] WebDeveloperGuy: They have a YT stream coming up in 10 minutes
[1:42:34] holeyroller: @RusUrtel Wasn't that crash due to pilot error, I seem to remember he did something he shouldn't have.
[1:42:34] K4gen: cruise speed of 747/777 is around 0.86 Ma
[1:42:36] Pokesaurus_rex: Thats different tho..commercial air travel hasnt changed since like the 19080s due to things like air resistance which impacts fuel
[1:42:38] RegDenied: the advantage is that the rocket starts out in way less dense atmospere
[1:42:54] boogerbomb01: At that altitude do they have to worry about sats?
[1:43:05] AsHackDM: current commercial planes doesnt able to go faster because turbo fan engines are not design to  do it jety engine itself stalls if they go faster @Giantwaffle
[1:43:16] Gelil: There are a new series of supersonic commercial air craft coming next year for testing. Boeing has the details
[1:43:21] RusUrtel: @holeyroller i don't think we will know for certain. very possible, can't really tell for shure

[1:44:01] AsHackDM: they were accidents
[1:44:01] vordican: 1
[1:44:02] Damage35381: 3.5 hrs from London to new york  PepoThink

[1:44:15] Selebrimbor: they not planing to ga as fast as concorde did
[1:44:23] dabeda1: DETH YEP
[1:44:23] QwyIl: Boom is the supersonic jet company
[1:44:29] podwe: charles de gaul airport france, big crash
[1:44:30] Okkelsskov: @Giantwaffle the Concorde got retired due to a crash in France after takeoff
[1:44:32] Damage35381: number one thing is the sonic boom, like it can only go super sonic over sea
[1:44:33] Cyberwire69: mayday is an awesome show tho
[1:44:34] vracorzi: the problem was that the plane was limited to the amount of airports due to the sonic booms being so loud over residential
[1:44:35] Orin_The_Sly: I remember them having residential issues with their speed
[1:44:44] calel13: Cant fly supersonic over cities
[1:44:52] Caaked: we have the last concorde in my city
[1:44:53] Pokesaurus_rex: Yes
[1:44:55] AsHackDM: YEP
[1:44:56] Caaked: is pretty cool
[1:44:57] Gelil: YEP
[1:45:00] FingerGames: heavy
[1:45:01] Cyberwire69: fully loaded fuel
[1:45:01] Stillglade: it ran over debris on takeoff
[1:45:04] helios34: Colombia space craft accident?
[1:45:07] aur1so: YEP
[1:45:09] omar_i_: yup, true
[1:45:17] Balafore: Not technically a crash. The concord hit debris on the runway
[1:45:18] M1k3D3l7a: YEP T/O weight is above max landing weight
[1:45:18] YOhodges: saw a really cool idea for a flight plan that would go over the north pole to avoid land and go from london to australia super fast
[1:45:26] DodieTheBasic: V1... Vr... Possitive rate, gear up.
[1:45:33] Damage35381: yep abort take-off is pretty dangerous YEP
[1:45:33] ruccoa: yeah if you need to return to the airport above max landing weight the planes need to dump fuel
[1:45:39] omar_i_: they need to vent 2/3 of their fuel before landing
[1:45:41] Gelil: Landing is usually is easiest as the hydraulics handle most of the load
[1:45:42] D3athKai: we need a safer plane, so no take off
[1:45:42] holeyroller: I think a Concorde picked up runway debris, was seen aflame, and crashed shortly after.
[1:45:45] M1k3D3l7a: wrong
[1:45:47] Myekos: Air France Flight 4590, was caused by debris on the field
[1:45:54] DodieTheBasic: yep
[1:45:54] kefyrasFTW: V1ZULUL
[1:45:55] M1k3D3l7a: V1 is the last point at which you can stop
[1:45:57] dasmako: i dont remember the exact points but yea
[1:45:58] 747Overcast: Statistically most accidents happen during approach and landing
[1:46:00] BennyF_Jr: @holeyroller yes that was the big crash

[1:54:18] Myekos: the deform allows more contact patch
[1:54:19] espi: they want the expand the tire so the expansion "pushes" against the ground to give extra grip
