[1:12:55] TheKnopex: stream raiders? PauseChamp

[1:13:10] MIICUTICO: COPIUM
[1:13:13] Anitional: Whats wrong with the keyboard?
[1:13:20] johnshepherd104: Could be a scanning issue
[1:13:22] MCas86: i need the numpad. i hate them otherwise
[1:13:23] Harmar: UPS reason why pepeLaugh tracking always wrong
[1:13:25] Tuxiak: You gotta believe
[1:13:29] Citriz: its crazy amazon now doing 70+% of all deliveries inhouse
[1:13:31] DeeK4yOne: which one did you get?
[1:13:39] johnshepherd104: I have had a lot of tracking issues with UPS so
[1:13:41] Cyberwire69: @mod check?
[1:13:42] Apparentthreat: did he ever add the sign for the new warp?
[1:13:44] Harmar: @Citriz sadly they kinda had to lmao
[1:13:47] DrHax_: local depot might be full and they couldnt unload the truck it was on catonShrug
[1:13:55] JosshM: repair all command in a vanilla server?
[1:13:57] TuxLafitte: Did I hear someone say Stream Raiders....  danKappa
[1:14:16] MarquesCoding: @JosshM server is too big to have XP farms
[1:14:16] L707644: @Apparentthreat he did for quarry
[1:14:21] kenzgamer21: hi I am new here and I love minecraft
[1:14:27] fahrenheit462: I have a monitor that‚Äôs supposed to come Thursday, and it hasn‚Äôt even been shipped yet
[1:14:29] MarquesCoding: @kenzgamer21 welcome
[1:14:36] Tuxiak: Btw, why is is normal in the US to leave packages outside of ppls houses? Like amazons
[1:14:47] fahrenheit462: I ordered in on Christmas
[1:14:51] just_a_joyful_josh: is it just a Java server
[1:14:53] JosshM: @MarquesTwitch makes sense, just was confused LUL
[1:14:54] Thurlas: while building things, why do you insist on filling things completely? isnt hollow easier?
[1:14:54] Citriz: @Citriz true, its just weird seeing most other company fumble the last 2 years and amazon literally double in size monetarily and physically... kinda scary
[1:14:57] HeyAFrozenZebra: I had something 2 night shipping from Boston to Maryland and it took a month
[1:15:05] Firstnecron: @Tuxiak if they didnt I'd never get a package. No one is home when they deliver...
[1:15:32] Tuxiak: @Firstnecron but isn't it reason there's so many package theft? In my country you've to sign or you won't get it
[1:15:34] Lupic: i'm glad EVs are growing too
[1:15:52] Wyatt_Earth: counting on more bailouts
[1:15:53] Spiderpig1711: They are all developing them. It takes time
[1:15:58] skuzzyy11: didnt hertz help a lot with that?
[1:16:02] Crag2804: The kodak approach to products changing
[1:16:07] Harmar: EV's are very dangerous and still very costly to develop/build
[1:16:08] Schowzy: getting paid by big oil to not pursue monkaS
[1:16:12] Citriz: this spring there will be over a dozen EV's starting production in the bigger companies i.e. GME, Ford, Toyota
[1:16:13] Hunter_Boone: Nikola Kappa
[1:16:13] DrHax_: @Citriz the entire logistical chain is just overloaded as fuck. not enough warehouse workers, drivers and in some parts cars fucks everything
[1:16:16] Apparentthreat: perhaps they're getting more money from oil/gas groups susHmm
[1:16:20] thefriendzz: toyota doing something good i hope
[1:16:20] 1lurker: electric mustang got released quietly, i see a lot of them
[1:16:20] Tuxiak: Yeah, and they don't even earn money LULW
[1:16:22] Skipy129: or do theu think tesla already has a monopoly?
[1:16:27] VengeanceUM: i think its funny because usually cars are a depreciating investment, and ive made money just owning my car KEKW
[1:16:27] korderoi: what car does waffle own?
[1:16:28] dazai13e: hi
[1:16:29] Alem_Sinner_pt: probably because of hydrogen cars
[1:16:29] GoJoose: And for basic EV 60k is normal and for 60k you can get a crazy good petrol car :/
[1:16:29] TheKnopex: teslas stock is just overpriced
[1:16:30] C0ldPlasma: the ones with no EVs by now are gonna go bancrupt
[1:16:33] thefriendzz: toyota ev line looking promising
[1:16:34] Kuhnivess: Thje automotive industry already sucked though. GM got bailed out back like 10 years ago
[1:16:37] Pieguy7343: its like they weren't ready for an innovator to come in and just had to actually start working on something once Tesla applied pressure
[1:16:37] Slowkill333: @Giantwaffle It is because companies are more worried about the profits now, not the future.  Executives get their bonuses because of how they are doing now, not how they will do in the future.
[1:16:37] Caritien: If anything it's a nice thing that it happened because it might push other automotive companies to make Electric models
[1:16:39] HeyAFrozenZebra: Now only if I would purchase a Tesla with Doge
[1:16:50] VengeanceUM: @Giantwaffle i think its funny because usually cars are a depreciating investment, and ive made money just owning my car KEKW
[1:16:51] celadriel23: stock valuation is no longer predicated on the success of a company
[1:16:55] Citriz: Everything is overpriced, we are in a massive bubble right now.
[1:16:56] Default_Uk: Petrol/Diesel bans coming in across Europe in next few years which explains some of the growth.
[1:16:57] 1lurker: f150 lightening will probably be popular too
[1:16:58] satyasann: probably because EVs are only viable in developed countries
[1:16:59] davethulhu: irrational market
[1:17:00] CGrizzley: @chat any of yall got any nfts?
[1:17:06] MogXi: if tesla keeps the growth they are doing right now tesla will not be overpriced in 2023
[1:17:07] maiph_: tesla is being valued at a price 10 years from now
[1:17:14] MogXi: with the current share price
[1:17:17] iciRellik: I wonder if it's because Tesla is more of a software company than a car manufacturer
[1:17:32] hackett33: There has been a lot of hate for Tesla recently. Could see a trend down in the future. I remember how popular Saturn cars used to be
[1:17:48] A_Tin_Rat: you said it before TSLA stock is high cuz the tech
[1:17:49] AleXanDreMau: @Giantwaffle use midle mouse click
[1:17:59] himmelking92: but thers also stuff who not get released becouse company's not wanna bring it out like thers new akkus theyr thin like foliage and way stronger many stuff just get holded bacl
[1:18:00] LiivingProof: Kia is going in with the EV‚Äôs right now
[1:18:03] himmelking92: back
[1:18:11] MCas86: but that spaceX program to suck CO2 outta the atmosphere sounds interesting although its not even starting yet
[1:18:13] Wyatt_Earth: It's become obvious that Tesla is going to be a major world player for the next 100 years. That's why it's so safe. That's why it's going up.
[1:18:15] Firstnecron: gotta be oblivious to not have realized the tech wasnt there yet LUL
[1:18:18] Cannonboot: @Giantwaffle isnt MERC have better self driving at this point? or is it fake story?
[1:18:18] SeaOhDee: SeaOhDee subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 10 months! 
[1:18:21] maiph_: i mean, they are also innovating on batteries, it's not just a car company
[1:18:28] maiph_: they also offer insurance
[1:18:29] fellynamedkelly: Meanwhile I'm sitting here comfy as a clam in my civic haha
[1:18:39] RoninStorm: I think people are investing in Tesla becasue it's the only way to invest into Elon's other projects like SPacex
[1:18:40] hackett33: Remember Saturn cars? me either
[1:18:42] himmelking92: its all about money that no other company brougbt out electric cars and shit
[1:18:43] DrHax_: cant wait for EV car prices to stay the same once we get the new batteries companies are working on sadKEK
[1:19:06] Wyatt_Earth: Tesla also has zero competition
[1:19:08] iciRellik: All I want is AAs that don't leak after a year :)
[1:19:10] Sploogii: aren't their cars super safe though?
[1:19:12] davethulhu: tesla's self driving is not only not good, it's intentionally crippled.  Musk refuses to anything other that optical sensors.
[1:19:13] HeyAFrozenZebra: Oh yeah those Tesla solar roofs keep popping up on my youtube recommendd
[1:19:17] Tabakhase: @Toom079 vanilla for a while, no clue how long, but like a year ort more easy
[1:19:18] MarquesCoding: @Wyatt_Earth wdym?
[1:19:24] Kianistus: I'm writing a PhD on the kind of AI that is needed for self-driving cars to work, and there's a lot of mixed opinions in the academic community about it. It's easy to get self-driving cars to work like 90% of the time, the issue is that it's insanely hard to get those cars to respond reasonably to unexpected events that a human would have no problem doing.
[1:19:39] Kollisco: This guy who keeps asking about your base is kinda sus
[1:19:39] Moobot: You can find Waffle's Youtube channel here - https://youtube.com/giantwaffle
[1:19:42] himmelking92: compare to Akku technik from china tesla is a child LUL
[1:19:43] AleXanDreMau: @Giantwaffle TESLA IS a battery companie, they make cars just to improve baterries and EVs
[1:19:55] Citriz: @iciRellik rechargables = win ... eneloops last me on average 5+ years never had a leak
[1:19:56] MogXi: tesla is probably gonna go in to every sector that elon and his comrades think need to be rethinked and get innovated
[1:20:01] NevaDaha: good moaning chat, good moaning waffle pokiWave
[1:20:08] MarquesCoding: @NevaDaha morning neva

[1:20:55] MayhemMooseS97: I just canceled my booster because Im terrified to go to the grocery store rn LUL
[1:20:56] AIex_0: Same LUL i don't go out if i can avoid it
[1:20:59] Apparentthreat: the line for an urgent care near me was so long. it may have been just for testing but still
[1:21:01] HeyAFrozenZebra: 16% positivity rate around here

[1:21:38] the1_ajc: Have you had your jabs?
[1:21:49] Zenon908: Vaccines are there to really stop you from getting Covid, its more so you dont die when you do get it
[1:21:53] LiivingProof: Is the US boosting already with vaccine?

[1:22:11] Arby_52: is it safe to see someone a week after they tested positive?
[1:22:13] fellynamedkelly: There's a recent article in Nature that shows how much Omicron is punching through the vaccines/boosters
[1:22:14] VeroSketch: @R1Rider01 the shot just makes the symptoms milder, does what its supposed to do
[1:22:15] Klippan23: Klippan23 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 4 months! pog
[1:22:16] mikehawk954: its only a cough and runny nose tho, so

[1:22:23] the1_ajc: I‚Äôve had a text to book my booster but going wait until after the holidays
[1:22:24] MarquesCoding: @Giantwaffle Have you had your booster yet?
[1:22:28] PinAnims: My management team knew COVID was a thing in our restaurant and DIDN'T TELL ANYONE. So me and my girlfriend got it and gave it to some family and friends... Luckily we're all vaccinated.

[1:48:39] Ichigolo: summit has that
[1:48:40] Reloadinko: summit has it like that
[1:48:48] RikSolo: you could use NDI to send video from your streaming rig to your main rig
[1:49:00] Ichigolo: wth u set that up for him? awesome
[1:49:09] jay7tx: Just
[1:49:15] Caritien: Isn't it more complicated due to physical location of your rig and not per se the entire set up? Wouldn't the technical setup be capturing the 3rd PC's stuff?

[1:50:28] VampireGod: Just turned in what are you doing
[1:50:34] Reloadinko: just click a button and your desk transforms into sim setup LUL
[1:50:39] RikSolo: I've done NDI in professional broadcast environments and then general way of doing it is just having your audio separate, until you have a mixdown going into your "final" single NDI stream
[1:50:41] Immp: Yeah, yeah. I know the difference. Just wondering who consistent the signal for the sifi is
[1:50:44] Immp: how*
[1:50:53] Ichigolo: I was telling summit to ask u about your setup and stuff too

[1:51:15] RikSolo: NDI is one of those things where it can be a massive pain to use, but it's generally still less of a pain than the alternatives
[1:51:19] SpankTank_aGoGo: I just got two white LED box lights and a greenscreen for christmas so wish me luck. tbf I wish I read further that the Logitech streamcam was USB C so now I'm waiting on an adapter -_-

[1:51:28] Harmar: @RikSolo thats been my main issues with NDI, i always had delays so it took a bit to get audio and video to sync right lmao
[1:51:47] KritterIsBack: I feel like streamers moved away from greenscreens
[1:51:47] Tabakhase: u use obs-ndi or ndi-capture standalone on that pc?
[1:51:48] MarquesCoding: means you have hide your messy room :)
[1:51:52] SpankTank_aGoGo: Greenscreen is nice when you dont have a nice house to have as your background @Giantwaffle
[1:51:56] Reloadinko: you should also get the green tight suit they use in movies and only have a hole for your face
[1:51:56] Moobot: Come join the Waffle House Discord! <# https://discord.gg/fhGFtMuzdS
[1:52:01] MarquesCoding: but then again I never stream with my cam on...

[1:52:05] Harmar: @KritterIsBack there situational
[1:52:10] MCas86: i'm not a green screen fan
[1:52:30] MarquesCoding: it looks clean, but if you don't have good lighting or camera then it'll look shit
[1:52:32] Reloadinko: i remember you used to have  a green wall
[1:52:38] RikSolo: green screen is the easy option, and getting a bit to the point where it's starting to feel uninspired
[1:52:50] SpankTank_aGoGo: yeah, that's what I'm going to work to avoid
[1:52:51] RikSolo: i'd rather have a nice background than a cardboard cutout
[1:52:57] Harmar: or the green screen white halo LUL
[1:52:59] aeadon: much easier to not block HUDs when using a green screen
[1:53:02] LuluF2P: yea greensceen just isnt needed there was a phase where it was the thing to do
[1:53:08] Mitchellmay: Ya if you have a cool background don‚Äôt use a green screen
[1:53:09] chochi314: Chat, there is that Noita clip - https://clips.twitch.tv/SmellyChillyGaurStinkyCheese-D-pZh5RZCjvSW_zP

[1:57:15] Schowzy: What about the V-tubers though, That shit is intense @Giantwaffle
[1:57:32] Immp: I have legit watched people go from full overlays to basically game and cam, and maybe a small "latest" notis on screen that disappear after a few seconds.
[1:57:39] Shuruzou: vtuber stuff is very accesible

[2:58:43] Drazer_: Oh yes that drill bit is 17/64ths. Wtf size is that. 6.75mm is just so much easier
[2:58:50] Smoketronic: its 12 degrees kevin out side
[2:59:02] bcollinstex: red shift will probably keep us from seeing the beginning of time
[2:59:06] Tabakhase: @kachinga404 pretty much those 1.5mil km - as thats the lagrange point the thing balances on
[2:59:07] Code4Coffee: @Nicktendo1986 Depends on how you define beginning of time.. They expect to see some of the very first galaxies
[2:59:12] daemonaedryn: Do we really want an empty hole under the wizards tower for a fuckton of mobs to spawn in?

[3:00:26] Enforcer__: what's the conversion from Parsec to Keven?  Some guy in a falcon is asking
[3:00:33] Tabakhase: @kachinga404 dont think anything is further than geo tho, but it technically "should" be possible

[3:04:32] mahajimbo: peepoHmm
[3:04:34] Chambiez: oh shit is that a dragon statue?
[3:04:41] 045d: @MIICUTICO yea the mouth is too thin
[3:04:41] stasad: why is rat there
[3:04:47] BaddaLuu: the dragons are sick!
[3:04:48] 0rangelight: Curve the stairs to the right?
[3:04:49] Harmar: might have to lift the terrain more for it to work
[3:04:52] DX_Plates: Overpass half clover leaf?
[3:04:55] MIICUTICO: peepoHmm
[3:05:01] Armathur: why have this platform
[3:05:09] Shadeflame1911: More horizontal stairs and let the road go under the stairs?
[3:05:12] greggarry: curve the stairs back towards the middle
[3:05:13] Soyurr: fixing the main stairs took me like an hour and a half last night to get right
[3:05:22] sour_doritos: gotta fix one of the creeper heads btw
[3:05:26] sour_doritos: Waffle^
[3:05:31] dav3yb: Series of figure 8's
[3:05:39] dahad1: scaling seems off, not harmonious

[3:05:40] daemonaedryn: NODDERS
[3:05:43] daemonaedryn: Rap it around
[3:05:49] daemonaedryn: Wrap*
[3:05:49] Firstnecron: Wasnt there going to be water around the sides after the half-circle?
[3:05:54] Aldiron: more curved stairs for @Soyurr to do Kappa
[3:05:57] LuluF2P: roun' the outside
[3:05:58] daemonaedryn: Itll also add depth
[3:05:59] Soyurr: @ninopanda <3
[3:06:01] Slymph: @DaemonSzyman Yeah go full eminem on that! PepLaugh
[3:06:02] Arby_52: @Soyurr they look really good! much better than waffles attempt pepeLaugh

[3:06:12] FlammAlpha: susHmm so spirals?
[3:06:13] sour_doritos: One creeper head is uneven waffle
[3:06:13] MIICUTICO: peepoHmm
[3:06:14] Mayonnaise4u: NODDERS
[3:06:15] Its_BullsEyE: Thatd be cool but hard to make
[3:06:19] ZneTex: yeah
[3:06:24] Nicktendo1986: that's what she said
[3:06:24] mephisto__ttv: nah. cahnge it
[3:06:32] Johnhugem: It looks ugly
[3:06:32] FlammAlpha: maybe not go backwards, but have more loops forward?
[3:06:32] RPGFiends: needs like vines or something to decorate the sides
[3:06:33] LuluF2P: @Giantwaffle instead of slabs stairs would be steeper and wouldnt take as much space
[3:06:34] Armathur: that flat place seems out place
[3:06:37] Hilix1984: Hilix1984 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 37 months! 
[3:06:38] Kodish: We need two giant statues one on the left and one on the right facing each other in a sword fight
[3:06:43] Onfight: what about extending with more fountains on the stairway up? @Giantwaffle
[3:06:44] didlldldlldldoodldod: change it
[3:06:44] Dyslexic_Pixel: maybe an earth platteau left and right of it
[3:06:45] Drazer_: I like that idea a lot
[3:06:47] RodriCraft93: some pillars, and add some details
[3:06:51] Unsophistcated: the stairs come in then out
[3:06:54] Drazer_: The stairs just go so far out right now
[3:06:55] AlexTroy20: maybe more water ?
[3:06:59] AlexTroy20: Or lava
[3:07:04] Bongo5e: Stairs are built like a stickman
[3:07:07] 0sem0: Make up your mind lol
[3:07:08] RPGFiends: @Giantwaffle build under the stairs with an arch
[3:07:09] OfflineGladiator: It is Medieval themed, right?  Maybe adding some wood and color depth and it'll be sick
[3:07:10] LuluF2P: making it stairs would take up half as much space
[3:07:11] Neffets1212: maybe a second curve that curves under itself (safes space and looks awesome)
[3:07:15] Nicktendo1986: I think there should be flower gardens next to the stairs
[3:07:19] GFQPR1882: didnt u say u wanted a figure of 8
[3:07:28] Dr_PhiII: what about making the splitting staircase to one big
[3:07:29] 0rangelight: Make it curve away from the bridge
[3:07:29] Cherokee__Chief: need a Balrog
[3:07:33] Xevilmf: @Giantwaffle do you know FirePuma143 here on twitch btw? xD Fucking great movie
[3:07:33] Unsophistcated: look great
[3:07:33] xNightrunx: top part of the bridge is to thin. doesn't look solid
[3:07:34] K4shira: yep do it like you said
[3:07:42] FlammAlpha: would curving it, but forward still save space? @Giantwaffle
[3:07:43] the_portuguez: Like spyral stair cases..you know Sintra, Portugal? you have something similar like you want but smaller...google it bro
[3:07:47] Sypheron: It feels like the stairs need some holes or something in the bottom parts as well, they seem too massive now from the side
[3:07:47] ThirtyWz: The creepers aren't the same @Giantwaffle
[3:07:48] Johnhugem: What if you build the same again infront of the first one
[3:07:49] sour_doritos: waffle one creeper head is uneven by the way
[3:07:50] Nicktendo1986: it looks cool. needs foliage.
[3:07:59] Human_Variant: maybe a large statue between the bottom stares
[3:08:00] Enforcer__: it needs a shrubbery
[3:08:04] Enforcer__: ;)
[3:08:11] fakehumanoid: @Giantwaffle can you do a fly by of those two statues? The dragon and the other one, they look beautiful
[3:08:18] daemonaedryn: Maybe add a statue the size of the entire entrancer on the sides
[3:08:19] Kornrolls7: Bridge colors are not my favorite
[3:08:21] Nicktendo1986: @Enforcer__ yeah shrubbery foliage, flowers
[3:08:35] Tapollo: One problem with the grand stairs is that it doesn't have enough of an opening at the bottom. It ends almost into the other mountain.
[3:08:38] kachinga404: yea like water handrails?
[3:08:42] SylvarGaming: green?
[3:08:44] BBQ1: ooo
[3:08:44] daemonaedryn: Ehh I still kinda dont like how the entire bridge is flat
[3:08:48] itsribas: Are the creepers symmetric?
[3:08:49] Bongo5e: Get a railing on the stairs
[3:08:52] Crom1974: elevate the outer  round walls to top like two towers from LOTR.....
[3:08:54] the_portuguez: @Giantwaffle  can i send you some idea on discord?
[3:08:56] st3x_: curve it away from bridge put the road between the two stair splits
[3:08:57] Apparentthreat: going to take a long time w/ TPS low
[3:08:57] Wynja: Bit of a moroccan style
[3:09:00] MrCaturdayNight: the copper will be way cool
[3:09:00] AmazinPenguin: 10 mc days
[3:09:01] daemonaedryn: Ah interesting
[3:09:04] GFQPR1882: not to long tbh
[3:09:04] Kornrolls7: The deep slate I mean
[3:09:12] Armathur: blue and orange looks out of place   with the black bridge
[3:09:13] AleXanDreMau: 10-20 mc days i think
[3:09:16] ThirtyWz: 50-82 days in minecraft
[3:09:20] lewisdkal: @giantwaffle where the stairs spit you could curve each side toward the road then go down to the road level
[3:09:29] kachinga404: water handrails?
[3:09:34] Nicktendo1986: the oxidation will look cool
[3:09:39] the_portuguez: any mod can help me sending him a pic of something cool he could build there?
[3:09:49] Nicktendo1986: vines coming out?

[4:45:42] Cyberwire69: mouth noises

[4:46:05] PayThePro: I think you missed some blocks on the underside
[4:46:08] AmazinPenguin: surely bionic hands will come before this anyway
[4:46:13] GNL_Phoenix: Just use neurostimuli to track where you want to go 4Head
[4:46:19] AIex_0: there are some that use it well, but the game has to be made with hand tracking in mind
[4:46:25] BuckYouFitch: You should try out the "Farsight" mod, that way you can see chunks farther away without effecting server performance
[4:46:25] Scopes64: i use it for aplication not games, true. rly nice for browsing etc

[4:47:24] oIRise: yes but they can't depict einsteins brain

[4:48:34] BaronVg: other side
[4:48:35] ttv_regnald: what u doin
[4:48:36] TheGeekPeek: the brain is always firing at an immense speed, so the main hurdle with neural signals is canceling out the noise to get a clear reading.
[4:48:37] AmazinPenguin: look at the tiktok of the lab made brain cells that play pong and shows the electric waves
[4:48:38] Stihons: ‡∂û
[4:48:41] GNL_Phoenix: Hard thing would be to make it learn what an actual like handmovemenz is and what the imagination of a directional movement would be
