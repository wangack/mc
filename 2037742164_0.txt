[0:22:50] ImVivie: @LEGOBOSS31 i'd say the best way to know is to watch Tango's How to Play Decked Out 2 video
[0:23:08] LEGOBOSS31: @ImVivie Ight thanks! sinder6Flower
[0:23:38] ImVivie: np! then just seeing a run from start to finish gives the rest of the context for the most part
[0:23:42] helahiro: @name_under_rennovation But not for medium runs. Probably you are right for Hard ones
[0:23:43] factorization4: Use your bounding for escape

[0:50:08] Sage898: Tanngooooo
[0:50:09] Projekt_Siva: that happened on another hermits run

[0:50:38] Fletcherpauley6: check command blocks?
[0:50:41] jeaninius: there seems to be a place where the evoker can see you when it shouldn’t
[0:50:44] Tip11000: Cheer100 Cheer100 was watching the house price guessing vid. you mentioned geoguessr in the video.  you should play that with kara or other people sometimes. it has multiplayer now and you can create a party with friends and compete with each other over the 5 locations and whoever has the highest score wins.
[0:50:45] ImVivie: i think it fixes itself?
[0:50:47] name_under_rennovation: I’m not sure if that evoker needs an iron bar in its head instead of a glass block or the other way around, but other people have been having that problem
[0:50:58] WhatABees: who do you think he is
[0:50:59] helahiro: There is a spot that an iron bar needs to be replaced with glass block.
[0:51:04] AzureeSkyeATK: reload
[0:51:06] soikles: @name_under_rennovation needs a glass block
[0:51:08] WhatABees: reload
[0:51:09] Sage898: Nah no point reloading
[0:51:09] garnettgemm: reload won't fix
[0:51:12] jeaninius: someone told HBomb how to fix it
[0:51:15] helahiro: That evoker can see the player
[0:51:15] MistikKnight: it's fine, It's a known bug
[0:51:17] Cdawg0012: reload
[0:51:19] cheetahgames140_: Reload
[0:51:23] cooltrainerpaolo: just avoid that last berry area
[0:51:23] oichedubh: Reload
[0:51:29] name_under_rennovation: the evoker needs a glass block in its head
[0:51:30] tooth42o: It's a bug usually
[0:51:33] nuh_uhhh: yo what server you playing on?
[0:51:36] ImVivie: i think it might fix itself, dont trust me on that though
[0:51:37] Sage898: Evoker might just be slightly exposed
[0:51:37] Iconicbluejay: wouldnt reloading cause the vexes to despawn?
[0:51:39] helahiro: There is a spot that an iron bar needs to be replaced with glass block. That evoker can see the player
[0:51:42] ingapotejtoo: spectate and check the specific place maybe?
[0:51:48] garnettgemm: place a glass block on that evoker's head
[0:51:48] MistikKnight: just have to not get super close to that wall and it wont spawn outside of max clank
