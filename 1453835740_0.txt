[1:05:51] DX_Plates: I just took a week off, and still have over 100 hours of vacation time... 5 weeks a year is a lot when you normally just use it for taking long weekends occasionally.
[1:05:52] Farmerick: reflux
[1:05:52] ChrisHimself: Wait how many vacation days does the average NA job provide?
[1:05:54] Silver_Lion: @SeanSn0w stop working damn it!

[1:06:33] zombietaint: @zombietaint I understand why they did it. it's just a funny story :p
[1:06:42] bluetip84: @ChrisHimself base 2 wks a year.
[1:06:43] DX_Plates: @ChrisHimself From my experience, you start with 2 weeks, and gain an additional week per year of service generally capping out at 4 or 5 weeks.
[1:06:58] DewDragon: velganos?
[1:06:59] munko: i have 38 days a year, i should take like a week or so soon or they'll force me

[1:08:54] HostileLogOut: its 100% a female
[1:08:58] DX_Plates: aawooooooooooo
[1:09:15] Biskit427: We can carry over 240 hrs of vacation time.  After that, you have to burn off any excess by the end of the year or you lose it.
[1:09:21] RolenNilo: doesnt that happen for every guardian?
[1:09:33] Archelonde: roster lvl 118 nice
[1:09:35] zombietaint: waffle uses polestar over blitz rush???
[1:09:36] Harmar: Biskit427 how alot of companies do it now
[1:09:45] AceBlizzardz: i dont even think guardian raids are worth it to do

[1:10:11] zombietaint: I've never seen it be staggered
[1:10:19] AmidAiz: waffleNS
[1:10:20] Namsayn: its much easier to run in pug groups
[1:10:24] Zunderz: you canno stagger the first phase
[1:10:33] big_a1tch: any Day-Z today?
[1:10:41] Biskit427: @Harmar yeah. I am glad they make us take time off haha
[1:10:49] Larklen: of course you never see it, you run away pepeLaugh
[1:10:53] Traaxus: I killed all three of my teammates as arty. I fired my nukes as they got transformed next to the boss :D
[1:11:04] omar_i_: I was hyped for DayZ Sadge
[1:11:04] Traaxus: shouldn't have failed the check
[1:11:20] bluetip84: its a good time for you to get in some fights to prep for wipe
[1:11:21] DX_Plates: All the major DayZ servers are wiping in a week for the new DayZ update so many of them are running wipe events with cheap raiding supplies.
[1:11:37] zombietaint: yeah
[1:11:50] Xev_00: Gunlancer and Artillerst have the most yeah
[1:11:55] Traaxus: gunlancer is top tier stagger. zerker is high too
[1:11:57] zombietaint: zerker has a lot too
[1:12:07] Kenji_QQ: artillerist have stagger buff so that makes it very good for that
[1:12:11] bluetip84: Art has wuite a bit as well.
[1:12:16] Xev_00: Yeah Destroyer is THE stagger class
[1:12:17] meanhattermeanderer: YOu should have a "whiff emoji for when you miss with your alt
[1:12:18] Archelonde: I am at 1197 mokoko's
[1:12:19] Archelonde: so close
[1:12:19] findi24: gunlancer can solo most group stagger with the right engravings
[1:12:32] hisdue: waffleThink swagger
[1:13:49] Traaxus: chadlancers
[1:13:54] n0vaes: my favorite fight atm as a lancer
[1:13:58] AceBlizzardz: cause there is stagger there

[1:15:14] Traaxus: some guardians are not that fun along with oversized arenas that burn time.
[1:15:23] zombietaint: I have very little hope in that May release
[1:15:27] Tamerlain: zipping frrom bosses
[1:15:32] zombietaint: I think it's going to be pushed back
[1:15:41] SolarisFall: I hope they don't fix it, but I have a feeling they will patch the zip
[1:15:54] Xev_00: May is still pretty likely for Valtan/toxic birb I think.
[1:15:57] zombietaint: I thought they were going to do the April release last week :(
[1:16:02] Xev_00: South Vern is a LOT of materials for mains

[1:31:10] warmwalrus: when greater honors were 800g
[1:31:20] Kenji_QQ: the maxroll calculator can figure this out for you if you put in mat prices

[1:32:09] officialhunterx: i wanna code a button to play random youtube video
[1:32:12] dumplingator: I think it's 4 solar protection @Giantwaffle
[1:32:13] Xev_00: 12/6/2
[1:32:30] Kenji_QQ: but you also need to consider the honing chance and how much artisan energy the protection gives, so its a bit more complicated
[1:32:58] warmwalrus: yea, using mari's for the blessings is good
[1:32:59] realJokoWidodo: check mari shop
[1:33:00] DeadlyBrother: @Kenji_QQ you don't need to consider artisan energy at all
[1:33:00] Xev_00: The blue ones are the worst value
[1:33:02] Archelonde: yeah thats why I run purple maps
[1:33:09] Archelonde: for middle solars
[1:33:19] DeadlyBrother: if a hone is cheaper than solar you would get more artisan energy either way
[1:33:23] Mortimmer: Prayge
[1:33:36] Xev_00: Yeah it's good value still
[1:33:58] warmwalrus: the green and blue are still hella owrth
[1:33:59] AceBlizzardz: waffle what are your 2 engraving on your main?
[1:34:12] warmwalrus: protections are break even-ish
[1:34:14] hisdue: NOTED
[1:34:24] Xev_00: Yeah 40g ea from Mari's
[1:34:36] Kenji_QQ: @DeadlyBrother is that true? didn't think it was 1:1 with increased chance they add and artisan energy it adds
[1:34:50] realJokoWidodo: Jebaited
[1:34:57] Alfapsi: The price in EU is 82 gold atm LUL
[1:34:58] ldvemonl: that's the quality of the offer not the item

[1:42:31] AIex_0: @NexX_____ you must've spent some cause i have 11k shards
[1:42:35] Venxuri: Isn't it it mileage on KR? and we don't have mileage so its shards
[1:42:43] HostileLogOut: @sogerr false mate. hence why if your only 10 people doing the ship u wont be able to do it
[1:43:18] ayaya_prime: mileage is for buying royal crystals

[1:45:30] AIex_0: its good for the f2p and stuff cause they can earn gold from getting lucky LUL
[1:45:32] Mandorake: @Giantwaffle its only 4% dps increase over the +25 ancient
[1:45:33] Turneetup: the inventory icon looks nice though :)
[1:46:10] DeadlyBrother: no
[1:46:16] PTK9: no its 4% only
[1:46:23] GrammurPowlice: Is this even a game or a casino at this point?
[1:46:30] DeadlyBrother: but imagine being able to sell the stone to the whales
[1:46:33] PTK9: thats why they call it p2lose
[1:46:34] AIex_0: you could just get lucky and get all the shards as a drop COPIUM
[1:46:35] PTK9: LUL
[1:46:54] Turneetup: if we don't get it that means we don't get the possibility of the stone drop from content though

[2:04:39] MisterRabbitHead: They should change the name to Shieldwatch already
[2:04:41] Chronoes: by that definition, LoL and Dota 2 aren't esports either because you can't tell what's going on if you don't know the game
[2:04:41] AlbinoPeanut: I love me some SC2 though
[2:05:08] mrchadiuss: league is pretty easy but can get complex very fast
[2:05:12] Xev_00: Comp overwatch was fun to play in the early days, but the view experience has always been awful
[2:05:23] DewDragon: im on a blizzard boycott
[2:05:27] madseed15: @Giantwaffle what is the checklist for your daily?
[2:05:31] Drudo: same was done to GW2 which killed the overall game
[2:05:32] Chronoes: 3 tank meta was awful
[2:05:37] meanhattermeanderer: Overwatch had some of the most toxic players.
[2:05:41] ldvemonl: they did the same with heroes of the storm
[2:05:41] Enlil5: games can be hard to understand and be good esports like LOL but yeah they definitily tried way too hard to make it competitive

[2:08:15] findi24: Because reflux
[2:08:17] meanhattermeanderer: @meanhattermeanderer For a FPS. it was worse then counter strike. DOTA 2 is in a League of their own
[2:08:24] findi24: Reflux only gets teleport
[2:08:27] mrchadiuss: KEKW
[2:08:32] DewDragon: idk why people play reflux tbh

[2:18:53] stormblaz: @giantwaffle do u think a recycle system for t1 to t2 to t3 makes sense? like combining some to make t3 mats etc?
[2:18:55] mrchadiuss: i failed a 40% like 7 times Sadge
[2:19:08] Dallas0621: im still stuck in that 1355-1370 grind

[2:20:02] stormblaz: its too good to pass up
[2:20:23] mrchadiuss: yea Sadge
[2:20:34] stormblaz: are T2 mats still overpriced?
[2:20:38] Dallas0621: islands are an amazing place for mats. Follow youre welcome challenges it helps a lot
[2:21:09] Uphoric: you can buy more stones on your sorc
[2:21:24] mrchadiuss: not until glaiver imo
[2:21:39] stormblaz: two t3s?
[2:21:40] resku89: Sooner or later tier 1 and tier 2 materials should be more expensive than tier 3 no?
[2:22:05] denbo92: so 960 is average +9 right?
[2:22:09] Uphoric: you do all your tower?
[2:22:09] DexxonGaming: check stronghold research
[2:22:11] mrchadiuss: dont you get like 100% to like 12 with books and shit ?
[2:22:14] Melfcin: STRONGHOLD RESEARCH
[2:22:18] Xev_00: You need to input prices to get optimal materials
[2:22:18] Leviterian: you have to take away 20% because of buff
[2:22:19] Dallas0621: ya its nuts man haha thats if you get it on first roll
[2:22:28] imTymp: thats best case
[2:22:31] stormblaz: Epic Games recently announced an epic new wave of fundraising, notable both for the $2 billion it’s pulled in and for an eye-raising firm present among the leading partners: Sony. The makers of PlayStation VR have invested a cool $1 billion in Epic to further “the development of new digital fan experiences” and the “metaverse.”
[2:22:41] stormblaz: why would sony dump 1bil on Epic
[2:22:50] stormblaz: i wonder what they are working on
[2:23:02] stormblaz: meta verse is the future they believe
[2:23:06] SmoothBlizzard: it feels wrong
[2:23:06] Xev_00: YEP it is
[2:23:09] Kenji_QQ: you get quite a lot
[2:23:11] NexX_____: the shards really screwd me
[2:23:12] GSBressan: @stormblaz UE5 maybe?
[2:23:13] Zeikoa: it feels wrong but it's a shit ton
[2:23:17] Sloganized: Is T2 Honing from stronghold taken in consideration?
[2:23:19] mrchadiuss: pepeLaugh
[2:23:19] DexxonGaming: its 900 but you get A LOT of stones in t2 from dailies, etc
[2:23:20] Vosy1984: LUL
[2:23:24] Dallas0621: the game is meant to take a long time to progress
[2:23:26] stormblaz: @gsbressan isnt it free tho lol
[2:23:28] Xev_00: Oh that's without bonus materials though
[2:23:38] realJokoWidodo: it is thats why always buy lifeleap from mari
[2:23:38] Shadowl0: is your stronghold turned on? (for calculator)
[2:23:44] DexxonGaming: unas, chaos, guardian
[2:23:45] Kenji_QQ: chaos + leadstone dailies gives a lot
[2:23:45] resku89: Boss rush is like 100 stones
[2:23:46] stormblaz: Question is why would Epic need a fund raiser
[2:23:47] Dibbsu: I don't know what kinda of math they're doing but my simulater had a decent bit of difference compared to their results.
[2:23:48] Draiv_: Does it count the honing % research and books we are getting from events?
[2:23:49] k20nny: cream Kreygasm
[2:23:52] GSBressan: @stormblaz personal use... not for commercial use... royalties!
[2:23:58] TheMeowstardCat: Any MC today?
[2:23:58] stormblaz: Epic has money printing like a bank
[2:23:58] Vosy1984: Dallas0621 t1 and t2 have a shit ton and a half of catch-up to t3
[2:24:02] Zeikoa: you also had ir on no additonal materials so it didn't calculate books/breaths
[2:24:05] mrchadiuss: NOPERS
[2:24:09] stormblaz: the fact that epic asked for fund raiser is buggeling
[2:24:10] Dallas0621: yes do that
[2:24:11] Draiv_: If you play a lot then yes
[2:24:13] Kenji_QQ: i do it for shards
[2:24:14] Uphoric: its as worth as your time
[2:24:15] Archelonde: yeah run it on your t3
[2:24:18] Xev_00: Full +9->+15 should only be 850 stones with books/moons breath
[2:24:21] Gorelin: @Giantwaffle Unas for leaps is 10 per una. You can get 10 tradeable per alberhastic (1080 guardian) - less for lower ones. Events give a bunch. Anguish is 50 per char if you have the string currency
[2:24:21] Kenji_QQ: most my t2 alts are limited by shards
[2:24:23] Dallas0621: i buy out every mat shop waffle
[2:24:24] ebaboy: with the event and all the books you barely fail so could prolly shave off quite alot of stones
[2:24:24] Archelonde: they are bound to roster
[2:24:25] maestro1596: I do life shard only
[2:24:31] NexX_____: i did it it was okay
[2:24:32] DexxonGaming: yep run on t3
[2:24:34] Xev_00: Yeah
[2:24:36] BobTaco21: I have neglected my strong hold. maybe I should do that before hitting T3
[2:24:38] 0v3rfl0w: they are bound arent they?
[2:24:38] resku89: you can buy pirate coin stuff on all characters and pool it to that one character.
[2:24:41] celadriel23: yeah run the 1080 chaos
[2:24:42] Uphoric: you need a librarian lol
[2:24:46] celadriel23: on main
[2:24:51] ebaboy: dont forget you have the tower aswell  thats a ton of materials
[2:24:52] Gorelin: the tower for alts also gives a couple hundred, I think
[2:24:58] ldvemonl: T2 is worth for not even 5k coins
[2:25:01] findi24: Fuck the tower
[2:25:04] Archelonde: tower is alot of mats and ez as well for sorc
[2:25:08] findi24: Tower is so damn boring
[2:25:14] mrchadiuss: pepeLaugh
[2:25:16] BobTaco21: Do tower now
[2:25:26] celadriel23: no t3 is gonna go up, t2 is already there
[2:25:26] NexX_____: i couldnt get passed lvl47 or so on my pala for tower
[2:25:27] Khanimation: 48 hour stream Pog
[2:25:28] Xev_00: YEP they will go up
[2:25:33] Draiv_: Well if they sky rocket then wouldn't it be nice to have T2 chars and sell the mats?
[2:25:38] Xev_00: Maybe 10-20%
[2:25:39] resku89: youre not getting tier3 in two days unless you invest thousands of gold
[2:25:45] celadriel23: anyone who has interest in getting glavier to t3 already has their mats
[2:25:47] rykk3r1: compared to my bard, sorc was a faceroll on tower
[2:25:48] Gorelin: after 45 is where I have been stopping for alts
[2:26:02] nathrizen: sorc feel so good to play
[2:26:04] Warkless: T3 lopang YEP
[2:26:10] mrchadiuss: yeah f2p YEP
[2:26:12] Uphoric: transfer your scrapper leapstones for guardian raids
[2:26:15] Xev_00: Shards are what will be expensive and you can't farm sellable shards from dailies
[2:26:16] Uphoric: from
[2:26:17] meanhattermeanderer: I miss the dragon outfit
[2:26:22] Vosy1984: as long as the mats are not 1 gold each, it is worth to sell everything
[2:26:27] DexxonGaming: get leaps on guardians  tho
[2:26:28] Triz08: ....
[2:26:29] DexxonGaming: like 12?
[2:26:31] Venxuri: 24 per day
[2:26:32] celadriel23: you get unbound
[2:26:32] SmoothBlizzard: 40
[2:26:38] Gorelin: alberhastic is 10 per run
[2:26:39] ItsBill88: barerly anyway! its crap
[2:26:40] rykk3r1: for alberhastic you get 10
[2:26:41] mrchadiuss: KEKW

[2:27:01] Warkless: Huh=?
[2:27:07] NexX_____: sure ill do it just come on EUC
[2:27:15] Zeikoa: late T2 guardians are like 10 leaps per soul, plus one unas is like 8+ leaps
[2:27:16] Uphoric: and leavanos is easy
[2:27:17] Xev_00: I can't I have a meeting in 3 minutes Sadge
[2:27:17] DewDragon: srry im nawest

[2:27:29] stormblaz: Players in Screeps: Arena is an online, PvP RTS for programming enthusiasts. where your programming before the match starts decide the battle
[2:27:31] Uphoric: no
[2:27:31] stormblaz: pog
[2:27:32] celadriel23: its rand
[2:27:33] zombietaint: it's random
[2:27:34] ItsBill88: unfortunatly it doesnt prio support
[2:27:39] Draiv_: Matchmaking has no prio in anything
[2:27:39] Moobot: You can sub to Waffle by clicking this neat link -> twitch.tv/giantwaffle/subscribe
[2:27:43] BobTaco21: Nope
[2:27:47] Vosy1984: there aren't that many supports, so the chance is really low @Giantwaffle
[2:27:47] zombietaint: there have been screen shots of 4 supports in a single group
[2:28:04] rykk3r1: gigachads use pheromones in here to make levanos come back instantly
[2:28:05] Gorelin: as a support (it is all I play), with matchmaking, I regularly get another support in the group... it is super toxic
[2:28:05] BobTaco21: I soloed that event lol
[2:28:08] stormblaz: Hey Dint advance wars 1+2 released ??
[2:28:15] stormblaz: it was delayed but then not really
[2:28:27] Melfcin: Im srslyt thinking of letting my 3 t2 alts stay on t2 for like next 2 weeks
[2:28:31] Melfcin: cuz of prices
[2:28:40] obscure_13: i want focusing alts playing through the game and im feeling it now Sadge
[2:28:42] halfbent: stormblaz indefinite delay last I knew
[2:28:48] obscure_13: wasnt
[2:28:49] stormblaz: @halfbent :(
[2:28:49] SmoothBlizzard: theya re too good for the buffs
[2:28:51] TheMeowstardCat: Any MC today?
[2:28:57] Vosy1984: LUL
[2:29:02] TheMeowstardCat: Sounds good.
[2:29:04] Zeikoa: death peepoHappy
[2:29:07] celadriel23: sorc is hilarious w/ the event buffs
[2:29:14] celadriel23: literally cant use abilities fast enough
[2:29:17] Draiv_: I don't mind Lost Ark
[2:29:21] HKRage: When lost ark feels good, it feels GOOD
[2:29:29] Dagmoo: @meilers yeah its fun
[2:29:38] DewDragon: ignite sorc on this event is stupid damage. like stupid.
[2:29:44] celadriel23: there was a reddit thread that said "combat in lost ark is the funnest part, but you spend the least time doing it"
[2:29:53] stormblaz: I believe lost arc is not that fun to stream, most streamers seem to play offstream for some reasom
[2:30:01] Kenji_QQ: have you done tower? there are so many leapstones there
[2:30:24] Chronoes: they're chads, they don't need some puny buffs
[2:30:25] Exxii11: when are the reworks coming in KR?
[2:30:25] stormblaz: maybe its just too much time consuming for a variety streamer
[2:30:26] imTymp: cause u pugged
[2:30:36] AlfredTheSalmon: yesterday a 1385 deathblade tried to call me dumb for targeting the invader, he believed the small bosses dropped the buffs not the invader, and that's why he always took >12min each run. I want to believe he was trolling on purpose
[2:30:52] resku89: funny thing in lost ark is that the party always follows the first guy even if he runs into a dead end
[2:30:58] stormblaz: they know a short cut
[2:31:04] Warkless: it's the deathblade from reddit PogChamp
[2:31:06] obscure_13: i had a group that wouldnt grab buffs last night and we also had an afk so it took like 15 minutes
[2:31:23] stormblaz: aim the buffs better duh
[2:31:35] imTymp: waffle slowly understanding why people say sorc stupid broken
[2:31:36] Uphoric: you can also start buying leapstones from anguish at 915 on alts
[2:31:40] Draiv_: I mean the buffs on the ground are just temporary everyone gets the big buffs
[2:31:44] AlfredTheSalmon: i did tell him, but just forgot it and walked away soon after
[2:31:45] Zeikoa: like 3 weeks in into this event and people not knowing how it works still COPIUM
[2:31:46] stormblaz: to be honest buffs can look like a enemy attack sometimes
[2:31:52] rykk3r1: KEKW
[2:32:12] SasquatchYeti: cutting the tail off the scorpion seems to be the hardest for most groups
[2:32:17] babyaddalyn: first time i also forgot to loot the chest lol
[2:32:21] Draiv_: Wait for the new hairstyles
[2:32:23] rykk3r1: I want them to add more customizeation options
[2:32:32] stormblaz: i like the colors
[2:32:34] stormblaz: tbh
[2:32:40] Dibbsu: May I think
[2:32:42] Draiv_: Yes this or next month can't rememeber
[2:32:48] stormblaz: ya
[2:32:49] SkinnaKid: i think hairstyles are coming in may ?
[2:33:09] stormblaz: why do all their current hair styles look like i came out of a salon
[2:33:19] stormblaz: i want some morr rugged styles

[2:34:53] celadriel23: but if youre doing leapstone dailies you cant do lopang as wel
[2:35:14] stormblaz: are you better off 4 dps or 2 supp 2 dps
[2:35:36] Draiv_: Takes around 1:30-1:50 for a 1400+ dps for alberhastic

[3:26:29] ItsOnMax: sharing is caring
[3:26:34] Salads_: is that just the normal ore sensor in your hotbar? never seen it last that long

[3:27:53] IronGajeel: fortune works with scorching heat enchant @giantwaffle
[3:27:56] Pointern: good evening waffle and chat
[3:28:09] redwall467: @Giantwaffle have you gotten into bee's yet?

[3:28:43] daemonaedryn: Honestly out of all resources copper so far has been the biggest reason for mining trips
[3:28:44] Face_32: i dont think it is vanilla ore gen coding
[3:28:54] madseed15: @Giantwaffle  fortune 3
[3:28:59] Invalidm_: you can change a spawner with a spawn egg so if you wanted to you could make a zombie spawner
[3:28:59] digg_m: does the fortune pickaxe not work

[3:30:37] Vosy1984: vanilla mega base it's where it's at
[3:30:39] macke_897: factorio is such a great game, love it
[3:30:46] Face_32: i personally think giving you too much ore to use would help with game balance since it would all rely on your progress through the pack
[3:30:48] Lordtsfly: the music is a mimic, its op
[3:30:50] Immp: there is a pack called Techopolis that allows you to purchase ores and set a miner on them to infinite generate the metals
[3:31:10] chaoskub: @Giantwaffle store your levels in the mem stick so you can teleport cheaper.
[3:31:12] TheIrishGuy: progression as well
[3:31:19] Jibbur: you could pretty simply get a copper bee and appiary, good source
[3:31:19] CameIMilk: quarry time baby!
[3:31:40] Zapper_777: backpack baby
[3:31:47] SirKaelan: Are these ore chunks fortune-able?
[3:31:51] ohbi78: covered in bees
[3:31:52] Face_32: but then you could build the automation to process the ore instead of doubling it
[3:31:58] daemonaedryn: COPIUM

[5:00:57] daemonaedryn: I love watching EFT, but I guess a lot of people might dislike the heavier PvP
[5:00:57] hisdue: ones a joke the other is a serious joke peepoSip
[5:01:05] Foooks: Day Z has building and interaction....  EFT is just loot and shoot   IMHO
[5:01:11] takesachomp: Dayz is a meme eft is tryhard
[5:01:11] jegkanikkelidetwitch: no 1 hour inventory sorting
[5:01:12] Biddy2004: im the opposite ill watch tarkov all day.  Probably because i played way to much dayz back when it was new
[5:01:17] Harmar: no zambies YEP
[5:01:17] Venxuri: DayZ is not always KOS, Tarkov well...is
[5:01:18] ForgottenTime: @giantwaffle DayZ is nostalgic Tarkov is new and scary monkaS
[5:01:19] CptSavv: tarkov is way harder then dayz thoguh
[5:01:20] Thills_: dayz is also interactions
[5:01:23] GFQPR1882: @orangecreamsicle3 same i wouldnt mind either way
[5:01:27] PetOrange: dayz is walking sim
[5:01:36] hiposlipo_: lmao not the pvp its the repetitive selling and going back in and out every 5 min to go to a raid
[5:01:38] daemonaedryn: waffleD
[5:01:41] kainboa: it's a bit like asking someone why they don't like ketchup on their hotdogs, instead of mustard
[5:01:43] Face_32: my favorite Dayz moments are the RP and interactions between characters
[5:01:43] daemonaedryn: people have weird tastes
[5:01:58] xClod: KEKW
[5:02:00] Equandor: eft has too much sitting in inventory and waiting in queue for my liking
[5:02:02] xClod: that looks nice
[5:02:03] Silver_Skeeter: do we finally have digital storage? SchubertWalk
[5:02:05] madscientist_72: That seems correct. KEKW
[5:02:08] TheBonBon_: did you know you can shift click request for all crafts and ctrl click for 10 crafts?
[5:02:09] daemonaedryn: btw if you crush the petals instead of using a mortar and pestle you can get up to 5 dye
[5:02:10] Moobot: You can find Waffle's Youtube channel here - https://youtube.com/giantwaffle
[5:02:19] fishypooos: dayz is more chill and when you die it feels more punishing
[5:02:21] maccabeus: that random dude who RP'd smoking a blunt with you was more entertaining than anything I've seen in EFT ever
[5:02:31] Face_32: i watched shroud play DayZ for a few weeks, trying to get through that new portal thing. 100% of the time he made he got camped before loading in

[5:03:09] daemonaedryn: Flux is godly
[5:03:12] Venxuri: on Namalsk map there is a portal to Lantia in some very deep military base
[5:03:15] LsTheRoberto: Are you still working towards digital storage?
[5:03:15] IronGajeel: yeah flux is godly
