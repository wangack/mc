[0:18:40] isfil: bUT WHY???
[0:18:44] Colonel_Panic_: What is the point of having 2 fuselages vs just 1 bigger one?
[0:18:47] Chronoes: @bad_crab_dad https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkk9DI-8el4 this guy but in emote form on Twitch
[0:18:47] Twin5un: symetrical for weight ?
[0:18:50] Apparentthreat: isfil yolo
[0:18:57] LMNTRX92: waffleLUL
[0:19:06] FingerGames: lifts much more weight
[0:19:13] Chyrion: @Colonel_Panic_ it'll carry a rocket between the fuselages
[0:19:19] mechoriet: @Colonel_Panic_ so they can put payload inbetween instead of under it which would make it need way insane higher gears
[0:19:24] Colonel_Panic_: @Chyrion oh well that just makes a lot of sense
[0:19:25] Larklen: AngelThump
[0:19:28] Initial_: What would happen if one side lost control
[0:19:37] dasmako: confirmed 1 huge runway
[0:19:39] KritterIsBack: that's plan B
[0:19:42] Apparentthreat: Twin5un maybe? shouldn't matter if they can just trim the flaps, whatever it's called, to correct for differences (guessing)
[0:19:42] isfil: @Apparentthreat overengineering at it's best
[0:19:45] cpt_gagarin: whats the purpose of this plane ?
[0:19:49] Mandorake: its so cute on the ground
[0:19:51] MeatPopsicles: When is it being added to Flight Sim?
[0:19:52] FingerGames: sumY it big
[0:19:57] dasmako: launch a rocket from mid air @cpt_gagarin
[0:19:59] Twin5un: @Apparentthreat monkaHmm right
[0:20:09] Apparentthreat: why did that look like CGI
[0:20:12] Alsabatini: @cpt_gagarin too fly I believe KEKW
[0:20:17] Chronoes: T H I C C
[0:20:20] CorSPACE: currently its going to be used for hypersonic testing
[0:20:27] SR_Powah: Now use it for ground pounding
[0:20:28] MrHashbrowns: how much fuel is saved?
[0:20:29] MrCoolBlueKid: It's a thicc boi
[0:20:38] Apparentthreat: oh shit. that's neat
[0:20:43] 1StClassAlcoholic: oh boy seeing this makes me miss ksp streams
[0:20:45] Wetware: This is like how they launched the X-15 from a B-52 back in the 60s
[0:20:53] MrCoolBlueKid: Great Concept
[0:20:54] FingerGames: sumUh not meh rocket
[0:20:59] crancc: you also probably dodge max-q
[0:21:30] Alsabatini: do you still have larry the squid @giantwaffle
[0:21:33] Colonel_Panic_: @Wetware Yeah, funny how tech kinda comes back around huh?
[0:21:41] QuesoBad0nga: and Certain weather conditions too
[0:21:44] MrCoolBlueKid: When i was younger i thought Planes that were used for Sky Diving Never landed when they took off LUL
[0:21:47] mechoriet: @crancc don't think it can dodge that
[0:21:49] SeriousPotatoBot: Yea I think i head somewhere that it takes more fuel to get to launch to LEO than from LEO to mars or the moon iirc
[0:21:49] M1k3D3l7a: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Giant_planes_comparison.svg
[0:21:49] drago1598: this plane probably doesnt take off from just any runway
[0:22:06] mechoriet: YEP succ
[0:22:06] Chronoes: Sure, a plane can take off any runway but how many planes will there be?
[0:22:08] thuniffe: one faulty decoupling and kaboom plane
[0:22:11] Mandorake: 8 years really isn't that long
[0:22:15] Colonel_Panic_: That rev up just cost $15,000
[0:22:17] Colonel_Panic_: KEKW
