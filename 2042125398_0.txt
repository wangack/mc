[0:50:37] gamingnscience: last night Gem was threatening Skizz with “Next time I meet you in Minecraft…!” - one cannot tell anymore what is a clue, tease or a troll or completely unintentional. XD
[0:50:40] bubba_leatherface: How are you doing? Ive been ruining my sleep, I hope yours is good!!
[0:50:42] schnitzel_schultz: You are such a good builder I love your HermitCraft season 9 base!
[0:50:47] rathgar1843: yep, it was close enough to April first that a April fools game wouldn't have time to get set up
[0:51:02] tybo_gaming: Just popped into Karns stream l, he's rambling about books
[0:51:04] dummyboar: new update allows to constant load end chunks from what i understand, could be good for farms
[0:51:04] bluubuns: Sorry I’m late, got myself a burger pearlieHeart
[0:51:06] Kriddius_: Right! A bunch of farms are there too hidden inside the buildings. This is my second world after losing my first one in March last year at 6585 days
[0:51:08] piglett89: hope it’s going to be a blind seed again love watching the discovery aspect
[0:51:09] kazriel_: @Kriddius_ that sounds awesome!!
[0:51:13] saleo37: Chat, who do you think will join in season 10?
[0:51:16] red1ska8: @dummyboar that was the exact reason why Tango built deepfrost citadel so big I believe
[0:51:31] waarisdetaart: it kinda takes away from the hardcore but people should do what they want
[0:51:32] KinggKrustie: When i see warden....I think Krull the Conqueror
[0:51:33] allmozdergel: Skizz and dunno who else
[0:51:35] secret_agent4706: @saleo37 I bet one of them is definitely skizz
[0:51:38] doxisontwitchnow: @gamingnscience Skizz plays the 'no idea what your are talking about' card so hard though. He's raising doubt for me. and every time I go :(
[0:51:49] rathgar1843: unless its ren, he dies just getting to the totem
[0:52:01] dummyboar: @red1ska8 i can imagine the struggle of small gothic style builds
[0:52:05] Kriddius_: Yeah I've never used a totem. I'd like to see them removed from the loot table entirely in hardcore mode
[0:52:18] doxisontwitchnow: @rathgar1843 hey, he survived that raid...barely but he survived
[0:52:18] piglett89: skizz and jimmy
[0:52:28] brian_of_farce: Ren is trying to speed run the achievements, I'll give him the totem pass
[0:52:30] pancake_lover_333: i was scrolling your clips, and i didnt realise how many hardcore worlds you have... and how many you lost to a creeper
[0:52:38] schnitzel_schultz: Gotta go so glad I could see this stream good luck on the warden building good bye
[0:52:42] bluubuns: Even on easy mode I hold on to my totem haha, you are so cool
[0:52:44] kazriel_: s10 joel truthers wya
[0:52:54] xWildSlicerx: Button just keeps going. man rarely slows down when it comes to crafting and building
[0:52:57] Cheesius: That arrow was clearly deliberate, just pointing out to us where you were putting your bed
[0:52:58] boohoocracker: i havent played hardcore and used a totem, its been that long since i played
[0:52:58] Nightbot:  Be respectful - No spamming - No advertising - English only
[0:53:00] Rizzard_of_Oz35: why do all the streamers I watch have to stream? at midnight
[0:53:07] dummyboar: fence posts would work so well for vertical decoration if only we could choose to link them together or not
[0:53:17] roll_away: what is the ratio of time spent in building vs collecting resources for the build?
[0:53:18] mustavariz: Ello Pearlie! pearlieHeart
[0:53:20] Bambi_Kazuki: Cheer10 Pearl would it be a bad idea to change my theme from Asian to fantasy on the Potango server and try to merge them as best as I can? Im afraid I got bored by the Asian theme
[0:53:22] pancake_lover_333: the extreme potion one doesnt show up, so i will never try
[0:53:24] c0ldtwitch: ight Pearl stop HORSING around ;D
[0:53:32] closet_gremlin: my friend and I made a real life mincraft cake today
[0:53:37] VoxKeys: Not me pearlieWoo pearlieWoo
[0:53:39] saleo37: I think its gonna be Sausage and maybe Jimmy. I dont think Skizz. He still has his job.
[0:53:39] CherishLoveArt: I could never so hardcore. I'd be constantly stressed and I don't want that when wanting to have fun lol. I admire those who can do it
[0:53:41] bluubuns: I love your stream time, it’s evening here in India pearlieHeart
[0:53:48] buzzie107: I’m still debating totems on my hardcore world that I’m doing on twitch after dying to a skelly and a Hoglin in the last one @pearlescentmoon
[0:53:52] waarisdetaart: @dummyboar yeah i really want to have the ability to choose to connect things or not
[0:53:55] bubba_leatherface: HII im in new zealand Its abt 1:50am And Ill stay up for your streams! <3
[0:53:55] nl_multicaster: late???? it's about 14:00 (2 o'clock in the afternoon)
[0:54:02] boohoocracker: the last time i played hardcore was just after 1.14 update and i died to a berry bush... safe to say i dont play hardcore anymore
[0:54:05] mayuniz_: How long do your streams usually last??
[0:54:08] closet_gremlin: I can never watch anyone live bc I have strict parents and Perth time zone :(
[0:54:09] rathgar1843: @doxisontwitchnow yep, but getting there
[0:54:09] nl_multicaster: happy to see you stream!!!

[0:54:56] coke__soda: it’s 8am for me ;)
[0:55:01] Kriddius_: I've found if there's a risk of losing it forever I appreciate it more while I have it
[0:55:07] coke__soda: :,)
[0:55:10] TheMysticCrafter: I have 1000+ days hardcore world but now I regret that it's not just survival bacause I don't want to loose it, it has some builds that are dear to me
[0:55:12] KinggKrustie: Krull (1983) full write up on google...
[0:55:14] thattinymushroom: I keep dying to random bits of lag and glitches on normal survival so it probably wouldn't go well for me if I do hardcore lol
[0:55:16] CherishLoveArt: I totally get that! My little heart heart just couldn't take it haha
[0:55:19] boohoocracker: i think 3 year world lost to a berry bush. i have  a vendetta against 1.14
[0:55:21] bluubuns: Is this your longest Hardcore world?
[0:55:23] saleo37: How do you feel about the 2 new hermits joining Pearl?
[0:55:26] xxthemythicalegendxx: 11:53pm here
[0:55:32] dummyboar: @cherishloveart i'm really bummed out when i lose my world so what i do is i play survival hard but the way i would hardcore, very carefully
[0:55:57] roll_away: do you watch pewds minecraft series?
[0:56:00] MarV07213: it's a pearl stream!
[0:56:10] MarV07213: hello there pearl!
[0:56:11] VoxKeys: I wouldn't be able to watch Pearl if it weren't my addiction to energy drinks. She always starts stream at 1am but idm pearlieLOL
[0:56:23] xWildSlicerx: I just recently started my own HC world. Its certainly been a different experience. Looking forward to the future
[0:56:27] AceK1n9: would you play vault hunters?
[0:56:28] bluubuns: I admire people who stick to a world, it’s so cool seeing all the progress! I tend to abandon them after a while but I’m trying not to
[0:56:36] VoxKeys: Who needs a heart /j
[0:56:39] boohoocracker: my computer stopped supporting me playing minecraft so ig its gonna be lost to the void
[0:56:43] rathgar1843: i normally miss pearl, st.louis time for me, but ehen im up it's on
[0:56:45] CherishLoveArt: @dummyboar nice compromise!
[0:56:45] mustavariz: For me you start stream at 14/2pm
[0:57:05] impivish: just like real life.... kinda
[0:57:06] MarV07213: hardcore is definitely different
[0:57:06] emchmu: did we end up reaching the warden goal? i assume so? we were close last time i watched a stream XD
[0:57:15] MarV07213: @impivish yeah, no resets
[0:57:40] pancake_lover_333: can we see it someday?
[0:57:40] kazriel_: @emchmu yep! last stream was the successful warden wrangling
[0:57:40] VoxKeys: No cleo in that hardcore base pearlieLOL
[0:57:41] saleo37: @emchmu the warden is already in his new home :))
[0:57:46] boohoocracker: i love playing hardcore but dying makes me just regret everything
[0:57:50] allmozdergel: @emchmu  we did, and last stream the warden was named
[0:57:55] bluubuns: That’s still so cool! I had like… 24 worlds in just this year haha I am not proud of that
[0:58:01] bean_ebabies: I tend to play so carefully normally that I imagine playing hardcore wouldn't be too different for me, but I definitely want to try
[0:58:02] emchmu: ohhh mustve missed it! thank you all :D
[0:58:03] dummyboar: a fun way to change from regular survival is to play no regen but keep inventory (or use the player grave mod).
[0:58:06] RCMNexus: Hello everyone how are you doing this fine day! I just woke up

[2:06:59] misserisacat: I was supposed to have a dentist appointment so i got to not have school but it got cancelled so now i can just watch your stream instead :D
[2:07:07] rathgar1843: yep, blue is a eye stress generator, yellow or red are best
[2:07:09] Nicklii: i used to get annoyed by CRT running at 60hz, but thats not really relatet
[2:07:11] puppy555jjj33: mines rainbow.... probs the causes of my headach all the time
[2:07:16] KrisIris1226: a bit, but blue is my favorite color! my mic has blues too
[2:07:20] Neamow: one of the first things I did when moving into my first apartment was install Hue lights with adjustable colour, everything is a soothing warm orange and it's so cosy and doesn't stress eyes
[2:07:23] bluubuns: Yellow and orange hurt me too, especially the fluorescent kind pearlieSad
[2:07:31] keshkup: Oof, for me it's the opposite, my keyboard is never red, it irritates my eyes for some reason
[2:07:42] VoxKeys: Yellow is my favourite colour pearlieSad pearlieSad
[2:07:59] misserisacat: @voxkeys same :D
[2:08:02] puppy555jjj33: i can confime rainbow keybord is headach
[2:08:08] Spookyalot: Orange
[2:08:10] mega_mage_36: thanks for the cheese cake tips
[2:08:17] crazy_irish: my keyboard colour changes based on time of day. blue during day and red at night
[2:08:24] stellaris_lex: honestly i can't even use a computer without ***x installed. I need that warm light or it causes eye strain and headaches.
[2:08:34] AeroNova_: Yes absolutely going to make a Tim Tam cheesecake
[2:08:41] jenny_b14: I have grey eyes and am light sensitive too
[2:08:45] AeroNova_: and pair it with a good hot chocolate
[2:08:46] keshkup: Mine are dark brown
[2:08:49] Miss_Rayne: I agree, reds and oranges irritate my eyes. Most of my lights are blue or purple.
[2:08:51] bean_ebabies: I have a pink and teal light theme for my desk :) I don't get migraines, though, thankfully
[2:09:04] Neamow: f l u x ? not sure why that gets censored
[2:09:07] Karnasas: Tim Tam cheesecake is amazing
[2:09:10] stellaris_lex: yeah it's flux
[2:09:11] KayaWolfHorse: for me it’s mostly just intensity of brightness instead of specific color
[2:09:25] VoxKeys: Blue just makes me sad
[2:09:32] buzzie107: pearlieDab pearlieDab pearlieDab pearlieDab pearlieBoop
[2:09:33] Neamow: @stellaris_lex thought it's built in to windows now
[2:09:33] daredevil2300: my eyes hurt with birch blocks but seems unrelated to the convo haha
[2:09:34] ChancieRN: It's a neurological thing. Separate from sunlight etc.
[2:09:38] Karnasas: I was trying to hold back and not devour it all
[2:09:42] bean_ebabies: I had cheesecake for breakfast
[2:09:44] vinodragon30: BibleThump10 I have Haysal eyes and bright lights give me migraines
[2:09:45] acezonedann: Blue eyed people have less melatonin in their skin hence they react to the sun more
[2:09:45] mastertaint: Gray eyes and astigmatism. All lights hurt my eyes
[2:09:46] Karnasas: you know what Im like with cheesecake
[2:09:50] stellaris_lex: @Neamow idk maybe, i still use it anyway it works well enough.
[2:09:53] Windfighter42: cheesecake is the worst but I've started coming around to swedish cheesecake xP
[2:10:06] Nicklii: the color on your keyboard might be an issue with the PWM circuitry managin the LEDs (Pulse widht modulation)
[2:10:21] ruby_rabbit747: Hi
[2:10:23] dorkpepi: hi! i'm new heree. for how long have you been playing in this world?
[2:10:27] Karnasas: I say its perfect as is, the tastebuds dont lie
[2:10:28] BertPotato: @acezonedann melanin for the skin, melatonin for the brain
[2:10:31] preparedman: @windfighter42 yeah that's different isn't it?
[2:10:32] jenny_b14: am I the only one who does NOT like cheesecake?
[2:10:44] saleo37: @jenny_b14 no, me too
[2:10:46] NeonsNeant: @jenny_b14 not a fan myself...
[2:10:46] ruby_rabbit747: Hi @jenny_b14 @preparedman @bertpotato @dorkpepi hii
[2:10:50] Noobelia: My eyes are a quite bright blue and are extremly sensible with light. I tend to need sunglases from early spring to mid winter on a daily basis. And I also sometimes have problems with migranes. But still my keyboard is in a (dark) blue. The red on it was to bright for me.
[2:10:52] PaintdOopsie: I don’t like cheesecake. 🥴
[2:10:55] Windfighter42: @preparedman it is, but I wouldn't be able to explain the difference xD
[2:10:56] ruby_rabbit747: @neonsneant hii
[2:10:56] Spookyalot: Less Junk or I'll tell Pearl... Oh Hang on.  oops
[2:11:01] VoxKeys: @jenny_b14 Personally don't like it either
[2:11:02] ruby_rabbit747: Hi everyone
[2:11:03] rathgar1843: cheese cake or cheese creamy, some are like a bread puddin
[2:11:17] bluubuns: I gtg for dinner, hope you have a great stream Pearl! pearlieHeart
[2:11:21] rastkodar: hi
[2:11:21] Zaneisthereal: Say one nice things about a lot of hermits
[2:11:24] rastkodar: !watchtime
[2:11:28] saleo37: What are Tim Tams like?
[2:11:30] rastkodar: i hope
[2:11:33] rastkodar: oh
[2:11:38] mega_mage_36: double life was too short
[2:12:01] Spookyalot: @saleo37 Are you from The UK? If you are they're like our Penguin bars
[2:12:12] buzzie107: my twitch is being twitchy today
[2:12:14] mega_mage_36: i still loved it
[2:12:22] PaintdOopsie: Secret Life and double life were my favorites
[2:12:24] niccitango: I have blue eyes and sensitive to bright light
[2:12:27] KayaWolfHorse: it was a solid length with good pacing, and very bingable now
[2:12:29] saleo37: @spookyalot no, germany
[2:12:30] lunarediv: secret life was crazy
[2:12:33] Spookyalot: aaah
[2:12:39] Neamow: it was good I think, on the other hand Secret Life felt too long to me
[2:12:40] VoxKeys: I've loved all seasons equally but I remember the boogie one the least
[2:12:43] AvivaKitty: i think the length was fine! not everything has to be the same amount of time :P
[2:12:51] mothersquishy: How do you get trees to grow like that?
[2:12:54] quasijem: I found myself watching less on the final episodes of the longer ones. double was probably my favourite
[2:12:57] Nightbot:  Be respectful - No spamming - No advertising - English only
[2:13:01] phantom_5032: i loved double life, last life is probably my favourite though
[2:13:03] rathgar1843: their still working out length
[2:13:03] puppy555jjj33: i like them short to be honnest
[2:13:04] mega_mage_36: and limited
[2:13:04] HeyItsMelinax: I binge watch Double Life all the time. It was a great length
[2:13:12] keshkup: I can see everyone in chat looking up papers about eye colour tonight at 2am already
[2:13:13] lunarediv: boogie was a among us fear hahaha
[2:13:23] saleo37: I actually liked limited life the most so far.
[2:13:24] Tinker_it: a life series, or something of the like would have been great for viewers during the hc 9/10 break... but probably not for the hermits unless it was pre-recorded
[2:13:28] kat999xx: @keshkup I already have about 3 tabs open haha
[2:13:30] waarisdetaart: that's why mangrove is so annoying to chop down
[2:13:37] KayaWolfHorse: last life was icon, i loved the build up to pearl’s final boogie kill
[2:13:44] KayaWolfHorse: iconic*
[2:14:15] BertPotato: jungle I think needs at least 3 blocks radius from the centre
[2:14:19] FuriousSocks: Have you seen the last life song?
[2:14:25] puppy555jjj33: Double Life is my fav
[2:14:31] waarisdetaart: the family dynamic was my favourite bit from LimL
[2:14:36] saleo37: Interesting, I loved the nosy neighbours alot!
[2:14:39] mega_mage_36: the more people the beter
[2:14:41] danger_noodle_snekly: personally, my least favorite life series was Secret life, it felt a little rushed towards the end TBH
[2:14:42] kat999xx: I enjoyed last life, but limited life might be my favourite
[2:14:43] greenriyder: Secret Life was my favorite life series
[2:14:54] FuriousSocks: Yeah same person, it's really good
[2:14:56] mega_mage_36: so last and secert
[2:14:56] cloudofdragonflies: the one from evil anvil is brilliant, your lines just pop!
[2:15:08] Leo_Winters: did you like the double life as a song video?
[2:15:08] CaptainStoppy: i still enjoyed your limited life series
[2:15:10] VoxKeys: Secret was probably my favourite because of murder camel and how Pearl died pearlieLOL pearlieLOL
[2:15:16] KayaWolfHorse: nosey neighbors was a wonderful team but liml is probably my least favorite overall
[2:15:24] autum_mist_101: Doublelife was your time to shine. Martyn even said you were the main character that season.
[2:15:25] tishencat: all the life series have been fun… different for sure
[2:15:28] mega_mage_36: the best part is your builders not pvpers
[2:15:31] kattituude: I have found myself fully invested in each season as it developed. It's such a unique, wonderful series
[2:15:35] CaptainStoppy: noisy neighbors was one of my favorite groups during that season
[2:15:38] Blue_Hamster11: I love the Double life song!
[2:15:55] puppy555jjj33: gonna lurk now and get dinner see ya soon chat
[2:16:00] cassidyshutupp: cassidyshutupp subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 27 months, currently on a 27 month streak! 
[2:16:03] bly1896_2: bogey tnt roof kill
[2:16:04] jojobeanlive: I'm not sure I could pick a favorite. They're all special and great in their own ways
[2:16:12] AvivaKitty: last life was my favorite, but i think its partly because its the one i had the most free time to watch more povs and do a ton of fanart as it came out
[2:16:16] saleo37: You cant make it right for everyone
[2:16:17] Blue_Hamster11: @puppy555jjj33 bye!
[2:16:21] KayaWolfHorse: the secret life finale was so good! your perspective was understandable and the narrative was great
[2:16:22] VoxKeys: People are just too negative
[2:16:24] autum_mist_101: Bye puppy! pearlieHey
[2:16:25] Neamow: but wouldn't you want to be the first DOUBLE winner? pearlieLOL
[2:16:27] PaintdOopsie: scar winning was a shock lol 😆 but loved it for him
[2:16:34] kat999xx: @puppy555jjj33 Cya puppy!
[2:16:35] revaar61: secret life was fun, but the last episode being "ok, now everyone just kill each other" kinda lost the feel of the rest of the season
[2:16:37] saleo37: @puppy555jjj33 byee
[2:16:48] mega_mage_36: its so hard catching thease in canada got to go
[2:16:53] Noobelia: I think it's so most fun to see how hard you tried NOT to win :D And Scar wasn't taking it :D
[2:17:07] Karnasas: I must disappear now, but have yourself an amazing stream and goodluck with your building! Goodnight to you lovely person you and goodnight to you as well chat!
[2:17:08] Shin_Zilla: honestly I liked that you didn't try to win, think it's a lot more fun to watch you try to guide others to victory
[2:17:10] jaspercoz: for me last life is number 1 double number 2 secret number 3
[2:17:10] waarisdetaart: which is so weird... like you definitely won?
[2:17:16] revaar61: how would it not be your win?  you solo'd two different teams
[2:17:17] puppy555jjj33: @Karnasas bye karn
[2:17:22] jaspercoz: Goodnight karn! karnasLOVE karnasLOVE
[2:17:24] Knot_SJ: Secret life is one of my favs because of how sitcomy and gaslighty it is
[2:17:27] preparedman: @karnasas gn Karn! karnasGhostmango karnasLOVE
[2:17:29] saleo37: @karnasas good sleeps!
[2:17:31] kat999xx: Goodnight Karn! <3
[2:17:33] Blue_Hamster11: @Karnasas bye Karn! pearlieWave
[2:17:34] quasijem: I feel like Scott's ending made it super clear that that win should be attributed to you tho
[2:17:34] lunarediv: @waarisdetaart last person to die wins which was pearl so yeah'
[2:17:36] KayaWolfHorse: regardless if scott was there it was still absolutely a win, what are even some people’s arguments
[2:17:39] keshkup: It wasn't predictable. None of the mounders actually followed your plan pearlieSweat
[2:17:40] AeroNova_: that was so cute :')
[2:17:43] giannnovich: Hello
[2:17:47] mega_mage_36: bye loved it!
[2:17:48] waarisdetaart: @lunarediv exactly...
[2:17:49] rathgar1843: dublife was nice for breaking up standard team up tropes
[2:17:49] realfragments: it
[2:17:53] fxoons: I still cant believe scar won secret life
[2:17:59] Nightbot:  Follow Pearl in all the places: https://www.youtube.com/pearlescentmoon  https://twitter.com/PearlescentMoon https://www.instagram.com/pearlescentmoo/
[2:18:02] Nicklii: i wondered where the "blue eyes see better in darkness" came from, then i recall people mention reindeers having blue eyes in winter and brown over the summer in such discussions
[2:18:03] realfragments: it's such a compelling narrative though
[2:18:12] GaspsHiChat: just woke up and saw you were streaming so it's a good day
[2:18:33] Nightbot:  Don't become a french fry, be a good potato, remember to follow the stream!
[2:18:49] realfragments: and anyway, you having fun on the series is important!
[2:18:52] tishencat: The life series introduced me to other creators
[2:18:58] Nightbot:  Reminder to be kind in chat!
[2:19:01] preparedman: It was still riveting. Towards the end I was like "oh no Pearl might win by accident! The tragedy!"
[2:19:03] thattinymushroom: I must head to sleep now, it was nice listening in to the stream while drawing! have a fun stream!!! pearlieWave
[2:19:04] Tinker_it: Scar was a beast
[2:19:13] thespectrescall: It was a very emotional ending I think
[2:19:21] waarisdetaart: @preparedman lol imagine that
[2:19:24] giannnovich: Scar juet killed half the server the madlad
[2:19:26] crapouche: this dirt city is a vibe honestly :) like a cobweb from a spider species we dont know about
[2:19:27] lunarediv: hahahahha
[2:19:31] Blue_Hamster11: @thattinymushroom Good Nigth! pearlieWave
[2:19:43] thespectrescall: Scar was so sad when he realised you died
[2:19:43] fxoons: Scar was so unpredictable and by far the hardest to kill for the whole series
[2:19:52] Tinker_it: well... scar was kind of forced to be a beast lol
[2:19:53] jojobeanlive: If Scar had taken your offer and killed you, I'm almost 100% positive gem would've won
[2:19:59] k1_setae: What i dont get in that is how a person(scar) can die 20 times in first episode of hermitcraft but still manage to survive that :D
[2:20:02] rathgar1843: scar to mumbo's advice to get better at the gamee
[2:20:16] ChancieRN: Scar really did great. I loved it was you two at the end after how many times you threatened to kill him lol
[2:20:17] Neamow: @fxoons the amount of people who tried to kill him only for him to somehow slip away was insane, including getting chased by a warden
[2:20:41] Nicklii: k1_setae, peple mention his hardcore series when that point is brought up
[2:20:44] GaspsHiChat: i joke that scar did so well bc he wasn't freaked out when he got to low hearts bc he's always on low hearts lol
[2:21:02] VoxKeys: Scar running from the wither for ages was hilarious
[2:21:02] mothersquishy: What time is it for you?
[2:21:04] waarisdetaart: watching you wrangle the warden from Tango's perspective was amazing
[2:21:09] BaristaSimmer: And it's more fun for the viewer too
[2:21:15] roll_away: whatsyour favourite secret task
[2:21:17] Sirromap: !time @mothersquishy
[2:21:17] Nightbot: January 25th 2024, 1:18:35 am AEDT GMT+11:00
[2:21:19] brian_of_farce: Scar was pure chaos in SL, glad he won
[2:21:19] coolstormation: how you flyin
[2:21:25] Knot_SJ: I love that secret live just felt like a sit com the entire time
[2:21:29] KayaWolfHorse: honestly i have no complaints about pearl’s life series, her story as a whole is so compelling
[2:21:35] saleo37: @coolstormation freecam
[2:21:37] fxoons: Life series is the best minecraft series ever created IMO
[2:21:40] VoxKeys: @KayaWolfHorse so true
[2:21:44] Tinker_it: hopefully the life series lasts long enough for someone to win twice; so we can see the group maul them next time.
[2:21:44] coolstormation: huh? how u flyin
[2:21:45] ChancieRN: If you were creating the next life series, what would you do?
[2:21:58] VoxKeys: @coolstormation freecam
[2:21:58] Blue_Hamster11: @coolstormation freeCam
[2:22:09] datguccipoochie: hellooooo am I late

[2:23:04] Nightbot:  Join the discord: https://discord.gg/pearlescentmoon
[2:23:04] jenny_b14: I think Grians Life series’ are the best.
[2:23:15] rathgar1843: i would combine them all with the set ups determined randomly.
[2:23:27] lunarediv: life series deserves all the praise
[2:23:33] GaspsHiChat: i had a dream last night that a new life series was created and it was double life but with inventory space instead of hearts
[2:23:34] Nightbot:  Don't be a dry potato, remember to stay hydrated!
[2:23:46] fxoons: Idk what would make a good concept for the next life series, but it definitely needs to have more of the boogy in it tgan secret did
[2:23:56] Neamow: I don't care what the next Life setting is, I just wish the boogeyman comes back pearlieLOL feels to me like it creates the funniest situations
[2:23:59] Nightbot: Remember to check out the Frequently Asked Questions (#faq) channel on discord!
[2:24:08] lunarediv: it needs a little more time in the oven to bake for a new concept
[2:24:08] domenator9995: I just thought I was 2 hours late and the stream is over
[2:24:15] datguccipoochie: I think I got food poisoning from some dumb burrito I got at a gas station
[2:24:18] toasterGhost00: ooooh that sounds fun
[2:24:19] Nightbot:  Be respectful - No spamming - No advertising - English only
[2:24:20] jindo1: oooo shared inventory would be interesting
[2:24:25] kamitsu_jaffa: ooh sounds cool
[2:24:28] kat999xx: oooh that's an interesting one
[2:24:29] GaspsHiChat: yeah you shared inventory space. it took scar until the end of the season to figure out in my dream
[2:24:35] datguccipoochie: that sounds like an interesting concept yes
[2:24:43] Nicklii: gaspshichat, sounds like a fever dream Kappa
[2:24:51] ChancieRN: ChancieRN subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 25 months! I'm so glad I finally finished clinical so I can catch some of your streams again!  Suppose to be studying for boards, being here is so much more fun.
[2:24:58] Blue_Hamster11: @GaspsHiChat pearlieLOL
[2:24:59] GaspsHiChat: @nicklii oh definitely was. i've been running a fever for a while now
[2:25:06] PaintdOopsie: i think double life but each session your partner changes would be hilarious lol 😂
[2:25:11] tishencat: did I see a horse in the desert?
[2:25:13] domenator9995: I just thought I was 2 hours late and the stream is over
[2:25:35] ChancieRN: Lol
[2:25:36] lunarediv: LOL
[2:25:43] bean_ebabies: LOL what a name
[2:25:49] Nicklii: redeeming themselves in the desert i see
[2:25:56] kat999xx: Lol nice name
[2:26:02] lunarediv: his legacy is named and really left behind lmao
[2:26:15] moonnn2803: i got a 50% skull rate for wither skellys (i only killed 2) and i think the game decided it was being too generous because none have spawned for the past 10-15 minutes
[2:26:23] waarisdetaart: @paintdoopsie imagine being partnered up with your enemy suddenly xD
[2:26:27] ChancieRN: Works for me!!
[2:26:53] PaintdOopsie: @waarisdetaart exactly imagine the chaos lol 😂
[2:27:05] rathgar1843: so eeeasy to go egyptian
[2:27:05] fxoons: The shared hearts on double life was good for ppl to be incentived to not just give thier lives up.
[2:27:10] kat999xx: I have to go sleep, goodnight!
[2:27:13] toasterGhost00: texturing the sand?
[2:27:34] jenny_b14: I’ve only seen Secret life and limited life. what were the names of Grians other life series?
[2:27:40] sadkitty15: It starting to look like a outback town
[2:28:00] datguccipoochie: yes
[2:28:03] Blue_Hamster11: @jenny_b14 Double life,Last life and third life
[2:28:04] rathgar1843: limited
[2:28:14] roll_away: fav secret task?
[2:28:23] jenny_b14: I’ll have to check out the other ones lol
[2:28:27] Knot_SJ: The naming convention is so confusing and I love it
[2:28:33] stellaris_lex: as someone with a desert base building in an egyptian style, it can be quite complicated if you want to get accurate about the style.
[2:28:34] Aion_Keeper: double life was my first life
[2:28:42] lunarediv: that one was fun
[2:28:47] PaintdOopsie: 3rd life was pretty good. I may have teared up tho on ending lol 😂
[2:28:49] AyushJind: even accidently killed Grian lol
[2:28:50] datguccipoochie: the hot potato one was comedy
[2:28:51] lunarediv: poor etho
[2:28:58] Blue_Hamster11: oo that task was fun!
[2:28:58] foxinatorz: that task from Etho's perspective was tragic
[2:29:01] realfragments: the hot potato episode was so fun
[2:29:04] revaar61: for settlements in an inhospitable environment, I usually find that it helps to think about WHY they would want to put down houses here, and HOW they manage to survive.  Then terraform around that
[2:29:05] itsthenars: hot potato was very good
[2:29:07] keshkup: Sand digging: Nice ASMR/ Dirt digging: Ear destruction
[2:29:17] ChancieRN: I was hoping someone would get a kill all pigs task....I was disappointed lol
[2:29:19] datguccipoochie: and the comedy of ethos getting it because he can’t move was amazing
[2:29:31] purely_average: @keshkup ^^^^^^^
[2:30:04] datguccipoochie: it was fate
[2:30:05] itsthenars: it was very funny to me lmao

[2:36:38] domenator9995: Hey Pearl if you had a favorite anime sword would you buy it in irl?
[2:36:48] itsthenars: i know grian mentioned he wants to do less planning in his season x builds because he gets stuck in that planning process and stresses
[2:36:52] datguccipoochie: omg it had been raining for the last 4 days where I live. I live in a desert.
[2:37:31] djts_stuff: Anything ya build in the life series will get destroyed in the end
[2:37:33] GaspsHiChat: i love how every episode you were like "okay we're getting started on my base today!" and it ended up with That tower
[2:37:34] jungle_aki: Hi
[2:37:34] theachup: hi pearl! have you ever thought about playing a modpack? specifically vault hunters? or do you only enjoy vanilla?

[2:38:47] peon_8: which hermitcraft season was your favourite?
[2:38:48] datguccipoochie: tbh one of my favorite things to do is build on curves, building with curves is so fun
[2:38:57] GaspsHiChat: tower-in-law or smth
[2:39:03] saleo37: And its good for defense
[2:39:13] BaristaSimmer: I like BDubs tower this past season
[2:39:14] RescueLynn: Hi Pearl!  Good to catch you here.  How are you?
[2:39:15] itsthenars: grian falling from the tower and just standing there on half a heart was one of the funniest moments to me just cause everyone stared at him like he was about to explode for a few seconds
[2:39:19] iCopperBonsai: Good Morning!
[2:39:21] rere8585: houses and castles are done to death in minecraft IMO

[2:39:47] keshkup: Some call that "The Batman logo curve"
[2:39:59] Tinker_it: Including all of Mumbo's redstone/bunker/vault builds... Mumbo's greatest work was the two  fence posts he put in secret life.

[2:40:02] kilauea2011: I've played Minecraft for almost 13 years and I still have never made a proper base.

[2:41:08] jenny_b14: Scar’s retort “it’s thick” had me rolling every time I saw it lmao

[2:42:02] giannnovich: Well Scar never thinks before he speaks so he always hss the best one liners
[2:42:07] GaspsHiChat: i'm glad y'all are all pg enough bc i can laugh at the jokes but my 5 yo sister doesn't understand at all
[2:42:27] Amaze_me15: I love how life series you guys really push the pg line. it’s awesome
[2:42:37] keshkup: Oh it's clear at this point Scar doesn't have that kind of filter

[2:43:56] itsthenars: bigb stole the early series fr fr he was so funny
[2:43:57] doxisontwitchnow: Scar's filter is like Sausage's, none-existent to adults but with enough innuendo that most younger kids don't get it.

[2:45:51] Pigoen_Kid: as a kid i would build a lot of pixel art in mc and now as a primarily pixel artist the 2 translate very well to one another in terms of the curves

[2:49:35] dimaginarylaw: I am trying to get into Kaizo type of gameplay and it's a bit hard

[2:53:37] datguccipoochie: Celeste is so fun but I think for a lot of people the difficulty of it can be too brutal
[2:53:41] jameis_not_james: after playing inscryption I’ve become addicted and would love to see some streamers playing it

[2:54:20] unatos: you got any plans for season 10? or just freestyle, or secret
[2:54:31] ARToatmeal: I’m disappointed by the trees in animal crossing legos but happy they included fauna
[2:54:35] datguccipoochie: isn’t there a set that’s like the London bridge?
[2:54:38] MusicFreeGaming: Some of the Lego city sets look cool.
[2:54:41] stormageddon07: check out the game xB is playing

[2:55:14] rathgar1843: i think they had the opra house set, hard to find though
[2:55:19] devdevthrills: Same with the NES with Mario on a TV lego set
[2:55:20] jenny_b14: depends on the size @philkats
[2:55:24] dimaginarylaw: I have kinda been getting into Roguelikes recently

[2:55:35] ARToatmeal: are you able to order things online where you are
[2:55:36] GaspsHiChat: anytime someone says lego i always remember the commercials that were like "a man has fallen into the river !!" followed by intense speed building by floating hands
[2:55:38] puddlleshine: Just a cute little stand and a storage square thingy. The other one is literally just a ginormous trader llama
[2:55:40] philkats: @jenny_b14 true i guess it also depends on the country right?
[2:55:41] DasAbsoluteDeuteron: star wars legos for me
[2:55:41] datguccipoochie: I have one that’s a Volkswagen camper can and that was so enjoyable and decent in size
[2:55:51] goodrickbadrick: I have the fox lego minecraft set. I like it, it's cute, but they are designed more as play sets than as cool display builds
[2:55:57] dimaginarylaw: Hades is fun but I'm not used to Isometric games
[2:56:07] DotBitGaming: Buy a used box and build from your imagination

[2:56:36] Larzss: 21343 Viking Village is pretty decent price and large
[2:57:12] datguccipoochie: technic sets are also very fun but as a huge artsy person I really love anything that’s large and a buising
[2:57:15] datguccipoochie: building
[2:57:19] revaar61: Have you considered playing something more storyline driven on stream, like Baldur's Gate? *hopeful*

[2:57:25] sydneygerby: Someone should try and make pearls season 9 base with legos
[2:57:33] GaspsHiChat: my younger brothers used to have several giant totes of lego and would build giant apartment buildings before their stepmom made them get rid of it
[2:57:37] EvilShadoww: Hey Pearl! How're you doing good
[2:57:38] jakholope: How did the warden wrangling go?

[2:59:57] GaspsHiChat: when y'all build lego, do y'all sort the bricks by colours? apparently that's weird but that's how i do it
[3:00:09] MusicFreeGaming: I grew up in the days of the early space sets like the Galaxy Explorer. The block selection was pretty limited back in the day.
[3:00:19] ARToatmeal: it’s just a brick
[3:00:22] sadkitty15: What your lest favourite thing in this world
[3:00:23] helarctic: LOL
[3:00:23] maxibon98: OpieOP
[3:00:24] goodrickbadrick: They often put in randomly colourful blocks on purpose. Like there was a dare to hide pink bricks in star wars sets and if you could the designer got a cake
[3:00:25] EvilShadoww: LUL LUL LUL
[3:00:27] secret_agent4706: LUL LUL
[3:00:28] devdevthrills: Most the random colored blocks are for reference while building! But they are so addictive, I've bought almost every Idea set this year....whoops lol

[3:27:59] HumanRayla13: How do people feel about peel in mashed potatoes?
[3:28:08] waarisdetaart: @SkullyWho that sounds AMAZING
[3:28:08] SkullyWho: Homemade
[3:28:09] rakuga23: I don't know for sure, but instant mashed potatoes was probably invented as an army ration.
[3:28:10] BertPotato: Your palate improves as you get older
[3:28:18] GaspsHiChat: i have sensory issues with food and cannot eat mashed potatoes with the peel
[3:28:18] niko23harrythebest: noooo you killed pig😭
[3:28:21] raydenrydia: Pearl needs a texture pack to turn all mobs in potatoes :D
[3:28:25] casinoking04: @humanrayla13 I love when it's the red skin potatoes but nothing else
[3:28:26] Nicklii: is that hill a face?
[3:28:33] fayytherzz: That is werid looking land Gen the pointy mtn.
[3:28:35] giannnovich: My mother has never made mashed potatoes of her own, so I've never have experienced the true mashed potato taste.
[3:28:40] niko23harrythebest: DONT KILL
[3:28:46] bearbeanpais: @raydenrydia YESSS
[3:28:48] niko23harrythebest: STOP KILLING
[3:28:51] bean_ebabies: roast garlic in mash potato is so so good
[3:28:57] Blue_Hamster11: Yeah, i'm not a big fan of mashed potatoes but the powder mash is just not it
[3:28:57] EzraManning: powder mash potato makes a good binder for other recipes
[3:28:58] BertPotato: @niko23harrythebest DON'T TELL STREAMERS WHAT TO DO
[3:29:05] ARToatmeal: wait yall do we still want a parrot
[3:29:13] casinoking04: Oh shoot. I forgot to take the pork outta the freezer 😶
[3:29:29] dimaginarylaw: What is mashed potato anyway?
[3:29:30] GaspsHiChat: squish
[3:29:31] AbsentNyx: Omg I had the exact same experience. Found a powder one I liked and then suddenly they were different and I didn't like it. Also added butter to it lol
[3:29:33] kuruasu: ewwwwwwwwww
[3:29:34] Hnkaa: hospital visit ruined mashed potatoes for me.. just thinking about it makes me gag
[3:29:35] anastasiaice1: Did you ever find the white tail?
[3:29:36] waarisdetaart: a fly's revenge
[3:29:44] fayytherzz: What matt did you get.
[3:29:45] bearbeanpais: @niko23harrythebest  yea it’s their stream stop demanding for her to stop killing fake animals 💀
[3:29:50] sparkysure: The baby red instant mashed are the best!!!!
[3:29:51] ByOrderoftheQueen: I hear mashed potato is taters that have been mushed
[3:29:53] gubbinbruh: @fayytherzz ^^
[3:29:54] Badgerattack: Sounds like a very australian issue, smashing bugs on your mousepad badger26POG
[3:30:01] Kienlabadao: The dungeon (mat) claimed another life
[3:30:02] toomuchinertia: what about sweet potatoes
[3:30:12] Noobelia: giannnovich just try it out yourself, it's really easy. Just boil a decent amount of taters, add some butter, mash them, add some milk and (a lot :D ) of muscat. Butter and milk can be ajusted at every time during the mashing.
[3:30:15] keshkup: @casinoking04 Me in highschool when my mom asked me to do that before heading out:
[3:30:18] DiscoBear_PS: What's the difference between mashed potatoes and pea soup? - Anyone can mash potatoes
[3:30:19] Shin_Zilla: the best spider are the spiders you never see pearlieExcited
[3:30:36] BertPotato: Killing all the polygons in order to prevent Polly gones
[3:30:36] RattyZee: Cute little secret roommates
[3:30:37] kaes_100: can i type now?
[3:30:39] raydenrydia: Is there something underground LOL
[3:30:42] GaspsHiChat: when i was little i wanted to move to australia then i was told about the spiders there and decided i no longer want to move to australia
[3:30:51] notdragolm: Why not check f3?
[3:30:53] ClassyCashier: What is a bee if not a chicken of the hive?
[3:30:55] kamitsu_jaffa: caves might be an issue?
[3:30:57] VoxKeys: Pearl is lost pearlieLOL
[3:31:14] nordicseven: One of the best potato dish is a Poutine
[3:31:16] Proffiesloth: pearliePearlLove
[3:31:22] EzraManning: if you have passive mobs in your spawn chunks that will also affect it
[3:31:44] Noobelia: So, we killed a lot of innocent bystanders. Do we have at least some seeds? :D
[3:31:46] ByOrderoftheQueen: scalloped potatoes is where its at
[3:31:52] kuruasu: sad
[3:31:59] AquaBlaze_XP: @ByOrderoftheQueen yes
[3:32:02] moonnn2803: @ByOrderoftheQueen scalloped potatoes >>>
[3:32:13] ByOrderoftheQueen: @moonnn2803 ye
[3:32:22] waarisdetaart: @ByOrderoftheQueen what is that?
[3:32:24] ByOrderoftheQueen: Pearl, have you ever had scalloped potatoes???
[3:32:33] Nicklii: no mules?
[3:32:43] djts_stuff: This past week I was just craving potatoes. Either to put in my ramen or just make some fries or chips
[3:32:46] raydenrydia: Actually might be a good thing to wait for spawns in the jungle
[3:32:52] fayytherzz: Scalloped potatoes are the best
[3:32:52] GaspsHiChat: scalloped potatoes are a solid 7/10
[3:33:01] beavie_: A singular Donk
[3:33:06] BertPotato: Hmmm... I never knew the passive mob cap was so low (10)
[3:33:14] desokit_: Scalloped potatoes are thinly sliced potatoes layered in a casserole dish and baked in milk or cream until they're tender
[3:33:17] Nightbot:  Follow Pearl in all the places: https://www.youtube.com/pearlescentmoon  https://twitter.com/PearlescentMoon https://www.instagram.com/pearlescentmoo/
[3:33:21] FerriaForever: thinly sliced potatoes with a cheesy sauce.
[3:33:21] kaes_100: i was watching on my phone and i couldn't chat anymore, but it works on my conputer. I'm very confused
[3:33:27] raydenrydia: If you get mobs spawning there it might be good once they despawned
[3:33:27] BertPotato: Basically a potato bake
[3:33:33] ByOrderoftheQueen: Google says 'hin and uniformly cut potatoes are layered in a casserole dish and then covered with a seasoned onion cream sauce and baked.'
[3:33:35] Asterionm: its a fancy sliced potato
[3:33:40] moonnn2803: if you add cheese to scalloped potatoes its called something else i think (i dont rmbr)
[3:33:42] beavie_: @desokit_ I really need to try that. Sounds yummy.
[3:33:50] ByOrderoftheQueen: also covered in cheese and chives
[3:33:58] revaar61: @moonnn2803 au gratin
[3:33:59] kattituude: Scalloped potatoes are good but very rich - better to have on occasion imo
[3:34:00] Nightbot:  Don't become a french fry, be a good potato, remember to follow the stream!
[3:34:06] beavie_: If you ever go to Canada, try Poutine. French Fries covered in cheese curds and melted with gravy.
[3:34:08] ByOrderoftheQueen: they are def a side dish
[3:34:25] Nightbot:  Reminder to be kind in chat!
[3:34:26] ByOrderoftheQueen: Poutine has made its way into the States, yum yum
[3:34:31] raydenrydia: Can't you just light it up a bit ???
[3:34:37] ByOrderoftheQueen: yeah, with roast. yum
[3:34:56] august_by_ts: man y'all are making me so hungry
[3:34:58] FerriaForever: I like O'Brian potatoes. Those are my favorite.
[3:35:28] VoxKeys: Sleepy Pearl?
[3:35:41] sparkysure: Me either
[3:35:46] GaspsHiChat: what are cheese curds? i've heard of them a lot but can't quite figure out what they are
[3:35:54] dimaginarylaw: Don't think mashed potatoes are common in India
[3:36:00] BertPotato: Chip's n gravy's a very Scottish thing
[3:36:03] killernurd: In New Jersey, disco fries are a diner staple, using mozzarella instead of curds
[3:36:04] kamitsu_jaffa: chips
[3:36:05] DiscoBear_PS: cheese curds should be squeaky. a lot of places will just use mozza
[3:36:16] nordicseven: Canada is where poutine is popular
[3:36:19] keshkup: fudge nuggets are called potatoes in my language
[3:36:25] corneelis0: My dad makes the best garlic Potatoes from the oven.
[3:36:38] FerriaForever: cheese curds are usually a very mild cheese like mozzarella or cottage cheese
[3:36:39] Neamow: mashed potatoes are best potatoes
[3:36:46] mad_blue_duck: no sour cream?
[3:36:48] N0peThankY0u: When I was in India my coworker took me to a sort of American-Indian restaurant that had the best potatoes I’ve ever had lol
[3:36:49] BertPotato: You can use a fork in the absence of the right utensil
[3:36:52] revaar61: @DiscoBear_PS that's just wrong.  if you don't have proper curds at least use cheddar
[3:36:55] kuruasu: you can mash potatoes with a fork, it's just harder to do
[3:36:57] BertPotato: Yep, peeling them
[3:36:58] mad_blue_duck: i guess you dont need it if your using milk
[3:37:00] griffwc16: A potato ricer makes the best mashed potatoes
[3:37:00] killernurd: the cheese curds used for poutine are usually cheddar cheese curds
[3:37:03] miss_gvs: A little sour cream or ranch is even better
[3:37:07] theheartofthings: mostly peeled is good
[3:37:11] autum_mist_101: Some people don't peel them?
[3:37:28] augustasman: I also add couple carrots
[3:37:30] mad_blue_duck: @miss_gvs oooo never done ranch before, might have to try that
[3:37:34] GaspsHiChat: my parents aren't home. how weirded out do you think they'd be if they came home and i've made mashed potatoes at 9:30am
[3:37:36] marty0metz: Powdered potatoes are the best ingredient with butter
[3:37:42] rootstock: pearl, you’re making me hungry with all this potato talk! I didn’t know I was coming to potato stream! 😭
[3:37:42] EzraManning: pealed and non leaky
[3:37:55] jenny_b14: my hubs makes these Greek potatoes where he essentially steams them in the oven and omg so good
[3:37:57] miss_gvs: You'll love it @sirnumnuts
[3:38:11] waarisdetaart: terracotta?
[3:38:12] kattituude: a bit of gravel?
[3:38:12] kyonarra: @GaspsHiChat Maybe they'll think you were preparing some lunch
[3:38:13] ashleighjane96: In Ireland we have champ, which is mashed potatoes with spring onion(scallion) chopped up through it. it’s beautiful
[3:38:14] NMy_mc: Red sandstone?
[3:38:17] kuruasu: gravel?
[3:38:23] szyszeg: granite?
[3:38:29] raydenrydia: Ehm, what is the goal ?
[3:38:30] kamitsu_jaffa: sandstone maybe? or granite?
[3:38:36] ketatheoreo: how long are your strems
[3:38:40] sparkysure: Stripped birch
[3:38:41] kyonarra: Mud?
[3:38:43] ARToatmeal: I find it realistic
[3:38:46] pulpvincenzo: rooted dirt?
[3:38:47] yvbrenda: Endstone?
[3:38:49] FerriaForever: mushroom stem goes well with sandstone.
[3:38:50] kuruasu: diorite?
[3:38:50] raydenrydia: What about endstone ?
[3:38:54] johndrinkwater: polished tuff .. just gotta wait, heh
[3:38:58] szyszeg: dripstone maybe
[3:39:06] GaspsHiChat: granite looks like it would taste delicious
[3:39:06] scruzcredo: Mangrove root? Even mixed with mud or rooted mud
[3:39:07] ARToatmeal: grante rooted dirt packed mud
[3:39:07] kamitsu_jaffa: oh yeah tuff maybe
[3:39:31] keshkup: May also annoy Iskall a bit in the process
[3:39:51] tasboiLIVE: how much do i donate to make you jump from a height and die?
[3:39:52] kamitsu_jaffa: ah gotcha
[3:40:08] ARToatmeal: 1 mil
[3:40:09] dimaginarylaw: Should you focus more on colour or shape when building?
[3:40:25] tasboiLIVE: ok well have a great australia day laters
[3:40:25] ARToatmeal: 1 billion
[3:40:33] haggleslag: reall? how about 2 dollar Kappa
[3:40:34] VoxKeys: So what have I been gifting for /j
[3:40:45] kattituude: anyone that asks that question would never donate anyway - it's so silly
[3:40:57] Monado_Oshawott: 60million channel points in 1 stream for you to do a water bucket cluch from world height
[3:41:06] miss_gvs: Facts @kattituude
[3:41:09] beavie_: I have been trying to extend a mountain on a server I'm on for a castle, I look at it and think "How does Pearl do all this in a week AND make it pretty?"
[3:41:15] ARToatmeal: 1 trillion lol
[3:41:16] RohanaDArilin: I donate for the pleasure of watching, and to help caus' I like it.
[3:41:45] RohanaDArilin: Streamers and content creators provide a service, it would be cheeky to never give back to them.
[3:42:00] beavie_: That makes a lot of sense. Thanks
[3:42:14] notdragolm: Is this like a path going through a cave?
[3:42:55] sparkysure: Guys now I'm cooking mashed taters at 9:40 am lol
[3:43:00] Nightbot:  Join the discord: https://discord.gg/pearlescentmoon
[3:43:09] ARToatmeal: it’s a lot but it could look cool, after some trust the process
[3:43:34] ARToatmeal: I would like to think it’s a SECRET TUNNNNNNEEEELLLL
[3:43:34] Nightbot:  Don't be a dry potato, remember to stay hydrated!
[3:43:38] GaspsHiChat: @sparkysure i also thought about making mashed taters at 9:40am so thank you for living out my dream
[3:43:42] RohanaDArilin: @sparkysure there's no wrong time for taters.
[3:43:48] RohanaDArilin: taters are universal
[3:43:51] Gyix_Tao: Hi pearl!   Did i hear mornin mashed taters?
[3:43:53] beavie_: You can't tell me what to do, Nightbot, I'm also drinking coffee
[3:43:58] Nightbot: Remember to check out the Frequently Asked Questions (#faq) channel on discord!
[3:44:01] ByOrderoftheQueen: Make enough taters for stream
[3:44:06] dimaginarylaw: I have a hard time sticking with creative work
[3:44:20] Nightbot:  Be respectful - No spamming - No advertising - English only
[3:44:31] ByOrderoftheQueen: I decided yesterday Minecraft needs to add palm trees
[3:44:34] ARToatmeal: ….some one bringing snacks?
[3:44:35] bearbeanpais: pearl i gotta go bye! i’ll be back soon
[3:44:39] ARToatmeal: trusting
[3:44:45] Gyix_Tao: not shabby.  lotsa lurkin, not so much chatting.   but i'm feelin froggy today
[3:44:58] joeri_van: that I what I say to myself when I make exams
[3:45:00] RohanaDArilin: i'm making soup right now.
[3:45:01] dimaginarylaw: I trust
[3:45:02] Gyix_Tao: been folloing ya since you joined HC
[3:45:02] beavie_: I joined the discord, instantly see your rank is potato. As someone who lives in a place known for potatoes, I feel welcome
[3:45:14] ARToatmeal: it all comes together in the end when the surroundings and vibe has progressed more

[3:45:33] Gyix_Tao: lol, i guess its an american expression.  It means i'm feeling energetic and a bit out of my normal
[3:45:40] Gyix_Tao: not a bad thing
[3:45:45] snowystar122: oh nuuuu i broke it xd
[3:45:52] VoxKeys: This stream really is a circle, we've gone from potatoes back to frogs pearlieCrazy
[3:46:09] GaspsHiChat: oh yeah we never saw the frogs on the lego sakura tree
[3:46:35] Gyix_Tao: ahh, i must have missed that lol
[3:46:36] ByOrderoftheQueen: im American and I assumed it meant their voice was going out lol
[3:46:51] GaspsHiChat: i'm american and thought they meant groggy
[3:46:53] EzraManning: my mum asks me if I feel froggy and for years I thought it was bad
[3:46:54] CrayonGhost: what region? I'm from utica and I've never heard the expression "feeling froggy"
[3:46:56] ByOrderoftheQueen: Gyix, are you in the South by chance?
[3:46:59] Gyix_Tao: you stream a tad early for me, so i dont always catch em
[3:47:04] Noobelia: I'll have to go outside soon to do some grocerys. But that storm outside gets even more wild every minute ... It said it would calm down by now ...
[3:47:07] ARToatmeal: I love how much sand you are keeping and the original desert vibes, it’s still looks like desert and not an oasis or just grassland
[3:47:07] GaspsHiChat: @crayonghost oh no not utica, it's an albany expression
[3:47:15] CrayonGhost: @GaspsHiChat ah I see
[3:47:19] Gyix_Tao: @ByOrderoftheQueen not currently.  Been raised in both north and south
[3:47:20] ARToatmeal: very realistic cute
[3:47:28] turtlesntoadstools: I was actually just wondering what to eat for breakfast so imma make use of the tater comment. GlitchNRG mrsblobNod
[3:47:29] styrium: i mean the path eill be gray, do morr contrasting than noe
[3:47:34] ByOrderoftheQueen: im in the Western US. Maybe thats why
[3:47:43] Gyix_Tao: I'm whatchya call a DamnDixie
[3:47:58] Gyix_Tao: oo, sorry, didnt think about that before i typed
[3:48:02] GaspsHiChat: i'm in southern us and never heard of froggy tbh
[3:48:05] Nightbot:  Follow Pearl in all the places: https://www.youtube.com/pearlescentmoon  https://twitter.com/PearlescentMoon https://www.instagram.com/pearlescentmoo/
[3:48:06] ARToatmeal: I promise not to tell the realism police
[3:48:08] ByOrderoftheQueen: the really interesting thing about America is we're effectively 51 countries, so there are LOTS of expressions that don't carry over
[3:48:22] CrayonGhost: @GaspsHiChat actually never heard it either in the midwest
[3:48:31] notdragolm: Deepslate?
[3:48:33] raydenrydia: Granite doesn't seem to look so bad...
[3:48:35] ByOrderoftheQueen: ok Americans, do you say pop, soda or coke?
[3:48:37] ARToatmeal: andsite? but I can’t spell
[3:48:39] Nightbot:  Don't become a french fry, be a good potato, remember to follow the stream!
[3:48:43] RohanaDArilin: The granite doesn't contrast wit the path enough imo
[3:48:48] dukeville10: Pearl I'm new to your hatrdcore stuff. What's the plan for this area?
[3:48:49] snowystar122: leaky potato xd
[3:48:51] Gyix_Tao: @CrayonGhost I learned it  here in Michigan.
[3:48:53] beavie_: Maybe a mix of andesite, stone?
[3:48:55] RattyZee: Birch planks maybe?
[3:48:55] GaspsHiChat: @byorderofthequeen soda but my grandpa used to say coke then ask for a dr. pepper
[3:48:57] raydenrydia: What about mixing some sand on the front too ??
[3:49:05] Nightbot:  Reminder to be kind in chat!
[3:49:05] maniacal_laughing: mud brick?
[3:49:06] CrayonGhost: huh interesting
[3:49:06] raydenrydia: Or like I said before Endstone ???
[3:49:12] ByOrderoftheQueen: @GaspsHiChat 'What flavor of coke do you want?'  '***pper' lol
[3:49:16] AquaBlaze_XP: change a bit of the dirt?
[3:49:19] Blue_Hamster11: i agree not really vibing with the granite
[3:49:24] Cyber_Saurus90: Hello!! Finally caught a stream you always start at 4 am where I am lol
[3:49:25] Gyix_Tao: maybe a generational thing....i'm on the older side
[3:49:26] dukeville10: Love it!
[3:49:26] turtlesntoadstools: Just mashed potatoes 🥔
[3:49:35] Noobelia: I'd still think using packed mud at some places might help. Even if it's in the buildings. The sand people used what they got for building so why not use it in the surroundings?
[3:49:39] RohanaDArilin: maybe stone and a sorta lighter path texture?
[3:49:45] marce11a: what about coral?
[3:49:48] raydenrydia: The original, not the bricks
[3:49:50] ARToatmeal: stripped birch, sand stones? maybe add to path to help brown in clift
[3:49:51] bean_ebabies: @byorderofthequeen that's very depending on where in the states you are. Midwest says pop mostly, where I grew up in Michigan we say soda
[3:49:52] jenny_b14: stripped birch??
[3:50:04] jenny_b14: mushroom stem??
[3:50:06] fxoons: Just wandering why the path is winding and organic and all the other streets are square
[3:50:10] ARToatmeal: terracotta or cyan terracotta
[3:50:14] itsKokonee: terracotta?
[3:50:17] scotchramune: I like this combination but it blends too much
[3:50:17] notdragolm: How about deepslate?
[3:50:21] beavie_: Sometimes with a build there's trial and error.
[3:50:24] raydenrydia: Or actually, replace the granite with the dripstone block
[3:50:25] Gyix_Tao: @bean_ebabies LOL we say pop in this part of michigan
[3:50:34] sapphicwhimsy: this reminds me of someone i knew who would use raw iron blocks for the path around their base...
[3:50:42] miss_gvs: Brown mushroom?
[3:50:45] RohanaDArilin: the mushroom stem is slighly grayish isn't it? like an off white?
[3:50:45] ywain_: the exposed mushroom, like the sand base path fwhip made recently
[3:50:51] beavie_: You could use diorite just to repel Iskall?
[3:50:52] FerriaForever: brown teracotta?
[3:50:54] ARToatmeal: it’s fun brainstorming together <3 <3 <3
[3:51:01] RohanaDArilin: @beavie_ ^^
[3:51:05] bean_ebabies: @gyix_tao really??? I grew up in Flint! :0 maybe I'm just a weirdo lol
[3:51:06] Casperiuss: dripstone
[3:51:07] Mick2077: concrete maybe?
[3:51:07] jenny_b14: I built a whole building then tore it down because I didn’t like it a few days later lol
[3:51:08] ClassyCashier: I think the granite looks good, it just needs a contrasting color near the dirt. A terracotta line would look good.
[3:51:09] turtlesntoadstools: I’ve lived in so many places in the US I just say soda at this point.
[3:51:11] LykunLife: Hello everyone!
[3:51:17] CrayonGhost: @Gyix_Tao same in ohio, in fact when my parents took me to disney world as a child my dad ordered a pop and the cashier responded with "what part of ohio are you from?"
[3:51:26] Spirilta: Andesite?
[3:51:32] ARToatmeal: I can’t wait for my nephew to come home so we can play Minecraft lol
[3:51:34] MariaRyom: bone blok?
[3:51:36] Gyix_Tao: @bean_ebabies I'm on the western side-ish.  Rural area between Lansing and GR
[3:51:39] ByOrderoftheQueen: Playing MC while listening to Pearl play leads to confusion LUL
[3:51:40] raydenrydia: Actually, dripstone block, brown mushroom thingy and the dripstone itself might actually work too ???
[3:51:42] pyr0lys3: I think I tore down my roof on my last build three times before I found a design I liked
[3:51:44] scotchramune: i feel like mayybe mud and mud with roots could look good
[3:51:52] Gwaffa: hey @PearlescentMoon
[3:51:55] GaspsHiChat: half the chat is talking about regional dialect and the other half is giving block suggestions
[3:51:59] MaraudingBacon: did pearl just say its "too mush" :O
[3:52:04] maniacal_laughing: rooted dirt?
[3:52:10] beavie_: Even not on a server, you're 100 times more organised than I ever will be. In Season ten you need to host organisation seminars for a fee. You'd make bank on Scar and Grian alone.
[3:52:13] Spirilta: What about andesite?
[3:52:13] bean_ebabies: @gyix_tao grandparents are from GR, now we live in Ohio. Small world!!
[3:52:14] z_e_ns: @GaspsHiChat why not hahaha
[3:52:24] ywain_: noteblock LUL

[3:52:43] unikum0815: terracotta
[3:52:45] ByOrderoftheQueen: what about beehives?
[3:52:47] FerriaForever: raw copper blocks
[3:52:50] beavie_: I have grown to love andesite just because of the texture. Rough enough, but still a hint smooth
[3:52:52] fxoons: Oak planks and stone?
[3:52:57] ARToatmeal: hay bales lol
[3:52:58] detsub: Grian talked ***shroom blocks in the nvidia colab where you participate. And he say dont use it in survival.
[3:52:58] RohanaDArilin: @beavie_ grian would sit down for 5 minutes then get bored ans start acting like a kid on sugar high ^^
[3:52:59] Tinker_it: tinted glass?
[3:53:04] Nightbot:  Be respectful - No spamming - No advertising - English only
[3:53:20] dimaginarylaw: We have been thinking of getting a dog. Need to know how to prepare the home for that though
[3:53:32] MusicFreeGaming: Designing on the fly is really hard because flies are so tiny
[3:53:35] miss_gvs: I trust your on the fly more than my plans lol
[3:53:41] GaspsHiChat: gonna start throwing out wild block suggestions like bedrock and obsidian
[3:53:41] szyszeg: light gray terracotta maybe?
[3:53:47] Tinker_it: tinted glass over sand?
[3:53:49] ARToatmeal: I love copper so hyped for the new update!
[3:53:54] TheRooPlace: Looms?
[3:54:07] MariaRyom: cactus
[3:54:14] miss_gvs: The tops and bottoms of chiseled bookshelves are nice
[3:54:17] turtlesntoadstools: what about a mix of different blocks?
[3:54:19] z_e_ns: what about sand LUL
[3:54:30] waarisdetaart: i'm curious if we're getting a snapshot today
[3:54:31] ARToatmeal: I love light grey and cyan terracotta with stone vibes
[3:55:22] dimaginarylaw: I really like building with smooth sandstone
[3:55:25] ARToatmeal: blocking out with stone and dirt has helped my organic builds so much
[3:55:25] DaniLovesWaffles: wait what are building right now
[3:55:30] miss_gvs: Figure out the frosting before the sprinkles 📝 got it
[3:55:33] waarisdetaart: usually on wednesdays
[3:55:36] raydenrydia: Okay so weirdly enough but what about the combination of "dripstone, packed mud, brown mushroom block and stripped Jungle Log/wood" ???
[3:55:57] miss_mori: home sick from work today, and missing all my favorite hermits, so i hopped on to see if anyone was on and my first ever Pearl stream. <3

[3:56:34] hufflepuff_cookie: 'ello everyone
[3:56:50] maniacal_laughing: Hire bdubs as an accent colored block.
[3:57:12] miss_mori: sadly thats while i'm normally opperating a sewing machine and gossiping at my awesome job.
[3:57:24] buzzie107: I usually try to plan out my buildings in all stone or wool before actually making them and detailing them
[3:57:30] raydenrydia: oh Pearl, before you end, I remember I needed to ask a question :) it's kinda a Sausage question too but I asked him and he pointed to you :D Did you ever release the viking map you 2 did together ???

[4:02:56] kattituude: I don't understand how phasmo can continue to be so entertaining - I got burned out very quickly but maybe I'm missing something

[4:04:14] raydenrydia: Honestly, if I build something from a person I always try to remake it or give things my own touch... I'm interested in using part of the Library design you guys did for making my new Storage building... My huge Storage from the 1.17 version turns out to small for 1.20 and it's gonna get worse :D
