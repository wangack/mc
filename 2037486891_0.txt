[1:09:18] Amandroid: @bunnygirlnextdoor linkzzeyPaws
[1:09:28] dank_mlg_guy: Why do performance modes exist shouldn't a multi billion dollar company optimize their game perfectly?
[1:09:33] bunnygirlnextdoor: @Amandroid i added lots of my own mods and data packs Gladge
[1:09:54] TheDruidJenn: it's so good
[1:10:01] TheDruidJenn: more of a southern US thing
[1:10:22] Amandroid: @dank_mlg_guy you generally only need to optimize if you're adding other mods already - my computer can run vanilla just fine, but once I start adding mods, it can lag - so that's not on mojang
[1:10:46] billboein: @dank_mlg_guy because they have some ugly looking bugs so they don't want to do it the lazy way the mods do it taneeshaElf

[2:42:37] kg_boom3r: @roliivagyok it definitely can come easy for some! Gladge But as a whole English is not considered to be an easy language to learn due to its complex grammar, spelling, and multiple things sounding the same but being different.
[2:43:01] roliivagyok: @RHC_Frank Yeah german is very hard to learn i live in germany for like the past 4 years yet i don't know much
[2:43:17] kg_boom3r: honestly anyone that can speak more than one language to me is next level. I've tried to learn other languages and I swear it just makes my English worse KEKW

It was Amanda, and as she got close, she whipped it, and from behind emerged bunny on water skis. She snatched me (and my tacos) and began dragging me to my doom. Suddenly, a being emerged from the surf. Glistening in body oil, and wielding his trident and itsy bitsy yellow bikini, xopa rose from the depths grabbed me and took me to iHop
