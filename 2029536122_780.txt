[3:19:00] girlz_for_jesuz: you are number 4327th on the any% leaderboard
[3:19:01] logmania: maybe
[3:19:01] twitchofalltrades1: yes
[3:19:01] gavdestroyer: PROB
[3:19:01] bigchonker456: should be
[3:19:01] doombot08: piston will work
[3:19:01] anarchopiggy: YesYes
[3:19:02] NoFlukeLuke52: people acting like not being allowed to chat for 10 minutes is a severe punishment LUL LUL
[3:19:02] maxthechillbot: just put blocks over the portal
[3:19:03] WempleTheLad: yes, put a platform to catch the item though
[3:19:04] Cedar_4: COGSLIDE
[3:19:04] picky64: i think its like sand and breaks on torches
[3:19:05] WickedWizard01: ah alright
[3:19:06] Harald_VIP: LETS GOOO GUES!!
[3:19:07] Soerd: might want a smaller platform to catch the dropped egg
[3:19:07] Glitch_GC: better safe than sorry
[3:19:08] fla_08_ita: yeah as long as it doesn't fall in the portal you could piston it right away
[3:19:08] Some_Apples: end portal????
[3:19:09] livipup: I think I have seen people do that, but idk about this specific version luceHmm
[3:19:12] thesillylittlefella: you really don't need to but ok.
[3:19:12] Mod_Walker: its gotta be 15 blocks out \from it
[3:19:12] fire____ball123: They are probably a bedrock player cuz in bedrock if someone else kills the dragon it also gives an egg when killed by different players
[3:19:12] boldandbrad: I thought you couldn;t push it with a piston
[3:19:12] maiamithrandir: Piston works, you just have to cover the portal just in case
[3:19:13] RonitG1204: ban would have been unreasonable but time out might be fine
[3:19:15] rangacherry: make a backup world
[3:19:15] ferogreywolf: Cover the portal
[3:19:15] reixyz: It teleports to an air block nearby up to seven blocks vertically and fifteen blocks horizontally, creating the same particles as an enderman.
[3:19:15] Xylden: it should be fine with a piston
[3:19:17] arbusam2009: @SmallAnt backup the world
[3:19:19] logmania: did you bring a piston?
[3:19:22] FaeAura: just cover the portal before you piston it
[3:19:22] Raubiri_2: cover the portal
[3:19:22] PyjamaMole: it works livi NODDERS I did it that way in my skyblock world
[3:19:23] maxoulehibou: i think the hoe deserve its title of ¬´ dragon slayer ¬ª
[3:19:26] MACo852: Doesn't it always go to ground?
[3:19:26] mattthias44: does the piston not push it and then falls into the overworld??
[3:19:27] svm22: I didn‚Äôt even know a dragon egg existed in this game, so this will be my only comment on the subject
[3:19:27] WempleTheLad: yeah it‚Äôs a gravity block
[3:19:28] fettuccinealfred69420: it will break when the piston hits it
[3:19:28] ianschleicher: Riskit

[3:51:37] Naburi22: how many shells does he got?

[3:56:53] Volcanron: I assume there's no way to get Chorus Fruit?
[3:56:54] continue_on: "vanilla skyblock" and also "I'm running a mod" oof
[3:56:55] iansonofthor_: so it ISN'T vanilla Sadge
[3:56:58] Bobobombastisch: i do remember watching a skyblock lets play back in the daym but i think the creator just got bored and quit it

[3:57:26] lxc1d65: Vanilla? cmonBruh
[3:57:27] continue_on: @EzraManning Mods are not vanilla unfortunately
[3:57:29] sorrowscythe: what do you want skyblock with only overworld? do you know how little content there would be
[3:57:31] tangelobreeze: 2 would be safer
[3:57:32] RonitG1204: monkaW
[3:57:34] zerixitybozo: DID SMANT BEAT DRAGON?
[3:57:37] grumpygrump77: @simplynullifed but there are only so many portals that can spawn
[3:57:37] supermembrane: for all of our purposes it functions as vanilla, but he is playing on the original skyblock map so this is the only way to get all advancements
[3:57:39] sniearrs: @zerixitybozo ye
[3:57:40] Mogswamp: like small chance it can die before the farm starts
[3:57:42] hogrider9787: using MODS in my VANILLA run?? smh unsubbing right now!!

[3:58:01] darkmoogaming: what happens if you fall off now
[3:58:03] simplynullifed: Easier said than done in my opinion
[3:58:08] continue_on: It's not a huge deal, he's playing in a way that WOULD BE vanilla, but it's not vanilla because it is modded
[3:58:09] Meep_Meep100: bro that looks like the 2b2t nether highways
[3:58:10] stinkytobybean43: when it hits itself it spawns a nother one

[3:58:21] EzraManning: @continue_on but the mod only does things you can do manually... just automatic... like originally skyblock was just deletint the world out to like 10k blocks
[3:58:21] thesillylittlefella: smant if you put  timer over the timer and have the timer be at two minutes, the viewers who were late to the stream would think that you're too good at minecraft
[3:58:22] smakdoodle: why do you use crying obsidian in the end?
[3:58:23] neonfalcon18: Hey everyone, what's happened so far this stream?

[3:58:55] iansonofthor_: lycelLuvSign
[3:58:55] continue_on: @ezra exactly, he's running modes to emulate vanilla, but it is not actually vanilla as it is modded. It's not a huge deal just semantics
[3:58:57] Whitebread112: smolChunkyrunky
[3:58:59] mmmckie1234: !bookshelves
[3:58:59] Nightbot: In a beta test build, the player would respawn with a stack of bookshelves, enchanting tables, end portal frames and end portal blocks so the devs could easily test their functions. That's why everything is built out of bookshelves and enchanting tables. smolWow
[3:58:59] usingername_: @sniearrs like that wr that got denied because there was a mod that prevented game crashing
[3:59:00] Lycel: no probl

[3:59:04] Britishpikachu: to block their shots at least
[3:59:04] thesillylittlefella: it sure would suck if a mod blocked this message.
[3:59:05] Smalls440: "When at less than half health, a shulker has a 25% chance of teleporting (as described above) after taking damage."

[5:01:50] tangelobreeze: someone said that in chat earlier
[5:01:52] thesillylittlefella: @SmallAnt name the second axolotl whopper
[5:01:54] grandpabadger: no it is 13
[5:02:01] SaggyTurbo: 7
[5:02:03] w_spell: Can someone explain to me how the shenanigans the last few days will connect with the existing skyblock world? (If at all?) Are we transferring items between worlds somehow or something?
[5:02:05] asdfsadfas23: it takes a random block in a 17√ó17√ó17 cuboid @SmallAnt
[5:02:05] mikr0wav3: 5-10 source: trustme bro
[5:02:06] SilentMystification: it can tp in a 17 block square with it at the center
[5:02:09] Metoisbak: wiki said 5-13 blocks away
[5:02:10] CallMeS1R_: Name the seocnd Woooooper
[5:02:12] grandpabadger: yes
[5:02:14] usingername_: dont think so
[5:02:16] CylusGamer: no
[5:02:17] quadr1tzel: the wiki said 10
[5:02:17] thesillylittlefella: yes
[5:02:18] khaosking6: no cause its half block
[5:02:18] CallMeS1R_: no, only the topoe
[5:02:18] thsgrn: are they top slabs or bottom slabs?
[5:02:23] skellez1: bottom slabs yes
[5:02:25] CallMeS1R_: only solid blocks
[5:02:26] thsgrn: shouldn't be able to teleport to the bottom half of a top slab
[5:02:27] E_Mints2008: yeah i guess
[5:02:27] michaelman3117: i don't think so
[5:02:30] usingername_: theyre not blocks so it cant work
[5:02:30] logmania: @w_spell we have already transferred everything, so we beat the end and have diamonds and other stuff
[5:02:35] CylusGamer: yes
[5:02:36] SilentMystification: yes they can
[5:02:36] thsgrn: bottom of bottom slabs yes I think so
[5:02:37] usingername_: Yes
[5:02:38] EuSouOFolha: the have to touch
[5:02:39] CallMeS1R_: no
[5:02:45] PyjamaMole: I think so
[5:02:47] CallMeS1R_: that is technically half a block
[5:02:48] sirliamothy: would trapdoors work?
[5:02:48] E_Mints2008: well try lucky
[5:02:49] Diggles11: I suggest building with soul sand, they cant teleport to that
[5:02:51] trolololowen: You're gonna have to build on both half blocks
[5:02:59] therealdinoboy: yes I think so cos shulkers can be upside down
[5:02:59] w_spell: @logmania thanks, I'll have to check the vod - I missed the last 4hours
[5:03:00] iansonofthor_: Shulkers generally remain stationary, attached to an adjacent block with a full face.
[5:03:11] SilentMystification: cursed full block
[5:03:13] Dusk5_: @w_spell he can use a dimension to store the items in, then as long as it doesnt get loaded it will keep the stuff for when he updates up, i think
[5:03:14] logmania: a fake full block
[5:03:14] EuSouOFolha: OH I GET IT
[5:03:15] iansonofthor_: @mischievouslittlegoober so not slabs
[5:03:21] Gruzba: you could do top slabs with pressure plates
[5:03:22] khaosking6: why
[5:03:28] SilentMystification: at least 69% sure
[5:03:31] EuSouOFolha: its a "middle" block
[5:03:31] CallMeS1R_: they can tp to any solid block surface, not to thje half bottom
[5:03:32] logmania: NOPERS not sure
[5:03:41] CatwithGatt: Are you gonna name the second axolotl?
[5:03:42] CapDeathWish: this is goofy and i'm here for it
[5:03:45] CallMeS1R_: they can spawn on "full blocks"
[5:03:48] Naburi22: how did he transfer the items between versions? I saw him getting the items but i was off when the transfer happened
[5:03:49] khaosking6: spawn proof != teleport proof
[5:03:58] stinkytobybean43: the sides
[5:03:59] E_Mints2008: slabs is much esier to econoum blocks
[5:03:59] mikr0wav3: it 17x17x17
[5:04:01] SilentMystification: button pressing boat ASMR
[5:04:03] logmania: @Naburi22 switching out nethers
[5:04:04] thesillylittlefella: @everyone who would win in a fight smolRunk or  smolChunkyrunky
[5:04:07] some_stupidusername: I‚Äôm back how does the farm work
[5:04:15] shay_tuna: is that vanilla?
[5:04:16] CallMeS1R_: spawn proof != tp proof
[5:04:21] sirliamothy: how limited are the nether and end?
[5:04:22] CapDeathWish: smant moves, the game: click sound effect x 9658792346952634987562
[5:04:34] Naburi22: i'll have to watch the vod it doesnt sound good hahahahahah
[5:04:40] logmania: vanilla+mods that make the game run not crappy
[5:04:42] turtle_1223: Smant is the third coin in the 2d subarea in the back of wooded kingdom still your favorite coin in smo?

[5:59:37] Dupletor: @supermembrane Here's the explanation: Chicken are made of Carbon, which is what Coal is made of. If you compress 200 chicken in a very small space, their Carbon is under so much pressure it becomes a Diamond, google about Coal under pressure that's what happens.

[6:02:24] immortaljelly_fish: don't question Ian his word is law.
[6:02:26] tybernation: afaik, the tl;dr of it is that the snow golems attacking it does no health damage, but still technically damages the shulker which can trigger it to shoot it's bullet so it duplicates  itself?
[6:02:27] trinityviolette: get it together tanner!!
[6:02:33] mister_bright_side: cant believe he wouldn‚Äôt mention that
