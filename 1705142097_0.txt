[0:48:06] Manacaym: gas turbines but you need better ingots for it

[0:51:41] Jaydepps00: whats the KappaPride solar panel?
[0:51:54] Zyie: @banshay3 Depends on how cold it gets basically as I understand it. So far, we've had a very warm winter (it's around 0c atm, normally it'd be -20c or more where I live around this time of year). If it stays unusually warm, we're fine. If it gets cold, we'll have issues afaik.

[2:33:26] PureSpider: asking for 100 and saying "stop making ingots when you only have 30 mb" is doing the opposite of what you want, isnt it?
[2:33:35] arkun_: @bobtaco21 ugh I don’t even want to think of that, people are already using it for malware
[2:33:41] NinjaMaster__: yall i get a phishing reminder like once a week because of the boomers i work with

[2:36:21] kane1941: storage just on the drawer?

[2:36:53] nellydocs: that rule does not apply to chinesium
[2:36:57] ShionSinX: like elevators, that have like 7 times the strength advertised (for max weight)

[2:38:19] IlsaGold: OMG thank you waffle
[2:38:27] frainsbreeze: i think i didn't understand what you did here. can you not do it so that the ingots are made only when you have 30 buckets?
[2:38:33] rododendro: @since the buffers are so large you should use a redstone controller for the machine
[2:38:39] PureSpider: you're trying to reach 100, but at the same time you're turning it into ingots
[2:38:59] Surge43: the ingots will backup at some point
[2:39:02] PureSpider: so you'll never reach 100, unless your liquid is coming in much faster
[2:39:22] PureSpider: okay gotcha
[2:39:39] PureSpider: making an amateur PID seqKEK
[2:39:45] 1killersquirrel: we need this system of buffers for so many other things, right?
[2:39:56] Cdup07: until it backs up you will only ever have less than or equal to 30 buckets, no?
[2:40:04] PureSpider: until you reach equilibrium, you'll burn a ton of energy
[2:40:18] PureSpider: @Cdup07 correct

[2:40:35] mrleonehart: @Giantwaffle I went to grab lunch real fast.....where's my capacitor bank wall

[3:57:35] IlsaGold: One for the main and two bi products?
[3:57:52] Sloppy_D: Its used in chemical refinement of gold right?
[3:58:21] JobTheConqueror: aqua regia is one of the acid that can dissolve noble metals, therefore called regia = royal
[3:58:35] KrunkleDunk: you need to gang up on the gold molecules to break it down.
[3:58:35] LethalBro: ThisIsFine
[3:58:39] b0ltz12: acids are all togethor confusing
[3:58:40] Rongoel: Its cause it the acids alone can only eat one part of the gold, so they run into a "wall" where it can no longer eat it. So mixing them helps break it
[3:58:41] BMYGRLFRND: if waffle wants to see a vidfeo about, that I have a link for a quick distraction
[3:58:49] LethalBro: ThisIsFine TeaTime
[3:58:52] IlsaGold: Also called Kings Water I think
[3:58:56] Sam_1443: you need to oxidize the gold atoms so they can be dissolved, thats why you need the nitric acid

[4:52:44] HKRage: I miss those minecraft college streams "Gotta dip to study for my EE exam"
[4:52:47] IlsaGold: True
[4:52:54] Garrett41: @PureSpider Nice I have 1 year left
[4:52:56] Gamernxc: thats usually why "mature" students do better in college
[4:52:56] Cirina_Felis: Education for me was learning how to learn and not really what I was learning
[4:53:01] bismarcksd: You're more dedicated to giving more money away. Kappa
[4:53:03] Glacial_Indifference: Highschool does not prepare kids properly.
[4:53:09] LucasLunatic: one of my professors got me my first job which launched my career, college is good for opportunities
[4:53:10] Quinnerdude1: learning how to learn
[4:53:10] GGinTheName: I think college is a good thing but it's not for everyone. I think today's society pushes it too hard on everyone and that's why so many people hate it
[4:53:14] IlsaGold: Prove yourself in getting it thrue
[4:53:19] PureSpider: Garrett41 hell yea :D i seriously considered a master's degree but couldnt be fucked doing another four projects and writing another thesis igaDead
[4:53:21] Garrett41: @Glacial_Indifference I completely agree with this
[4:53:23] NemesisXKL: @Quinnerdude1 this
[4:53:26] wagad: wagad subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 16 months! 
[4:53:29] aeadon: I went back in my 30s and it's soo much easier lmao
[4:53:31] loganpod2000: I just graduated as a civil engineer and my god I am happy I am done
[4:53:31] Maximus439: letMeCi
[4:53:34] frainsbreeze: its never late to go back to college if you wish that
[4:53:35] VikashPindoria: Would you go back ?
[4:53:37] tomey36: It also exposes you to many subjects
[4:53:43] Garrett41: @PureSpider Trust me LOL I thought about grad school too but I want someone else to pay for that
[4:53:43] Feist_: I went back after 20 years. 3.9 gpa and I was not a good student in high school
[4:53:47] LethalBro: Yeah I'm going out for some job experience to return to a CS BSc a stronger student
[4:53:50] banshay3: I went back and I'm getting absolutely destroyed
[4:53:55] Dizz1227: Almost stand time
[4:53:58] jayrickson87: you could teach a whole collage course on this mondpack
[4:54:00] ItzJord: signalim upgrades?
[4:54:00] darkskylegion: I truly think people shouldn’t go to college until 25. Give them time to breath after high school and get through their early 20s before they head off
[4:54:09] Banage: Are you still doing the draconic battery?
[4:54:15] Flobu_: what does sign in the power room say?
[4:54:15] Moobot: You can sub to Waffle by clicking this neat link -> twitch.tv/giantwaffle/subscribe SUBprise
[4:54:19] deadgolfer: vc?
[4:54:22] zynithtv: how much power does the assembly line take?
[4:54:24] john_wicks_beagle: leave it to future Waffle KEKW
[4:54:34] PureSpider: Garrett41 college/uni is mostly free in germany, minus administrative fees which is like 50 bucks a semester :D so money was thankfully not a concern, just that i decided 2.5 years of working experience is worth more than a master's
[4:54:42] GGinTheName: @darkskylegion The downside I see to this is you kind of get out of the groove of school and can start to forget the foundational knowledge necessary for a lot of college degrees
[4:54:50] OrangeW2: @darkskylegion I took effectively two years off, after what is secondary schooling here in the UK. i felt way better going into university than my university friends do even now in my last year
[4:54:59] Makaheehee: Its complicated. Kappa
[4:55:00] 1killersquirrel: but you wouldn't change the buffers LUL
[4:55:08] 1killersquirrel: to make more
[4:55:15] Garrett41: @PureSpider Most definitely, what do you do now ?
[4:55:16] WonderlandTru: !mc_pack
[4:55:16] Moobot: The December modpack, Nomifactory (GTCEu Port) is in full swing !!! | https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/nomi-ceu | The bois were unable to complete the pack in 2022. Will they be able to beat it by NYE 2023? Tune in to every stream to find out! pepeLaugh
[4:55:33] jdog0616: 45 mins teams call and i never unmuted

[4:55:41] jdog0616: but i can un mute waffle now!!
[4:55:46] TippletonJohn: But Pati fixed epoxy yesterday...  seqOk
[4:55:53] Garrett41: @PureSpider Nice, I want to go towards cyber security I think
[4:55:55] Amraki: past waffle meets future waffle
[4:56:05] lukasalbert: i made my first numismatic toady
[4:56:12] lukasalbert: its been 3 hour grind haha
[4:56:13] Sayiber: is there a limiter on that barrel_
[4:56:24] lukasalbert: now i can finally progress
[4:56:25] PureSpider: Garrett41 cyber security was one thing in the master's course that i was really interested in, but again, just not worth my time sadly :D
[4:56:48] frainsbreeze: throttle the iridium ingots to 100?
[4:56:55] 1killersquirrel: 56
[4:57:16] TippletonJohn: 56
[4:57:22] darkskylegion: @gginthename Yea I understand the knowledge drop off, but I know so many people who weren’t ready at 18 to take on the monster of college.
[4:57:25] DKJensen98: 56
[4:57:26] HonZoR: is the ruthium dust going down without bars going up?
[4:57:27] jdog0616: Com Sec is like a 20 year career move, so many certs required
[4:57:53] Foobaah: CiYouLater
[4:57:55] frainsbreeze: maybe make the thermal machine with the gear upgrade? it is a quest too
[4:58:24] darkskylegion: @orangew2 Yea I took off 2 years before heading in and I may have been an older person in class, but I felt more prepared.
[4:58:40] lukasalbert: its called something gear press or the like
[4:58:48] lukasalbert: i saw it earlier when making the gears
[4:58:55] GGinTheName: @darkskylegion That's fair. I personally haven't met many people who weren't ready for college but that might be because I go to a fairly prestigious school so most students here are pretty well prepared
[4:59:06] tomey36: Don’t forget to put the dust in the smelter
[4:59:08] ligerzerof: yes
[4:59:13] Saytos1: yes
[4:59:25] Cannonboot: @Giantwaffle so now you so far into the pack anything youd do differently ?
[4:59:25] Garrett41: @PureSpider I feel that, im excited for this to be done though
[4:59:27] 1killersquirrel: iridium i believe it's used in night vision devices
[4:59:33] ligerzerof: Ru atomic number 44, Ir is number 77
[4:59:48] Timiderxbox: Export bus is not set to argon?
[4:59:51] frainsbreeze: didn'T you have like 15000 buckets of argon yesterday?
[4:59:51] hisdue: algon YEP
[4:59:54] Gamernxc: think vaccuum freezer backed up
[5:00:21] lukasalbert: oof
[5:00:28] Naappletree: YEP
[5:00:29] lukasalbert: IV ?
[5:00:31] Saytos1: @Gamernxc waffleSmart
[5:00:37] Foobaah: more freezers Pog
[5:00:37] Purecrew: bigger import bus
[5:00:39] dennis3833: or LuV
[5:00:42] 1killersquirrel: about that
[5:00:44] DecoyOcelot: just increase the power
[5:00:46] CommanderUrsus: hot potato, hot potato
[5:00:57] jdude20202: p2p KEKW
[5:01:00] lukasalbert: might be worth instead of making a new one
[5:01:01] 1killersquirrel: that would be smart
[5:01:02] Banage: We have tons of extra powah
[5:01:04] Archie8300: are there extra freezers by the EBF hall?
[5:01:05] IlsaGold: Is there a large freezer?
[5:01:18] WARHERO322: Isnt the Vacuum Freezer running on P2P
[5:01:19] Silver_Skeeter: upgrade to more power
[5:01:24] john_wicks_beagle: !mc_pack
[5:01:24] Moobot: The December modpack, Nomifactory (GTCEu Port) is in full swing !!! | https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/nomi-ceu | The bois were unable to complete the pack in 2022. Will they be able to beat it by NYE 2023? Tune in to every stream to find out! pepeLaugh
[5:01:29] jayrickson87: the large freezer requires neotrunoim
[5:01:48] Zapper_777: so Power--> freZZar :D
[5:01:56] frainsbreeze: what is CI saying?
[5:01:57] Naappletree: ehhhh
[5:02:07] IAmJester: and then the highest is just "voltage voltage"
[5:02:08] cjthedjdolphin: Should of put ultra high before zero point honestly
[5:02:11] WARHERO322: you are still running on P2P on the freezer i think
[5:02:11] LethalBro: Ultimate+ rooH
[5:02:26] SolarisFall: Ultimate EX
[5:02:28] bandani: it should be EFBV even further beyond voltage
[5:02:28] Moobot: You can find Waffle's Youtube channel here - https://youtube.com/giantwaffle
[5:02:29] Auzze: no-one said there was going to be a test
[5:02:37] Foobaah: can you repeat that last sentence i was still writing the first one
[5:02:39] jdog0616: @cjthedjdolphin ya really zero point is too cool for anything to be above it
[5:02:46] teddiii_: where is ULV in that scale?
[5:02:51] BOLT_M4G1C: monkaS test?
[5:02:51] Sam_1443: since you are out of liquid helium it looks like that cooler will be forever backed up
[5:02:52] frainsbreeze: i thought you were making the thermal machine SADGE
[5:03:01] lukasalbert: ZPM is the highest tier of energy in Stargate
[5:03:05] lukasalbert: i wish it was the top haha
[5:03:24] GGinTheName: @Giantwaffle you finishing this pack is almost two weeks past the due date lol
