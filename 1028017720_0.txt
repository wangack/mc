[0:15:53] MediocreStream: Use quantum computer 4Head
[0:15:59] BurnedAether: Make a list saving the primes once you find them
[0:15:59] Apparentthreat: modular arithmetic
[0:16:10] Opsidill: Use the GCDs (greatest common divisors)
[0:16:15] AVeryDeliciousCake: you can use a quadratic sieve algorithm
[0:16:17] PureSpider: FUCK not a sub carvemRage
[0:16:18] TastiHam: dictionaries aren't supposed to be sorted
[0:16:18] Stillglade: bit shifting is fast
[0:16:30] Terminex19: @apparentthreat ^^^
[0:16:31] PureSpider: it's called "integer factorization", and a well known problem
[0:16:33] knowledge_within: sorted(dict, key=dict.get)
[0:16:34] AVeryDeliciousCake: @Giantwaffle you can use quadratic sieve algorithm
[0:16:34] Butterwhales: gcd algorithms are fun :)
[0:16:36] knowledge_within: something like that
[0:16:38] PureSpider: a sorted dictionary is a tree
[0:17:12] BurnedAether: @Giantwaffle sort the array not the dictionary
[0:17:15] Tabakhase: basics PauseChamp
[0:17:29] D_roi_D: so is your prime factor algo correct? and just the sorting is the problem?
[0:17:34] RedalousTheRed: do you need to sum the multiples of the prime factors? i.e. do you need to sum all 3 2's for 8? if so sets are your best friend
[0:17:45] CocoScruff: can you use a second array and push the key values in?
[0:18:12] Larklen: mamma mia
[0:18:30] 0x000000: you can limit up to number / 3, no need to go full list
[0:18:30] DoctorScorch: Oh, I remember this problem in engineer school
[0:18:43] ForgottenTime: cant you do the same thing but start at trhe square root

[0:20:08] DecoyOcelot: hello Waffle and chat
[0:20:20] Riddixdan: @Giantwaffle what if you use list instead of dict, where index would be the key in dict
[0:20:21] D_roi_D: it looks like those lists are not the same even unsorted
[0:20:21] RedalousTheRed: So if you get to the square root and you haven't found any prime factors, don't you just add the number to your list of primes?
[0:20:23] Strayer_J: probably an IEnumerable
[0:20:29] Strayer_J: that might have a .ToList
[0:20:35] TastiHam: @Syzygy50 he needs to list the prime factor of each number, so you still have to do it for every number no?

[0:21:35] BurnedAether: @Giantwaffle Or just make a list of all primes that fit into an int. It's not like they are going to change Kappa
[0:21:41] 0omkins: Chat not smooth brain apes?
[0:21:43] seismicshot: Could you generate a list of prime numbers up to the biggest input to only run your prime function once? that is what I would do
[0:21:50] Strayer_J: so essentially caching a list of primes
[0:22:17] JommyBee: waffle did you see zizaran is going to be a dad PogChamp
[0:22:18] Tabakhase: just ignore the square... while i * i <= primetestNumber...
[0:22:57] Kohta_Sama: peepoBlonket

[0:23:13] 0omkins: Prime Dick
[0:23:17] Va3lin: YEP dict
[0:23:24] Hazzarius_: Have you considered other checks for divisibility which can save time. For example summing all digits in a number and checking if that is divisble by 3
[0:23:43] D_roi_D: shortcut to that is to not give a default and check for None
[0:23:50] RedalousTheRed: list(dict.keys())
[0:23:54] Ebonmourn: yah
[0:23:56] theRealPoorcupine: yeah, dict.keys()
[0:24:00] rickitikki: isnt there a function in dictionary that just get all the keys as a list

[1:47:06] complexprotein: @Tawmcruize1994 It's doing great! COPIUM
[1:47:06] PSutchy: Another row of pistons at the top would push them all into the water instead of the top row falling down onto the sand
[1:47:07] Wetware: People do it in GTA and it looks silly LUL
[1:47:09] Orin_The_Sly: Does this pack have fans? For the excess Sugar Cane.
[1:47:09] TomWithTime: how is omnifactory feeling compared to other tech packs?
[1:47:10] masztufa: sprint jumping is at least 0.1% faster in every game
[1:47:28] slimpoke: @giantwaffle do you focus on a single crypto to mine, or do you change?
[1:47:31] Exerion09: Butcher knife gives extra wool
[1:47:38] masztufa: a blizz?
[1:47:38] CorSPACE: blitz
[1:47:39] kennycraig: that's blizz
[1:47:44] icprincess: I started sprint jumping back in morrowwind
[1:47:46] Robme2: I remenber satisfactory sliding
[1:47:53] Larklen: ppHop
[1:48:11] kennycraig: how are you liking the pack so far?
[1:48:14] daemonaedryn: Apex legends still has some of the best sliding I think
[1:48:15] masztufa: why was that bad? sliding is good
[1:48:34] CorSPACE: a sliding mod for MC would be epic
[1:48:36] masztufa: titanfall parkour > apex sliding
[1:48:40] Kevin_Blutklaue: Warframe sliding is also pretty cool
[1:48:47] daemonaedryn: @masztufa Fair fair YEP
[1:48:47] YeahThatFits: oh yea the screen shuffling
[1:48:50] Slymph: Theres a sheep bottom right corner Kappa
[1:48:52] Exerion09: The sheep are usually in town actually haha
[1:48:52] masztufa: but nothing compares to tribes
[1:48:54] Apparentthreat: wasn't that a basalz you Pepega s. not a snowy biome
[1:48:58] mooseysnoosey: Nothing beats snowrunner mud sliding
[1:49:02] Syzygy50: @giantwaffle What every happened to the satisfactory factory build w/soryan ?
[1:49:05] Larklen: @slimpoke you'll typically only focus on one crypto for a period of time. When profitability severely drops you can swap if you want. For now though, ETH still the most profitable for most GPU miners
[1:49:06] Vernash_: warframe speed makes my hands hurts >.<
[1:49:17] Tawmcruize1994: warframe hurts my pinky
[1:49:17] Moobot: Support Waffle by using his Epic creator code: Giantwaffle
[1:49:22] aundros: @Giantwaffle Think you might honestly love doing "it takes two" with someone waffle. Its amazing

[1:49:49] Venxuri: meteor?
[1:49:49] Stormflare: meaty orr
[1:49:49] Daforian17: where all the sheep women at?!
[1:49:52] Tawmcruize1994: meteor
[1:49:54] masztufa: tribes skiing is the best. Absolutely no friction and a jetpack on maps filled with smooth hills
[1:49:55] itsIffy: Metor :)
[1:49:59] TallicDragon: Could turn on mob icons in the minimap to help find sheep
[1:50:04] Larklen: @slimpoke thats where the research comes in and learning where/how to mine certain cryptos and how to determine your profitability if you wnt to get the most you can. Or you can just stick with ETH until it goes to ETH 2.0 which is in 2 to 999 months
[1:50:04] djfrankfurter: shazbot Sadge
[1:50:06] Mike190Twitch: Meteor? what about Meteand?
[1:50:12] dabeda1: i miss tribes every day

[1:50:17] PureSpider: meaty aunt?
[1:50:20] Xraxxus: jesus fuck I miss that game
[1:50:26] Bow_Shock: Man I was looking for a meteor for at least 2h and you find one just like that
[1:50:28] Traupick: tribes zoooooooomin\
[1:50:36] shankupotamus: lol what about GunZ
[1:50:38] Larklen: I was always obsessed with wall/shield placement for some reason
[1:50:41] daemonaedryn: I never heard about it until you showed it on stream LUL
[1:50:43] masztufa: tried to get back into T:A in a month, but hackers run the servers now
[1:50:44] Skarpis: Oh yeah, Tribes Vengeance
[1:50:45] Ebonmourn: If mobs can spawn in the void whats the point in building there vs in the overworld @Giantwaffle ?
[1:50:47] Bolt_Vanderhuge_: there's a game on steam called Jetball that's trying to do what tribes did. feels very faithful to the original
[1:50:48] slimpoke: @Larklen I thought we couldnt mine ETH 2.0?
[1:50:53] CozyHawk: was i the only one to play the first Abes Odysee game ?
[1:50:55] Shaggy_Lives: imagine if meteor came from meaty ore
[1:50:57] Exerion09: You can buy sheep with coins
[1:51:01] PureSpider: titanfall is just offline apex 4Head
[1:51:06] Traupick: i remember going like 400km
[1:51:09] Entrymissing: quake 3 rocket arena was also insane movement wise
[1:51:09] Mike190Twitch: WTB Meaty Ore
[1:51:11] Degenerate: i cant remember which one it was but it was either tribes 1 or 2 that i liked
[1:51:13] Bow_Shock: Oh man tribes ascended was sooooo good, the movement was 400IQ all times
[1:51:15] Traupick: 400kph missingh every shot
[1:51:16] DrHax_: every open world game I play I keep thinking "man this would be nice with the tribes hover jets" Sadge
[1:51:16] masztufa: tribes vengeance is still a thing i think, just that everyone playing is a literal god
[1:51:18] Larklen: @slimpoke yeah, which is exactly why you'd stick with ETH until 2.0 comes out in terms of mining.
[1:51:21] Yomaice: @giantwaffle can you not turn on friendly mobs in the map?
[1:51:25] Exerion09: buy a sheep with omnicoins
[1:51:45] Mike190Twitch: Sheep Spawn Egg, gives 2 i think
[1:51:46] DecoyOcelot: you can buy spawn eggs
[1:51:51] daemonaedryn: pepeLaugh dont forget the game will always hide whatever you are trying to find
[1:51:54] Venxuri: breed them :3
[1:52:02] richie385: Could there be wool in building or cobwebs that could be turned into wool
[1:52:07] madseed15: why dont u have flight yet Kappa
[1:52:13] slimpoke: oh roger, does it matter which wallet you use? there's quite a few options
[1:52:18] Mike190Twitch: no end game armor yet? GOSH Kappa
[1:52:37] DecoyOcelot: should get a grapple hook, best way to travel
[1:52:44] realCulprit: trust wallet gang
[1:52:45] Larklen: yeah either metamask or you can use your preferred exchange as your wallet so you dont need to transfer it. Lots of choice
[1:52:47] MasterKraft: what a great road for a minecart and boosters
[1:52:49] PureSpider: metamask ftw
[1:52:52] DecoyOcelot: or most fun way anyway
[1:52:55] Larklen: KEKW
[1:52:56] just_a_jao: You can get string from web inside builts
[1:52:58] Shaggy_Lives: my metamask wont log on in my opera browser anymore
[1:53:02] daemonaedryn: No spidermaning Sadge
[1:53:06] Stormflare: ppHop
[1:53:10] JarmoEST: no glider KEKW
[1:53:13] CorSPACE: 1.17 pre releases should be out soon, the latest snapshot was another bugfix one
[1:53:19] Venxuri: if you make it send out just 1 hook, I think you can sneak click to change the settings
[1:53:20] drewzerTV: when using the scanner, what colors indicate iron veins?
[1:53:23] Venxuri: you can grapple the ground
[1:53:27] Kilowatt31: buy two sheep an make sheep farm
[1:53:34] Shantrix: sure
[1:53:46] just_a_jao: I think will be easier get string and make wool

[1:54:10] Surge43: Step 1: buy sheep Step 2: Profit

[1:54:30] DecoyOcelot: you get so many quarters from the endgame tab for like free
[1:54:36] Just_Walter: Did you see the Atlas launch ?

[3:36:14] Venxuri: between 10 and 40
[3:36:27] decentfarts: @Giantwaffle you would just use them at home like for stream and stuff.
[3:36:33] decentfarts: or quiet places
[3:36:37] DrHax_: I always get some weird pressure in my ears when I use closed headphones so open ones are the only I want to use
[3:36:39] JommyBee: Larklen did you ride the rollarcoaster

[3:37:38] Larklen: Should definitely notify the person, but definitely something they can do
[3:37:48] CantTouchDisNow: you dont get any ad revenue anyways do you?
[3:37:49] TimmyVRC: were they just making too much money off revenue?
[3:37:52] Kuroiorb: agree @Larklen
[3:37:58] L96x: @TheInsightNetwork  lol for real, good old days so sad time flies
[3:37:58] wr1th3: anyone who thinks that someone deserves to get punished for doing what the platform allows is abolutely crazy
[3:38:00] YaseenDIY: waffle do you have plans on going back and finishing your degree at all?
[3:38:00] Blazedude99: @TimC i don't think twitch said, but its assumed cause her content is lewd
[3:38:04] decentfarts: more than $5?
[3:38:06] Litefox007: the problem is they do stuff like this without explanations
[3:38:08] macchete: it might have been the advertisers telling twitch to pull the ads
[3:38:09] lasarian: @TimC nope, because they disagree with her content
[3:38:13] Stegmurmulis: do me some ads Kreygasm
[3:38:15] DrHax_: can twitch also just willy nilly change your partner tier?

[3:38:40] YaseenDIY: i feel you
[3:38:40] Killpimm: what degree is waffle doing? Computer science?
[3:38:41] Drobotic: you need your degree for that
[3:38:41] RussianRainbowTV: if you run midrolls it gets rid of preroll ads which is huge IMO
[3:38:44] d0peinc: do you like home automation @Giantwaffle ?
[3:38:45] wr1th3: college is a scam for programmers/computer scientists
[3:38:54] TheInsightNetwork: @l96x I miss the podcast dude
[3:38:56] Late20sWhiteGuy: I bet you don't actually need to finish your degree for that
[3:39:00] phoenixxua: you don't need degree. you need practice
[3:39:01] TheIrishGuy: its just hard to get it
[3:39:01] Larklen: Degree or experience pretty much
[3:39:01] decentfarts: @d0peinc i do
[3:39:03] Mrtastybottom1: start an only fans tbh
[3:39:05] Vovosunt: Go to Europe, get degree here LUL

[3:39:06] LordDynom: Need? No. Should? yes.
[3:39:11] JommyBee: how much on your degree did u have left?
[3:39:11] Red_Legion: in IT it's not so much what you know, it's WHO you know
[3:39:14] JommyBee: if u did go back
[3:39:16] ZukaZamam3e: honestly, the more projects you can show off, the better
[3:39:16] Surge43: degrees pass the resume screeners
[3:39:17] DeadeyeWolff: Definitely need to know some one
[3:39:18] Killpimm: started my masters just before corona started. New citiy and dont know anyone for over a year now....
[3:39:19] Ace_Runn3r: My professor gave me a job so I wont complain about collage
[3:39:19] Zunderz: i dont have a degree and i work
[3:39:25] JacobSolo: You def don't need a degree to get an developer job  Source: I have a CS degree and have hired plenty of people without one
[3:39:26] Shuetox: i dont have a degree but i programmed since i was 12 and was lucky to get in contact with some people that could refer me
[3:39:29] lasarian: easier to get foot in door? yes need? no
[3:39:29] SoapGuy: A portfolio and projects will go farther than a degree
[3:39:30] Ace_Runn3r: college
[3:39:34] Sup4545: Been turned down by two this month because I am not done with my bachalers. The nice ones you do need it
[3:39:35] decentfarts: @Giantwaffle work towards getting like a C# certificate or something
[3:39:38] JimTheShark: You definitely don't need a degree to get a dev job. You just need to have a good github and use hackerrank to get recruited from.
[3:39:40] n8level: it may be tough moving into some kind of lead/managing role, not having a degree - its silly but so are industry certs imo. Its just an easy way for admin to approve  pay rates
[3:39:41] d0peinc: @decentfarts if you like home automation and python and playing around look at Home Assistant (hass.io) and a rasp pi
[3:39:45] Tenkaichi500: you definitely dont need a degree. i was offered 2 entry jobs when i didnt know any programming. Didn't accept because i was in the middle of my 2nd year of college
[3:39:49] wr1th3: @JacobSolo you hiring? lmao
[3:39:56] L96x: @TheInsightNetwork  id give all my crypto gains to go back lol
[3:40:00] Tabakhase: na just means code
[3:40:05] Tabakhase: job or not noone cares
[3:40:06] Luvan_: I have a degree in product design but am a self-taught front-end dev. no degree needed
[3:40:10] FingerGames: just tell them you can make pizza EZ
[3:40:11] ZukaZamam3e: so long as you know the fundamentals and get an interview, you should be ok
[3:40:15] Kroggie: I don’t have a degree and I work as a system developer
[3:40:17] Venxuri: long tunnel underground will be useful for other things later
[3:40:18] CantTouchDisNow: KEKW experience requirements for a programming job
[3:40:18] decentfarts: @d0peinc I have. It is neat, but having to pay for the $5/mo could sync is not cool
[3:40:19] Stegmurmulis: I have job experience but no diploma! KEKW
[3:40:22] Tabakhase: they just dont want to TEACH you python, its a job not a school
[3:40:22] Myekos: they'll put you through a programming test
[3:40:23] Kuroiorb: you can also mention the projects you've worked on aka game dev stuff
[3:40:26] Tenkaichi500: KEKW
[3:40:38] decentfarts: look. there is nothing like horny programming @Giantwaffle
[3:40:40] BobPatience: 🔦
[3:40:44] Slasher0915: portfolio doesn't matter
[3:40:48] SeniorSmiles22: SeniorSmiles22 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 13 months! pepeSmoke
[3:40:54] Joshuapetch: LUL
[3:40:55] TheInsightNetwork: @l96x lol yeah but waffles beard is immaculate lol
[3:40:57] Stoods_: Im working on my cs degree in Austin, but all the internships want experience which is ironic
[3:41:00] Tenkaichi500: sheeesh
[3:41:00] Myekos: I knew a guy that worked there
[3:41:01] Killpimm: the references gotta be somewhat decent tho, and getting into decent companys without some official qualification is definetly harder. Also career tajectory is limited
[3:41:03] Exerion09: URGETN
[3:41:07] JacobSolo: Austin is a great place for tech jobs
[3:41:08] JimTheShark: Wow not showing us your porn folder?

[3:41:42] s_DeXTeR_s: sadKEK
[3:41:44] dasmako: and other things too. we use it at my job to contract things out
[3:41:47] DatoPotatoDato: im desperately looking for freelancing experience rn
[3:41:48] Tenkaichi500: my profs told me about upwork for art too
[3:41:48] Larklen: @s_dexter_s that emote isnt enabled here lol
[3:41:50] PureSpider: you sell yourself soooooo grossly under value on upwork, no matter what your value is
[3:41:56] SchroTN: Sounds more fun than the new cyber security director at the pipeline company
[3:41:58] Protonmat: In Fucking Argentina we earn like 12k a year ( Im a SSR Software Eng )All because we are from LATAM
[3:42:01] s_DeXTeR_s: @Larklen sadKEK
[3:42:04] dasmako: yea upwork is super undervalued. only good if youre in other countries IMO
[3:42:08] decentfarts: @Giantwaffle having a project to work on is always better for me learning instead of doing it for nothing
[3:42:16] dasmako: YEP exactly
[3:42:19] dasmako: i feel bad tho
[3:42:32] DatoPotatoDato: is upwork really worth looking into for experience in the u.s?
[3:42:32] realbobmaster: Contributing to open source also looks good
[3:42:34] Venxuri: a diamond vein would be Pog for you right now
[3:42:40] TheInsightNetwork: @l96x i wonder how bacon is doing last time I saw him he has a kid and was losing a lot of weight

[3:43:50] CommanderRudolph: From what I can gather the Uraninite ore spawns between y 10 and y 40, and is quite rare down there.
[3:43:59] TheInsightNetwork: @l96x ohh most definitely he had come back once and said if the yeah accusation thing where to work out he'd come back
[3:44:03] JacobSolo: Side projects can be a great substitute for traditional 'work experience' IMO
[3:44:12] sccrfreak: There are gregtech diamond veins. Best way to find is to use double range upgrade in scanner after buying with coins
[3:44:13] decentfarts: maybe just never found a big vein of diamond then
[3:44:38] Deadfox74: Is there a better tool for you to mine with?
[3:44:40] decentfarts: @Giantwaffle yeah. buy some gregtech diamond blocks to scan to find more
[3:44:46] Exerion09: You can print diamonds with the Simulation mod
[3:44:52] Wild_Pachi: for now monkaS

[3:49:28] devast95: poe2 was the chance for them to rebuild the game from the ground up and make it better, but sadly most of the game mechanics and loot is just getting copied over from poe
[3:49:28] kskskskskskskssss: hides in SSF
[3:49:34] Wetware: "RLI" - Repetitive Loot Injury? LUL
[3:49:34] WilliamWeist: found the dude who doesnt play SSF

[3:49:57] DaGMC: EFT uses IRL BTC, IRL uses EFTs GPU Lootspawn Kappa
[3:50:03] DrHax_: the "POE 2 will fix everything" mentality is gonna be the same shit as with the Source 2 update for Dota 2
[3:50:06] WilliamWeist: 2 week, how old is the game ?
[3:50:08] Venxuri: what is SSF
[3:50:10] DrHax_: it wont fix everything
[3:50:11] LordAzio: whats ssf
[3:50:14] HostileLogOut: @Giantwaffle the game was never made for SSF.
[3:50:18] slumberproject: solo self found
[3:50:24] Venxuri: oke
[3:50:26] lasarian: @Giantwaffle also even if the "tRuE GaMe mOdE" is SSF its FUCKING impossible to learn how to craft or half the systems
[3:50:32] Venxuri: thanks @slumberproject
[3:50:42] JommyBee: COPIUM
[3:50:47] Wild_Pachi: COPIUM this time ill drop a mirror
[3:50:51] Larklen: COPIUM they still have next time
[3:50:57] DrHax_: it upsets me so much how the GGG idea of crafting is just fucking gambling
[3:50:57] Moobot: You can sub to Waffle by clicking this neat link -> twitch.tv/giantwaffle/subscribe
[3:50:58] Larklen: COPIUM PoE 2 will fix it
[3:51:01] BobPatience: !soon
[3:51:03] TimmyVRC: the only way to realistically learn all the crafting systems is if you played from day one lol
[3:51:03] Atum123: poe2 will fix everything COPIUM
[3:51:04] Slymph: Snowrunners PogChamp
[3:51:04] Dexal0: Dexal0 subscribed with Prime.

[3:51:05] HostileLogOut: @lasarian false. the crafting system is easy to learn.
[3:51:07] Fimbululfr: still a bit salty about the launch
[3:51:08] complexprotein: Each league is the equivalent of "Don't look at the man behind the curtain"
[3:51:09] Wetware: in a co-dependant relationship with your software publisher
[3:51:10] devast95: sound just like every new wow expanions "maybe this will be the one"
[3:51:14] omar_i_: after snowrunner hot tub strean?
[3:51:14] lasarian: @HostileLogOut wrong dude
[3:51:14] L96x: have you heard of Lost Ark its kinda like poe but not really
[3:51:23] DrHax_: just like Dota 2 source 2 fixed everything, yeah KEKW
[3:51:23] TimmyVRC: i lost interest in PoE because they just keep adding new shit and I get so lost

[3:51:34] shankupotamus: woah thats dope
[3:51:36] HostileLogOut: @lasarian nope. thats why so many people uses it to make the best items. its simple AF
[3:51:42] shankupotamus: When did this modpack come out?
[3:51:49] lasarian: @HostileLogOut literally wrong. there isn't a single in game resource to teach you how any of the systems work
[3:51:54] lasarian: @HostileLogOut i didn't say its bad
[3:52:11] shankupotamus: Might have to give it a go
[3:52:12] D_Roxxxx: Any Snow Runner today chat?
[3:52:13] DaGMC: when can we expect a mc mod made by waffle?
[3:52:27] lasarian: @HostileLogOut the prior knogledge required to do anything in poe makes it tedious
[3:52:29] HostileLogOut: @lasarian also false. there is. it tells you how to use it. and how it works. just not giving you all the details cause they want you to learn.
[3:52:41] Slymph: @DaGMC When you have enough crypto to pay for it KEKW
[3:52:47] DrHax_: "want you to learn" aka want you to gamble
[3:53:06] qerutar: i love when you scan while you are in a vein and you get flashbanged
[3:53:09] HostileLogOut: @lasarian if you want a game to give you everything for no effort. play Diablo 3 or World of warcraft ngl.
[3:53:16] TimmyVRC: eve online? Kappa
[3:53:21] ThatOnneGuy: I just hate having to go to youtube for literally every game I play these days
[3:53:22] lasarian: @HostileLogOut its not putting in effort
[3:53:27] HostileLogOut: it is.
[3:53:30] n8level: I do not want to spend half my time on a wiki or youtube viewing to learn how to use an obtuse mod/game ymmv
[3:53:34] mephisto__ttv: yeah. never gonna play PoE cause of the entry level Giantwaffle
[3:53:35] Quinnerdude1: pepeSmoke
[3:53:48] HostileLogOut: hence why Escape from tarkov is so fun.
[3:53:50] DaGMC: @Slymph I just have 0.00237087 btc will this be enough?!
[3:53:53] HostileLogOut: cause you learn from playing the game.
[3:54:05] DuckyBert: half the fun is to make the modpack not crash
[3:54:06] GSBressan: So.... have you ever played Dwarf Fortress?! LUL
[3:54:20] JommyBee: this is alot of gold
[3:54:30] DrHax_: not to mention "Budget Starter builds" just have 40ex in your stash 4Head
[3:54:34] sccrfreak: Banded iron viens are the best @Giantwaffle
[3:54:40] GSBressan: That's a game you have to put a LOT into learning
[3:54:40] Venxuri: widePepeLaugh yes
[3:54:46] lasarian: @HostileLogOut you literally don't you learn from zizaran and watching youtube, there is 0 resource in game to teach you how to play the game
[3:54:47] Slymph: @DaGMC He is not that cheap susHmm
[3:54:55] Tapeman83: you will use all that gold

[3:55:03] Doomwyte: mathil effect LUL
[3:55:11] thomasausen: how far are you from automated recource generation ?
[3:55:14] Webvidaddict: games where you have to look up how to play isn't fun for new players or people watching on twitch
[3:55:14] dabeda1: Ngahamus
[3:55:17] s_DeXTeR_s: yes
[3:55:18] Tapeman83: long @thomasausen
[3:55:18] HostileLogOut: @lasarian i dont watch them to learn imao. i play the game to learn.
[3:55:21] Wild_Pachi: hateforge went from a few chaos to a mirror
[3:55:21] n8level: @GSBressan I watched one video from Quill18 on DF - never had to go look something up after that, thought it was reasonable considering how byzantine DF is SeriousSloth
[3:55:24] DuckyBert: thats a big vein
[3:55:32] s_DeXTeR_s: its was ngmaus axe
[3:55:45] s_DeXTeR_s: 6l went from 30c to 4ex
[3:55:50] PureSpider: mjölnir?
[3:55:51] complexprotein: Yea someone made a video of that axe being able to do a double COC build
[3:55:52] lasarian: @HostileLogOut i mean if you want to casually struggle through as a new player, then sure
[3:55:57] Atum123: no
[3:55:59] s_DeXTeR_s: no its
[3:56:03] Red_Legion: wasnt mathil, just a random guy
[3:56:04] DrHax_: wait nghamus axe in this day and age
[3:56:05] GSBressan: @n8level I'm too hyped for the steam version
[3:56:10] s_DeXTeR_s: Cyclon CoC BB/BF
[3:56:15] Red_Legion: happened to blow up on reddit though

[3:56:27] Warkless: So large and veiny
[3:56:29] TimmyVRC: huge veins Kreygasm
[3:56:33] Exerion09: could be a double vein
[3:56:33] wr1th3: YEP COC
[3:56:34] HostileLogOut: @lasarian never struggle. only having fun. because its interesting to learn. instead of having that hand out mental thing going on
[3:56:36] JommyBee: it is long and thick too
[3:56:36] DuckyBert: it has some height too i think
[3:56:38] JommyBee: pepeLaugh

[3:56:50] n8level: @GSBressan cant wait to see bay12games get the financial windfall they deserve
[3:56:50] DrHax_: those essence flame blast builds look super chill, but I cant be assed to reroll ResidentSleeper
[3:56:59] s_DeXTeR_s: Headhunter is 158ex
[3:57:01] DrHax_: *essence mod
[3:57:05] GSBressan: @n8level exactly! <3
[3:57:23] CommanderRudolph: I know this pack is quite complex and all, but mining out a chunk like this for materials is hella satisfying
[3:57:42] s_DeXTeR_s: Hateforge Glovs went from ~4ex to 141.8ex in 3 days

[3:58:35] CoolReal: If you are in the mood then go for it
[3:58:39] LordDynom: COPIUM
[3:58:46] lasarian: @HostileLogOut i want the ability to effeciently progress through a game at a reasonable pace with adequate time, thought, and skill. PoE instead decides that you must have grandfathered knowledge and seek information outside of the game in order to do so.
[3:58:52] d0peinc: there is a stack hanging there
