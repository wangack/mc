[1:16:33] dabananananana: All art has meaning if you BS confidently enough
[1:16:48] ReaperBuildsRC: Art is open to interpretation...the eye of the Beer holder as they say.
[1:16:52] fufie_32: That needs clipping

[2:08:50] Liamblie: you actually have a decent scottish accent, coming from a scottish person
[2:08:52] Chilari: if he moved to leicester, he's not from leicester
[2:09:02] dampishwheat430: Andy has been to the end and back
[2:09:11] gandduh: Hello renjamin!
[2:09:16] Liamblie: ive heard worse lol
[2:09:22] mayfire1900: @nuno_the_kitter üëã

[2:09:58] Underaverage08: thats not hard to do
[2:09:59] DeltaicZap: Well go on then

[2:10:25] leanimal7: depends on the american you're trying to copy lol
[2:10:27] zayplayz411: Well now I need to hear the American accent
[2:10:27] emmaleth2003: it depends on the American-some find it hilarious
[2:10:29] Pentaract: bo'ol o
[2:10:34] rathgar1843: except for a few words here and there your current accent is fairly american
[2:10:36] gandduh: @hugelunatic south african
[2:10:46] kiqipper: Bolowater
[2:10:46] Pentaract: bo'ol o' wo'o'
[2:11:11] Chilari: How do you rate Andy Serkis's South African accent in Black Panther?
[2:11:25] w0bbelb0b: Just the sud afrikaan
[2:11:26] VogelVrouw: yeah the south african accent seems quite subtle but very specific
[2:11:27] summerflower1234: andy serkis is brilliant
[2:11:29] dmreins: honestly, as an American, I will say that we're pretty good at getting offended by anything and everything, generally speaking.
[2:11:49] gandduh: Baddel of wadar
[2:11:50] VogelVrouw: boo o wa a
[2:11:51] leanimal7: When I 1st heard a South African accent, it took me a second to wrap my head around
[2:11:51] YoMummaClaire: lol
[2:11:57] kiqipper: That genuinely makes me sad
[2:12:01] Pentaract: oh my god I keep seeing those pillager banners misaligned. please ren straighten them out :C
[2:12:10] dampishwheat430: kinda like Xisuma's accent
[2:12:41] kiqipper: @pentaract same!
[2:12:44] summerflower1234: yes
[2:12:45] VogelVrouw: yess
[2:12:46] Liamblie: yes!
[2:12:47] bigheadface: I can never tell if someone is from S. Africa or New Zealand unless they straight up tell me
[2:12:48] Cahila3617: I find it funny as a new Zealander people in the uk think I'm either from Australia or South Africa, I find it more funny than offensive as I work retail and get the question all the time
[2:12:49] rxhector: awww c'mon, i ceensored that
[2:12:49] kiqipper: Yes!
[2:12:50] miss_gvs: Yes please
[2:12:51] okiedokiecrisco: oh boy
[2:12:58] UltimateWager: Dude. Jono totally has a SoCal accent, it's hilarious.
[2:13:03] Moobot: Hieroglyphics are not an acceptable way to communicate anymore. (@zayplayz411) (warning)
[2:13:08] DoIDare: I love the South African accent
[2:13:11] MissMoni71: Some americans can get overly offended over things. I wouldn't worry too much about it...lol.
[2:13:22] okiedokiecrisco: it sounds .... roughly the same?
[2:13:32] zayplayz411: yes!
[2:13:37] bigheadface: @MissMoni71 I can't believe you'd say something like that
[2:13:50] Chilari: Accents are weird. My partner was born in the UK but has a Jamaican half brother, and can barely understand him even though he's used to the Britishified Jamaican accents of his UK-based Jamaican relatives
[2:14:00] colt_heart: it sounds like youve taken the RP british out of your voice lol
[2:14:12] w0bbelb0b: The tree?
[2:14:25] MissMoni71: @bigheadface i am an american, and have had my head bit off over lil thangs...so yea...lol.
[2:14:25] gandduh: You sound like ren to me lol
[2:14:30] miss_gvs: Missed the entire accent through the ads lol
[2:14:46] VogelVrouw: there was def a difference
[2:14:49] summerflower1234: lol Ren you still sound the same to me
[2:14:51] Cahila3617: I've recently re watched the 3rd life series and loved all the accents you put on ren it made me laugh so much
[2:14:57] Liamblie: i could hear the difference but mostly quite similar
[2:15:03] bigheadface: @MissMoni71 (pssst) that was a joke
[2:15:09] okiedokiecrisco: could hear it more on certain words, like "here", but it was pretty much the same to my american ears
[2:15:16] tarrantking289: its 4 FOUR off the water
[2:15:26] art_by_sam: it was a bit sharper tonally when you were speaking with the accent than without, but you sounded roughly similar to me, tbh
[2:15:27] dampishwheat430: The Tango impression was great though.
[2:15:30] smartypaints: I grew up in the middle of nowhere near Abilene TX. I have a THICK accent that is dulled from living on the TX coast. when I‚Äôm around family it comes back with a vengeance.
[2:15:31] MissMoni71: @bigheadface d'oh! Lol rdtvDerp
[2:15:34] w0bbelb0b: Just dutch to me
[2:15:35] jamienicole7775: The word here was different
[2:15:35] SimplySuvi: I could tell a slight difference at the end of your words
[2:15:48] MoonGuyyy_: hi Ren!
[2:15:49] summerflower1234: you were always the farmer.
[2:15:50] california_moon: I could tell the difference... mi or but its there... especially right at the end
[2:15:52] cezero11: your accent is the same, but it's the inflections and rhythm that are different
[2:15:54] Z3R0TR0N: no I love making farms.
[2:15:55] Rose_The_Bookworm: oh I love doing farms
[2:15:56] AshTheBlackCat: No, I love Minecraft farming!
[2:15:59] UltimateWager: "Basic Symmetry" is right up there with "Ren Dingo" in the hierarchy of Hermits.
[2:16:00] lastjaybird: No they're fun!
[2:16:00] GhostPandaLif: Love farms and fishing
[2:16:05] pj_in_the_loops: Theres something old timey about it - farming those crops
[2:16:09] mayfire1900: No love to male farms
[2:16:11] tushka1512: I like farming & fishing
[2:16:14] skellyelly28: Farms are relaxing to make
[2:16:14] AshTheBlackCat: Yup farms and fishing
[2:16:26] mayfire1900: Make
[2:16:33] SnugInTheSun: Same, I love making farms and farming the crops
[2:16:36] dampishwheat430: advancement for breaking a diamond hoe right
[2:16:37] summerflower1234: I think plants are cool. add more!
[2:16:39] DeltaicZap: Wish they'd add corn, would love to have a corn maze
[2:16:49] california_moon: Also, water irrigates 4 out in every direction... so the next one down the line should be 9 away
[2:16:50] MissMoni71: I'd love to get more things to grow...and make vines grow fruit & veggies too
[2:16:51] VogelVrouw: yeah
[2:17:00] lastjaybird: Gimme some tomatoes and corn
[2:17:05] emmaleth2003: nah everyone would find some reason to complain about new vegetables
[2:17:09] Cahila3617: I love farms in minecraft and love automating them, I learnt how to do a sugarcane and bamboo and it is now going to be my main one
[2:17:17] summerflower1234: well we should be able to put potatoes together with steak and carrots and have a meal
[2:17:19] OrganicOma: Vegan options!!  LOL!!
[2:17:21] Kurstles: Why can't we get a couple new veggies so we can craft salads?
[2:17:25] mayfire1900: Grapes would be fun broccoli ü•¶
[2:17:26] sporeblossom: golden carrots r good though
[2:17:28] Oswald080: rutabaga
[2:17:39] art_by_sam: i agree! I've been wanting it forever but the veggie foods are just not great compared to the saturation of the meat items :/
[2:17:44] MissMoni71: Squid should give calamari & bats should give bat wings (potion ingredient)
[2:17:45] okiedokiecrisco: oooo ren have you tried tempeh??
[2:17:46] gandduh: add nuts?
[2:17:47] mcsallie: you can alternate your crop rows for faster growth
[2:17:49] mayfire1900: üçå
[2:17:53] juleoc: lol soyboy Ren confirmed
[2:17:54] Cahila3617: Mangos in the mangroves

[2:17:58] sporeblossom: strawberry bushes :o
[2:18:00] hugelunatic: soybeans so we can make tofu
[2:18:01] summerflower1234: mangoes are my favourite
[2:18:01] VogelVrouw: i'm vegetarian but i honestly dont care in games, i would love more options tho
[2:18:06] Krazy_E: that last row of dirt is too far from water
[2:18:10] smartypaints: geez, I e wanted palm trees in the game for ever.
[2:18:12] DeltaicZap: @bjornar97 genius
[2:18:12] w0bbelb0b: More cooking recepties
[2:18:13] rosette_prism: mangoes would be jungle I think
[2:18:13] MoonGuyyy_: Ren I had a question... Why are you never active in your discord anymore? XD
[2:18:15] jamienicole7775: Rice?
[2:18:19] zayplayz411: Mangos tango

[2:19:45] summerflower1234: love hot chocolate
[2:20:08] w0bbelb0b: Coconuts on palm trees near warm oceans... With the possibility to drop and harm
[2:20:17] MissMoni71: Shrimp and /or lobster to fish out of the oceans would be cool
[2:20:17] zayplayz411: tea
[2:20:23] art_by_sam: ooo like stalactites :0 i love that as a mechanic
[2:20:24] Bjornar97: Hot chocolate could then shave a few seconds off poison, to make it useful too, since it has milk in it :)
