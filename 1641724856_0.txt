[5:01:09] pharfignewtn: every 5 have a different block?
[5:01:11] SummersSalt: Holy fuck Joel lmao
[5:01:11] Sevati: yea use a second type of block for counting
[5:01:11] luciiferous: yes agreed!
[5:01:13] AnnaTheWitch_: so its how many blocks atm??
[5:01:14] Arc_insanity: you can use the coordinates to measure the number of blocks
[5:01:15] Thelothuo: or 10th if you're only placing every second block
[5:01:18] SummersSalt: This is gonna be so big
[5:01:18] ArtIsArt: Put a different color every 5.

[5:06:42] Sevati: math? wats that
[5:06:49] NBeeMC: then 1
[5:06:49] Thelothuo: @Nosredna_ obv, it's way faster than teaching someone how to make ANY size on their own via process
[5:06:53] plasticsinue: you also are gonna need to take into account that the mushroom head is gonna be many times bigger than the trunk
[5:06:58] AnnaTheWitch_: it aint me man, i do walkthroughs not math
[5:07:03] aquamarineispro: HELLO
[5:07:12] ArtIsArt: Use this as the head.
