[2:46:06] rodg88: any two bees make babbees
[2:46:30] 3v1lc0w: in the original version they were called "Spelling As" NODDERS
[2:46:44] darth_baggins: Rythian "Stop it I'm bees" should know all about bees!
[2:46:48] HoboWith2Shotguns: you need to right click both of them with a flower
[2:46:55] HoboWith2Shotguns: campfire
[2:47:01] Gold__Kai: campfire
[2:47:06] Dargon_____: You can use a dispenser instead
[2:47:06] bigoldmeatpie: The name spelling bee is said to have originated from the Middle English word 'bene', which means 'a prayer' or 'a favour'. In England, this has developed into a dialect form of this word - 'been'. This refers to the voluntary help given by neighbours toward the accomplishment of a particular task.

[2:48:56] ginjninj: happy bum day
[2:48:57] Moztastic: Yes
[2:48:58] jariley: other one is cloaca day when you celebrate mam chimken
[2:49:08] TyrsHTML: they have "clutch day" when they were laid, and Egg day" when they hatch. they get 2
[2:49:19] 3v1lc0w: see if you can find a boat daveCheck
[2:49:20] sleepykooo: Maybe they have 2 birthdays? Like the Queen did boupheThink
[2:49:21] RufusTheHairyCatWrangler: chickens lay eggs all the time but most don't hatch. You would have to have special days all the time
[2:49:23] roundburrito4: Conception birthday?!? brionyParty
[2:49:25] TheMoththem: when hatch because they incubate in the egg similar to mammalian baby who incubates in mother limesNoted
[2:49:45] jariley: @sleepykooo if you think about it, this means the queen was like actually 190
[2:50:06] Faaafv: modCheck
[2:50:12] roundburrito4: Multiple a day
[2:50:14] Teacosy_: daveCheck eggHatch
[2:50:14] ginjninj: im new to looking after chickens, only one of ours is laying so far
[2:50:32] jariley: external womb
[2:50:33] darth_baggins: LUL
[2:50:33] guywithastone: Inverted womb NOTED
[2:50:33] 3v1lc0w: lewisMadge
[2:50:33] Leuty_P: the exo-woumb
[2:50:34] Napoleonflip_flops: I mean they won’t be at exactly the same time, could you imagine?
[2:50:37] Teacosy_: Porta-womb
[2:50:41] Faaafv: YEP
[2:50:42] antacss: eggGive eggHatch
[2:50:43] bigoldmeatpie: "an egg is just a womb on the outside" - briony 2023
[2:50:50] Dargon_____: KEKW
[2:50:53] jariley: Briony commentary is unmatched, I wish for more egg talk
[2:50:55] Colin_Marx: So what about Platypus babies
[2:51:06] guywithastone: v! eggHatch
[2:51:09] darth_baggins: "an egg is just a womb with a view" was pretty good, ngl
[2:51:21] Cappo40: You can add upgrades to each
[2:51:22] oldmun: the key is to make sooooo many of them
[2:51:31] antacss: rythian there are 4x4 drawers so you can take up way less space
[2:51:36] daft_dave_41: Dog Faaafv had eleven a's in the name....if he is still missing for sneaky non-cheaty teleport reasons
[2:51:38] antacss: oh nvm
[2:51:40] antacss: I'm blind
[2:51:43] RufusTheHairyCatWrangler: just make more drawers. But yeah, things you only have one of should just go in a chest
[2:51:46] rodg88: those are 2x2
[2:51:49] Cappo40: Then now you just mass produce them for everything lol
[2:51:53] TyrsHTML: just make a ton and throw everything in
[2:51:54] tesmike: look into compacting drawers for some stuff
[2:51:54] HoboWith2Shotguns: 2 by 2 is biggest
[2:52:00] TyrsHTML: they are cheap go for it
[2:52:04] HoboWith2Shotguns: You could consider adding Refined Storage if you want nice digital storage
[2:52:05] antacss: yeah I just wasn't seeing it right
[2:52:16] HoboWith2Shotguns: It's not *that* complicated if you follow the recipes
[2:52:27] rodg88: @HoboWith2Shotguns slippery slope lol
[2:52:27] Gold__Kai: compacting drawers for ingots so you can pull out the ingot/block/nugget?
[2:52:33] Cappo40: Does the mod have the computer?
[2:52:36] guywithastone: You usually have a ton of drawers NODDERS  and then a shit chest for the small stuff
[2:52:38] 3v1lc0w: brionyBunkies
[2:52:53] jariley: I do think draws are best for storing things in bulk, and then have chests or other storage for more finnicky things, but also, I'm dumb as shit so idk
[2:53:00] oldmun: the benefi imo is that they are cheapish to build lots of. then the draw controller can connect to another storage system later with very little extra work
[2:53:20] Kacie_S101: Put single potat in item frame
[2:53:39] wotolom: they have there use, but also some drawbacks shadowatCool
[2:53:41] llithiumstars: krbage?
[2:53:53] wotolom: *their
[2:54:12] ginjninj: @wotolom yogC
[2:54:13] Limewood_: Cabbage, tomato and onion is probably only in new villages further away.
[2:54:20] 3v1lc0w: Wild Cabbage should spaw near the beach
[2:54:25] Gold__Kai: new chunks
[2:54:29] little_popz: DinoDance DinoDance
[2:54:30] HoboWith2Shotguns: youll need to generate new villagers
[2:54:58] Limewood_: Can also generate as plants on the ground in new chunks.
[2:55:02] Gold__Kai: they also sawn growing wild in new chunks
[2:55:04] ginjninj: sailing into the unknown for cabbage
[2:55:19] Timothy_Molinari: what is a cabba?
[2:55:24] HoboWith2Shotguns: Tune in next week for CABBAGE QUEST!

[2:56:00] honeybutterbread: Hello! DinoDance
[2:56:11] 3v1lc0w: iMadeaHugeMistake
[2:56:15] rodg88: Even if it only holds the bulk mats, drawers are still goodge
[2:56:22] HoboWith2Shotguns: 100% get your pack creator to add in Refined Storage or AE2 for digital storage.
[2:56:28] 3v1lc0w: bearded fancy shirted storage man
[2:56:31] ginjninj: @honeybutterbread yogHey
[2:56:33] JQ_amp: Oh i hope you can make delicious Cabbage Water like in Willy Wonka
[2:56:54] RufusTheHairyCatWrangler: A Colossal Chest would be good, it can be connected to a network and looks very cool
[2:57:09] rodg88: if briony and kirsty just double right click on the controller before they do any dumping in chests
[2:57:38] Stefnos: play stardew valley, things stack to 999 yogHypers
[2:57:47] rodg88: colossal chests without a digital storage mod to access it would be awful lol
[2:58:06] HoboWith2Shotguns: If you pair it with Refined, and wire the Controller into the Drawer controller with an Extrenal Storage bus on higher priority, the 2 work together beautifully
[2:58:14] JQ_amp: Long enough to survive on mars
[2:58:25] JesusRemix: Hey rythian you might want to get the "FindMe" mod as it searches nearby chests for items best if used with JEI
[2:58:30] mitsuhariversong: Potatoes have lots of vitamins
[2:58:32] JQ_amp: as matt damon.
[2:58:44] Ruffyluvy: depending on the work you want to put in, yeah like Hobo said there are some pretty elegant solutions. But they're all going to be a faff
[2:58:45] Teacosy_: KEKW
[2:58:45] JesusRemix: F o7
[2:58:48] 3v1lc0w: matt damon did it NODDERS
[2:58:53] Dargon_____: iMadeaHugeMistake
[2:58:53] cosmo_c: Yeah JEI would be a big help
[2:58:53] rodg88: its hot and it gets everywhere
[2:59:07] cosmo_c: Simple Storage Network might a good easy storage help
[2:59:14] IanMidknight: Fire resistance potions
[2:59:18] Limewood_: @hobowith2shotguns Refined is great, but it has some complicated recipes and setup and it needs power.
[2:59:41] rodg88: pretty sure you can configure RS to not use power
[2:59:48] ginjninj: being on fire is sinful NODDERS
[2:59:59] therealmike90: therealmike90 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 48 months! 
[3:00:03] TulkasStream: Taters are high in Vitamin C, potassium and the skin is high in fibre.
[3:00:04] Faaafv: YEP
[3:00:10] Ruffyluvy: I always like the dump chests with the interface, then it doesn't matter where you put stuff. But not sure what is available on this pack
[3:00:27] 3v1lc0w: brionyGiggle
[3:00:27] AutoRefresher2: my favourite simple storage solution has always been the rftools storage. no power either (unless you count the rftools base, which you don't even need to use)
[3:00:36] rodg88: its a very light custom pack @Ruffyluvy
[3:01:28] Ruffyluvy: I like chocolate milk
[3:01:38] darth_baggins: HypeLUL Turtles!
[3:01:45] Ruffyluvy: Foster's was the best show
[3:01:48] ginjninj: i like ccccccccccerealll

[3:02:48] Dargon_____: KEKW
[3:02:50] jariley: no context
[3:02:51] cosmo_c: stiff udders okay

[3:02:56] SketchThisWave: LUL
[3:02:58] rorchach_test: HUHH
[3:03:01] Ruffyluvy: the boob bone
[3:03:09] 3v1lc0w: they're like a glove full of milk HAPPERS
[3:03:13] jariley: bubic bone
[3:03:40] RufusTheHairyCatWrangler: You still question the workings of Briony's mind after all this time, Rythian?
[3:03:44] rodg88: compacting drawer would also be good for redstone, it stores it as blocks, but you can take out blocks or dust as needed
[3:03:49] ChuckCarmichael: I mean imagine if boobs had bones
[3:04:00] 3v1lc0w: brionyGiggle
[3:04:01] rodg88: thats so sad
[3:04:06] darth_baggins: Since people can understand Pokemon, I suppose you could ask a Miltank what it's like to have udders?
[3:04:09] ginjninj: use a nose
[3:04:13] mitsuhariversong: God Bless Briony
