[0:26:15] produkteriswf: i thought it wont be anime, its just promotion for special manga
[0:26:29] JeanBaldeux: iracing
[0:26:39] Just_Walter: Did you get that Trailer down the hill on Snowrunner LUL ?
[0:26:45] ninopanda: its a webtoon and possible manga

[0:27:00] DarkSpooon: Oh boy LULW
[0:27:04] MrMoneybagMan: thatd be nice full anime :)
[0:27:14] ba_nanananananana: this is going to fail for e.g. www3.
[0:27:18] UltraScientism: isn't it usually done with regular expressions?
[0:27:29] MakerOfThingys: regEx
[0:27:41] Chronoes: regex is better but urllib.parse module exists too for this purpose KEKW
[0:27:49] 13hunteo: should you not just split with the first and second dot?
[0:28:01] sum_summ: cant you just take a string between dots ? @Giantwaffle
[0:28:02] ba_nanananananana: LUL Chronoes
[0:28:03] DaGMC: ^.+://([^/:])$
[0:28:11] DarkSpooon: split between dots?
[0:28:19] K3ll06s: Can you regexp in Phyhon? :D
[0:28:19] DecoyOcelot: then sites like bit.ly come along
[0:28:25] DaGMC: ^.+://([^.]).+$
[0:28:26] Larklen: well chat, there is an example with only 1 dot too KEKW
[0:28:26] Ebonmourn: lol didn't know about find
[0:28:28] Tausgi: Do you have diamond hands Waffle? :)
[0:28:35] kskskskskskskssss: split string on `.` and look for first non `HTTP` or `www` string ?
[0:28:51] Larklen: PepLaugh
[0:28:56] Nexhunter: chat you dumbasses
[0:28:57] DaGMC: @Giantwaffle learn Regular Expression and try it in an online RE test app
[0:28:57] DarkSpooon: LULW excellent timeout
[0:29:02] ba_nanananananana: does this work for unicode domains Kappa

[0:29:16] anastasisdrama: ok
[0:29:22] DarkSpooon: KEKW
[0:29:23] CantTouchDisNow: just a regex :)
[0:29:27] aur1so: Regex YEP
[0:29:29] maca134: regex unreadable KEKW
[0:29:32] BlueberryKing: Guy flexing with his regex KEKW
[0:29:37] DarkSpooon: Those are pretty readable imo
[0:29:39] Chronoes: yes
[0:29:42] MasterKraft: RegEx i hate so much...lol, but it is so darn powerful for string manipulation and validation
[0:29:42] ba_nanananananana: good python code needs to be readable and written in sensible blocks. People who do one-liners should go back to Perl
[0:29:43] Ebonmourn: its just regex.. in higher level progarming its very very common
[0:29:43] Nexhunter: regex is better

[0:29:52] nativeW01f: readable is most important
[0:29:52] CocoScruff: i like functions that are defined and called
[0:29:53] UltraScientism: regex is more proper, there is theory behind it
[0:29:54] maca134: regex is better
[0:29:54] BlueberryKing: To be fair, if you've used it before, a regex is pretty readable
[0:29:57] Venxuri: isn't regex like ultra-slow?
[0:30:00] Zunderz: thats not a readable things, thats a performance thing
[0:30:08] DarkSpooon: A lot of times the one liner is so hard to read. But in this example it's pretty easy honestly.
[0:30:08] maca134: re-implementing is usual bad
[0:30:09] DaGMC: it depends
[0:30:10] infucio: comes with experience, years later you will love the readability but will want to improve upon it
[0:30:11] Bulva: hey guys and waffle
[0:30:11] Nexhunter: yes since you can break them out into more unit testable
[0:30:13] kskskskskskskssss: depends on context, but normally readability is better
[0:30:17] Henktank1: it depends
[0:30:22] Nexhunter: testability you mean KEKW
[0:30:23] PossibleScam: Readable code is good. But if your entire team knows what you’re doing, no need to make it readable.
[0:30:24] QwyIl: leftParse and rightParse aren't great names but I prefer smaller functions with well defined names
[0:30:24] BlueberryKing: As a concept it's a good thing to split up code, but it's always a trade off
[0:30:30] Venxuri: i'll rephrase: is regex good for performance?
[0:30:31] ba_nanananananana: there is no good answer for your question, really. It depends
[0:30:32] K3ll06s: if you could reuse the function somewhere else with different params then yes, else dont split it off
[0:30:33] Minelmonia: less lines of code, and more efficient
[0:30:33] devilsarmagedon: more functions is more better
[0:30:34] 13hunteo: @Venxuri nah regex is always faster than manually searching
[0:30:38] Chronoes: There is negligible performance penalty from using functions instead of a single block
[0:30:40] noxiiiouse: thats why you can comment everything so no big deal
[0:30:42] Ebonmourn: there is no better way to do it @Giantwaffle ... it all depends.. often on the how the codebase your working with works
[0:30:46] DeadeyeWolff: Fastest code as long you annotate the hell out of the document
[0:30:48] Nexhunter: that when you walk them through KEKW
[0:30:49] DaGMC: but sometimes one liners helps to make more code more readable due to lesser lines
[0:30:49] anastasisdrama: no block please
[0:30:49] DX_Plates: The new guy will need it to be readable.
[0:30:56] nativeW01f: people join and leave teams all the time
[0:30:58] Chronoes: useless comments are bad
[0:30:59] maca134: if you need comments, your code is bad
[0:31:00] K3ll06s: ...
[0:31:03] TasteMaShu: @Giantwaffle why not both ?
[0:31:09] JonnyL: DansGame
[0:31:11] 13hunteo: You need comments to describe what a function is doing
[0:31:11] DarkSpooon: Bad!?!?!? Comments are necessary!
[0:31:15] devilsarmagedon: anyone who thinks comments are useless have never worked in a large codebase
[0:31:16] Allmostdone: useless comments are bad
[0:31:17] Minelmonia: noooo dont comment, it gets outdated!
[0:31:18] 13hunteo: or a specific command is more complex
[0:31:19] TasteMaShu: Comments + better named variables
[0:31:20] DaGMC: in ASM comments can save your life
[0:31:21] AkunaAkwei: comments should explain why something happens, code already describes what happens
[0:31:24] CocoScruff: on web applications they remove comments so it doesn't affect performance
[0:31:27] anastasisdrama: waffleOMG
[0:31:28] infucio: you can always batch remove commented lines, if you want to compile comment-less bin
[0:31:30] ba_nanananananana: no you still want comments stating what something does, because some idiot will later rewrite it to some meaningless shit
[0:31:32] nativeW01f: you shouldnt need to write comments if your code is readable and understandable, comments are good for like javadocs stuff and the likes of that
[0:31:32] W84M3: well there 's a thin line between redeability and efficiency... if you can live without super performant code redeability is a good key if you need supper performant code well screw redeability
[0:31:35] Chronoes: naming is one of the hardest problems ever KEKW
[0:31:40] DarkSpooon: Name it better KEKW
[0:31:43] TasteMaShu: "i" is usually a counter
[0:31:44] TasteMaShu: incremented
[0:31:44] Rangetuur: there is a book "Clean code" that describes how you write good code
[0:31:53] DarkSpooon: Man, comment everything. Comments are the best thing you can do.
[0:31:55] 13hunteo: you need to use comments in a team setting, its a lot less efficient to make them work out how it works with naming conventions
[0:31:57] evilthatotherguy: some variable have size limits, so comments are neccesary
[0:32:01] Allmostdone: you should have a naming convention anyway
[0:32:03] DaGMC: and comments are good to transfer the context from your mind
[0:32:08] Just_Walter: I'm doing a coding course and what you're saying about comments they are basically telling me.
[0:32:11] DaGMC: to other devs
[0:32:13] Nexhunter: you want efficient go rust Kappa
[0:32:14] W84M3: exactly! then go 100% for redeability
[0:32:15] Apakawata: Under the scene
[0:32:20] ba_nanananananana: just use voidpointers with everything, perfectly sane and safe C programming Kappa
[0:32:21] joaofcmb: size limits in python KEKW
[0:32:29] kskskskskskskssss: why would you do that in the first place XD
[0:32:30] twiQsP: def thisFunctionIsDoingALoopAddingAllIntegers YEP
[0:32:38] DaGMC: or even yourself
[0:32:38] kskskskskskskssss: imagine reviewing a 255 function name
[0:32:43] Hazzarius_: I find in my job commenting is key when updating/patching old code, where someone figures out the necessary logic once and just writes down their explanation in the code.
[0:32:51] BlueberryKing: Java probably
[0:32:52] Pine_Noir: max_Int characters per variable
[0:32:53] Nexhunter: because you can minify
[0:32:54] Nexhunter: KEKW
[0:32:58] DaGMC: its because of Java
[0:33:00] Ebonmourn: nah java
[0:33:09] taurenite: no, it's spring framework that's famous for that
[0:33:19] 4729_zex: you can't just neglact comments all to gather
[0:33:22] Just_Walter: what programming language is this in ?
[0:33:25] Ryetta: 36k
[0:33:26] ba_nanananananana: the main problem with not commenting and relying on the code explaining itself ... code review and debugging can get really annoying
[0:33:27] W84M3: if i can have code without too many indentation (no matter which language, ex if statements/if&else and so one... just break everything into methods)
[0:33:29] DaGMC: JavaScript was heavily inspired by Java back in the days
[0:33:29] DarkSpooon: Or just use comments?
[0:33:33] nativeW01f: a function should do one thing and nothing else
[0:33:34] 13hunteo: @Just_Walter It's bad practice, what they are telling you to do is not to comment every line. You should be commenting on parts saying what that part is for, rather than how its doing it. You should always have good comments that help people understand the code quicker than having to work it out
[0:33:34] FloodRacer: self documenting code
[0:33:35] CantTouchDisNow: it is only a problem if it does something wrong
[0:33:49] taurenite: if you do it solo, readability is not as important
[0:33:50] Ajut: highly mathematical or statistical code sometimes really needs comments to explain specific cases or why you approach something in a specific way
[0:33:52] W84M3: even if you have more code lines but fi you can have redeability and reusing code it's the best, i guess
[0:33:53] PossibleScam: Most programmers are looking for efficiency, less lines == usually more efficient code.
[0:33:54] kskskskskskskssss: functional programming is the way, split stuff in simples pieces that can be composed/ re-used
[0:33:57] DaGMC: # this lines is required to save humanity Kappa
[0:33:59] Nexhunter: well you use i, and x for your loop index timmacLAUGH
[0:34:00] MediocreStream: Going back to your code a year later comments will save you time understanding imo
[0:34:01] Minelmonia: its readable... just not for the novice programmer
[0:34:03] 0sem0: The best thing to do is contributing to real projects on github
[0:34:03] Chronoes: So untrue
[0:34:09] DarkSpooon: That's not what they mean when they say comment your code though
[0:34:14] Zunderz: best code its the one that comments itselfg
[0:34:15] DarkSpooon: They mean explain a function
[0:34:16] DaGMC: better readable
[0:34:20] Ebonmourn: Sounds like Waffle would love the Functional Programming mindset rather then the Object Oriented mindset
[0:34:21] joaofcmb: Less lines it strived for not because of efficiency, but maintainability
[0:34:24] 13hunteo: @Giantwaffle You have the wrong idea about how comments should be used. They should be describing what something does rather than how it does it. You shouldnt be commenting each line
[0:34:27] DaGMC: maintain less code is better
[0:34:28] TasteMaShu: Its about modularity
[0:34:29] complexprotein: That's not what she said Kappa
[0:34:29] maca134: well it kind of is on the assembly level
[0:34:32] joaofcmb: Usually LOC is not correlated to performance in any way
[0:34:33] UnrealUndead: Comments are only for "Why?". Code should be self-describing.
[0:34:35] Drapi_x: size doesn't matter Kappa
[0:34:37] Nexhunter: well yes and no once you start getting into oddities of engines
[0:34:37] DarkSpooon: @13hunteo Exactly
[0:34:47] ba_nanananananana: also, chat, this is python. You are going to want lots of blocks and short lines for style DansGame
[0:34:51] FloodRacer: you might as well spell out variables "SubString1" instead of abbreviating as "sub1"
[0:34:57] Ajut: its not really what you are doing its why you are doing it
[0:35:02] Rangetuur: commenting code is 100% BAD
[0:35:02] UltraScientism: comments can describe how somethign works, Comments like that are the best
[0:35:03] 4729_zex: you are right
[0:35:04] TasteMaShu: commenting CSS ? KEKW
[0:35:21] DarkSpooon: @Giantwaffle Except you just said you shouldn't comment code when you 100% should be commenting code when someone else or you are going to be maintaining it.
[0:35:22] W84M3: if you work on a team project... with not so much problem with performance... go 100% for redeability and comments (obviously just comment for example business rules and so on....)
[0:35:22] espi: substr1
[0:35:25] DaGMC: isnt finalString against python naming scheme
[0:35:33] Nexhunter: timmacLAUGH imagine not using the vs code web editor
[0:35:34] laserloui: str_sub1
[0:35:35] DaGMC: looks more like java
[0:35:36] K3ll06s: write it in your ide? and paste it back
[0:35:38] Hazzarius_: Comment grand ideas, like you do on a whiteboard to break down the general logic. Commenting what each variable means is unnecessary
[0:35:40] Nexhunter: come on codewars get smaht
[0:35:43] UltraScientism: Than don't use the website's editbox?
[0:35:43] devilsarmagedon: any reason why the substrings are seperate instead of in a collection like an array?
[0:35:49] 0sem0: The best thing to do is contributing to real projects on GitHub
[0:35:56] BlueberryKing: That's a good point. A good ide would also autocomplete variable names for you, so using longer names doesn't slow you down
[0:35:59] Nexhunter: yea that safe timeouts
[0:36:01] UltraScientism: point of this website is to check your answers
[0:36:05] 13hunteo: For something like codewars you don't need comments, it should be for quick code for learning how to do something in the best way
[0:36:12] 13hunteo: So you are in the rght
[0:36:14] 13hunteo: *right
[0:36:27] joaofcmb: Comments are good for insights and remarks for other developers who need to understand and maintain your code. for instance, might make sense to explain in few words what's the purpose of the function so devs understand its purpose better and what it does more easily
[0:36:35] Pine_Noir: constraint?
[0:36:37] infucio: indicator
[0:36:37] BlueberryKing: 0sem0 This is quite hard to do as a beginner though
[0:36:56] 0sem0: Why not?
[0:37:04] Ebonmourn: @Giantwaffle generally with python using native functions to do something is better then bandaid-ing something yourself (they are often implemented in C under the hood)
[0:37:15] BlueberryKing: Even learning git by itself is gonna take 5 months KEKW
[0:37:20] ba_nanananananana: joaofcmb especially when a function was messed up by someone who doesn't stick to clear style. That happens, a lot.
[0:37:20] Larklen: KEKW
[0:37:22] Sundrata: And then you fix and commit again :D
[0:37:23] Robohornet: Robohornet subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 23 months! 
[0:37:24] CantTouchDisNow: that is good tho you learn that way
[0:37:25] DecoyOcelot: check out Fast Inverse Square Root. There is an algorithm in Quake that is straight bonkers but super efficient
[0:37:29] MediocreStream: Watching Jonathan Blow (guy who did Braid and The Witness) code live on twitch is mindblowing
[0:37:30] 0sem0: Well contribute to projects that allow beginners
[0:37:38] Minelmonia: That IS the point
[0:37:39] firstratejake: The 12 second limitation is to ensure algorithmic efficiency. If it takes too long you need to work to improve the time space complexity of your algorithm.
[0:37:40] 0sem0: or are friendly
[0:37:41] DaGMC: you could use the timeout command in linux: timeout 12s sleep 86400 @Giantwaffle
[0:37:47] ba_nanananananana: just don't do deepcopy when you can do [:]
[0:37:48] Moobot: Support Waffle by using his Epic creator code: Giantwaffle
[0:37:50] officialzip: Save the contributing for Hacktober Fest
[0:37:59] W84M3: yes... my comments are basically just commenting business rules and things like Task numbers so people can find where this code is linked to... i never comment my code like everyoen says if you don't understand the code it's because it's bad
[0:38:02] vladutzul123: if you don't know programming that much how would you even get to a project on which you would contribute ?
[0:38:03] joaofcmb: @Giantwaffle Theres literal pull requests to fix typos, so you can start with something simple, plus you can look at similar code to get an idea of how to do stuff
[0:38:03] Apakawata: Nothing is better than going back to projects when you first started and criticizing how terrible you were.
[0:38:03] 13hunteo: Most projects have useful people that give valuable feedback on how to improve, don't be afraid to try. It's the best way to not get stuck into bad practices
[0:38:05] Allmostdone: no they are gonna ask... why didn't you say that. You know comment it
[0:38:06] kskskskskskskssss: dont be afraid on PR, it's better to have feedback than 0 comments
[0:38:08] Ebonmourn: read the documentation to find those functions lol
[0:38:14] Chronoes: @Giantwaffle look up urllib.parse module for Python KEKW
[0:38:17] DaGMC: @Giantwaffle Regex are also useful
[0:38:28] kskskskskskskssss: linter ?
[0:38:36] 0sem0: freeCodeCamp has a really good repo for beginners
[0:38:45] DaGMC: CI/CD
[0:38:45] BlueberryKing: Continuous Integration?
[0:38:50] CocoScruff: heroku rebuilds every time i think
[0:38:58] Stillglade: lol - everyone does CI/CD for like the last 20 years
[0:38:59] BlueberryKing: It's just a shit pipeline though KEKW
[0:39:00] QwyIl: That sounds like Continuous Integration
[0:39:02] Allmostdone: yep... it not typos
[0:39:03] Dibbsu: Yeah it's call CI, continuous integration pipelines.
[0:39:04] TasteMaShu: DevOps
[0:39:10] DaGMC: CI/CD => Continous Integration & Continous Deliverment/Deployment
[0:39:11] haradok: devops
[0:39:13] Sundrata: JENKINS has entered the battlefield
[0:39:15] kskskskskskskssss: yeah
[0:39:17] Legopiraat: yes its very normal
[0:39:19] 13hunteo: I think some things use different branches, and push things into the master branch when they are ready to build it
[0:39:21] Venxuri: yes, I actually work as an DevOps
[0:39:21] Allmostdone: CI is the correct word
[0:39:23] kskskskskskskssss: pipelines run on new commits
[0:39:23] DaGMC: yes
[0:39:24] devilsarmagedon: @Sundrata you read my mind xD
[0:39:24] DarkSpooon: Seems pretty normal?
[0:39:25] DrSnydes: Yeah, can set up jobs on build servers that monitor commits on a repository
[0:39:27] 0sem0: CI is for testing mostly
[0:39:30] Chronoes: automated deployments
[0:39:34] DaGMC: Its the future of devs
[0:39:37] Kaldhax: Hey chat, what is he doing rn?
[0:39:40] Minelmonia: CI/CD is where you want to be
[0:39:45] Allmostdone: its not the live side
[0:39:45] Dibbsu: Yup something like Jenkins will monitor a repository
[0:39:47] Just_Walter: I think i understand minecraft better LUL
[0:39:50] sofalord_: devop is functional if you know how the business after the devops works...
[0:39:50] catshapednoodles: if the changes pass the tests, they can get integrated immediately yeah
[0:39:56] TasteMaShu: @Giantwaffle you should read how DevOps work :)
[0:40:01] firstratejake: If you submit an update it runs a preset pipeline of tasks to ensure the new code doesn’t break anything.
[0:40:05] W84M3: yes basically... specially if you have Test environments... everytime you commit to master it builds and delivers the code there so it can be tested
[0:40:07] joaofcmb: @Giantwaffle Not live (production), unless it's a pretty Pepega setup
[0:40:07] Sundrata: @devilsarmagedon :D
[0:40:10] haradok: good
[0:40:16] Larklen: pepeSmoke
[0:40:17] DaGMC: I'm doing courses for company about devops

[0:40:52] orangecreamsicle3: PepoThink
[0:40:53] devilsarmagedon: @Sundrata at my previous job we had jenkins send angry emails to the dev that broke the build
[0:40:55] 0sem0: what is biomutant world?
[0:40:55] APieceOfFruit24: im still super excited for it
[0:40:58] DarkSpooon: That they're heavily marketing it
[0:40:59] ByakurenHoujuu: Isn't it sponsored, because it's early access?
[0:41:01] shauL__: thanks for showing me codewars seems like a dope site
[0:41:06] poiple_: ah
[0:41:09] disserno: @orangecreamsicle3 streamer privilege
[0:41:19] DaGMC: pepeSmoke test in the pipeline Kappa
[0:41:29] Apakawata: I Cohh playing it. The game kinda seems lackluster to me. Just a simple action RPG with a cool concept that falls flat.
[0:41:29] Larklen: Sounds like someone didnt get a code Kappa
[0:41:31] Zoney1: Hey Waffle, about how many hours did it take you to complete Compact Claustrophobia, and was it worth it?
[0:41:34] Sundrata: @devilsarmagedon we get slack pings and an email to the whole team for ours... nice and embarrassing
[0:41:36] UltraScientism: more money for streamers
[0:41:53] 13hunteo: How do they distribute early access to streamers? Do they contact agencies or do you have a central place for all the games.
[0:41:56] Winner5001: 2-3 weeks?
[0:42:03] K3ll06s: thats normal for not level 100chads Kappa

[0:49:13] Hunter1701: What you dont like going around looking at anime tiddy in vrc anymore? KEKW
[0:49:17] DaGMC: @Giantwaffle have you played Phasmo on VR?

[0:49:57] n8level: devs spent too much time in their own game? Kappa

[0:50:08] Hunter1701: its 2018 now but still shit KEKW
[0:50:19] UltraScientism: that's because it's so hard to port between unity editions
[0:50:20] Lymoz: Which game we talking about?
[0:50:21] Opsidill: NeosVR is the new competitor

[0:52:29] EmotePerMessage: they moving to 2019 next patch beta
[0:52:29] DigitalVortex92: Unity LTS is 2018.4.35f1, 2019.4.26f1, 2020.3.8f1. So why would a lot of devs update if they still have LTS on older versions if its not worth the improvement
[0:52:44] ByakurenHoujuu: Yeah they upgraded to 2018 & are gonna do 2019 this summer
[0:52:50] Venxuri: Mixer is cool I think you can make glowstone with it
[0:53:03] JBourden: are you gonna use AE2? if so how close are ye to that?
[0:53:04] fci_: @DigitalVortex92 This is a big reason, especially avoiding having to rewrite code for major engine changes.
[0:53:13] DigitalVortex92: @fci_ Ya
[0:53:15] DaGMC: and EFT is pushing Unity pretty hard
[0:53:18] ItsOnMax: Shadergraph is pretty chill in URP

[1:01:35] PeterZ_97: I know this option might be hard early game, but try to use "deep mob learning" mod, it will make your life easier, you can create ingots and diamond / emeralds with this mod.
[1:01:36] DarkSpooon: Did they even rename ABS?
[1:01:38] JBourden: yee
[1:01:40] Humphr3y: I haven't had soda in almost 2 years

[1:07:52] ItsOnMax: @Jugohuber That was so 'extra' tho KEKW
[1:07:57] Mitsuninja: mekanism in this pack? if so, setup for duping?
[1:08:16] Mike190Twitch: No Mekanism
[1:08:21] xevos221: @Mitsuninja no Mekanism, ore multiplying is all GregTech
[1:08:29] JBourden: wait what you refine ore into pulsating dust?? thats so op!
[1:08:31] Mike190Twitch: Ore Doubling is pretty simple though
[1:08:31] Aragnir: @Giantwaffle sooner you loop mob learnining for enderpearls and diamonds, faster you start progress
[1:08:48] PeterZ_97: Balanced pack? Good joke, check flux capacitor and compare it with gregtech battery :)
[1:08:51] xevos221: Does waffle know about numismatic dynamos?
[1:09:03] MrDocth: need more power and some work
[1:09:41] Mike190Twitch: Numismatic Dynamo
[1:09:53] JBourden: pristine matter?
[1:09:54] IamtheJK: IamtheJK subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 20 months! 
[1:09:54] Larklen: pepeSmoke
[1:10:04] Sentinel1_9: one way to find out, make it!
[1:10:04] xevos221: Each mob data model has a power req
[1:10:07] Mike190Twitch: Data Models require different amounts of power e.g. diamonds is 512 Rf/T
[1:10:39] Mike190Twitch: Shulker is diamonds
[1:10:39] Venxuri: shulker
[1:10:47] xevos221: You need an enderman and shulker model for infinite cycle looping
[1:10:49] Mike190Twitch: No
[1:10:53] thomasausen: make it so you can get diamonds since there is a dynamo and a dynamo upgrade to use diamonds
[1:10:54] xevos221: You don't
[1:10:54] MrDocth: it's the "bals" that drop loot
[1:10:55] Mike190Twitch: you dont need The End
[1:11:25] JBourden: that looks p simple
[1:11:26] Moobot: Support Waffle by using his Epic creator code: Giantwaffle
[1:11:40] GenericFutureMan: a lot of people do
[1:11:41] Bow_Shock: You could run 9 with turbine upgrade, for 360 rf/t time 3
[1:11:48] Venxuri: I think power is not the problem, is producing polymer clay thats the issue
[1:11:49] Mike190Twitch: You will need a Blast Furnace before you can get loot though
[1:11:52] xevos221: The GregTech infrastructure to support infinite polymer clay is a decent amount
[1:11:55] MrDocth: not really, you produce more quickly
[1:11:56] Mraav: Can you show your sugar cane farm ?
[1:12:01] MrDocth: will*
[1:12:09] JBourden: just need pearls?
[1:12:17] xevos221: You use the resonant clathrate instead of uranite
[1:12:19] masztufa: really? no way to make it in the EBF or something?
[1:12:21] Mike190Twitch: You can make Clay with Dust Blocks and water, for PolymerClay
[1:12:35] Tapeman83: Lava gens in the Nether will be good power for a while
[1:12:42] Mike190Twitch: @xevos221 Uraninite BECOMES pulsating dust when smelted
[1:12:59] Mike190Twitch: Diamond Power in his pack is OP
[1:12:59] DrHax_: catJAM
[1:13:00] xevos221: @Mike190Twitch I know but you can't infinitely generate that at this point
[1:13:07] Mike190Twitch: @xevos221 this is true
[1:13:09] Wild_Pachi: pump out the nether YEP
[1:13:22] xevos221: @Mike190Twitch you can infinitely generate the clathrate with an enderman model
[1:13:27] xevos221: I've already played this pack
[1:13:34] Mike190Twitch: @xevos221 yes
[1:13:43] Humphr3y: compact draw so you have access to block ingot and nuggets

[1:13:59] Spirevipp: remember ederio snapshot filter can read drawer controllers
[1:14:26] Venxuri: @Mike190Twitch 2nd creative vending run, what kind of masochist are you lol
[1:14:32] SecretlyHandsome: snapshot filter is great, makes filter based on contents of a chest
[1:15:10] Mike190Twitch: @Venxuri Ive played this pack for at least 1000 hours and im not tired of it.
[1:15:26] loafabreadly: Anyone know how to make a sub-assembly in KSP?
[1:15:32] Cyberwire69: f7?
[1:15:36] xevos221: Hit it with a dye and it will show the range
[1:15:36] Bow_Shock: It says in the description i think
[1:15:42] Mike190Twitch: @Venxuri the Dev Version of this pack has some pretty sweet additions

[1:16:54] drsnaki96: 64 radius or diameter?
[1:16:56] Mike190Twitch: @Venxuri I play OF for the gameplay, for how the pack is made, not for hard mode stuff
[1:16:59] m3lm4n: waffle what have you done to me? I've been doing good, working on unity every day, but now I've been hauling planks and stuff all over the woods for 10h straight.
[1:17:09] JBourden: just make 2 4Head
[1:17:32] Venxuri: @Giantwaffle there is also a feral flare lantern, it makes stuff nicely bright without the clutter that torches make, you just need 1 of them
[1:17:33] Wazepas: Make sure to not show him Farming Sim then monkaW

[1:42:35] ThatOnneGuy: You only really lose money if you're very bad these days
[1:42:40] ThatOnneGuy: But yeah it sucks
[1:42:41] demoniclaxatives: pay to win
[1:42:59] Tasar_: Its that the whole gotcha model?
[1:43:01] DigitallyAdmiringHumanity: morning @Giantwaffle
[1:43:01] John_Seaman: Not pay to win, it's pay to advance
[1:43:02] daz__boot: yeah t10 sucks on repairs if you get nuked early in the match
[1:43:04] Chronoes: I mean, it's like a subscription for MMO, but it's hidden as F2P
[1:43:07] DigitallyAdmiringHumanity: morning chat
[1:43:08] daz__boot: especially non prem
[1:43:09] Imp4ct42: You can always use your lower tier Tanks to make money
[1:43:13] Robohornet: You dont lose money but you end up stagnating without Premium
[1:43:25] Tabakhase: no
[1:43:25] ThatOnneGuy: 100%. I paid for a year of premium and it's night and day. It used to take a week to get 1mil, with premium it takes like a few hours
[1:43:37] DrWinston0Boogie: high tier is expensive in repair costs
[1:43:38] Sandiro1: Tier 6 - 8 is the most fun imo
[1:43:38] Tabakhase: t6 is money makers
[1:43:42] auzu_: lose money playing top tier
[1:43:48] TechNaOkami: low teir in WOT isnt fun but it is in WT

[1:44:46] Moobot: Support Waffle by using his Epic creator code: Giantwaffle
[1:45:12] AkunaAkwei: need to input more energy
[1:45:15] Mike190Twitch: This is the LV, you'll need MV
[1:45:25] John_Seaman: Premium ammo in WoT is still a thing?
[1:45:33] RanOutOfUsernameIdeas: YEP
[1:45:43] Mike190Twitch: With over-clocking, it becomes roughly 2x faster at 4x the Energy cost
[1:45:45] Venxuri: you can make one into a boiler and other into steam turbine and it gives more RF/t @Giantwaffle
[1:45:50] ThatOnneGuy: Here's how unbalanced wot can be. I used a CHONK of a t7, the O-NI, has thick armor. A t8 premium, autoloader light tank killed me shooting through my front armor (thickest part) and still had a shot left
[1:46:21] Bow_Shock: Waffle, look at the quest entry, "the beginning", pretty much in the middle - the steam turbine upgrade. Gets you triple the energy out of steam.
[1:46:26] Sandiro1: gold ammo cost silver now but you really cant use it unless you have a premium account
[1:46:33] ThatOnneGuy: ^
[1:46:37] That0neGeye: Yes hello?
[1:46:37] Duckatron3001: im pretty sure gaijin got rid of hull breaks but there is over pressure now

[1:47:02] Sentinel1_9: the one you were on was called the beginning waffle

[1:47:28] Bow_Shock: YEP
[1:47:32] Bow_Shock: This is poggies
[1:48:08] M1k3D3l7a: On a scale from 1-10 how fun is the new Snowrunner map? Unfortunate I couldn't watch you SR-streams
[1:48:19] Bow_Shock: Also, sorry for BSG, but it would have hurt me, if you set up the inefficient steam dynamos KEKW
[1:48:23] Venxuri: read all the quests and it become much easier

Basically all players want to work on the central brain thing and build a sphere around each star in the galaxy which is shown in that type 3 window I guess.

[2:27:43] fafuja: I heard pytorch is better
[2:27:44] Tech: @Opsidill Tensor Flow Docs and any youtube channel your interested in.

[2:28:24] PureSpider: tensorflow literally runs on embedded systems no problem
[2:28:26] bubble_d: you just hit a wall and its a lot harder to understand the layered programming if youre new to the foundation stuff
[2:28:30] IvanGodlike: A huge part of machine learning is data preparation and cleaning, so you have to learn that first
[2:28:50] Opsidill: @Giantwaffle that was an assignment for one of my classes in my bachelors
[2:29:09] BlueberryKing: There is a pretty simple solution using "backtracking". Interesting to look at
[2:29:11] PureSpider: Opsidill same bamKEK to teach recursion
[2:29:13] Tech: ML isn't even really a Programmers tool IMO. You have to wear your data scientist hat more than your engineer one.
[2:29:18] Nilau: I'm working on a ml project right now to control the hot water supply in a german city WAFW
[2:29:20] K3ll06s: KEKW play tic tac to perfectly
[2:29:36] Tech: It really doesn't
[2:29:39] PureSpider: like sudoku is so easy to solve with recursion, no ML needed
[2:29:44] IvanGodlike: depents on the ML technique
[2:29:49] Opsidill: @PureSpider to be fair, I was swamped with work and never completed it. Going to attempt it again soon
[2:29:56] thomasausen: ResidentSleeper
[2:30:00] Tech: And too many people use it to solve every nail they see
[2:30:01] PureSpider: Opsidill it was one of my favorite asignments tbh
[2:30:02] DaGMC: ml has the danger that you can't debug it like classical software
[2:30:09] PureSpider: yuuup Tech
[2:30:18] Ajut: ml is just statistics with a fancy mask
[2:30:23] devilsarmagedon: i like watching codebullet for machine learning shenanigans
[2:30:35] DaGMC: but the output gets the input
[2:30:35] bubble_d: ML Is typically best used for large data consumption, theres little you can do to influence it once its learned
[2:30:38] Nilau: @Tech wdym, I use ML to control a robotic arm to wipe my ass widePepeLaugh
[2:30:44] ZyianDev: the black box is just stats theory
[2:30:49] n8level: same with OP-Amps
[2:30:49] BlueberryKing: Just don't be disappointed when you find out it's just math
[2:30:51] ZyianDev: I took a class and ho boy

[2:32:52] Tech: You understand what you need to do, just not how to convey it and write it down.
[2:32:53] RedalousTheRed: If you know how to translate the rules, you know how to skip simple steps and therefore can make your programs more effecient
[2:32:57] PureSpider: yea, it's a way of thinking you have to learn and train, for sure
[2:33:06] Opsidill: If you can think of the logic you used in your head then you can eventually convey it in code
[2:33:06] DaGMC: sometimes its helpful to have a pet project which motivates you to learn
[2:33:07] hanilins09: hello i'am from brasil
[2:33:10] gurekam74: Discrete mathematics is hard
[2:33:11] colinbobolin: watch threebrownoneblue linear algebra, its mind blowing

[2:33:48] RedalousTheRed: @Apparentthreat Analysis is fun too :)
[2:33:48] PureSpider: thats just a regex? :D
[2:33:52] gurekam74: @Giantwaffle This concept is why I love learning new things, then drop them so fast. I can see a huge sudden progress when I learn the basics, then it tapers off and I move on.
[2:34:07] Nilau: just strip it?
[2:34:08] K3ll06s: @Giantwaffle does this work with subdomains?

[2:34:31] PureSpider: yea just regex :D
[2:34:33] BlueberryKing: Yeah, but that's the part that you're gonna get more comfortable with as you keep practising
[2:34:35] PureSpider: as i said
[2:34:36] Apparentthreat: Regex can be slow
[2:34:43] Nilau: or split yea
[2:34:53] Invariantly: I've always hated string manipulation.
[2:34:56] Tech: I mean the nice thing though about not using the libraries
[2:35:02] n8level: a bunch of data science programming is figuring out how to shape the input dataset in a way that the code can efficiently run math over it and output the answer
[2:35:02] PureSpider: thats just getting to know the language though, thats normal, waffle
[2:35:03] Ace_Runn3r: as long as its not a regular expression
[2:35:04] Tech: is you understand what the libraries are actually doing
[2:35:16] itsfilipoficial: mathpy
[2:35:16] Tech: Not just accepting them as the only way to do something
[2:35:17] Guydudeman3: Knowing how to ask the right question is like 75% of the problem
[2:35:19] isot0nic: *.+//\..+
[2:35:24] RedalousTheRed: String splicing is fun
[2:35:35] Chronoes: It helps to just look through the Python stdlib documentation, especially the 1st chapter with the basics
[2:35:43] RedalousTheRed: yee slice notation
[2:35:56] Andee2: @Tech True, those libraries can be black boxes of dark magic
[2:36:06] PureSpider: just looking at documentation randomly never helped me at all, i'd have to look at use case based documentation
[2:36:10] Tech: It's like reading the repair manual for any modern car LUL
[2:36:12] Chronoes: I mean, you should do it. Then you know what is potentially available
[2:36:18] Chronoes: That's what I did anyway
[2:36:19] n8level: @Guydudeman3 Elon Musk — 'One of the really tough things is figuring out what questions to ask. Once you figure out the question, then the answer is relatively easy.'
[2:36:38] Janzert: Yeah, the standard library docs are a reference not a textbook
[2:36:50] Tech: Yeah, but you get better at finding what you need to learn
[2:36:59] fafuja: dictionaries are just hash tables under the roof right?
[2:37:05] Chronoes: @Janzert a reference is kind of useless if you don't know what to look for
[2:37:28] Ezrion1: thats why doing projects is so good for learning
[2:37:29] devilsarmagedon: intermediate?
[2:37:36] RedalousTheRed: overview?
[2:37:37] LaneTaxCollector13: junior
[2:37:37] ZyianDev: bootcamp course?
[2:37:37] KranGence: bootcamp?
[2:37:37] n8level: survey
[2:37:37] Kruvik: general?
[2:37:37] KritterIsBack: general?
[2:37:39] Janzert: @fafuja dictionaries are implemented with hash tables, yes
[2:37:39] 0x000000: comprehensive
[2:37:40] K3ll06s: a beginner course is still nice, to get confirmation that you have all the basics
[2:37:41] UltraScientism: You need to recreate CS education, if you want a good job.
[2:37:41] Rubinix: survey
[2:37:46] Ace_Runn3r: crash course
[2:37:50] kakiewakie_: crash course
[2:37:55] Tech: I mean any of the CS like courses are good
[2:38:15] Tech: When you are looking for a job, yeah LUL
[2:38:23] hadrised: u gotta spam leetcode to get a job
[2:38:28] Tech: Depends on the company, but yeah
[2:38:31] AvaanKha: yep
[2:38:42] Tech: You whiteboard these questions during your technicals
[2:38:44] peetur_: I learned a shitton from leetcode
[2:38:54] goldbear584: Yes I use it to prep for interview.
[2:38:55] ZyianDev: Do you want an interview question to think about?
[2:38:57] UltraScientism: you need to move on to reading Cormen or Sedgwick
[2:39:07] AzureTail: @Giantwaffle Have you tried Codingame?
[2:39:09] hadrised: leetcode kinda just solving riddles and remembering exact techniques, not great for learning imo
[2:39:21] DaGMC: I've never done something like this for a dev job im my whole life
[2:39:30] Chronoes: leetcode is good for learning the basics of the language and maybe some methodologies
[2:39:58] itsfilipoficial: Being a software dev and the worst part of the job is interviews been on both sides
[2:39:59] Ace_Runn3r: I have not
[2:40:01] Tech: FAANG and Silicon valley like companies are the ones that ask for Leetcode
[2:40:08] hadrised: as a new grad i had to do leetcode  for every interview this year
[2:40:13] 0x000000: it only works with junior/mid positions
[2:40:13] Tech: It's basically non-existent elsewhere which is good
[2:40:21] itsfilipoficial: No one uses leetcode before FAANG and silicon valley
[2:40:31] RationalLies: @hadrised did you find it helpful for the code interviews?
[2:40:42] Ace_Runn3r: My job wouldnt work with leetcode lol different focus
[2:40:48] itsIffy: I am a java consultant, cloud engineer, and I would never ask for leetcode, and have never been asked about my leetcode skill
[2:40:48] colinbobolin: coding challenges maybe but they won't be quite like that
[2:40:56] hadrised: yeah its definitely helpful, leetcode helped me get a job
[2:40:59] DaGMC: I'd hire you even without this shit
[2:41:04] Mka696: I work at a finance company as a dev and never had to do that dumb stuff
[2:41:06] hadrised: its for all companies really
[2:41:09] colinbobolin: I just had an interview with a take-home challenge
[2:41:11] itsfilipoficial: I work for a ott company and we just do a normal test, with code you actually write everyday
[2:41:13] Tech: Well companies outside of the sphere will typically hire people leaving Silicon Valley/faang
[2:41:29] Guydudeman3: SAT or ACT if you're from mid-west
[2:41:38] Guydudeman3: I took the ACT where I grew up
[2:41:39] itsfilipoficial: I think its a us thing these kind of test
[2:41:44] Janzert: My impression is the bigger the company the more likely you are to get interviews like that
[2:41:47] calvinisonline: after covid a lot of colleges dont even look at test scores
[2:41:52] SeeAGamer: As a python hiring manager for a fortune 500, this is the first time I've heard of leetcode, neat, but I could care less if they know python enough to do it on the fly - I'd prefer they can talk about process, node code.
[2:42:03] Rubinix: some colleges are looking at personal portfolio now depending on program
[2:42:04] Apparentthreat: I'm glad Cybersecurity isn't as much as a shitshow when it comes to interviewing (for a lot of it, at least)
[2:42:16] Kamikizzle73: folks without experience would benefit from leet code no matter where they're applying, because they dont have any industry experience to talk about during interviews. for folks with a year or two under their belt, you can spend the time talking about features you built, or problems you solved and can rely less on solving the interviewer's algo problem
[2:42:30] Tech: They want to see your processes
[2:42:30] Moobot: Come join the Waffle House discord https://discord.gg/G5FeeveP3c and chat with the community! Remember to link your Twitch account in the Settings (gear) > Connections for subscriber channels.
[2:42:44] hadrised: i think its a good idea for critical thinking, but its so overused that everyone memorizes the techniques and does hundreds of leetcodes...
[2:42:50] Opsidill: Brute force is fine if you can iterate on top of it or provide insight on how to improve
[2:42:54] weightmaker: who are you talking about?
[2:42:54] colinbobolin: its important to be efficient when working at scale
[2:43:01] Janzert: Skip the interview and build your own SaaS business ;)
[2:43:04] itsfilipoficial: They want to see how you would approach and fix a problem more than the solution
[2:43:04] RationalLies: sometimes the brute force comes with serious draw backs
[2:43:05] Tech: Yeah, I mean it depends on the job
[2:43:06] Ace_Runn3r: depending on the job a brute force would be bad
[2:43:09] ShellingFord55: it's not that silly, if you can't produce optimized code then that's the problem for certain companies
[2:43:09] Mka696: as dumb as I find leet code to be for hiring, it's better than Google's old "how many golfballs can you fit in a 744?" questions
[2:43:14] m3lm4n: i've been working as android dev for 10 years now in a bunch of companies, and in my experiance you only get leetcode kind questions in interviews in huge corporations, everyone else is pretty chill :)
[2:43:14] peetur_: @colinbobolin you can optimize from first solve
[2:43:24] Apparentthreat: who's that techlead guy KEKW
[2:43:27] Mka696: 747*
[2:43:43] Janzert: yes
[2:43:45] isot0nic: is not silly, if you`re writing code to detect pedestrians on the road you need to be certain about what the camera sees, you cant be hacky about it
[2:43:47] Drobotic: yes
[2:43:48] punkgeek: I've seen that, yeah
[2:43:50] Mka696: yeah they use to ask teaser and riddle questions
[2:43:52] Tech: Doing riddles and brain teasers were common LUL
[2:44:00] RamseyRinehaus: i got asked "how many quarters would it take to stack to the top of the empire state building" at VistaPrint and failed the interview cuz i got it wrong
[2:44:01] Invariantly: What is that question supposed to tell you about somone? I got asked how many blades of grass are on the campus
[2:44:02] Nilau: What does that even mean
[2:44:04] m3lm4n: they don't want the answer, just to see how you go about working it out
[2:44:07] Drobotic: it's to get you to show how you would think about solving it
[2:44:11] ItsOnMax: freight or passenger plane? YEP
[2:44:13] zachonius: Beard game is strong today dude
[2:44:15] itsfilipoficial: The best google question is how would you jump out of a blender if you where the size of a fly
[2:44:20] Tech: We basically hire the same way as Amazon
[2:44:48] Galeswift: It's to mimic someone asking you to estimate costs for something.. like "How many servers do you think we will need at launch of our game"
[2:45:00] brenner1265: Talk like you normally would jsut to hear the difference
[2:45:00] Tech: Lemme see something
[2:45:17] DaGMC: You should avoid the big corps.
[2:45:44] UltraScientism: streaming persona
[2:45:50] Tech: This is how interviews go at Amazon/Amazon Subs https://amazon.jobs/en/internal/landing_pages/interviewing-at-amazon#onlineapp

[2:46:51] stormzwest: french for me, then english KEKW
[2:46:54] Tech: So basically it's a phone interview
[2:46:54] StOrMy1100: I also got spanish
[2:46:54] Ace_Runn3r: it says internal in the URL
[2:47:05] Tech: Then you get called back for In person interviews
[2:47:07] UltraScientism: Well texas was part of mexico...
[2:47:17] Ace_Runn3r: Sounds like my hiring process
[2:47:19] MrCoolBlueKid: intranet ?
[2:47:22] RamseyRinehaus: VPN?
[2:47:23] UECNSNemesis: YEP still got that

[2:47:29] DrSnydes: VPN
[2:47:30] Ace_Runn3r: I got to skip phone tho :p thank yo college
[2:47:30] Tech: In Person interviews are each for a specific topic.
[2:47:30] M1k3D3l7a: you mean openVPN the program?
[2:47:30] Apparentthreat: imagine not being on SSO
[2:47:34] RationalLies: yep, was true a year ago too
[2:47:36] SirT0ad: fuck cisco
[2:47:36] DecoyOcelot: active directory/domain/vpn/sso lot of different things for that

[2:48:49] gingerrsss: Thankfully we never have to use credential servers for our software so i can do 99% of work without the VPN LULW
[2:48:51] Guydudeman3: Solidworks is PogChamp

[2:49:09] Trsg_craig: can we get a translator in here
[2:49:18] UltraScientism: the spider waifu has two cute anthropomorphic eyes, kinda a cop out

[2:55:53] Tech: Not to totally go back, but this is the interview FAQ for amzn https://www.amazon.jobs/en/landing_pages/interviewing-at-amazon#onlineapp
[2:55:59] Tech: The actual link LUL
[2:56:04] RedalousTheRed: So
[2:56:16] drock223: I work there now leggooooooooooo
[2:56:20] Robohornet: Thats what i had with that prof. He was a former research mathematician specializing in graph theory and he got tired of the politics of research and went to teach at the local community college
[2:56:22] HostileLogOut: @Giantwaffle i got my bachelor 3 days ago as a software developer
[2:56:26] punkgeek: I do not want to work for amazon, they've approached me though
[2:56:35] drock223: You want the insider packet?
[2:56:41] Jedidude77: Wow I work Amazon and I'm not sure I could do this
[2:56:46] Tech: Interview is the chunky one
[2:56:52] Tech: STAR is the best and I love it IMO
[2:56:58] ShellingFord55: @Giantwaffle for AWS it's more important to know how to answer behaviour questions, tech questions are a bit less important
[2:57:01] BlueberryKing: monkaS
[2:57:16] NewFutureTech: AWS kills jobs.  dont work for amazon..  I had a bunch of people laid off due to automation. AWS is 10x more expansive then on premises hardware, so once it is setup they have to fire the employees to keep up with the costs.
[2:57:16] Tech: It's behavior based on what you did before
[2:57:20] Stellrow: what is that interview,mine was alot chiller for soft dev
[2:57:22] Tech: Not prove yourself now
[2:57:25] Banana_Pizza_Enjoyer: amazon job interviews is its own bachelors KEKW
[2:57:28] Pine_Noir: I hate STAR questions
[2:57:47] usernameNull: lol, @NewFutureTech3D named for future tech complaining about automation
[2:57:48] Larklen: 🤓 👆 Tip: Bring a bottle to relieve yourself in, this will help reduce stress.
[2:58:13] RedalousTheRed: My last final of undergrad was for the hardest class I had to do the entire four years. The last day was a "final" where we sat around and talked for two hours about anything but analysis (double major in math and compsci here) and all of us students passed several flaskas around and left trashed
[2:58:19] Tech: Those are the exact questions I was basically asked
[2:58:23] NordESA: How did SnowRunning go? Any more today? danHmm
[2:58:32] Tech: They are asking questions about things you actually do in the workplace
[2:58:35] drock223: I did process improvements for mine

[2:58:38] TheOnlyGremlin: PogChamp
[2:58:38] punkgeek: perfect answer
[2:58:38] AzureTail: Pog
[2:58:48] punkgeek: hire this man, amazon
[2:58:51] NewFutureTech: yea, we went from 20k a month servers, to 120k a month servers for the same setup... developers had to go!
[2:58:59] drock223: @Tech are you an SDE or TPM?
[2:59:08] Tech: sde
[2:59:10] drock223: TPM interview was worse imo
[2:59:16] drock223: (I failed lol)
[2:59:16] punkgeek: It's more about figuring out how people think about/approach problems
[2:59:21] Larklen: The biggest thing is a lot of people don't like to "sell themselves", I have found anyways
[2:59:44] Tech: They talk about the technical in more depth as well
[2:59:45] NordESA: I did that for a LD job interview, very interesting :D
[2:59:55] Tech: https://www.amazon.jobs/en/landing_pages/software-development-topics
[3:00:01] NewFutureTech: don't work for any company that uses AWS
[3:00:18] DaGMC: does it need to be Picasso Level? Kappa
[3:00:35] paulpkpk: LULW
[3:00:41] Stillglade: all my interviews are in pseudo code

[3:01:34] coolcake2: hey amazon, im very good at minecraft command block coding. can you hire me?
[3:01:37] Hibame: Thats rust
[3:01:42] Tech: But to answer your question, I never went through the Amazon interview process
[3:01:42] itsIffy: Dart and Flutter, or Rust
[3:01:42] Collectorftw: the only language I'm good at is English
[3:01:45] ItsOnMax: 3101 new languages
[3:01:48] DaGMC: you can also learn cobol which is really old from the 60s
[3:01:50] LordDynom: That's Rust lang
[3:01:54] paulpkpk: Redstone engineer PogChamp
[3:01:55] dnsmcbr: Tech got in through the back door, eh?
[3:01:56] Tech: I had a phone interview and 3 in person interviews during the curse days
[3:02:00] MrHashbrowns: my favorite are the job ads that ask for more experience than the age of the language they need
[3:02:03] Nilau: Also nobody can interview you because nobody except you knows the language PogChamp
[3:02:05] The_Holas: nope they want 5 year of exp when language is out LUL
[3:02:07] Apparentthreat: Command block coding is more like coding now anyway NotLikeThis
[3:02:11] CoolReal: I'm a better English speaker than Native Language speaker
[3:02:11] Stellrow: oh god AI
[3:02:14] Tech: I was hired on as a contractor since I was 20 in Uni, and didn't have to interview to FTE
[3:02:16] NordESA: I legit scripted a complex randomized code and keypad for a level and used it as part of my interview for my current job :D
[3:02:20] Bow_Shock: Although the language existed like 6 months, still 2y experience
[3:02:27] NordESA: As one of the things I'm most proud of.
[3:02:28] DaGMC: guys learn COBOL it will be required in the next years
[3:02:34] RamseyRinehaus: contract to hire can be somewhat common
[3:02:47] DaGMC: most of the COBOL devs died with the dinosaurs
[3:02:56] Tech: If you were actually interested in amzn, learn nosql
[3:03:07] Stillglade: at Google, all the interview questions were data structures
[3:03:09] artykQBR: I work doing COBOL lol
[3:03:10] CoolReal: I had a class that was all about Data Structures in uni
[3:03:32] gingerrsss: YEP
[3:03:34] Tech: Stuff like that, yeha
[3:03:50] QuesoBad0nga: Hashes uses a lot of memory comapred to Linked Lists for example
[3:03:52] AtchTwoOh: I didn't have any, now in my last year
[3:03:55] Ebonmourn: and how much memory data types use up and what not
[3:03:59] DaGMC: @rtykQBR good to see you alive ;-) you are driving our assurances/pensions and so more, thx <3
[3:04:07] coolcake2: bitcoing
[3:04:07] 0x000000: for nodes
[3:04:09] Tech: Making a Crypto Currency KappaHD
[3:04:10] TelRehiad: tree structures
[3:04:10] BasedLemur: Blockchain LUL
[3:04:12] DaGMC: Menu Structures
[3:04:13] LordDynom: Data structures you only learn by doing
[3:04:14] macchete: macchete subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 24 months! 
[3:04:15] BurnedAether: Just fast insertion
[3:04:18] QuesoBad0nga: Are bad in some cases good in other cases
[3:04:18] Hibame: Yes, data structures are criminally under taught in college
[3:04:19] Chronoes: KEKW
[3:04:19] BurnedAether: That's it
[3:04:20] Tech: KEKW
[3:04:23] paulpkpk: KEKW
[3:04:25] AtchTwoOh: a queue
[3:04:33] QuesoBad0nga: also you can combine data structres like linked lists inside hashes
[3:04:33] Ace_Runn3r: if you dont have a lot of memory
[3:04:34] S3l33ngrab: Linked lists are good when you have frequent insertion or deletion in the middle of the list
[3:04:42] maca134: when you dont know the total length, link list works
[3:04:44] TelRehiad: they aren't usually
[3:04:46] CoolReal: My course is more about Software Engineering rather than Coding, I hate it
[3:04:47] colinbobolin: not linked lists
[3:04:48] DrSnydes: just with how you pop and push to it
[3:04:48] artykQBR: @DaGMC Haha I'm 29, I guess I am the future of COBOL LUL
[3:04:50] 0x000000: depends on implementation
[3:04:51] QwyIl: Linked lists are mostly for teaching the ideas of references to compsci 101 students imo.
[3:04:52] ShellingFord55: they use linked list under it
[3:04:55] coolcake2: @Giantwaffle you are somewhat rightm linked lists are border line uselss
[3:04:55] Janzert: they can be built on top of a linked list
[3:05:00] Ebonmourn: i mean any list that you have to go through in its entriety like a list of objects to update would work for linked lists
[3:05:00] m3lm4n: you can use a linked list to implement a queue
[3:05:03] drock223: LIFO
[3:05:05] coolcake2: LIFO
[3:05:06] philipkatis: The way you access the data is different. They could be implemented as a linked list. @Giantwaffle
[3:05:09] QuesoBad0nga: every structure has its beneffits and flaws
[3:05:15] Mka696: I mean queues can be implemented with a linked list or an array
[3:05:19] Sanduckchan: fifo/lifo
[3:05:20] DaGMC: @Giantwaffle if you are interested in Data Types you should try to implement it yourself
[3:05:32] ThomK114: Stack Lifo,
[3:05:36] Ballioli: Queue and stack are abstract data structures.
[3:05:40] BasedLemur: You will very rarely find a problem best solved by a linked list. They're generally an inefficient data structure
[3:05:43] AtchTwoOh: fifo is queue
[3:05:44] CoolReal: Stack is good for html-like verifications
[3:05:55] Stellrow: oh god im trying to relax after the week not have a headache KEKW
[3:06:01] BaTu016: 2 hours later Kappa
[3:06:14] BlainL: @Stellrow you came to the wrong place
[3:06:15] CoolReal: <><\>
[3:06:29] AzureTail: First in last out would be a stack
[3:06:33] m3lm4n: but why would you use red-black trees :P
[3:06:37] Larklen: <blink> YEP
[3:06:37] mechoriet: KEKW css
[3:06:37] Moobot: You can find Waffle's Youtube channel here - https://youtube.com/giantwaffle
[3:06:45] Bow_Shock: I backseated the steam dynamo thing, went AFK for an hour, and you’re still not finished LUL
[3:06:52] coolcake2: but is there a better alternative?
[3:06:53] QwyIl: Have you seen tailwind css? It's really cool
[3:06:53] mechoriet: YEP sass or scss way better :)
[3:06:53] Chronoes: What, CSS is amazing compared to other GUI styling tools
[3:06:58] colinbobolin: red black trees are a fun implementation challenge
[3:07:03] Larklen: @Bow_Shock dont worry, we sidetracked for about an hour KEKW
[3:07:04] mechoriet: and just let it generate the messy stuff
[3:07:08] CoolReal: This is the content we come here for
[3:07:16] DaGMC: @rtykQBR good to hear that someone is learning COBOL. I talked to some old COBOL devs, they're nice and maybe smarter because of the limited resources for Mainframe dev
[3:07:21] mechoriet: pepeLaugh
[3:07:22] John_Seaman: KEKW
[3:07:23] colinbobolin: css sucks ass
[3:07:25] Bow_Shock: I love you waffle
[3:07:28] Stellrow: my god how much?
[3:07:36] DatoPotatoDato: god damn
[3:07:36] Invariantly: im so lazy, i use bootstrap every time
[3:07:41] Jedidude77: that sounds like something's wrong
[3:07:51] SirT0ad: we're learning Processing in my comp sci class
[3:07:54] K3ll06s: efficent css ist to use modern features and labeling your html elements
[3:07:55] DaGMC: @Giantwaffle do you know kkrieger 96kb demo ?
[3:07:56] Tech: CSS is rough, but a good base is so worth it for a site
[3:07:58] psyco_oe: Why not just use like bootstrap
[3:07:59] skokpo: yeah
[3:07:59] Stellrow: for me css is mostly trial and error
[3:08:00] HostileLogOut: @Invariantly thats not lazy through. thats just efficent use of a good template
[3:08:05] K3ll06s: display grid PogChamp
[3:08:06] BlueberryKing: This also shows how much Unity does for you
[3:08:13] skokpo: why dont you use a css framework @Giantwaffle
[3:08:14] Tech: No
[3:08:16] Tech: I have not!
[3:08:17] coolcake2: I once had to make a JAVA GUI for my uni course. IT. WAS. HELL
[3:08:25] Tech: Pog!
[3:08:27] Stellrow: my god its beautyfull
[3:08:27] Tech: Web Dev Pog
[3:08:34] SirT0ad: processing seems kinda pointless to me right now
[3:08:36] paulpkpk: PogChamp
[3:08:42] SyriiAdvent: responsive
[3:08:45] punkgeek: responsive
[3:08:47] AzureTail: responsive
[3:08:48] John_Seaman: Responsive
[3:08:48] DaGMC: responsive
[3:08:49] x1xamen: responsive
[3:08:50] HostileLogOut: @Giantwaffle what language did you use? for backend if any?
[3:08:51] Tech: I dig it
[3:08:52] DaGMC: do you use svelte ?
[3:08:53] DigitalVortex92: No
[3:08:59] BasedLemur: Responsive means you can resize your window and it still looks nice
[3:09:02] punkgeek: that's what responsive means
[3:09:04] Chronoes: No, responsive is that it fits any screen size
[3:09:04] AtchTwoOh: responsive is changing in function of the width
[3:09:08] Borandus: responsive
[3:09:09] DigitalVortex92: Responsive is based on what happens depending on window size/resolution
[3:09:12] BurnedAether: yeah the mobile vs desktop is what makes it responsive
[3:09:14] Buige: @Giantwaffle  whats ur linkedin?
[3:09:16] BasedLemur: Yea that's responsive
[3:09:16] loganpod2000: @giantwaffle you going to create merch to eventually sell?
[3:09:18] GameDadel: enbed twitch stream?
[3:09:22] weightmaker: are you using bootstrap?
[3:09:23] myfriendoatmeal: Your name at the top isn’t responsive on mobile LUL it gets cut off on the sides
[3:09:28] BennyF_Jr: is this using bootstrap?
[3:09:28] Ace_Runn3r: I hate that
[3:09:29] colinbobolin: what framework did you use?
[3:09:34] DatoPotatoDato: @Giantwaffle was this all made from scratch or did u use a template?
[3:09:37] Stellrow: native mobile app when? Pog
[3:09:40] Borandus: the mobile adjustment is the responsive nature
[3:09:42] SyriiAdvent: im a lead software engineer, you did pretty good for a first time, who cares what tutorial you used waffleAYAYA
[3:09:49] colinbobolin: sick
[3:09:50] Buige: @Giantwaffle  because ur linkedin isnt working
[3:09:50] panchi64: It's probably overflowing due to a set text size?
[3:09:55] colinbobolin: I'd hire you
[3:09:56] Tech: Using something like bootstrap or tailwind even is faster
[3:10:07] Tech: but it's way better to just do it from scratch to learn and get exactly what you want
[3:10:10] DaGMC: yeah
[3:10:14] Ace_Runn3r: there are websites that are so broken in mobile view and when I request desktop it doesnt change because of width lol
[3:10:22] BennyF_Jr: f that, I just use bootstrap lol
[3:10:24] DaGMC: you should use a framework
[3:10:28] BasedLemur: Monolithic css file monkaS
[3:10:31] HostileLogOut: bootstrap is great. and fast to use
[3:10:34] msfWEBdude: vscode lets you section your css into regions if it gets too long to manage or read
[3:10:35] BlueberryKing: There is something beatiful to vanilla html/css
[3:10:39] Stellrow: i love using react with typescript rly similar to oop
[3:10:50] Xerxex_: "i hate javascript" me: programs in javascript daily for my job....
[3:10:51] DigitalVortex92: React for this would be stupid overkill LUL
[3:10:55] yasboyy: for a website this simple, bootstrap isn't necessary (
[3:10:55] Tech: LUL
[3:10:55] DaGMC: we use sveltkit and bootstrap
[3:11:06] DaGMC: and stylebook
[3:11:06] loganpod2000: We need merch now!!!
[3:11:07] Tech: KEKW
[3:11:09] loganpod2000: Lol
[3:11:09] Borandus: knowing basics goes a long way regardless

[3:11:29] AtchTwoOh: you you already have a chat command for the website?
[3:11:29] BennyF_Jr: @yasboyy bootstrap is simple. It isn't just for a complex site
[3:11:33] macchete: LUL
[3:11:35] officialhunterx: what was that website
[3:11:36] Tech: and for a big brand, they are sick because you can change the logo for each specific section
[3:12:11] DaGMC: @BennyF_Jr you can also use bootstrap for complex sites
[3:12:27] gingerrsss: NODDERS
[3:12:28] FuzzyOmega: Isn't that an extension?
[3:12:31] DaGMC: just use a framework like vue, react or svelte
[3:12:32] BennyF_Jr: @DaGMC thats the best part <3
[3:12:32] DatoPotatoDato: live server is amazing
[3:12:33] Rozz161: look googles design principles. material design and theres a section for web
[3:12:36] SyriiAdvent: its so amusing watching people find new cool tools or features
[3:12:44] BennyF_Jr: VSCode is nuts
[3:12:45] SHAYENEK: @Giantwaffle its easier to use chrome devtools F12
[3:12:52] DatoPotatoDato: @FuzzyOmega yeah it is
[3:12:59] sogerr: VSCode is love <3
[3:13:01] DaGMC: sometimes you need a webserver
[3:13:01] Tech: hot-reload is amazing for iteration on sites
[3:13:05] 3DExtended: your linked in profile is not linked :D
[3:13:09] DaGMC: for certain features
[3:13:10] Sanduckchan: omg when i remember the old days.. having a local or even remote webserver .. save upload .. fuck that :D
[3:13:30] John_Seaman: KEKW
[3:13:39] RamseyRinehaus: you would love being an ops person, forget this dev stuff
[3:13:39] Tech: Did you at least make use of CSS variables?
[3:13:46] DatoPotatoDato: i dont blame u KEKW
[3:13:50] Tech: KEKW
[3:13:51] DaGMC: CSS is much better than <font face > shit from 1996
[3:13:51] Tech: LUL
[3:13:53] Sanduckchan: KEKW
[3:13:56] K3ll06s: if you really define of dynamic content thats nothing :D

[3:13:57] artykQBR: KEKW
[3:13:59] Jedidude77: don't worry about css variables
[3:14:00] AtchTwoOh: media keys
[3:14:16] Tech: Just quality of life, not important :D
[3:14:17] Jedidude77: you could probably benifit from more efficient classes
[3:14:23] marcel40625: Your Linked IN is not linked! :D
[3:14:36] DaGMC: with bootstrap it would have taken you just 2hrs
[3:14:41] loganpod2000: Waffle will you have merch now?
[3:14:41] K3ll06s: bem is a really cool html/css concept
[3:14:41] Moobot: Come join the Waffle House discord https://discord.gg/G5FeeveP3c and chat with the community! Remember to link your Twitch account in the Settings (gear) > Connections for subscriber channels.
[3:14:59] DaGMC: selecotr

[3:15:03] BlueberryKing: Emmet?
[3:15:03] FundamentalsRL: Weird question but, What brand are your black shirts?
[3:15:05] DaGMC: CSS selector
[3:15:10] wandataco: VSCode gives you so many shortcuts as soon as you type its awesome
[3:15:10] SyriiAdvent: its called emmet
[3:15:20] 0omkins: open source it
[3:15:31] DaGMC: and small errors can change the behaviour
[3:15:36] Chronoes: see why everybody shills now, Waffle? KEKW
[3:15:42] Chronoes: VSCode now*
[3:15:49] IchaTV: i like Techs idea of open sourceing ur website to us
[3:15:50] BlueberryKing: Also makes you feel like a hacker when you type 5 symbols and get like 8 lines of code EZ
[3:16:06] DatoPotatoDato: do u still plan on adding more to ur site? @Giantwaffle

[3:46:40] Bolt_Vanderhuge_: translation: this is making us a shit load of money so we're turning a blind eye to our own rules
[3:46:45] DaGMC: and it also attracts misbheaviour in the chat
[3:46:46] ShionSinX: but half-naked people IS FINE, so what gives?
[3:46:47] robsta107: waffle with shirt off will be too sexual for everyone
[3:46:49] Allmostdone: Well Twitch and everyone else in America
[3:46:50] Tech: It's the same thing as how movies and games do it
[3:46:52] Bulva: they saying this much sexuality acceptable because the money we earn is good enough
[3:46:53] Syrun3: Waffle hot tub when?
[3:46:54] Tradios: Twitch loves grey areas so they can cherry pick who gets a ban and who doesn't
[3:46:57] Surge43: Just turn off your face cam. lol
[3:47:00] OMICRON: at the end of the day no one making anyone watch those streams..
[3:47:00] IchaTV: subathon for a shirtless waffle stream?
[3:47:01] RamseyRinehaus: you in that black tshirt and balck jeans in a hottub would be hilarious tho
[3:47:05] Nexhunter: Just hire a bunch of ultra orthodox religious folks and the rules will be enforced fully mehdiLAUGH
[3:47:05] DaGMC: or attracts donations with the wrong motivation
[3:47:08] Abbiethecat: what we need to do is get men in the tub an  maybe people will see how silly it is
[3:47:09] ShionSinX: BY THE WAY, YOU CANT SHOW FEET
[3:47:15] fafuja: so what is sexually suggestive to twitch again?
[3:47:15] Moobot: Come join the Waffle House discord https://discord.gg/G5FeeveP3c and chat with the community! Remember to link your Twitch account in the Settings (gear) > Connections for subscriber channels.
[3:47:28] Freeflyer99: So its exactly the same, just a different category?
[3:47:33] Nexhunter: @abbiethecat those streams made them bank
[3:47:34] itsIffy: PogChamp get suspended
[3:47:39] DaGMC: twitches policies are weired and not speaking about bans is on of it
[3:47:39] itsIffy: no more ads PogChamp
[3:47:40] SyriiAdvent: @Freeflyer99 ye
[3:47:43] AnesthesiaFC: ads dont make streamers a lot of money though?
[3:47:44] ThistleCrown: oh. well it makes more sense now
[3:47:45] KekPek_: nsfw category inc PogChamp
[3:47:48] Goodmangammering: hot tub streams wont have normal ads lmao
[3:47:54] n8level: been happening on Youtube for a long time, advertisers excluding categories
[3:47:57] Invalidm_: I find you extremely handsome and I think it's sexually suggestive waffle
[3:47:58] ShionSinX: @AnesthesiaFC no, ads make Twitch a lot of money
[3:47:59] bismarcksd: @Tech Am I understanding it right, from reading that, it says that if Twitch removes the ability for a streamer to get ad revenue, then no ads will ever roll on their stream???
[3:47:59] tylerfivek: hot tub streams gonna have ads for trojans now
[3:48:01] SyriiAdvent: why do they care if they can have aads? there all selling onlyfans anyways
[3:48:01] YukiBloodbornGaming: cant tell you how many trojan commercials ive seen here
[3:48:06] Alsabatini: hit tub streams about to have p-hub adds
[3:48:07] Surge43: What kind of ads will I get on hot tub streams?
[3:48:07] Abbiethecat: @Nexhunter dam really
[3:48:10] n8level: gaming chat LUL
[3:48:12] Nexhunter: @invalidm_ well we gotta ban waffle now
[3:48:28] S3l33ngrab: So when can I use my Twitch Sub on ph? LUL
[3:48:30] Nexhunter: @abbiethecat yea was Cyr, Esfand and that group of folks
[3:48:30] retrogamewizard: twitch promoting fapertainment  instead of video game related streams
[3:48:36] DaGMC: justintv
[3:48:37] Opsidill: I think it's smart to expand outside of gaming
[3:48:43] HusVen: HeyGuys
[3:48:46] Nexhunter: KEKW
[3:48:49] Apparentthreat: Waffle when is your debut hot tub stream?
[3:48:51] Tech: @bismarcksd Can't really answer questions like this for you. Happy to help with general questions, I just stick away from stances and specifics like this
[3:48:53] OMICRON: you either adapt or get left behind
[3:48:56] sonorantoad: Dude there’s even a gambling category now
[3:48:58] Allmostdone: To much space stuff is gonna be banned!
[3:49:00] Tech: Yes, exactly
[3:49:02] itsIffy: Social drama platform FeelsBadMan
[3:49:04] ShionSinX: twitch wants you to stay here for your fap sessions instead of going to the streamers OF HahaThink
[3:49:06] KeplersConjecture: This sounds familliar, reminds me of someplace called JustinTV or something...
[3:49:06] Nilau: I'm curious as to what will happen if a minor happens to do a hottub stream. Twtich will surely end up in some weird news and take a hit
[3:49:15] deviantdeviations: twitch pornhub cooperation when
[3:49:16] LegoCoin: Amazon wants it to be more like Youtube
[3:49:21] johnny_dan: The return of JustinTV
[3:49:27] bismarcksd: lol ok @Tech thanks.
[3:49:29] Invalidm_: we need competition
[3:49:30] LegoCoin: I wonder if Youtube allows Hot Tub streams?
[3:49:30] tylerfivek: thats literally what that hot tub shit is lol
[3:49:34] botmaniac: twitchurbate
[3:49:36] Tithonius: the new catagory does give advertisers a place and section to narrow focus to
[3:49:37] SeeAGamer: Do you remember when twitch said streamers was to be primary game related, with the odd other thing, now it's the reverse.
[3:49:38] fafuja: eyah...
[3:49:38] Collin3388: justintv was not gaming WeirdChamp
[3:49:39] Wetware: Programming, Crypto, Stones, SpaceX and once in a while, some games LUL
[3:49:39] KekPek_: gachiBASS
[3:49:42] LegoCoin: Just WHAT EVER LUL
[3:49:45] mechoriet: KEKW new categories: pools, hottubs, beaches KEKW
[3:49:52] LegoCoin: just nsfw LUL
[3:49:53] DaGMC: one day twitch will have more policies than a country has bills
[3:49:55] Thornblade_: Every streaming platform is a slippery slope to porn
[3:49:57] Abbiethecat: @Nexhunter ya but i feel thats not the same as some of the other hot tubers. we need to get men with OF accounts lol
[3:49:59] AnesthesiaFC: pornhub live?
[3:49:59] Opsidill: Na, they'll keep it PG. No way there's an NSFW section
[3:50:01] Sanduckchan: it probably will
[3:50:04] Sanduckchan: because sex > gaming
[3:50:04] ShionSinX: you can keep gaming, but naked @Giantwaffle
[3:50:05] paulpkpk: just put a NSFW category LULW
[3:50:07] Tech: Wait, honest question on your view point. How is this different than Youtube content?
[3:50:07] produkteriswf: holy shit, live hentai Kappa
[3:50:08] Invalidm_: 100% yes
[3:50:08] IchaTV: i'd be down for a nsfw part of twitch
[3:50:10] RamseyRinehaus: i dont see it going that far, but we're definitely going to be on the edge of it for a while here
[3:50:11] zero3juan: slippery slope, yes
[3:50:14] madseed15: @Giantwaffle Relate this to how apple forces discord to do a thing to it's NSFW section
[3:50:19] Wetware: stones? dammit autocorrect! stonks
[3:50:23] Abbiethecat: twichurbate?
[3:50:25] Tithonius: @Tech youtube sucks Kappa
[3:50:28] SyriiAdvent: yes it would, look at tiktok. all these pool streamers have 1 link away advertising there onlyfans
[3:50:29] Hengo: I dislike those reactions streams
[3:50:34] Gelil: Yes, and Yes. Porn is a multi billion dollar business. Twitch is a multi million dollar busines.
[3:50:36] DaGMC: YT has also naked content 18+ stuff
[3:50:36] KeplersConjecture: Probably will. Just look at the top streams and you will see the type of content the Twitch and their audience wants
[3:50:38] Opsidill: A PG livestreaming platform
[3:50:39] Murfles: they got rid of the travel catagory to replace it with hot tubs LUL
[3:50:39] itsIffy: moderation is pretty bad on twitch, it's a bit skewed.
[3:50:42] paulpkpk: yep
[3:50:43] ThistleCrown: I don't know, the argument needs more traction
[3:50:49] Abbiethecat: so true waffle
[3:50:59] Opsidill: It has happened in the past
[3:51:03] Tabakhase: ^^
[3:51:03] paulpkpk: True
[3:51:08] DaGMC: definitely
[3:51:09] blisteringcold: @Tech  but twitch cannot become a second youtube, i don't think it can compete with it
[3:51:09] fafuja: true.
[3:51:16] Invalidm_: I agree
[3:51:16] Bulva: @Tech youtube hide those "contents" really good in their search algorithms but on twitch its like front of your eyes
[3:51:18] DaGMC: you cant learn
[3:51:24] Ghost0447: do you think they need hard guidelines?
[3:51:27] Tech: Is it inconsistency, or the difficulty in changing policy?
[3:51:35] LegoCoin: Trasparency of a FOG LUL
[3:51:35] DaGMC: there is no process where anybody is involved like in court
[3:51:36] ShionSinX: twitch, just like youtube, will NEVER be transparent because then people will walk just on top of the line
[3:51:45] Gelil: Have the increased the age of creator accounts?
[3:51:51] Opsidill: Inconsistency in how they enforce their policy as well
[3:51:54] Tech: Like the biggest thing that I see with this is that we changed it to a coverage policy vs a context based policy
[3:51:56] OMICRON: aka backasswards
[3:51:58] S3l33ngrab: Inconsistency comes from lack of communication about why certain things changed
[3:51:59] Abbiethecat: twitch see what sex sells an are money hungry i feel
[3:52:02] Tech: and people still reference the old rules for why stuff shouldn't be on here
[3:52:03] DaGMC: YT is fucked with content id copyright system
[3:52:13] Allmostdone: So we want democracy or totaltaism
[3:52:18] Little_Lady_Lauren: waffle your looking overly sexy and your not banned. nothing to worry about
[3:52:24] Alsabatini: I love twitch because it give viewers a way to directly interact with their favorite creators. but also at the same time some of the things that twitch does turns me off the platform
[3:52:24] fafuja: seems like Steam when people try to sell nsfw games.. so inconsistent
[3:52:26] IchaTV: wait there a nude beaches and there public does this mean if u go to that beach you can stream nude
[3:52:26] Allmostdone: people are not logical
[3:52:38] OMICRON: i come back for the fireplace
[3:52:43] ShionSinX: twitch itself has no content, streamers do
[3:52:51] Gelil: Did they increase the age of creator accounts to match this change?
[3:52:51] Allmostdone: nude beaches not in America
[3:52:52] daemonaedryn: But this "policy" is massively based on the person deciding on it, theyve essentially said we decide whats sexually suggestive, so even if something is obviously sexual but we dont want to see it that way, we'll ignore it
[3:52:52] DaGMC: and YT also fucks up content creators like demonetization with COPA stuff
[3:52:59] OMICRON: cohhCV
[3:53:12] mongolianbhop: chinks
[3:53:12] n8level: sorry, what's going on? I was distracted by this really good article I'm reading in this month's Playboy Kappa
[3:53:14] Nexhunter: @DaemonSzyman yeah we should have ultra orthodox religious grandmas decide Kappa
[3:53:14] ShionSinX: @fafuja Sisterly Lust, Being a DIK AppaK
[3:53:23] CursedEvil: $$$
[3:53:27] daemonaedryn: @Nexhunter The babushka is never wrong Kappa
[3:53:31] Opsidill: People don't like change and will argue over anything lol
[3:53:32] IchaTV: ayyy we could get an AOC hottub stream with nancy pelosi
[3:53:34] Nexhunter: people are being puritanical assholes though
[3:53:39] SpookyClips: Twitch will get a nude category soon cause they care about money more than their own rumor...
[3:53:40] OMICRON: your never going to satisfy everyone
[3:53:40] Invalidm_: so what exactly were we reading btw
[3:53:45] Tech: Policy is impossible
[3:53:47] Sacratoy: IRL was a mistake
[3:53:49] OMICRON: at the end of the day you just gotta yolo
[3:53:49] Tech: because people will always hate it
[3:53:49] DaGMC: content creators are just cheap solutions to lurk us into the big coorps database
[3:53:49] Nexhunter: like a bit of ankle and oh lordy twitch is going to the devil
[3:53:53] Tithonius: @Invalidm_ twitch announcement
[3:53:59] haradok: policy ~ politics
[3:54:02] Invalidm_: oh ok
[3:54:03] Sir_Medis: people are habit creatures, change is no fun
[3:54:06] Allmostdone: @Nexhunter Do you remember a program called Cyber Patrol?
[3:54:07] DaGMC: data is the gold of this century
[3:54:07] Sir_Medis: thats the problem
[3:54:08] CommanderUrsus: peeps don't like change either
[3:54:09] DaGMC: or oil
[3:54:11] S3l33ngrab: Twitch is all about community - just let viewers categorize content by vote and let viewers decide what kind they want to see at all, what could go wrong? LUL
[3:54:14] Invalidm_: i thought it was from elsewhere
[3:54:14] infucio: ever though ove jumping onto other platform ?
[3:54:15] Abbiethecat: what are we drinking??
[3:54:17] LegoCoin: I say just do what you want and let it fall where it will LUL
[3:54:17] Tech: I mean it's the same way even the government works
[3:54:17] Arcunas: the only issue i have with the hot tub streamer thing, is will underage girls be banned instantly or not
[3:54:20] Sacratoy: voting is bad
[3:54:30] Nexhunter: @Allmostdone isn't that some filtering bullshit
[3:54:36] haradok: !modpack
[3:54:37] Moobot: Waffle is playing Omnifactory. Check out the mod list at curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/omnifactory
[3:54:38] ItsOnMax: Almost June Kappa
[3:54:39] SmurfzEdits: this is literally the most chill stream ngl
[3:54:46] Tech: Well it's a decent example because everyone deals with it
[3:54:47] peetur_: make a hottub category and let me block it
[3:54:49] cora1414: yo @Giantwaffle  should i be worried about bitcoin dropping again BibleThump blzd5head
[3:54:52] The_Holas: i mean every change is bad in users eyes cause is mostly controvercial or non consistent ...
[3:54:56] DaGMC: something like overwatch system in CS would be nice
[3:54:57] LegoCoin: Next Riot on the Capitol will be about Hot Tub Streams LUL
[3:54:57] Nexhunter: well the biggest issue is how many users and there you have that many definitions of sexual KEKW
[3:54:58] Tech: It's inescapable and it's just part of the push and pull of moving forward
[3:55:01] Ghost0447: tech are you working rn or are you off?
[3:55:10] Melinkie: wait this is important.. do you make your coco with water or milk? @Giantwaffle NotLikeThis
[3:55:15] Tech: Ghost0447 off since I'm getting my second shot :d
[3:55:15] Moobot: Support Waffle by using his Epic creator code: Giantwaffle
[3:55:21] sonorantoad: @smurfzedits Waffle is an og streamer dude before this platform got weird
[3:55:25] gingerrsss: YEP
[3:55:27] Allmostdone: @Nexhunter I use to work for that company in the networking customers. The people that created that list were 70 year old women
[3:55:27] Ghost0447: goodluck PogChamp
[3:55:29] mechoriet: @Tech MONKERS good luck
[3:55:34] Nexhunter: @Allmostdone OMEGALUL
[3:55:46] Tech: My favorite thing is seeing this change for local based subs pricing
[3:55:48] daemonaedryn: There would absolutely be a Kappa tag
[3:55:48] thomasausen: what have you done so far in minecraft today ?
[3:55:52] KeplersConjecture: Most people dont know what they really want
[3:55:52] Thornblade_: That is very true, I mean really who am I? I'm just text on a screen, what the hell do I know?
[3:55:52] Tech: and people in the US going crazy about how it's not fair
[3:55:53] Sir_Medis: That's not really true Waffle
[3:55:54] Zaptan: people have no idea what they want that they can detail
[3:55:57] Fimbululfr: categoryMcCategoryFace :)
[3:56:00] Tech: When we are such a small part of the global population
[3:56:02] fafuja: "Democracy is the worst form of government, except for all the others."
[3:56:11] Collectorftw: so like glow squids.....
[3:56:11] Venxuri: When are local sub pricing changes going live?
[3:56:11] Tithonius: @Tech what is twitch doing to prevent VPN local sub pricing?
[3:56:12] SirupyCircle: boaty mcboatface, classic
[3:56:17] ThatOnneGuy: The OSRS dev team does stuff the community doesn't want quite often
[3:56:18] Sir_Medis: they make some ideas what they kinda want @Giantwaffle but only one of em gets added by people voting, so they push their own ideas to get polled by the public.
[3:56:37] Archelonde: prime subs #1 greatest twitch feature
[3:56:41] Allmostdone: @Nexhunter They had a small room up in NJ that ran 5 days a week and the lit was pushed daily
[3:56:42] Jibbur: Super user polling is often useful for direction, but shouldn't be the deciding factor, general user polling is useless
[3:56:46] Nexhunter: well UI changes for accessibility was some non income based unless you count potential lawsuit threats
[3:56:47] John_Seaman: Local sub pricing is a saver
[3:56:50] Sir_Medis: yeh
[3:56:54] Tech: @Tithonius Stuff like this is never easy to just prevent, or circumvent
[3:56:56] Sir_Medis: but u said polling is bad
[3:56:57] Tech: it's a balance
[3:56:59] Sir_Medis: which is not true
[3:56:59] Ruan_A: I hope my shit gets cheaper Sadge
[3:57:01] daemonaedryn: Im still using a prime sub KEKW
[3:57:03] Opsidill: That change (local sub pricing) is for the vviewer that doesn't subscribe
[3:57:06] Sir_Medis: since it's only THEIR ideas being polled
[3:57:07] paulpkpk: Prime sub is such a hugh addition for both streamer and viewers
[3:57:16] Tithonius: @Tech thats what i feared, dont get me wrong, its a good thing overall for sure
[3:57:21] Sir_Medis: Sorry about mixing runescape with twitch LUL
[3:57:31] Nexhunter: the real issue we have is the fact the twitch chat API keeps dropping the fucking sub and moobot snipes subs KEKW
[3:57:31] DaGMC: are the hot tub streams age restricted?
[3:57:35] sogerr: in brazil a sub is R$22.99 but amazon prime is R$9.99
[3:57:37] robsta107: santa
[3:57:37] n8level: I love the feels when I gift my amz sub to a small time streamer
[3:57:45] AshtenD: AshtenD subscribed with Prime. 
[3:57:45] Moobot: Welcome AshtenD! waffleH waffleHeart
[3:57:47] Tech: I mean if you ever think something is easy to circumvent, and it's related ot money
[3:57:51] Archelonde: I have my 1 twitch prime sub and thats it, because why not I already had amazon prime.
[3:57:53] Tech: it's probably not that easy LUL
[3:57:56] Tabakhase: thers lot of primers, but also a lot of people that sub usually have more than one PepoThink not sure how that adds up in the end
[3:58:04] AshtenD: speaking of twitch prime subs, should use that
[3:58:04] Sir_Medis: what i don't understand is that they waited 4 years since accidental 3tick blowpipe for instance, to rebalance everything @Giantwaffle
[3:58:06] fafuja: true
[3:58:11] Nexhunter: welcome to life KEKW
[3:58:17] Mackiearoni: Mackiearoni subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months! Did someone say prime
[3:58:17] DaGMC: that's sad
[3:58:20] Ghostnine: i know im late on the blackjack topic but go check out "every day at work"
[3:58:24] daemonaedryn: Greed motivates people a lot more than most other things unfortunately waffleD
[3:58:28] TheTerraner: money rules the world
[3:58:28] Allmostdone: @Nexhunter I'm proud to say Cyber Patrol took the entire New York subway system down

[3:59:49] pancakes1424: hello
[3:59:49] DaGMC: I had biontech
[3:59:51] ipyro0: what kind was your 2nd?
[3:59:52] Tapollo: My second shot I only had 1 hour that I wish I could off of work. But drinking water and eating well helped me
[3:59:53] DemonicHell3: The 2nd shot for me had 0 effect. the first shot i slept for like 16 hours
[3:59:55] Allmostdone: the symptoms are way to varied
[3:59:57] CursedEvil: I hiked all day after my shot, phizer lol
[4:00:02] Sanduckchan: had biontech day before yesterday.. felt almost nothing..
[4:00:02] robsta107: i got no side affects for the first and second shot :( i think mine was water
[4:00:06] Nexhunter: oh chat remember newest Windows 10 version dropped timmacLAUGH

[4:57:40] PureSpider: dip just means buy more lewSmile
[4:57:43] Mike190Twitch: it goes from 5, to 30% (800ish simulations)
[4:57:48] dcirusc30: if you mouse over the module it tells you the rf cost
[4:57:48] ParAd0xA: Not faster
[4:57:50] KeplersConjecture: Are you really going to trust PDX after EU4 Leviathan and Imperator: Rome sogerr?
[4:57:51] CoolReal: ML PogChamp
[4:57:51] Nilau: Not fast, the chance just goes up
[4:57:54] IEthesI: I mean you gotta remember that ADA was at 1.20 for 2.5 months above 1.20 is impressive!

[4:58:26] sogerr: @KeplersConjecture yes
[4:58:29] Kaedonshi: clay > terracotta
[4:58:30] Mike190Twitch: Macerate Cobble down to Dust, use a chemical reactor with water to make clay blocks
[4:58:35] Nilau: With the enderman thing you can make a postive feedback loop on polymers @Giantwaffle
[4:58:46] Kaedonshi: Get terracota from the buildings and break it down
[4:58:47] PxlSauce: maybe clay balls?
[4:58:48] Mike190Twitch: 3 Macerators and 1 Chemical Reactor
[4:58:50] Kaedonshi: intoclay
[4:58:54] Nilau: if you include a cobblestone generator to clay
[4:59:02] Nilau: cuz you can make the dust needed
[4:59:26] ParAd0xA: one self-aware enderman DML can run 8 SImChambers
[4:59:40] PxlSauce: maybe look at clayball recipes
[4:59:40] Moobot: Support Waffle by using his Epic creator code: Giantwaffle
[4:59:54] Nilau: There was certainly one with molten ender I think(?)
[5:00:08] Nilau: I don't have the game open rn to check it again myself
[5:00:08] Mike190Twitch: With enderpearls, you melt down to fluid and combine that with Nether Quartz to get Clathrate, smelt that to get pulsating dust
[5:00:12] dylan0806: Loot fabrication?
[5:00:15] KeplersConjecture: sogerr Then you have far more confidence in them than I do
[5:00:16] Nilau: ya there it is
[5:00:19] Wulfenst: @Giantwaffle what launcher do you use for Minecraft now? im having issues with curseforge w/ overwolf. Some reason packs I run through it pull way more resources then when I had twitch launcher.
[5:00:20] Kaedonshi: Terracotta is a super easy way to get clay and will help you through MV as well
[5:00:22] Mike190Twitch: No thats not it, that requires 1000 EU/t
[5:00:22] weightmaker: hah! look at the power required for the enderpearl dust
[5:00:28] CoolReal: Oh god it's going down monkaS
[5:00:32] paulpkpk: monkaW
[5:00:36] Mike190Twitch: @Giantwaffle thats not the way
[5:00:43] exo_pho3nix: thats EV so yeah not gonna happen anytime soon

[5:00:54] dcirusc30: resonant clathate is best way
[5:00:56] TimmPure: so much red man NotLikeThis
[5:01:00] Mike190Twitch: This is what you want to do: With enderpearls, you melt down to fluid and combine that with Nether Quartz to get Clathrate, smelt that to get pulsating dust
[5:01:02] dylan0806: @giantwaffle maybe with a loot fabricated
[5:01:04] allxrise: @Wulfenst he use multimc and i recommending to use gdlauncher
[5:01:16] AzureTail: peepoSad
[5:01:18] CoolReal: Need quartz
[5:01:26] Mike190Twitch: Quartz = Glass in a Electrolyzer
[5:01:30] sogerr: @KeplersConjecture this game will probably be a do or die for them, i doubt they will screw it up too much, my only fear is it being dumbed down too hard like CK3
[5:01:32] Nilau: You can make glass into quarz
[5:01:52] dcirusc30: you can pulverise cobble < gravel>sand > glass :)
[5:02:29] Nilau: Thats on the next test chat, write it down!
