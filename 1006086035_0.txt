[0:28:53] Ghandus: @Giantwaffle hey waffle thanks to your ldjam i also started programming again. thanks for the inspiration :D
[0:28:57] GeneraISpy: cgp grey did a great video on all of this
[0:29:11] witty_pup: I used to work 12 hr shifts and the first day off was always sleeping till 3pm
[0:29:23] witty_pup: felt wasted
[0:29:40] Vistor1001: Sunday is for F1 Kreygasm
[0:29:46] Ghandus: man if you have some video recommendation please share them
[0:29:49] QuesoBad0nga: Design patters
[0:29:53] clidump: fail early
[0:29:59] ZyianDev: fail early
[0:30:03] PossibleScam: Comments?
[0:30:08] CiVR: It’s Friday YEAHHH
[0:30:31] Stillglade: fail fast is the expression
[0:30:32] Apparentthreat: CiVR PETTHECUTIE
[0:30:34] B0bcatnation99: You’re all wonderful human beings and I hope that you’re all having a phenomenal Friday!
[0:30:38] PossibleScam: Yeah. Guards only have specific use cases though.
[0:30:41] uahuman: ==?
[0:30:46] PossibleScam: Depends on what you’re working on.
[0:30:46] Moobot: Support Waffle by using his Epic creator code: Giantwaffle
[0:30:49] AnarkaTV: earñy return
[0:30:54] DigitallyAdmiringHumanity: my man waffle
[0:30:55] AnarkaTV: early return*
[0:30:56] clidump: yeah don't waste cycles
[0:30:57] Nexhunter: it also helps with branch predictions
[0:31:14] Zighome24: ^^
[0:31:14] ZyianDev: @Giantwaffle it's an important concept for when you start learning Go
[0:31:20] Ghandus: @Giantwaffle you have some recommendations for youtube channels regarding these studies?
[0:31:25] Unicornflake_: @Giantwaffle The book Clean Code by Robert C. Martin is very good :D
[0:31:33] Wetware: I don't know, my code fails pretty fast as it is LUL
[0:31:38] mr_ladman: mr_ladman subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 43 months! 
[0:31:46] Nexhunter: just wait until you start learning low level optimizers pepeLaugh
[0:32:11] Zighome24: ^^ oof
[0:32:13] AnarkaTV: consider it as a precondition
[0:32:18] CiVR: When in the world did you have time to learn that last time
[0:32:18] n8level: intro CS programming courses should not use java, it should use the smallest arduino so that code efficiency like that is emphasized
[0:32:35] complexprotein: Never give up, you can always fail faster KEKW
[0:32:38] MiraPacku: NODDERS
[0:32:39] DecoyOcelot: 'should you be here' type logic should always be first
[0:32:46] Schimmeldude: always test vs null first, then everything else
[0:32:47] dasmako: order of operations matters for efficiency
[0:32:50] bloodylantern: chat is inting i got it :O
[0:32:59] Quinnerdude1: Quinnerdude1 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 21 months! happy pizza friday
[0:33:01] MiraPacku: Hi Chat HeyGuys
[0:33:02] Nexhunter: you also gotta think about for branching what is my most common truthful statement cause of branch predictors pepeLaugh
[0:33:15] Brianmose12: PepLaugh int isn't nullable
[0:33:41] Brianmose12: there is nullable int though
[0:33:42] Zanax__: guards are Pog
[0:33:42] brewerdc: It's called short circuiting
[0:33:46] iwattcher3: is it Java?
[0:33:48] Nexhunter: that would explode if using a compiler KEKW
[0:33:50] taurenite: no, you would want to fail immediately
[0:33:51] ZyianDev: it can be nullable if it's a pointer to an int KEKW
[0:33:55] clidump: error
[0:33:56] MagnesiumOxide: that would depend on the language
[0:33:56] brewerdc: Compile error
[0:33:58] Zighome24: @giantwaffle with a language like python there exists things called function decorators that wrap a function and allow you to apply things like guards without modifying the function itself
[0:33:59] ItsOnMax: it would not compile
[0:34:00] clidump: depending on the language
[0:34:10] Solitude411: we doing landing gamba today?
[0:34:12] brewerdc: int?
[0:34:17] Nexhunter: type gaurding is a lot more useful in duck typing
[0:34:18] ItsOnMax: GameObject can be null
[0:34:19] Brianmose12: string can be null
[0:34:19] brewerdc: "int?"
[0:34:21] RazorOPS_: String
[0:34:23] Ghandus: javascript would implicitly turn a string into int :D
[0:34:24] Flyrain: An Object can be null
[0:34:26] taurenite: any object is nullable
[0:34:26] zacouse: a var maybe?
[0:34:35] ZyianDev: primitives are usually not nullable
[0:34:36] Jerod5_: depends on the language
[0:34:37] Nexhunter: a var def can be null KEKW
[0:34:38] MagnumCopus: a good example is a list, if you try to index a list that is null then it will error
[0:34:39] twiQsP: can null be null
[0:34:41] AtchTwoOh: in python, it's a bigger problem
[0:34:42] Enymowns: "int?" is nullable
[0:34:42] PossibleScam: Anything can be null.
[0:34:44] DecoyOcelot: depends on the language, sometimes you can specify nullable like in c# its int?
[0:34:44] bloodylantern: me playing league is int thats all i know :D
[0:34:45] Nexhunter: cause a var doesn't have a type property
[0:34:52] Aarimous: @Giantwaffle The book "The Pragmatic Programmer" is a classic for writing better programs. More about the mindset you should have.
[0:34:54] Egrassa22: IDE will stop you
[0:34:55] PossibleScam: Also depends on the Lang
[0:35:07] Ghandus: compilation error
[0:35:07] Nexhunter: yes
[0:35:07] ZyianDev: compile error
[0:35:09] Brianmose12: yes
[0:35:10] ItsOnMax: Yes
[0:35:11] Flyrain: it's a different function
[0:35:11] Kroggie: in C# it wouldnt run
[0:35:11] Schimmeldude: you would test if your object is null, but you would not check if an int is null
[0:35:12] RazorOPS_: yap
[0:35:12] clidump: nullable types are handled differently in different languges
[0:35:12] brewerdc: But technical yep
[0:35:19] Entrymissing: Won't complie
[0:35:21] Zighome24: Depends on the language but most follow a zero-value pattern and for primitives it’s zero / empty and for complex objects it’s null/nullptr
[0:35:21] MagnesiumOxide: likely yes, although again, depends on language
[0:35:22] Nexhunter: that why most use vs code KEKW
[0:35:29] Apparentthreat: what happens if I instantiate an int without a value?
[0:35:34] clidump: define best
[0:35:34] Nexhunter: depends on your definition of null
[0:35:35] Schimmeldude: none
[0:35:40] PossibleScam: Compiling with sublime KEKWHD
[0:35:41] DecoyOcelot: JS is probably the worst
[0:35:41] brewerdc: Haha
[0:35:44] ooblies: javascript :D
[0:35:45] taurenite: javascript is the worst
[0:35:46] Jerod5_: js is the worst
[0:35:48] Schimmeldude: always make sure, you don't have nulls
[0:35:49] Egrassa22: null for int is just 0
[0:35:50] GeneraISpy: in C++ you could do that if u set it properly before
[0:35:52] Ghandus: @Apparentthreat undefined i guess
[0:35:55] Nexhunter: var is to skip the typing restrictions @Giantwaffle
[0:35:58] ZyianDev: var is an implicit type
[0:35:59] Entrymissing: php  is also terrible
[0:35:59] QuesoBad0nga: js
[0:35:59] brewerdc: javascript so loosy goosy
[0:36:04] Jerod5_: js
[0:36:07] Slowkill333: Golang provides "reasonable" defaults for all variables if you don't specify an initial value.
[0:36:09] Curnil: golang is pretty good with null
[0:36:12] calvinisonline: java me boy
[0:36:12] Jedidude77: javascript doesn't have hard typing
[0:36:13] Jerod5_: javascript doesnt have types
[0:36:14] clidump: are you talking about c#?
[0:36:17] Nexhunter: it is lazy as fuck
[0:36:17] Ghandus: @Giantwaffle javascript uses var because it is not typesecure
[0:36:18] Brianmose12: var in csharp is just laziness PepLaugh
[0:36:23] QuesoBad0nga: var is dead, now is let
[0:36:27] Wetware: var can get you in trouble, almost defeats the purpose of a strongly typed language
[0:36:29] RazorOPS_: I'm used to strict type definition so var is a no-go
[0:36:31] Nexhunter: @QuesoBad0nga this is c#
[0:36:33] PossibleScam: Variables are useful when you don’t want to define a specific data type.
[0:36:35] UECNSNemesis: Flexibility for some of my programs where the input data can vary wildly
[0:36:39] Zighome24: It’s a combination of lazy / letting the compiler optimize where it can
[0:36:49] Wetware: It's useful in some cases though
[0:36:53] DecoyOcelot: var in a typed language is a special case type of thing. or lazy ness
[0:36:58] Ghandus: very dangerous though
[0:36:59] bloodylantern: how did u came from playing minecraft to "int isnt nullable"?
[0:37:05] QuesoBad0nga: @Nexhunter ECS6 uses let to avoid some var issues when creating variables inside functions
[0:37:08] clidump: Debug.Log tells me this is c# and yes it's lazy... c# should be strongly typed
[0:37:09] Wetware: Heh, yeah it's abused too LUL
[0:37:13] AnarkaTV: far cleaner code and easier to refactor
[0:37:13] Ghandus: @bloodylantern my bad, sorry :D
[0:37:15] KoniQ111: ahh yes let me replace "var" with "WhateverTheFThisClassIs"
[0:37:15] DecoyOcelot: dynamic is a fun type too
[0:37:20] inDOObitablee: its also an old way to do it
[0:37:24] Brianmose12: there are cases where var is usefull, one is when the typing out the type takes forever
[0:37:24] brewerdc: var for refactors
[0:37:24] Nexhunter: @QuesoBad0nga I was talking about waffle's little typing and his knowledge of var danBlank
[0:37:26] Curnil: @Slowkill333 nice, default values for golang can be annoying at times when the "default state" is a valid option and when working with MongoDB where default values are ommited going to the DB >_<
[0:37:35] bloodylantern: @Ghandus np i was curious :D just turned in :D
[0:37:36] QuesoBad0nga: @Nexhunter ooohhh hehe :P
[0:37:38] Zighome24: But easier is better if your job is pushing code as fast as possible right?
[0:37:57] Nexhunter: @QuesoBad0nga but i still use var sometimes in my typescript when I am lazily breaking apart some asshole java devs giant try/catch block they wrote in js
[0:38:00] PossibleScam: It’s always better to explicitly define your objects.
[0:38:04] Ghandus: @bloodylantern i told him i started programming again because of his ludum dare. then it kind of went a bit to the side
[0:38:10] PossibleScam: Good Code LUL
[0:38:13] Zighome24: lol @nexhunter
[0:38:13] twiQsP: good .. as fast as possible? KEKW
[0:38:17] PossibleScam: THATS OBJECTIVE.
[0:38:17] wsd7: only if else KEKW
[0:38:21] ninopanda: KEKW says someone who doesnt comment your code!!!!!
[0:38:23] Apparentthreat: QA will catch it, right? Kappa
[0:38:23] clidump: good code can be a read
[0:38:23] PURPLEsweats: Fast code isn't fast code when you need to reqrite it 2-3 times
[0:38:24] BurnedAether: var is readable as long as your variables aren't x, y, temp1, etc.
[0:38:24] Nexhunter: good code is not having giant try catch blocks
[0:38:26] Nexhunter: fuck java devs
[0:38:30] Zighome24: Hahhahahaha
[0:38:32] Direwolfe: in c# var has faster execution cause memory doesn't need to allocated until the last moment
[0:38:32] Slowkill333: @Curnil  oh yeah...I ran into that exact issue.  We ended up changing to pointer values for like boolean so we can pass 0 to turn off flags...a little annoying.
[0:38:33] Nexhunter: that just AI shit
[0:38:38] KoniQ111: But Gates would rather hire lazy person for hard job
[0:38:39] QuesoBad0nga: @Nexhunter var is totally viable and it works :)
[0:38:40] Maykr__: if it works it works. It's the next persons problem
[0:38:40] dasmako: its because when you work for a company and its unrealistic to code good LULW because under budgetted
[0:38:43] Ghandus: Typescript for the win :D
[0:38:48] Curnil: @Slowkill333 Yup, same here pointers
[0:38:48] Moobot: You can sub to Waffle by clicking this neat link -> twitch.tv/giantwaffle/subscribe
[0:38:54] bloodylantern: @Ghandus yeh i learned c+ and python like 6 years ago in a young age but now i totally forgot about everything but i want to learn it again :D
[0:38:57] clidump: @NightStellar_ I hate you LUL
[0:39:00] matt_trex: Path of Building dev literally wrote his own language to do updates easier
[0:39:01] daemonaedryn: Is radiation an actual problem in this pack? Ive not seen any consequence to it
[0:39:01] Amnisia: ironically, taking time to comment code and simply design out what you need to build, helps save time in the long run with coding
[0:39:14] Maykr__: @cliDump Job security
[0:39:15] daemonaedryn: Shorty is playing it, looks fun so far
[0:39:15] grid_space: good
[0:39:15] Curnil: @Slowkill333 and exactly on booleans also
[0:39:19] Zighome24: C# dev laughs at Java dev not realizing they are practically two sides of the same coin
[0:39:20] Apparentthreat: ninopanda is there a new spider anime today
[0:39:21] SpitfireTK: playing Shortty guy today too?
[0:39:22] PossibleScam: It looks good. But it’s also 70 bucks.
[0:39:26] clidump: @NightStellar_ tru
[0:39:27] Slowkill333: @Curnil but, not having to check for null or whatever before accessing a value is so worth it.
[0:39:30] PossibleScam: It looks good though.
[0:39:34] ninopanda: @Apparentthreat yes
[0:39:35] bloodylantern: @Ghandus now everything about coding i hear i dont understand anymore :D
[0:39:35] Nexhunter: that is truth
[0:39:41] ZyianDev: self documented code
[0:39:42] Brianmose12: self documenting code
[0:39:43] PURPLEsweats: @Giantwaffle  YES
[0:39:43] Nexhunter: and not giant fucking try catch blocks
[0:39:44] Apparentthreat: bye chat KEKW
[0:39:46] GoksiiLija: depends on size...
[0:39:48] danilul9: YEP
[0:39:51] Stillglade: in modern programming, comments are considered an anti-pattern for that exact reason
[0:39:58] DecoyOcelot: good code can still be complex and need comments
[0:40:03] Zighome24: @nexhunter you are scarred aren’t you
[0:40:04] Ghandus: @bloodylantern well i'm working in that field, so it's a bit easier for me :D programming a small game like in unity or smth while following a tutorial is actually pretty helpful imo if you understand some basics at least
[0:40:11] ninopanda: @Giantwaffle your code needs COMMENTS!!!! reading some of your shit is bad!!!!!
[0:40:18] Nexhunter: @Zighome24 i fucking hate java devs who write giant try catch blocks danBlank
[0:40:20] ZyianDev: true
[0:40:21] RazorOPS_: LUL
[0:40:22] Zighome24: The key is not commenting every single fucking line
[0:40:23] Slowkill333: @ninopanda KEKW
[0:40:26] Curnil: Oooo, I hate when people make variable names like "md" is like myDocument
[0:40:30] Apparentthreat: ninopanda just figure it out 4Head
[0:40:33] Apparentthreat: WutFace
[0:40:34] inDOObitablee: Yea it is better to extract the code and name the function than comment a block of code
[0:40:36] Brianmose12: WutFace
[0:40:44] Nexhunter: KEKW pythonic ode
[0:40:51] chivalrous_duck: if you need to write comments, it's not a good code, usually
[0:40:53] EbonLux: Hello Waffle, Chat. I started learning how to write music yesterday, it is interesting
[0:41:04] Marshmelluws: comments are kinda for someone who reads your code that isn't you so they don't go "wtf"
[0:41:16] ninopanda: @Apparentthreat i eventually did, just dumb i have to dig so fucking hard when he could just type "// <this does this>"
[0:41:19] clidump: Beautiful is better than ugly. Explicit is better than implicit. Simple is better than complex. Complex is better than complicated. Flat is better than nested. Sparse is better than dense. Readability counts. Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules. Although practicality beats purity. Errors should never pass silently.
[0:41:31] clidump: The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters
[0:41:37] Curnil: @Marshmelluws or for yourself so when you go back to it in the future you can be like "wth was i doing here"?
[0:41:50] Marshmelluws: @Curnil that is also true yes :)
[0:41:52] bloodylantern: @Ghandus yeah i bought a Big Unity Tutorial on Sale and it was actually pretty fun to follow along with cuz it tells you how to use certain codes and variables and let u finish a programm with mistakes in it and then u see the like the right code and what u did wrong was pretty cool
[0:41:57] Nexhunter: @cliDump yea until python community rebels and adds typing pepeLaugh
[0:41:59] CorSPACE: @Giantwaffle theres an ingenuity update livestream on right now and they are talking about moving to an operational demo phase for the next 30 days to show how a helicopter can support a rover for scouting
[0:42:05] Crozbo: @Marshmelluws  you write comments for yourself too, imagine come to code after 6month
[0:42:12] Nexhunter: that is when you need to have standard project structures
[0:42:14] clidump: @Nexhunter they have typing now
[0:42:24] ninopanda: exactly what i am having an issue with your code right now @Giantwaffle
[0:42:25] N3rvrackD: @Giantwaffle Maybe build another Huge Room you can use for Power, then replace it with somethign else once the fusion is working?
[0:42:25] Nexhunter: @cliDump i thought that pep was withdrawn back into development?
[0:42:30] splix661: wouldn't a couple diesel gens from immersive be better than lava gens
[0:42:35] Nexhunter: or did the pep finally get fully pushed @cliDump PauseChamp
[0:42:35] daemonaedryn: It means youre copying from another box
[0:42:37] kyllotes: coding can be very overwhelmed
[0:42:38] bloodylantern: @Ghandus sry my english sucks :D
[0:42:39] Nishok: Outside air @Giantwaffle
[0:42:53] daemonaedryn: I had to go to a glitch world to fix it
[0:42:54] clidump: still duck typing @Nexhunter
[0:43:09] Slowkill333: I hate going back to my old code because I always hate myself for writing it like I did.
[0:43:16] Nexhunter: @cliDump i know still duck overall but like PHP added good typing support with 7 PogChamp
[0:43:23] AtchTwoOh: just put them one closer?
[0:43:24] Brianmose12: copyThis pastaThat
[0:43:28] Nexhunter: just need python to have that pep fully supported buddhaEvil
[0:43:39] Nexhunter: i hate looking at code I wrote the previous hour KEKW

[0:43:53] JommyBee: monkaS

[0:44:38] whitymicmuffin: Its friday saturday what
[0:44:41] bloodylantern: i mean u learn from mistakes and u get wiser every day so sometimes looking at an old code is like a cool thing to see what u achieved or not :D

[0:45:26] Slowkill333: how about when the entire internet breaks because a JS developer got mad and removed a github repository....
[0:45:26] GoksiiLija: the size of memory to load up, instead of 0x0020 he wanted 0x0040

[1:43:09] complexprotein: Uh I don't want to link a dick but check out beeple on twitter, he runs all that NFT shit, but he posted an image of him on CNBC and they had him side by side with a digital dick pretty much
[1:43:10] JommyBee: i thought chat had died

[1:44:03] CyberLordSeldon: waffle you remind me of someone i'd meet at a party at a really good college
[1:44:19] complexprotein: It was an NFT of a "Dick Milking Factory" and they had it there right on CNBC
[1:44:23] isaacleii: Are you going to watch SN15?
[1:44:32] Goodboy34: okay its going  into photo shop right now
[1:44:35] mechoriet: KEKW

[1:44:42] ThatOnneGuy: they gotta get the views somehow
[1:44:54] Pizzzaking21: wait please please explain. Im not really sure what a nft is, is just like a 3d idek
[1:45:00] JoniSusi: I do like Beeple's art. It's so fuckin weird.
[1:45:01] Minelmonia: @complexprotein who sold that?
[1:45:23] benjamin_berry: A fool and their money...
[1:45:31] Helo_KiX: omg it says "dick milking factory" right on it...
[1:45:34] complexprotein: @Minelmonia Not sure, they just had it posted next to him on his CNBC interview
[1:45:35] numb3r13: it basically gives you ownership of a digital item
[1:45:42] Maykr__: nft is a new way to money launder in the art industry
[1:45:53] CyberLordSeldon: its buying ip
[1:45:54] DigitallyAdmiringHumanity: @TnBHelo where
[1:45:57] LuckyDuckie1: nfts weird to me, its like you are paying for bragging rights to "owning" a digital asset
[1:45:57] CyberLordSeldon: intellectual property
[1:46:00] BurnedAether: Except you don't buy the item. Just the "authenticity"
[1:46:07] TheWumbologist101: I like how NFTs help artists but I foresee a lot of abusive capitalistic behavior
[1:46:12] complexprotein: @dpmarag0ni on Beeple's Twitter, he posted the image
[1:46:15] Pizzzaking21: i feel monkey
[1:46:26] isaacleii: isaacleii subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 9 months, currently on a 2 month streak! Everytime I have subbed he has pronounced my name is "issa-slee" instead of "Isaac Lay". Lets see if he can get it right this time.
[1:46:27] DigitallyAdmiringHumanity: @complexprotein oh
[1:46:29] Askjong: But if the server that holds the asset goes down, it's lost :)
[1:46:33] Goldps1: you bought the original
[1:46:39] lvyEartman: people still can make copies from the digital work
[1:46:42] CyberLordSeldon: real question: do they matter
[1:46:45] Deep_Frozen: You've bought the receipt for your groceries, not your actual groceries
[1:46:53] Benkka: if you buy it and then resell the original owner still gets some so you dont have the ip
[1:46:55] benjamin_berry: It’s a digital version of a certificate that says this is n of however many
[1:47:00] LuckyDuckie1: you dont have the rights to the item and the asset isn't protected from copying or anything. honestly it all sounds like a scam to me
[1:47:01] DetusX: Enjin
[1:47:11] CyberLordSeldon: NFT of NFT then
[1:47:12] Immp: There is an awesome tweet of a Reddit post describing NFT's its so good!
[1:47:17] Internot: I dont think you can just copy them
[1:47:22] benjamin_berry: Like the certificate that comes with a print of a paining. Only no print.
[1:47:33] Davemathews: Davemathews subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 26 months! 
[1:47:48] LuckyDuckie1: exactly, you are paying for a "certificate"

[1:48:03] saltyspitoon73: so it says my ethereum is better than yours
[1:48:31] ssquire14: that's the point of the NFT though, right?
[1:49:10] wsd7: its like buying property from moon
[1:49:24] Jedidude77: you make it sounds so alien but it's just a certificare
[1:49:26] LuckyDuckie1: I think NFT just gives you bragging rights, that you are the original "owner" even though everyone else could just pirate it
[1:49:27] Internot: like a hologram of your actual art piece
[1:49:28] Jedidude77: certificate
[1:49:29] lykenew: It's like buying a receipt
[1:49:38] Askjong: It's just clout
[1:49:40] benjamin_berry: And they sell more than 1 nft for a piece too
[1:49:41] sidneyprefontaine: It’s like a numbered print, instead of the original painting.
[1:49:47] Larklen: thats a bad comparison KEKW
[1:49:51] benjamin_berry: It’s like naming a star
[1:49:52] peetur_: what stops me from NFTing something I don't own?
[1:49:53] exo_pho3nix: Getting a planet or star named for a price is the biggest scam ever
[1:49:56] Zighome24: But also NFT don’t mean you own the art, the artist still holds the rights to the art
[1:50:03] ItsOnMax: @peetur_  nothing
[1:50:16] BeastboySAW: Wait.....  I don’t own property on the Moon?  Dammit.
[1:50:21] TheUnrealOculus: Man you need to automate the hitting of pickaxes on walls
[1:50:28] LuckyDuckie1: "own" loosely meaning you bought the product, not as in you have the intellectual property rights
[1:50:41] TheUnrealOculus: Oh wait
[1:50:44] Xenotics: look up kolectiv. from the epicGG team that you did some work with
[1:50:46] sidneyprefontaine: And you don’t own rights to the image, just one of many prints.
[1:50:48] HawkeyeMihawk: what about tattoos that's art how would that play into it
[1:51:07] GreyWolfBlack: Well I joined during an intense convo... I love it
[1:51:12] benjamin_berry: My issue with NFT is they don’t confer ownership of IP or prevent more copies being made
[1:51:16] lykenew: Well isn't NFT the same as trading cards, like technically the card is just a piece of paper and ink if you think about it
[1:51:20] Th_Lorax: is there a command for a mod link?
[1:51:26] thepolaroidbear: With a painting though, someone painted it. Digital goods are just made once, and resold. Like a poster, or print.
[1:51:30] chochi314: I would say that you pay so much, only if you believe that you sell higher
[1:51:33] CurlySC: Thats actually showing how fucked up the World is
[1:51:38] LuckyDuckie1: I think NFT is trying to solve some problem, but it's not the right way about it
[1:51:47] Larklen: Ithink NFT as a concept is great, it just is in its weird super early state
[1:51:50] benjamin_berry: It’s a tax dodge
[1:52:01] Larklen: and needs a lot of work, and then plus the txn fees another issue
[1:52:02] TheWumbologist101: Sounds like a bunch of investors that missed the crypto boay
[1:52:05] TheWumbologist101: Boat
[1:52:14] LuckyDuckie1: yeah
[1:52:17] isfil: Solucionism

[1:52:38] benjamin_berry: I can blame him. I think NFTs are a scam

[1:52:46] CyberLordSeldon: easier
[1:52:50] Surge43: watches my fridge tv

[1:52:57] Barney__: Game Devs tend to do that
[1:53:04] Siyrax: i do :)
[1:53:05] BurnedAether: Dynamo still disconnected monkaS
[1:53:07] exo_pho3nix: A marketing department was like, "We should appeal to millennials and zoomers"

[1:53:26] Pizzzaking21: im actually watching you on my microwave. jk lol
[1:53:28] The1_TS: The question I keep asking is "what problem are we solving" this disappears from peoples minds in tech all the time.
[1:53:32] grimmn: that's generally referred to as "a solution in search of a problem"
[1:53:34] GreyWolfBlack: Samsung white goods are notoriously unreliable

[1:54:32] Xenotics: you dont want to be the person that doesnt have those features, its weird
[1:54:33] RhinoWrEcKs: i think the inside of the fridges is not very pleasant to look at
[1:54:36] フリクリ: waffleThink yeah i guess it's over complicated
[1:54:42] ItsOnMax: I am wachting you from my smart wall
[1:54:43] Troupster: listen if I can't play doom on my keyboard keycaps it's a trash keyboard

[1:55:34] Maykr__: then the server goes down and its useless
[1:55:34] Troupster: not hotdog
[1:55:34] Apparentthreat: AI/ML and a camera
[1:55:36] GeneraISpy: camera + ai ?
[1:55:37] Zebbuh: Like amazon stores i would imagine
[1:55:40] punkgeek: You'd need every product to agree to an RFID process, no chance
[1:55:40] Lands8142: until we have the amazon tech where it identifies it by itself I'll never use that function. It'll just take WAY too long to scan everything
[1:55:42] daemonaedryn: What if you have a really deformed ingrediant?
[1:55:42] Utael: I could see it using the barcodes
[1:55:48] Jedidude77: it's a camera that looks at the stuff
[1:55:48] Askjong: often yes
[1:55:49] Apparentthreat: probably offloads to cloud anyway
[1:55:49] ItsOnMax: Cameras can drive a Tesla car
[1:55:50] BONBONNIE13: HACKERMANS I'm on the case
[1:55:50] Gliderman: that's the point of UPC codes
[1:55:50] n8level: an appliance repair person told me the in door water makes in most fridge models break and are not cheap to repair. intentional? maybe
[1:55:51] MrMoneybagMan: freedom PogChamp
[1:55:53] Larklen: barcode would be so fuckin tedious KEKW
[1:55:56] tvfriestie: Smart fridges also connected to your network. Probaly less software/security updates... go figure your network security
[1:56:00] Utael: SKU's are the same
[1:56:07] minegryf9: every item you purchace has an nfc tag on it
[1:56:07] Jedidude77: cameras can drive now so they can tell you're low on milk
[1:56:10] ThatOnneGuy: produce has the same code at all stores
[1:56:11] grimmn: usually it's there are food consumption tracking apps that you can just scan barcodes with
[1:56:12] Lands8142: open the door samsung
[1:56:16] Lands8142: i can't do that
[1:56:17] ooblies: Then don't forget you have to scan everything again as you use it up D:
[1:56:19] minizen: what if you put a pan of bens in it? how will it know??
[1:56:19] ThatOnneGuy: Bananas are 4011 YEP

[1:56:55] Alsabatini: skus are usually purchased from companies with large databases of skus, so a lot of them can be the same throughout multiple companies
[1:57:05] R1Rider01: what if the kids drink it all while you are at the store?   then you'll know!

[1:57:14] madscientist_72: I work in aerospace, so all we do is over-engineer stuff.
[1:57:25] Troupster: I don't want a fridge, I want a cool room that's behind the drywall and tubes
[1:57:26] Allmostdone: laswt time I heard most of those frig's are zombies for widespread DDOS attacks

[1:57:29] toclosebutfar2: Well you are weird
[1:57:29] Yatko: oh yes a nice cold apple how nice
[1:57:31] ItsOnMax: It would be nice to know what stuff you are out of, when you are in the store. If you forget a list or something.
[1:57:32] daftMOOSE: I have a food logging app that I can scan any barcode and it knows what the food is.

[1:57:38] kelleymcches: DansGame
[1:57:40] punkgeek: apples are just sweet potatoes anyway
[1:57:40] RodriCraft93: like the fridge sending a message to tell you, you left the door open instead of doing it itself
[1:57:41] Weras57: wtf apples
[1:57:42] toclosebutfar2: eggs go in my ass gachiGASM
[1:57:42] tvfriestie: you probaly put milk before the cereal too DansGame
[1:57:46] Denimdan13: eggs have to go in the fridge if you bought them cold
[1:57:55] minegryf9: walk in closet < walk in fridge
[1:57:59] kerpenverpen_: I would want a camera inside my fridge so I don't have to get up from my pc to check what's inside
[1:58:08] sky_moo: Does anyone know how to automate alloying in a smeltery?
[1:58:12] afetus24: it's so you eggaxtly how much you have waffle

[1:58:48] kelleymcches: eggs need to go into the fridge if they are washed, if they are not washed they don't need to go into the fridge
[1:58:50] Askjong: So why do you have a Ring doorbell? It's it just as easy to go and check the door? :)
[1:58:55] Larklen: If the fridge was able to tell me exactly what and how much was in the fridge with no effort on my part, I'd be down for that
[1:59:01] minegryf9: @BONBONNIE13 you have a lock on your fridge?
[1:59:07] BONBONNIE13: EGG ARMOR wafflePog
[1:59:11] Xenotics: I know no one who doesnt put eggs in fridge
[1:59:12] Weras57: KEKW eu shielded eggs
[1:59:14] Madarion: why are the eggs washed in the us? O.o
[1:59:14] TyulSK: I would rather have a camera in the garage to see if I left the garage door open, than one in the fridge to see what is in there.
[1:59:15] Lands8142: bacteria groes it's just slower

[1:59:37] hendyius: you don't wash free range eggs if you have chickens and you can leave them out on the counter
[1:59:37] Allmostdone: do you really want Windows 10 on your frig?
[1:59:39] dabeda1: just close the door looool 4Head

[1:59:51] Scootycoolguy: Then we just become the people in WallE
[1:59:52] RoninStorm: @Giantwaffle It's because in EU they have a salmonella vaccine they give their chickens that isn't approved for use in the US...  we wash to reduce salmonella
[1:59:54] lvyEartman: just a sensor that will tell if its closed or open is enough
[1:59:54] TheWumbologist101: That layer is ass juice and we all know it
[1:59:55] Troupster: you can get a garage sensor for $15 or use a Bluetooth headset I did that for years
[2:00:00] daemonaedryn: I want a reminder that I have locked my house correcly because even If i check it 20 times I will forget and worry KEKW
[2:00:03] RodriCraft93: what if you leave home and want to know if you have milk in the fridge so you can go grocerie shopping before getting home to check
[2:00:04] minegryf9: yep
[2:00:06] tvfriestie: How do you like your eggs chat
[2:00:14] RoninStorm: @Giantwaffle It's because in EU they have a salmonella vaccine they give their chickens that isn't approved for use in the US...  we wash to reduce salmonella.
[2:00:15] daftMOOSE: There are smart garage door openers that'll tell you if its open or not.
[2:00:15] BattleLew: Imagine just keeping the whole house below 40°
[2:00:17] MrMoneybagMan: correct
[2:00:21] kelleymcches: what RoninStorm said
[2:00:21] Troupster: what if they are criminal chickens though
[2:00:22] hendyius: no, i mean if you own your own chickens... your own coop
[2:00:23] Stillglade: eggs in the grocery store are washed which makes them need to be refrigerated
[2:00:25] Lands8142: i think the legal definition for free range is a bit iffy too

[2:00:44] TyulSK: @Troupster didn't know that I will look into it.
[2:00:45] Troupster: organic has no legal definition
[2:00:48] Xenotics: what is nonorganic eggs is the question
[2:00:48] Rubinix: "free ranged" still means that you can cram a hundred chickens in a 9 square meter area and have it still count
[2:00:50] DakotaFoxes: I had backyard chickens here in Texas. I only washed the eggs if the had chicken shit on them @giantwaffle
[2:00:52] kelleymcches: factory farmed chickens is fucked
[2:00:53] OgivaNuclear: organic has organs
[2:00:59] punkgeek: We
[2:01:01] kelleymcches: gmo is good
[2:01:01] GeneraISpy: NODDERS gmo's are fine
[2:01:01] daemonaedryn: GMOs?
[2:01:02] saltyspitoon73: No shot
[2:01:05] ssquire14: corn
[2:01:06] 0omkins: Without GMO's we'd have starved a long time ago
[2:01:08] Troupster: GMOs are not bad
[2:01:09] MrMoneybagMan: bruh just wash your hands after handling eggs
[2:01:09] Kylexyz003: they are good yes
[2:01:09] Larklen: I only use natural herbicide ... cyanide YEP
[2:01:10] punkgeek: We've been guiding crop genetics for thousands of years or more
[2:01:12] Rubinix: GMOs are not a bad thing
[2:01:13] Jamswhat2: YEP
[2:01:14] sky_moo: thats just artifical selection
[2:01:15] Denimdan13: technicly, nothing you eat isnt a gmo...
[2:01:15] none_the_wiser: Most modern GMOs are for shelf life and mass not nutrition.
[2:01:16] kelleymcches: gmos allow us to have hardier plants
[2:01:17] aman36000: @Giantwaffle Look at what corn looked like before it wwas modified
[2:01:18] Lands8142: without gmos we couldn't have a sustainable population this large
[2:01:18] minegryf9: gmo's can make plants produce their own nitrogen
[2:01:18] Morionware: They are not inherently bad
[2:01:20] Goldps1: thats what ive been saying for years
[2:01:21] DigitallyAdmiringHumanity: whats a gmo
[2:01:22] Allmostdone: we been doing it forever
[2:01:22] DigitalVortex92: @0omkins I don't think that's necessarily 100% true, but there's some truth to it in some regions
[2:01:24] Flobu_: i saw vegan water one day in the supermarket but i actually would prefer the non vegan water
[2:01:24] Jamswhat2: dogs are GMOs YEP
[2:01:29] RoninStorm: carrots aren't supposed to be orange.. so orange carrots are technically GMOs
[2:01:30] Yatko: GMO causes autism just like vaccines and 5G
[2:01:33] RodriCraft93: you mean like Lemon?
[2:01:33] Madarion: look up native melons, before we demosticated it LUL
[2:01:36] Jamswhat2: corn are GMOs YEP
[2:01:40] hendyius: if you raise chickens, you aren't supposed to wash your eggs... if you wash your chicken eggs, then you have to refrigerate them.
[2:01:41] sky_moo: it certainly influences the genetics
[2:01:41] Allmostdone: look at hops for beer and wheat
[2:01:44] Denimdan13: GMO free doesnt exist
[2:01:44] RodriCraft93: life never gave us lemons, we created them
[2:01:45] Charlion2: selectve breed ing is a form of gmo

[2:01:51] Alsabatini: @yatko what? how?
[2:01:51] lvyEartman: what does the O stand for in GMO?
[2:01:52] minegryf9: i think the stigma comes from Mosanto being the worst company
[2:01:53] M1k3D3l7a: that's true
[2:01:53] tor_geir: Grapes without stones in them
[2:01:54] Darkxant: yes and no. They arent hazardous to us necessarily. but they are HORRIBLE for the environment because they are designed to not be replantable and destroy any likelihood of neiboring crops from ever flourishing
[2:01:56] BeastboySAW: Giant mutant ostriches def bad. Do not want.
[2:01:57] DigitalVortex92: As long as Monsanto stops controlling 90% of all GMO's, i'm ok :)
[2:01:58] kerpenverpen_: GMO will turn you and your kids into a mutants Kappa
[2:01:59] Kylexyz003: the only possible threat are super plants that take over ecosystems
[2:01:59] complexprotein: You can increase yield, you can lower water requirements, all sorts of good shit
[2:02:01] afetus24: I thought gmos came from scientist in a lab
[2:02:02] Lands8142: bananas are all clones of one breed cuz they rest mostly died out
[2:02:06] sky_moo: genetic code editing is interesting
[2:02:06] ssquire14: old bananas got wiped out by rot, cavenders so they moved on
[2:02:08] minizen: carrots were originally purple
[2:02:10] AshhanX: banana is modern day plantain i thought
[2:02:10] Weras57: bananas are dying :(
[2:02:13] Xenotics: show breeding of dogs is cruel though
[2:02:15] OgivaNuclear: everything is GMO then
[2:02:15] MrMoneybagMan: theres only like 2 species of bananas left
[2:02:22] kelleymcches: you can still get purple carrots
[2:02:23] Troupster: I want to combine dinosaurs with bananas and make giant bananas
[2:02:24] RodriCraft93: the actual banana flavour is kept on the sweet bananas
[2:02:25] podwe: carrots massively gmo'd, now mostly orange
[2:02:28] RoninStorm: @Kaylome97 all bananas in the world are from a clone of ONE banana tree.
[2:02:33] ItsOnMax: @MrMoneybagMan Not true
[2:02:33] DigitallyAdmiringHumanity: @minizen my whole life is a lie
[2:02:44] minegryf9: same drain on the ground tho
[2:02:47] podwe: straight bananas too
[2:02:48] minegryf9: soil*
[2:02:50] ArbitraryHubris: your audio is weird today.  it sounds like you're sped up and clipping

[2:02:56] aman36000: aman36000 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 6 months! Have you seen what some plants would look like if we never modified them
[2:02:57] BONBONNIE13: Scientists sitting around in a lab, figuring how to hack fruit so they taste better. HACKERMANS
[2:02:58] Alsabatini: have you seen that video on youtube where the guy makes yeast produce spider silk through genetic modification?
[2:03:00] afetus24: so like that crop stick mod from mine craft @giantwaffle
[2:03:01] Allmostdone: It was some small vocal group that didn't understand want GMO really meant
[2:03:02] sky_moo: All fruit is unnatural
[2:03:03] Troupster: I'm ok with that
[2:03:04] minizen: not for me @ArbitraryHubris
[2:03:06] daemonaedryn: !latency
[2:03:06] Moobot: If you find that Waffle's stream is glitching, lagging, or rubber-banding, try turning off "low latency" in the stream settings and/or switch the stream resolution off of Auto. This issue is on Twitch's end.
[2:03:08] mechoriet: !latency
[2:03:13] ArbitraryHubris: thanks!
[2:03:13] mechoriet: fak too slow
[2:03:13] sky_moo: the amount of flesh and juice and sugar in them would never occur in nature
[2:03:15] フリクリ: all grape candy tastes the same but none taste like actual grapes PauseChamp
[2:03:17] Darkxant: or is waffle speaking way faster today?
[2:03:18] DigitalVortex92: Also just try refreshing the stream
[2:03:25] Lands8142: modern corn is WAY different

[2:03:35] ArbitraryHubris: all modern dogs
[2:03:48] Xenotics: most is for cows
[2:03:48] Larklen: Yeah, Corn we grow, and Korn we listen too :)
[2:03:48] Tabakhase: ethanol is HUUUGE
[2:03:50] grimmn: cattle corn
[2:03:50] Darkxant: testing corn
[2:03:50] Gliderman: the problem is when monsanto goes and sues.  basically two farmers plant next to each other, one with monsanto, one without.  monsanto gets unhappy when fucking bees pollinate between them and the other farmer "steals" their special gmo plant
[2:03:51] 0omkins: Wasn't there an issue with wheat too? Like ancient wheat would not grow in todays soil or something?
[2:03:52] Lands8142: most is for pigs and stuff
[2:03:53] Larklen: Kappa
[2:03:54] BattleLew: Why don’t we selective breed people?
[2:03:56] Othixz: feed corn
[2:03:58] Alsabatini: waffle is slowly becoming xqc and will soon be completely unintelligible
[2:03:58] kelleymcches: it's for animals and fuel
[2:03:59] ArbitraryHubris: yeah, sugar corn is supposed to have no flavor
[2:04:01] BurnedAether: corn and chad corn
[2:04:02] madscientist_72: We eat sweet yellow corn.
[2:04:02] BONBONNIE13: Corn is already gross to me. I don't trust anything I can't digest. FeelsWeirdMan
[2:04:03] DigitalVortex92: Most corn grown is for production purpose, then edible corn (sweet corn as an example)
[2:04:04] usernameNull: the number of vegetables we eat that came from 1 plant is insane, brocolli, cabbage, brussel sprouts, etc
[2:04:05] Madarion: yeah, starch corn and sweet corn, thats basic xD

[2:06:21] Utael: Ethanol is worse for the environment than gasoline, it takes more energy to produce and emits more CO2 throughout the process. it was designed to help extend the life of our oil rather than help with Greenhouse gas emissions.
[2:06:26] QuesoBad0nga: hahaha
[2:06:46] daemonaedryn: pepeLaugh Ci is chaos personified

[2:12:50] BattleLew: @giantwaffle I work for a fast food chain that started using this system called eProduction. It tracks how much food you’re cooking and you’ll get a report how it’s affecting your food cost. I hate it

[2:14:34] punkgeek: I thought Red Robin was basically fast food anyway
[2:14:38] Tabakhase: cheaper than restaurant food - way more expensive than "own cookieng" still
[2:14:39] n8level: the margins are so close sometimes the fast food place runs out of a certain item, rather than having extra they have to throw out

[2:51:39] BONBONNIE13: yeah
[2:51:41] branlru: thx <3
[2:51:44] daemonaedryn: np
[2:51:47] isaacleii: @theboan13 as far east as possinle *in texas*. Its so they can fly over the gulf and not have to go over any land
[2:51:49] TheWumbologist101: Okay I’m off to the doctor catch you all in an hour or so
[2:51:50] kaos4666: any hype for Dyson Sphere Program?
[2:51:59] brenner1265: Its free real-estate
[2:52:15] CardboardBoaner: @isaacleii you mean as far south
[2:52:18] daemonaedryn: Maybe theres augments for it?
[2:52:21] OhTick: can you make the next tier upgrade for the machines yet @Giantwaffle
[2:52:22] Apparentthreat: upgrade the machines more
[2:52:46] Vovosunt: is there a compacted version of sand and so on?
[2:52:51] Apparentthreat: there's an orange and green upgrade on top of what you applied
[2:53:11] Memi02: @Vovosunt No compressed block, no
[2:53:25] isaacleii: @theboan13 yeah I guess lol. As far south and east basically. They want the body of water to be top the east of the launch site
[2:53:55] daemonaedryn: Its more than fast enough for sure
[2:54:15] Apparentthreat: PepeHands
[2:54:36] CardboardBoaner: @isaacleii its also one of the most west places in texas that touches the gulf
[2:54:38] Apparentthreat: The way "thermal" does upgrades in 1.16 is dumb
[2:55:09] daemonaedryn: What does it change @Apparentthreat ?
[2:55:35] isaacleii: @theboan13 yes. It gives them the most amount of room  to fly over water. Excuse my poor directional skills lol
[2:55:37] Apparentthreat: DaemonSzyman I"m not sure if it's because it's a "different" mod, but upgrades are treated like augments and take up a slot
[2:55:45] kerpenverpen_: catJAM
[2:55:52] toclosebutfar2: catJAM
[2:56:06] Apparentthreat: DaemonSzyman you can't slap them on PepeHands
[2:56:09] CardboardBoaner: @isaacleii i understood what you were trying to say just wanted to let you know your easts and wests
[2:56:12] Alsabatini: is there a way to have all outputs going directly into your ME system?
[2:56:18] daemonaedryn: @Apparentthreat Huh, thats annoying. Dont the upgrades themselves create slots?
[2:56:27] Drunten1337: Drunten1337 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 31 months! 
[2:56:36] daemonaedryn: Also dont have enoufg storage YEP
[2:57:09] Apparentthreat: DaemonSzyman I think so, at least in 1.12. I say "different" because it has a different name in 1.16. Just "Thermal" without foundation or expansion
[2:57:13] Drunten1337: wow chats slow today xD
[2:57:17] isaacleii: @theboan13 waffleD
[2:57:20] daemonaedryn: @Apparentthreat susHmm

[3:05:22] MiraPacku: OMEGALUL
[3:05:23] coolcake2: is twitch TOS such a big thing only because of Amazon?
[3:05:27] PxlSauce: a "pheonix" yeah...

[3:06:40] HyperHydroX: When sn15 launch ?
[3:06:50] MiraPacku: only 8k of bandwidth pepeLaugh
[3:06:56] Larklen: I'm fine with if they decide to allow it or to now allow it, its just the wishy washy nature of it KEKW
[3:06:56] daemonaedryn: It would have been better if they went out and actually gave permission instead of the really passive answer they gave
[3:06:56] Tech: What did I walk into
[3:07:12] coolcake2: discord is the real mvp for providing bandwitdth
[3:07:13] Zimmygee: uh are you dunking things in poo water?

[3:07:57] Apparentthreat: PauseChamp
[3:08:06] Tech: I mean javascript is the best to learn IMO
[3:08:06] Mka696: just use Typescript, problem solved lol
[3:08:06] KingYou123: Say what, web dev here
[3:08:08] Gliderman: Js is terrible
[3:08:15] officialzip: I like JS
[3:08:18] xHASHTRONAUTx: im like intro level in MATLAB

[3:08:31] fafuja: ?????
[3:08:32] DigitallyAdmiringHumanity: KEKW
[3:08:32] ZyianDev: C# and Java sure
[3:08:33] Mordenak: JS will get you paid though.
[3:08:33] Zimmygee: Reading javascript makes my eyes puke
[3:08:34] Tech: YOUVE DONE IT
[3:08:35] Jedidude77: it's all c like i guess
[3:08:35] Wetware: Riot in chat! LUL
[3:08:35] MrEgregious: WutFace
[3:08:37] sogerr: @Tech can you ban waffle please?
[3:08:38] PureSpider: syntax is close, nothing else is
[3:08:38] Gliderman: it's close to programming
[3:08:38] brenner1265: COPIUM
[3:08:40] YOhodges: MATLAB is the stuff of nightmares
[3:08:44] MiraPacku: you've awoken the chat KEKW
[3:08:45] daemonaedryn: The amount of indignation every programmer in chat is feeling is hilarious KEKW
[3:08:46] Apparentthreat: Chat be like monkaGun
[3:08:51] Tech: Real talk though, Javascript/Typescript is the language I'd bet on for the next 20 years
[3:08:53] LordDynom: Highly depends on which JS version you are writing in KEKW
[3:08:55] n8level: @Mordenak so will cobol PartyTime
[3:08:56] BennyF_Jr: the idea is the same
[3:08:57] Jedidude77: for loops in javascript are similar to java that's fair
[3:09:02] Gliderman: how do I cancel my prime sub?
[3:09:04] fafuja: haskell > all
[3:09:05] coolcake2: IT is C-like except the truthness BS
[3:09:06] Tech: Very different the two
[3:09:06] ZyianDev: not really
[3:09:06] fafuja: Kappa
[3:09:07] Klorell: as close as any other language is close to any other
[3:09:09] Jedidude77: Reading both can be similar
[3:09:10] Guydudeman3: Anytime an Engineer hears Matlab.... Pepega
[3:09:21] MagikHands: Sounds like you're just getting use to reading code. Not that they are similar
[3:09:25] Chris_Cross_Crash: TypeScript is like JavaScript++
[3:09:27] Tech: Javascript Everywhere is powerful af
[3:09:28] DigitalVortex92: it better not
[3:09:28] Guydudeman3: yes index 1
[3:09:29] fafuja: yeah
[3:09:29] coolcake2: yes
[3:09:29] Soul_Synergy: Typescript will probably stay for at least any frontend for a while
[3:09:29] CantTouchDisNow: yep
[3:09:30] OhYhat: Imagine subbing to this code monkey KEKW
[3:09:30] Sander20011: yes
[3:09:31] Askjong: yes
[3:09:31] xHASHTRONAUTx: yes
[3:09:32] DigitalVortex92: thats gross
[3:09:34] Maykr__: Lua does as well
[3:09:35] Marcopach: Yes I know wht ur talking, I work on both for web
[3:09:35] Soul_Synergy: Yup
[3:09:36] Gliderman: matlab is garbage, and yes
[3:09:37] LordDynom: R does it as well
[3:09:37] Zimmygee: Just no
[3:09:41] Zighome24: @tech in terms of the concepts that they utilize yes but I’m betting on go and similar more flexible languages with more type safety
[3:09:42] Guydudeman3: For what it's worth MATLAB is a super intuitive language tbh
[3:09:43] Chris_Cross_Crash: same with Lua
[3:09:43] Madarion: i had a lecture once by a maintainer of typescript... was rreaaally weird
[3:09:43] TheUsefulDistraction: LUA too right?
[3:09:44] fafuja: Lua the same thing
[3:09:45] grimmn: ugh, yes it does
[3:09:46] n8level: matlab will not really get you a job, better to learn python imo
[3:09:47] Mka696: Lua starts from 1
[3:09:48] Allmostdone: Javascript needs to DIE!
[3:09:49] CantTouchDisNow: but not in mathematiics tho
[3:09:50] Askjong: because of math
[3:09:51] Soul_Synergy: Matlab is not a real programming language and you cant tell me otherwise
[3:10:10] YOhodges: Matlab is defo a bit cheaty
[3:10:10] punkgeek: Zero exists in math
[3:10:16] Sander20011: Because of the reason it was made uses physical numbering, therefor there is no number 0 index.
[3:10:17] Soul_Synergy: Matlab is a fancy calculator
[3:10:17] coolcake2: I mean yeah. Matlab is basically like a calculator, not a programming languge
[3:10:17] OhYhat: Does R start at 1 too?
[3:10:20] Jamswhat2: lists start at 1 though :)
[3:10:21] Tech: languages that are not zero indexed are typically not aimed at computer science/engineering
[3:10:22] KingYou123: What's your opinion html as programming language? Kappa
[3:10:27] Zighome24: It’s not made for devs, it’s made tor engineers
[3:10:29] Maykr__: LUA's a great language. Especially for scripting in games
[3:10:29] Larklen: 0 devCheck 1
[3:10:30] Chris_Cross_Crash: You should program bots in computercraft @Giantwaffle
[3:10:32] LordDynom: @OhYhat, Yes, it does
[3:10:33] RhinoWrEcKs: zero is reserved for header
[3:10:35] panic_inducing_citrus: 3rd gen new programmer would prefer 1
[3:10:36] punkgeek: HTML isn't a programming language
[3:10:37] Apparentthreat: be careful with the triple dots
[3:10:42] Gliderman: WHAT THE FUCK is the naming convention for matlab functions?  lower_case(), camelCase(), or BigCamelCase()?  ALL OF THEM ARE USED
[3:10:44] Askjong: and it's a lot easier to use matrixes with index 1
[3:10:44] Va3lin: yeah realized it as i sent it @Apparentthreat lmao
[3:10:46] Jugohuber: Matlab will definetly get you a job lol
[3:10:50] Guydudeman3: MATLAB is the #1 engineering software package (atleast every engineering minus CS)
[3:10:53] KingYou123: @Apparentthreat I was trying to bait waffle
[3:10:54] ruccoa: HTML+CSS is turing complete
[3:10:56] xHASHTRONAUTx: i use it alot for diff eq with its ode45
[3:11:01] DigitalVortex92: @Jamswhat2 List COUNTS start at 1... because it counts elements. it doesn't give indexes :P
[3:11:02] fafuja: @ruccoa KEKW
[3:11:03] coolcake2: its for engineers... For math you have things like Maple
[3:11:07] Deadfox74: It’s because MATLAB focuses on matrices not arrays. 1 is easier to have as the first index
[3:11:09] YOhodges: LOL why are they all germans
[3:11:14] Tech: being zero indexed can cause a lot of issues in just context switching between the work you are trying to accomplish, and the language you are using
[3:11:20] Va3lin: @coolcake2 omg i completely forgot about Maple
[3:11:26] Gliderman: @coilstraint thanks, couldn't remeber
[3:11:41] grimmn: @CoilStraingt also referred to as PascalCase
[3:11:44] SirrProdigy: because germans are good engineers lmao
[3:11:44] daemonaedryn: My maths teacher was german... unfortunately she also had a heavy german accent
[3:11:52] Tech: Yeah
[3:11:54] JerryLubrano: for my AE classes i had no German but a bunch of Indian
[3:11:58] Goodboy34: Tech did you take your 10 min time out from yesterday
[3:12:02] coolcake2: yeah also Matlab doenst have "arrays" Its al Matricies
[3:12:02] arcticae: wish matlab simulink was something other than matlab
[3:12:05] Tech: Goodboy34 yeye
[3:12:09] Tech: I left for an hour :)
[3:12:10] ItsOnMax: Dialect?
[3:12:31] Goodboy34: @Tech slime
[3:12:32] Tech: Well you would if you are constantly swapping languages
[3:12:34] DigitalVortex92: Lists are arrays with extra functions :)
[3:12:39] ruccoa: @coolcake2 but in math matrices are 0 indexed KEKW
[3:12:39] Akiron_rafa: depends on the Language
[3:12:41] thecodealive_original: array <> list
[3:12:41] Guydudeman3: How often did you use MATLAB when you were in uni?
[3:12:46] Jugohuber: @arcticae yes, i wish i could get simulink standalone without matlab
[3:12:47] Gliderman: arrays are typically static in size, lists are expandable
[3:12:51] Tech: But I dont know many engineers using Matlab on a daily basis
[3:12:54] Ardrago: lists are just variable size arrays
[3:13:00] Tech: Those tools are typically made for other professions
[3:13:03] coolcake2: @ruccoa true..... we will never know the true answer
[3:13:11] DigitalVortex92: Well Unity uses Mono doesn't it? That's like a whole separate version of C# in some regards
[3:13:11] Stillglade: lists are covariant and arrays are invariant
[3:13:12] Deadfox74: Oh trust me, I was learning C++ when my homework assignments in my aero classes used MATLAB. It sucked...
[3:13:14] HostileLogOut: @Giantwaffle a list is a wrapper around a array.
[3:13:15] Askjong: Arrays are multidimensional. Lists are one dimensional
[3:13:28] xHASHTRONAUTx: pizza TYME
[3:13:31] DigitalVortex92: @Askjong Not true. You can have list of lists
[3:13:36] Gliderman: you can have a list of list
[3:13:39] ecnerw4l: @askjong ??
[3:13:50] Wetware: I have a project where we inherited a bunch of VB modules, but 80% of our code is C#, switching between them always taxes my brain for a bit
[3:13:57] Gliderman: tbf, you can define new int[][][]
[3:14:04] fafuja: I think It's very easy to switch to languages that use the same programming paradigm you're used to
[3:14:04] Moobot: Support Waffle by using his Epic creator code: Giantwaffle
[3:14:13] Askjong: @DigitalVortex92 That is the container
[3:14:20] Gliderman: what's fun is an array of lists :p
[3:14:23] DigitalVortex92: @Gliderman You can also define List<List<List<String>>> kiiKEK
[3:14:41] coolcake2: but why
[3:14:49] CiVR: what do I do with all this free time in the day
[3:14:49] Gliderman: oh yeah, just pointing out that it's slightly faster
[3:14:56] DigitalVortex92: @Askjong But what you're saying is just wrong though
[3:15:06] Tech: KEKW
[3:15:07] DigitalVortex92: A list can be multi-dimensional
[3:15:10] coolcake2: 🅱️
[3:15:21] Askjong: @DigitalVortex92 Not in the same "layer"
[3:15:24] Allmostdone: no what emoji?

[3:16:03] Allmostdone: don't think I've ever seen that
[3:16:03] PureSpider: yes
[3:16:05] Gliderman: yes
[3:16:08] Wetware: List-ception!
[3:16:09] HostileLogOut: @Giantwaffle yes. if u store a list of a list. u need to have it as type list.
[3:16:11] DigitalVortex92: Yup
[3:16:13] Jamswhat2: List<List> stores lists
[3:16:14] Soul_Synergy: Yes
[3:16:14] Gliderman: that's not correct
[3:16:15] Apparentthreat: yep
[3:16:16] Daanaas: PureSpider Hallo BB
[3:16:17] hybrid_pineapple: yes
[3:16:18] PureSpider: inner list also has a type
[3:16:24] hybrid_pineapple: list<list<list<list<list>>>>
[3:16:24] PureSpider: heyo daan xobiasWave
[3:16:25] Gliderman: what's the type of that inner list
[3:16:33] Daanaas: PureSpider No Sn 15 Hop SadFace
[3:16:34] Riddixdan: yes
[3:16:34] grimmn: List<List<Element Type>>
[3:16:34] mechoriet: List<List<String>> like this
[3:16:35] PureSpider: wafffle, inner list also needs a type :D
[3:16:40] Gliderman: carefully
[3:16:42] Jamswhat2: List<List<int>> stores Lists of integers :)
[3:16:48] DigitalVortex92: @Giantwaffle List l = new List<List<String>> etc...
[3:16:51] Gliderman: I can show you some code later Tonight
[3:16:54] hybrid_pineapple: yes
[3:16:58] YOhodges: isnt this the infinte problem of does a list of all lists contain istels
[3:17:01] YOhodges: itslef
[3:17:04] Wetware: I think I'd make an object LUL
[3:17:06] Daanaas: KEKW
[3:17:06] Allmostdone: a list of list type of pictures
[3:17:06] Soul_Synergy: Yeah thats right
[3:17:14] tracycodes: I see we're looking at some statically typed code KEKW
[3:17:14] MrMatrix86: the first agenda on the list is the list of the list
[3:17:15] LordDynom: I see you've never encountered c++ templates KEKW
[3:17:17] Gliderman: I like nesting it in for loops because I'm adding elements one by one
[3:17:23] Soul_Synergy: recent project I had a map of sets of lists
[3:17:24] AnarkaTV: the inner lists are not allocated
[3:17:28] coolcake2: that was just a matrix
[3:17:35] ragequittertrol: go a 3rd dimension
[3:17:39] tracycodes: Code is just all lists LUL
[3:17:41] Apparentthreat: This is why I work w/ Python OMEGALUL
[3:17:44] t0bart: !ludumdare
[3:17:48] Apparentthreat: !ldjam
[3:17:52] Apparentthreat: stupid
[3:17:56] Daanaas: lol
[3:17:57] DigitalVortex92: @Askjong The internals of a list is literally an array of Objects (whatever you define)
[3:17:57] Apparentthreat: !itch
[3:17:57] Moobot: Waffle has created a couple games that you can play today! Visit giantwaffle.itch.io/ to check out current and upcoming games such as SNHOP and Dig Deep.
[3:17:58] PureSpider: no
[3:17:59] Apparentthreat: there
[3:18:00] mechoriet: nope
[3:18:01] Soul_Synergy: no
[3:18:02] Wetware: Just put it in a var Kappa
[3:18:02] Daanaas: KEKW Apparentthreat
[3:18:06] grimmn: not like that
[3:18:07] DigitalVortex92: The List class, just adds extra functionality to the array itself
[3:18:07] Allmostdone: by that time just throw the damn thing in a memory block or satabase
[3:18:10] Madarion: i learned C first, so i see everything as pointers LUL
[3:18:13] Tech: Not quite
[3:18:15] ecnerw4l: no
[3:18:15] PureSpider: you make a new list like you had it before, and then add the "inner" list to it
[3:18:22] Apparentthreat: Daanaas someone keeps modifying moobot so I don't know current commands
[3:18:26] Gliderman: outerList.Add(new List<string>())
[3:18:31] grimmn: you will
[3:18:31] Apparentthreat: I wasn't calling that person stupid LULW
[3:18:32] Daanaas: HHAHAHAHA
[3:18:35] DigitalVortex92: I prefer using Lists to nested loops so I don't have to deal with resizing LUL
[3:18:43] mechoriet: yeah thats monkaS
[3:18:45] Daanaas: Yes u Dit
[3:18:46] Soul_Synergy: you could do List<someList.typeOf>
[3:18:48] Daanaas: LUL
[3:18:51] DigitalVortex92: I prefer using lists over nested arrays*
[3:18:59] YOhodges: matlab means you can run matrices
[3:18:59] Daanaas: Apparentthreat  u calling Travy Stupir KEKW
[3:19:00] ItsOnMax: You can make a multidimensional Array with int[ , ]
[3:19:02] Daanaas: Kappa
[3:19:06] Zighome24: No, you have to keep the type definitions but the point is that you’d have to allocate a separate list of objects before adding it to the list of list of objects lol
[3:19:06] Askjong: @DigitalVortex92 That is correct. I'm not talking about the "Z" direction. It might be wording it a bit wrong
[3:19:08] DigitalVortex92: If i don't give a shit about efficiency that is
[3:19:10] FairePlaie: a array in 3d ? like variable[a,b,c,d] ???
[3:19:19] Apparentthreat: Daanaas it was probably invalid. travey has been away
[3:19:19] DigitalVortex92: Yes it is
[3:19:22] ItsOnMax: it is!
[3:19:23] PureSpider: it is
[3:19:25] DigitalVortex92: not liek that
[3:19:27] Gliderman: should be
[3:19:30] Daanaas: Oke
[3:19:40] Apparentthreat: t0bart try !digdeep
[3:19:43] DigitalVortex92: int a[int,int] = new int[,] or some shit
[3:19:44] Daanaas: Still LUL
[3:19:45] Tech: Oh Boy
[3:19:46] Gliderman: you're using python in c# here
[3:19:52] brenner1265: susHmm
[3:19:52] DigitalVortex92: I don't use that syntax though so
[3:19:52] Soul_Synergy: 2d array
[3:19:53] Mordenak: Multi dimensional array?
[3:19:59] t0bart: @Apparentthreat thx
[3:20:03] DigitalVortex92: X,Y coordinates = Point Classs
[3:20:04] ItsOnMax: Yeah Multidemensional array
[3:20:04] Larklen: int[][] . no?
[3:20:06] t0bart: !digdeep
[3:20:06] Moobot: Play Waffle's entry for Ludum Dare 48, Dig Deep, at giantwaffle.itch.io/digdeep | Check out the other entries at ldjam.com/games | Looking for the github? Visit: https://github.com/GiantWaffleCode/DigDeep
[3:20:08] Zighome24: int[][]?
[3:20:08] Daanaas: Pure Fix It
[3:20:11] Gliderman: @digitalvortex92 I think the sizes are defined on the right side
[3:20:13] DigitalVortex92: Yeah @ Larklen me dumb
[3:20:20] Zighome24: oh
[3:20:23] DigitalVortex92: @Gliderman Yeah like i said, i dont use that formatting
[3:20:29] Apparentthreat: its def [][]
[3:20:31] Ardrago: and thats what you would use classes for
[3:20:35] ItsOnMax: a[lenght,lenght] and then fill it with two for loops
[3:20:43] DigitalVortex92: int[][] a = new int[,]; I think?
[3:20:51] Soul_Synergy: Its fine
[3:20:51] coolcake2: there is no wrong way KEKW
[3:20:54] Larklen: No, int[][] is fine. Large datasets you'd want to do something else, but it works
[3:20:56] DigitalVortex92: where [,] does somthing but i dont know what
[3:21:00] LordDynom: Just define small types containing the x and y
[3:21:00] Zighome24: Really you want to use tuples or containers for the xy vakues
[3:21:00] OhYhat: Does it work?
[3:21:03] Mka696: yeah both work in C#. you can do multi-dimensional arrays, or arrays of arrays, like you have done before
[3:21:07] OhYhat: If so who cares KEKW
[3:21:14] Soul_Synergy: Multiple ways of defining things with different syntax
[3:21:16] Tech: I mean there is no right or wrong if it works.
[3:21:20] Larklen: If you use Python, you can just use Panda library pepeLaugh
[3:21:23] coolcake2: @OhYhat true
[3:21:27] ItsOnMax: I am using it for a flow field for my units.
[3:21:30] Apparentthreat: push() pop() YEP
[3:21:34] Gliderman: just as long as you make the code readable
[3:21:34] tracycodes: @Tech True
[3:21:38] Daanaas: LUL
[3:21:38] blake_u1: pepeSmoke
[3:21:41] Ardrago: there is better or worse though Tech
[3:21:45] Zighome24: Usually you want to store an array of say Vector3d which have storage for all three values
[3:21:46] DigitalVortex92: @Tech I started hard blocking YT channels because YT thinks I want to know the "arbitrary best way" to do things FailFish
[3:21:47] UltraScientism: @Tech there are slow and unidiomatic ways though
[3:21:47] YOhodges: there are better and worse ways
[3:21:49] Tech: Better or worse, yes
[3:21:50] tracycodes: @Giantwaffle Not in the world of code that makes money KEKW
[3:21:54] DimensionalShadow: Just more or less efficient
[3:21:58] tracycodes: If it works, don't change it LULW
[3:21:59] mechoriet: i mean one way is probbly less performant then the other way KEKW
[3:22:01] DigitalVortex92: Like, Im gonna do it my way until i have to do it differently
[3:22:03] Tech: But the trap people fall into
[3:22:05] Larklen: One of my favourite quotes regarding game dev is, "People play games, not code". So as long as the code works and donesnt hinder the game, then it dont matter
[3:22:05] Moobot: You can sub to Waffle by clicking this neat link -> twitch.tv/giantwaffle/subscribe
[3:22:07] Dethan: sub-optimal
[3:22:12] OhYhat: Its correct until you fine the bug KEKW
[3:22:12] Tech: is over optimizing without solving the problem in the first place
[3:22:17] Feist_: more efficient ways @giantwaffle not necessarily wrong ways
[3:22:18] tracycodes: @Tech YEP
[3:22:21] coolcake2: @Giantwaffle but the thing with compiled languages is that Compiler changes your code a lot
[3:22:24] ragequittertrol: @Giantwaffle the true way is a single dimension array, but use offsets to store data in 2 dimensions
[3:22:35] MiraPacku: KEKW
[3:22:43] Wetware: Performance is bad? Hardware is cheap LUL
[3:22:44] DigitalVortex92: @coolcake2 I mean yes. That's what a compiler does krippKEK That's the point
[3:22:47] Soul_Synergy: Exactly, think of things like sorting algorithms. Some are much faster than others but they all get the job done eventually. Some ways are more correct but others arent completely wrong @Giantwaffle
[3:23:04] UltraScientism: @Wetware not in 2021
[3:23:09] LordDynom: No, that's very wrong
[3:23:13] ragequittertrol: yes, because [] [] is in fact an array of pointers in the first dimension, and the actual data in the 2nd dimension
[3:23:16] Ardrago: no why would you do that
[3:23:16] Wetware: @UltraScientism Truuuue actually
[3:23:17] coolcake2: @DigitalVortex92 yes. so it will most-likely fix your shitty code to optimal verion. regarless of how clever you think you are
[3:23:18] Tech: See, but justifying performance optimizations is typically tough because the value of the time spent by an engineer typically outweighs the cost of running it in production.
[3:23:43] Apparentthreat: use a dictionary YEP
[3:23:50] Mka696: you'd only do it for performance pretty much. you can scan through all the data very fast if it's only in one array
[3:23:53] DigitalVortex92: @coolcake2 the compiler doesn't optimize your code unless it's built to do so. It just kinda depends on the compiler
[3:23:54] Ardrago: 2d arrays are fine if you need a solution fast
[3:23:58] DigitalVortex92: And the scenario you use it
[3:23:59] Tech: Yes
[3:24:07] ragequittertrol: it's smarter, but requires more memory, you need to store a pointer for each y dimension value. yes it is faster, but using a single dimension is the true way Kappa
[3:24:07] Tech: AND then you have something to iterate on
[3:24:10] Stillglade: Premature optimization is the root of all evil
[3:24:12] Madarion: do it like c99, x values come first, than come the y values, and u need to know when they switch to index correct LUL LUL
[3:24:12] grimmn: @Tech that very much depends on the domain you're working in
[3:24:13] sp4wn999: waffleH OH the NEW Pokemon snap is so cool
[3:24:17] Gliderman: yes is fucking does
[3:24:19] BennyF_Jr: kinda sorta
[3:24:22] DigitalVortex92: It will just convert your code to what you give it generally. Otherwise optimizing code would be that much "easier" in a way
[3:24:24] Jamswhat2: vars DansGame
[3:24:24] LuckyDuckie1: The true way is to store everything in binary and use bit ANDs
[3:24:25] tracycodes: Release code, then optimize after
[3:24:25] Soul_Synergy: Definetly if you are dealing with scalability
[3:24:25] Allmostdone: yes it will
[3:24:26] Fawnz_: depends on the usecase
[3:24:27] C0mpl: if something is going to be done millions of times or something then it could definitely matter
[3:24:28] palagrim_: it really depends on the application
[3:24:32] UltraScientism: move fast and break things, as one very rich but not very moral person said.
[3:24:35] AvaanKha: + other people have to read your code
[3:24:36] Apparentthreat: i mean, as long as you're not writing real-time stuff then sure, yeah?
[3:24:36] YOhodges: it depends if you are dealing with 50 datapoints or 50,000
[3:24:37] Chris_Cross_Crash: You can literally throw a tiny bit more money at a server and save a ton more money by making it easier to program
[3:24:38] Riddixdan: depends
[3:24:42] BONBONNIE13: Your code runs .083 nanoseconds slower than optimal speed. 😡
[3:24:44] Klorell: then you have unoptimized at PoE levels
[3:24:47] mechoriet: @Giantwaffle also a msfs approach KEKW
[3:24:47] Mka696: in reality, turning a 2d array into a 1d array with smart indexing is incredibly easy. the formula is "index = x + y * width"
[3:24:47] Tech: grimmn2 yes, but no. optimizing from the start is typically a trap
[3:24:51] daemonaedryn: Release the game, make it later, the cyberpunk approach KEKW
[3:24:51] Riddixdan: if you create a shader then it's important
[3:24:52] BennyF_Jr: best practices should be used in development imo so you don't redo work
[3:24:55] Apparentthreat: but then again, if you want super optimized stuff, there are languages for that
[3:25:03] Driitzz: did you know it's valid to use var in c# ?
[3:25:22] xHASHTRONAUTx: lol the dayz effect
[3:25:23] ecnerw4l: many ppl prefer var
[3:25:29] tracycodes: Lots of nested multiplication KEKW
[3:25:37] UltraScientism: and the function interface is inherently slow KEKW
[3:25:38] BennyF_Jr: but who was RAM
[3:26:10] Allmostdone: I can't trust person "X" down in that office. He's function is shit
[3:26:39] fafuja: if you really want to make your code run faster, make it as parallelizable as possible and run it with your graphic card
[3:26:39] ShinyBadger: poe 2
[3:26:48] Denimdan13: the fix is poe
[3:26:48] MiraPacku: you say that pepeLaugh but they also wont fix the clicker problem pepeLaugh
[3:26:50] LordAwsum: irather than having them auto combine when dropped, i just want picking up a currency to also collect nearby same currencies
[3:26:51] Ardrago: thats what refactoring is waffle, its one of codings biggest challenges
[3:27:14] FairePlaie: i don't know is that can help, but i like doing multiple array. (like, Factory[Maint].ProcessLine[2].Machine[BeerPackaging2].Motor[Output1].CurrentAmp[Ph1].value
[3:27:22] TarMonA: use POE as beta POE2.0
[3:27:35] Tech: I doubt that it is that far gone that they would rewrite it all
[3:27:37] tracycodes: @Giantwaffle You now understand the world of corporate dev KEKW
[3:28:05] Allmostdone: and you miss your deadline and get fired
[3:28:06] Tech: It's way easier to refactor something than it is to start from the ground up when you get into applications of that size
[3:28:10] ragequittertrol: @Giantwaffle get it working, get it right, get it optimized. my motto when it comes to building new shit (T. lazy software engineer here Kappa )
[3:28:28] Jamswhat2: Disagree :)

[3:28:40] Orin_The_Sly: Absolutly
[3:28:50] Tech: Disagree
[3:28:59] Allmostdone: not a clue
[3:29:00] Archelonde: Maybe
[3:29:06] Tech: The average user associates modded with FTB
[3:29:15] even__odds: Let's kickstart this shit
[3:29:16] Tech: They will search for FTB minecraft over modded minecraft
[3:29:34] Tech: Yeah, but that was pre-boon of modded MC
[3:29:35] MiraPacku: NODDERS
[3:29:42] PureSpider: tegic bam0
[3:29:42] Captainharlockspacepirate: NODDERS
[3:29:44] Fawnz_: tekkit gachiGASM
[3:29:44] Tech: It's really hard to move then needle on mindshare and SEO
[3:29:46] Solitude411: i dont really get why forge is no good anymore and why fabric is better can someone explain
[3:29:53] Maykr__: I don't think Forge will be going away anytime soon, watching CPW's streams on Forge development they have a lot of good stuff in the works, also working to rolling out releases faster when never version of the game come out.
[3:29:57] InTheLittlePro: Yooo ETH is almost to 2800 Pog
[3:30:04] Tech: I mean the main subreddit for modded
[3:30:08] Captainharlockspacepirate: @Tech hard but not impossible waffle makes a good point with tekkit
[3:30:08] Moobot: You can find Waffle's Youtube channel here - https://youtube.com/giantwaffle
[3:30:09] Tech: is just called feed-the-beast
[3:30:10] Yemtron: doge goin nuts D:
[3:30:12] even__odds: streamers
[3:30:14] Alamose: youtube is the main driver for new modded users id assume
[3:30:17] Foooks: FTB in my opinion
[3:30:24] bhikhoom: bhikhoom subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 4 months! hello
[3:30:34] Riddixdan: just google minecraft mods
[3:30:48] Orin_The_Sly: Way more people use YouTube for discovery than Reddit
[3:30:49] RussianRainbowTV: fabric mods are so ResidentSleeper currently though
[3:30:54] Tech: Yes
[3:30:57] Tech: Exactly
[3:30:58] Klorell: no more laggy endgame modpacks?
[3:31:02] Captainharlockspacepirate: yeah fabric is sleeper
[3:31:19] Tech: So the mindshare of those who play modded are on FTB
[3:31:32] HostileLogOut: @Giantwaffle i typically look for unigue modpacks that changes the game completly
[3:31:35] Tech: Updating to latest snapshots is counter productive to the general end user as well. It's already a pain as it is to get everything working
[3:31:39] Tech: let alone across all version
[3:31:49] Madarion: where my allegiance lie? FOR THE HORDE
[3:31:58] Tech: It's an easy top 3 game still
[3:32:14] Jamswhat2: Minecraft more globalized now? :)
[3:32:21] DemonicHell3: @Giantwaffle How do you think someone like XQC would do with a modded minecraft.
[3:32:23] MiraPacku: minecwaft peepoHappy
[3:32:27] Tech: The actual future of modded I see, isn't the modded we know
[3:32:36] Tech: It's the store they have for content
[3:32:44] Tapeman83: that would be cool tbh
[3:32:59] Tech: They have the content store for bedrock edition
[3:33:03] Alamose: Microsoft has a store for MC content, like skins and whatnot
[3:33:07] ItsOnMax: Like steam workshop?
[3:33:07] MiraPacku: bedrock edition pepeLaugh
[3:33:14] UltraScientism: It's surprising that no one has made some kind of minecraft 2.0
[3:33:25] Allmostdone: that would be terrible
[3:33:28] Alamose: more users are on console than anything yeah
[3:33:41] MiraPacku: fair enough NODDERS
[3:33:42] minizen: bedrock edition isnt bad tho
[3:33:44] Madarion: @UltraScientism well many tried xD
[3:33:46] kennycraig: KEKW
[3:33:49] Tasar_: it's because it's cross play
[3:33:54] MiraPacku: it's not bad, just a meme Kappa
[3:33:57] Archelonde: Do it Terraria style and have native mod support you can just look up and download from the menu
[3:34:00] Valentin_PV: bedrock is on everything else that has minecraft. Java is the one that's only on PC
[3:34:05] Tech: Yes, because it's the version everyone plays, it has a safer brand perception, official support, and you know it will just work for the most part
[3:34:07] Allmostdone: but who is going to vet content for bedrock?
[3:34:11] BennyF_Jr: bUrself
[3:34:15] Tech: Exactly
[3:34:24] drsnaki96: if i buy a modpack who would get the money? the pack dev or the mod dev?
[3:34:25] toastyytm: Skyfactory 9.99 or 1600 MSP ahahaha
[3:34:29] Wetware: Weren't you making a fusion reactor? Why the lava power?
[3:34:36] Tech: Hence why I don't see FTB going away, because they have already started on content for that store
[3:34:47] Allmostdone: well buying mods worked will for steam when they tried it.
[3:34:49] forfiet: @drsnaki96 where do you see people selling modpacks
[3:35:02] crimpymaple: @giantwaffle how does a person learn about playing Minecraft mod packs?
[3:35:08] UltraScientism: @Madarion minecraft-style building/construction/digging with sea of thieves graphics, maybe add some kind of next gen AI npcs  = easy billion dollars
[3:35:11] Helo_KiX: I wouldn't mind that assuming M$ doesn't take a massive cut
[3:35:33] Tech: There is a lot of gray area there
[3:35:35] drsnaki96: @forfiet just an if we were to be buying modpacks
[3:35:39] toastyytm: What happens when pack dev's ie Darko don't want to put a pack on the store and charge people money for it tho?
[3:35:47] Tech: But bedrock edition has it's own suite of dev tools
[3:35:51] Tech: it's limited compared to forge
[3:36:00] TelRehiad: yeah they don't want them messing with the base because they have to insert their code in those areas and would lead to a lot of problems
[3:36:04] Tech: but it's enough to produce content akin to earlier versions of mods
[3:36:22] Madarion: @UltraScientism like i said, many tried, the devs of the biggest public minecraft server even made a new studio for it, its pretty silent out of those guys, and man, they know their stuff
[3:36:23] tor_geir: How far are you from finishing the reactor?
[3:36:30] Allmostdone: and MS would have to change their terms to allow payments to 3rdd party
[3:36:34] Tech: And you don't modify the base game because that is what leads to mod incompatibilities.
[3:37:01] Tech: rarely. That's why Forge wants no more core mods
[3:37:07] AshhanX: you override them
[3:37:12] Soul_Synergy: That's just a json file
[3:37:14] AshhanX: not really change them i think
[3:37:16] RussianRainbowTV: that's why everyone hates Quark
[3:37:22] doublealife: ye
[3:37:23] Maykr__: forge has functions for registering recipies
[3:37:29] n8level: crafttweaker easy peasy
[3:37:33] toastyytm: Quark is hated?
[3:37:34] Tech: typically you'd just do it with something like crafttweaker
[3:37:40] AshhanX: i think it disables the vanilla recipe, and then make a recipe of your own that creates the vanilla item
[3:37:43] Tech: so it's bundled with the modpack, not the mod
[3:37:47] doublealife: can you make us able to use points i have 1.4 mil...
[3:38:05] TelRehiad: and you can remove specific recipies as well with Crafttweeker

[3:38:16] TheIrishGuy: you can use points @doublealife
[3:38:21] Tech: It's fine if a modpack changes that stuff, because it's the last step and has no down streams. Mod typically don't touch vanilla recipes.
[3:38:27] Fawnz_: the old creative menu lol
[3:39:28] TelRehiad: you remove the old recipie and then add the new
[3:40:06] AshhanX: i think a bettwe way to think about it is this: its more like changing the textures with a texture pack, than it is changing the code with a mod
[3:40:08] TelRehiad: not really. since its just the crafting databas
[3:40:24] Tech: Yeah
[3:40:38] Tech: but that is where it comes down to the modpack dev
[3:40:54] TelRehiad: Ehhh. sort of. there are blocks that do that.
[3:40:54] TheIrishGuy: null poionter would form
[3:40:58] Tech: The concept of modpacks is easily my favorite part of MC modding specifically

[3:41:47] TelRehiad: I think you would really really like making your own modpack. the tools have come a loooong way. its so much nicer now

[5:08:18] FairePlaie: ok
[5:08:25] ninopanda: @tabbin_ to make you ask questions Kappa
[5:08:28] KekMannetje: is your production even high enough to keep up with consumption?
[5:08:38] Tithonius: this should be good

[5:08:43] brenner1265: The ends have the extra 2 lava gens but the middle has an extra dynamo
[5:08:46] Tithonius: as one fills the other will fill
[5:09:13] Tithonius: the system should auto balance as the unused dynamos fill
[5:09:14] Alamose: I would reconnect all the fluid and see if it catches up
[5:09:16] Tithonius: so should be fine
[5:09:40] daemonaedryn: Seems to prioritise the bottom ones?
[5:09:48] Tithonius: you should leave it connected because it will auto balance itself yeah
[5:09:49] Yrlish: how many cubes does he have now? lol
[5:10:19] GTabxrda: !charm
[5:10:24] Alamose: I think the fluid just isn't distributing evenly, so some are filling up while others are empty. Just need to let it catch up
[5:10:43] Tithonius: is it a limitation of your power cable?
[5:10:45] GameDadel: did you use the power somewhrre else?
[5:10:45] brenner1265: Reconnect all of the fluid pipes
[5:10:45] Tithonius: or the tunnel?
[5:10:48] blazingcookie1: the middle row of gens are not getting enough lava
[5:10:51] Tithonius: are the tunnels power limited?
[5:10:52] saltyspitoon73: I miss Dante Dankweed FeelsBadMan lawyer man bill PepeHands
[5:10:56] R_U_S1rius: do you still have that rf-meter?
[5:10:57] babyjoshy: is there some lose in the cables?
[5:11:02] Silver_Skeeter: wait till it's filled up and balanced out
[5:11:04] Trucker_Torpedo: use signalum servos for 2x fluid speed?
[5:11:05] R_U_S1rius: to check the current output
[5:11:06] Perryproject: what does his title mean
[5:11:06] Cafn8247: Why not use the ender fluid ducts?
[5:11:14] RevengeLetsPlay: @Giantwaffle You should dischonec thte power drainage. Let the Dynamos and check if lava keeps up
[5:11:22] The_Bantjes: @Giantwaffle because the one lava gen is powering another system i think...
[5:11:25] Tithonius: you should reconnect the lava all back together so that once some of them are full then the lava will auto balance
[5:11:31] Yrlish: doesn't ender io fluid pipes have round Robin?
[5:11:35] Tithonius: seperating them creates artificial load
[5:11:42] Cafn8247: Ah I gotcha.
[5:11:46] SoLowe: ender io ones?
[5:11:51] Alamose: @Tithonius I agree with this
[5:11:56] Tithonius: ^^
[5:12:03] tigertank4567: just make more lava gen and everything goes into a tank and gets distributed from there
[5:12:04] NonSix: The bottom generators are taking the lava before the top ones?
[5:12:16] Silver_Skeeter: @Tithonius yes!
[5:12:20] KnightofObv: That's decent
[5:12:25] Neevotic: Neevotic subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 31 months! POGGIES
[5:12:31] RevengeLetsPlay: yed
[5:12:36] Cafn8247: Honestly I’d do that cause they can nest with the other conduits
[5:12:37] ninopanda: ill ban your width
[5:12:38] TheIrishGuy: its how much it can store
[5:12:39] ninopanda: Kappa
[5:12:44] Cafn8247: Nice and tidy
[5:12:51] Yrlish: @ninopanda lol
[5:13:01] afterwork: are there better heatsources? it seems as there is enough cobble generation but to slow to generate lava
[5:13:03] RevengeLetsPlay: max IO  means maximum input is 400/t @Giantwaffle
[5:13:19] 05eby: What are you using to melt the cobble in your crucibles @Giantwaffle
[5:13:21] Cafn8247: Can you make a card to copy all your conduit settings too?
[5:13:48] Trucker_Torpedo: you dont have a cobbleworks automation yet???? LUL

[6:03:56] SoldierFieIds: I overtrusted a fart in the shower and ended up spraying diarrhea all over the wall.
[6:04:02] DecoyOcelot: overheating isnt what you need to worry about. If your coils lose power once your actually on, thats a problem
[6:04:05] Alsabatini: larry and waffles orange chair

[6:09:33] officialhunterx: pwoered*
[6:09:35] Tasar_: Batteries?
[6:09:38] Trucker_Torpedo: when it starts running it will generate power to itself
[6:09:42] Evoti: look at the heat
[6:10:07] DecoyOcelot: eventually
[6:10:24] Alamose: it takes a long time to build up to being self sufficient though
[6:10:28] DecoyOcelot: its going to take awhile for it to get efficient enough to power itself
[6:10:59] TheIrishGuy: just pump more power
[6:11:03] coolcake2: and ppl say fusion is complicated
[6:11:06] officialhunterx: also make sure you can keep up with fuel consuption
[6:11:29] MiroMade_: You was pointing at the wrong place in reactor to see temperature...
[6:11:33] MiroMade_: Green column

[6:14:36] AshtenD: NOTED
[6:14:48] Trucker_Torpedo: slow down @Giantwaffle didnt you wanna go with lithium 6&7 for the fuel?
[6:14:57] Alsabatini: he said short answer only
[6:15:07] Valentin_PV: Did you see China launched the first module of their own space station? Scott has a video on it
[6:15:11] kingdigun: You're feeding power into the center aswell, that's why it's not green
[6:15:15] omar_i_: green bar
[6:15:21] Alsabatini: and we have to show our work
[6:15:25] Tithonius: it wouldnt hurt to make a few more dynamos
[6:15:30] Tithonius: like at all
[6:15:33] officialhunterx: maybe another tunnel is needed
[6:15:43] Alamose: uhh output of cells in that one is different
[6:15:44] drissical: Batteries should fill up before the dynamos
[6:15:48] Tithonius: your making over 9k, but the cable is limited to 9k isnt it?
[6:15:48] Valentin_PV: peepoHappy
[6:16:20] kingdigun: The center needs power to start up aswell
[6:16:35] Tithonius: are you making anough to charge the cable too? the cable has a "buffer" its small but its there
[6:16:39] Cafn8247: What’s the maximum rf capacity of those conduits?
[6:16:56] omar_i_: the hotter your reactor is the more power u generate right
[6:17:00] Evoti: look at the conduit
[6:17:04] grimmn: cooling efficiency might be affected by proximity of other coolers
[6:17:11] kingdigun: It needs to heat up to 8k, then it turns on
[6:17:15] daemonaedryn: Can we use the energy meter to see how much is actually going through?
[6:17:16] CallofDuty_Monster: you need to put coolers also on  top maybe?
[6:17:18] officialhunterx: one probe has a setting so you can the liquid inside
[6:17:21] TelRehiad: lookup the nuclear craft video on it
[6:17:32] Evoti: water conduit has no water in them
[6:17:34] nwl1515: water conduit empty someplaces
[6:17:36] Tithonius: yes. when i ndoubt build MORE POWA
[6:17:47] Evoti: y
[6:18:33] officialhunterx: imagine doing this with a ring size of 24
[6:18:45] Trucker_Torpedo: you have 40 coils in your inventory LUL
[6:20:41] BobPatience: NOTED OSHA stairs even taller now
[6:20:43] alek_199: wouldn't a fusion reactor create more energy?

[6:21:10] Evoti: y
[6:21:13] MDSZilla: Its still turning red
[6:21:14] daemonaedryn: Aaaand it went red
[6:21:22] NikNP: Water isn't flowing through??
[6:21:33] MiroMade_: Lava conduit I meant
[6:21:34] MiraPacku: YEP succ
[6:21:36] fat_larz: more water
[6:21:41] ensoPy: @Giantwaffle maybe you need more water sources
[6:21:47] kingdigun: You do
[6:21:50] TheIrishGuy: not yet
[6:21:58] Evoti: you close to 5k rf
[6:21:58] daemonaedryn: Maybe provide the middle area a different source?
[6:21:58] nesse007: see a vido one the core
[6:22:04] omar_i_: connect the middle part
[6:22:08] TheLurkingOne: Cant you build a buffer first?
[6:22:08] KnickKen: 19k RF YEP
[6:22:11] TelRehiad: you need to watch the nuclear craft video on this. its bloody complicated
[6:22:14] ThatOnneGuy: can you turn it off to fill it up then turn it back on to see how bad it drains?
[6:22:16] Valentin_PV: Confuseruuu7u
[6:22:21] CommanderUrsus: can you let the batteries build up for a bit?
[6:22:25] Trucker_Torpedo: watch another video LUL
[6:22:29] kingdigun: I got to like 30k rf before mine finally turned on, but I made more than it needed
[6:22:37] NikNP: Are liquid pipes are not inserting to cooling blocks?
[6:22:46] keittehvan: yes you do
[6:22:46] RussianRainbowTV: the nuclearcraft dev has his own youtube channel
[6:22:48] TelRehiad: so you need to charge the core up with it off and then turn it on
[6:23:10] officialhunterx: disconnect it from the cube let the cells fill up and then try it
[6:23:10] TelRehiad: from what I remember
[6:23:16] n8level: there's also a ncraft discord that is fairly helpful
[6:23:42] Trucker_Torpedo: i think the cable is limiting the output from the water gens
[6:23:44] officialhunterx: effiency loss maybe
[6:23:45] ninjakirby: ninjakirby subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 3 months! Woooooohhhhh
[6:23:53] Askjong: so you have half
[6:24:04] IamtheJK: Would an extra tunnel help on power?
[6:24:04] Valentin_PV: I really hope more mods introduce the in-game tutorials or guides that teach you the whole mod like Create is doing. That would make modpack a lot more accessible to new players
[6:24:14] NikNP: Check cooling again
[6:24:33] Evoti: look at fluid conduit to see how much output
[6:24:41] ThatOnneGuy: monkaS temp 📈
[6:24:42] MiraPacku: @ninjakirby talking about succ YEP
[6:24:46] Dejvidusx: You are not even heating up the core, aren't coolers off because of that?
[6:24:48] Cafn8247: The bottle neck is probably the fluiducts the
[6:24:52] ChetSteadman_: peepoEZ
[6:25:28] Suchtprohd: the conduits are to slow, they can only extract and transfer a limited amount
[6:25:33] keittehvan: the one conduit connection does not extract the water fast enough
[6:25:41] Tasar_: Big battery?
[6:26:07] Vidzargs: When you finally get it running, it will self sustain
[6:26:14] akaCube: Feed it into itself?
[6:26:22] saltyspitoon73: did you just fix it?
[6:26:25] Moobot: Waffle is playing the Compact Claustrophobia modpack (on v1.12.2) via CurseForge! The modlist: modpackindex.com/modpack/5547/compact-claustrophobia
[6:26:57] Vidzargs: @akaCube it doesn't produce power until it's heated enough
[6:27:00] Trucker_Torpedo: you need to power the rings, and power the reactor for it to power up
[6:27:05] TheIrishGuy: but waffle do you need the speed upgrades ?
[6:27:05] Evoti: no you need 7 more
[6:27:14] eefe: don't you have like 3k rf extra, you need like 6 more
[6:27:19] Evoti: y
[6:27:53] Evoti: just make a output more from the room
[6:27:59] Xantalus: waffle do you remember nothing of engineering? always overestimate the power draw :D:D
[6:28:03] Trucker_Torpedo: i made 2 LEU reactors to power the rings with one and the reactor with the other.
[6:28:22] sdman12o: NOTED
[6:28:23] daftMOOSE: Could you just upgrade the generators you already have?

[6:29:31] Vidzargs: I only know the tier 4, which is a shitton
[6:29:33] MasterKraft: What happenes if you don't have enough emergy?
[6:29:37] ninopanda: isn't there a book?!
[6:29:41] Alamose: id guess more than 2, less than infinite
[6:29:50] officialhunterx: i thought it was 150 million but that was in a different pack
[6:30:01] Vidzargs: fusion reactor doesn't melt down unless you forgot to feed the ring with power
[6:30:04] mechoriet: D: 150 what
[6:30:08] cooljas19: im seeing 160 million RF to get the core temp to 8 MK
[6:30:10] AshtenD: Apparently takes like 40m RF total and will just succ until its full. At least it says on a wiki
[6:30:14] her0zer0: How do you even transport that much power what
[6:30:22] Xantalus: @giantwaffle there was some way to make an emergency shutdown with redstone comparators for the reactor
[6:30:23] officialhunterx: fluix networks>
[6:30:26] officialhunterx: ?
[6:30:47] Xantalus: to prevent it from melting
[6:30:53] mechoriet: @Xantalus i think that was to make it as efficient as possible
[6:31:32] MasterKraft: oh that is what i missed.  cooling isn't working, gotchya
[6:31:37] Xantalus: @mechoriet you could do both with it its been a while since i played ee2e

[6:32:41] Askjong: upgrades?
[6:32:51] Vovosunt: how much can conduits transfer?
[6:32:55] kingdigun: You could disconnect half of the ducts from each other

[6:36:22] Orin_The_Sly: Yeta Wrench, you can make it so you only see fluid pipes
[6:36:23] Mr_Anderson90: yeeta wrench
[6:36:30] TheSparMan: place the fluid first
[6:36:32] Orin_The_Sly: Clap
[6:37:04] CallofDuty_Monster: waffle I did the rough math as a guess it takes 430k rf to kick start the reactor.
[6:37:31] Vovosunt: might need more extractors on the cobble gen?
[6:37:32] Moobot: You can sub to Waffle by clicking this neat link -> twitch.tv/giantwaffle/subscribe

[6:38:45] Valentin_PV: Those 2 are not mutually exclusive
[6:38:57] KnickKen: make it annoying, but NOT annoying NOTED
[6:38:58] Toxicplasm4: this is exactly the problem i have with almost every automation game, at some point you have to basicly start over and produce absolute starter items
[6:39:03] Riddixdan: but wont you still need to grind for resources?
[6:39:06] FairePlaie: it's impossible, no is necesary
[6:39:12] mechoriet: waffle do you remember those powered carts for harvesting wood
[6:39:28] MiroMade_: This must be rewarding then
[6:39:29] MiroMade_: To do
[6:39:35] mechoriet: YEP thats a pog mod yeah
[6:39:44] MrDerpTV: @Giantwaffle Hey! Im sorry if this sounds inaproppriate or something but I just have no clue what happened to nightstreams.. I miss them so much and I just cant find the answer anywhere
[6:39:58] dabeda1: NODDERS
[6:40:08] mechoriet: @MrDerpTV people just busy :)
[6:40:10] Valentin_PV: I can't wait for you to play Create
[6:40:18] N4RCO5: modular power suit is one of my fav mods till today
[6:40:18] officialhunterx: would you replay FTB Infinity Evolved
[6:40:42] MrDerpTV: @mechoriet I heard something about getting canceled and all and I just got confused about whats happening
[6:40:45] N4RCO5: boosting with rail gun
[6:41:06] N4RCO5: MC 1.4.7(?) was wild
[6:41:14] Mr_Anderson90: i loved the hand that shot light sources
[6:41:15] MrDerpTV: @mechoriet I just dont want to see a group like this split, it used to be soooo good
[6:41:30] RussianRainbowTV: the material costs later on balanced it well, adding iridium alloy plating and stuff as a requirement in some packs
[6:41:32] Toxicplasm4: i only can recommend the game factorio, with mods its basicly also endless
[6:41:34] N4RCO5: must have been ftb ultimate?
[6:41:37] MiraPacku: is that the one where you turn yourself into a cyborg?
[6:41:39] mechoriet: @MrDerpTV also they played all the game too dead
[6:41:42] Mr_Anderson90: some flat lamps
[6:41:55] just_a_jao: EMC is a good Mod, but make things easy in late game
[6:42:18] mechoriet: @MrDerpTV also gtarp sucks up so much time
[6:42:20] Mr_Anderson90: during that time i watched a lot of sevadus. i thinnk it was sevtech or something
[6:42:20] N4RCO5: Good old uu matter farm that produces solar panels to make more uu
[6:42:52] daemonaedryn: Manufactio took a step towards that I think, then stopped
[6:43:05] mechoriet: @MrDerpTV also shorty taking a break from streaming
[6:43:12] BONBONNIE13: jokes on you I have no idea how EMC works so I just don't use it 5Head
[6:43:26] Evoti: coblestone
[6:43:36] CallofDuty_Monster: The reactor might start after 7 minutes at 75k rf/t? this is a rough guess by watching mod spotlights
[6:43:46] mechoriet: @MrDerpTV so alot of things that made it kinda dificult to get it going again but hopefully soon then can find a timeslot that would work for all wafflePog
[6:43:55] daftMOOSE: @Giantwaffle what heat source are you using under your crucibles?
[6:43:58] 0BHK: rank favorite modpacks
[6:44:01] MiraPacku: monkaGun thinking
[6:44:20] daemonaedryn: KEKW
[6:44:23] mechoriet: KEKW
[6:44:24] akaCube: when does the reactor start generating power?

[6:49:23] TelRehiad: disable the cooling until its on
[6:49:23] daemonaedryn: The question is, do you want to risk that Kappa
[6:49:30] mechoriet: KEKW
[6:49:32] nesse007: you dont need the cooling to start the reactor
[6:49:41] TelRehiad: you want the core to heat up

[6:54:23] mechoriet: monkaCough right in ma face Lark
[6:54:24] Trucker_Torpedo: ok so i watched the tutorial for the cooling. you need the coolers placed diagonal for best efficiency. in regards to the numbers, each size of the reactor needs different numbers. you need one stable source of power for the rings, and one temp source of power for the core until it hits 8000 K. @Giantwaffle Sorry for wall of text
[6:54:35] Driitzz: pepeSmoke
[6:54:37] Jamswhat2: monkaCough
[6:54:58] Evoti: how much power can the core hold?
[6:55:11] omar_i_: you are cooling it too much
[6:55:13] tripwires: tripwires subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 7 months! 
[6:55:15] daemonaedryn: Wonder why the quest gave so little information about this
[6:55:28] Driitzz: can you make the reactor go boom for science ? NOTED
[6:55:30] omar_i_: mirror coolers on the sides
[6:55:47] Trucker_Torpedo: yes you need elevators so you can go upstairs @Giantwaffle
[6:55:47] Vovosunt: @Giantwaffle can you power the core, till it starts producing power for cooling?
[6:56:14] Silver_Skeeter: mirror = cooler - ring - cooler
[6:56:39] Jamswhat2: mirror = - ring :)
[6:56:57] Vovosunt: so diagonally?
[6:57:03] Trucker_Torpedo: diagonal means across on the other side
[6:57:14] Bleu_Forge: Bleu_Forge subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 21 months! are ya winning son
[6:57:31] Auratone: hey man how was the game jam?
[6:57:33] omar_i_: you are cooling it too much
[6:57:54] Trucker_Torpedo: so each water cooler does 50k on its own, but 200k if they are placed diagonal. cooling is not useful until reactor is on @Giantwaffle
[6:58:08] nesse007: turn off cooling see what happens?
[6:58:15] Driitzz: ^
[6:58:43] Askjong: pepeLaugh He doesn't know
[6:58:45] Trucker_Torpedo: it will take a loooong time before you are anywhere near meltdown.
[6:59:28] Trucker_Torpedo: can be negated with turning it off :P
[6:59:56] Cafn8247: I feel like exploding a draconian reactor has made me a it gunshy of any reactor mod lol

[7:14:35] Larklen: PauseChamp
[7:14:36] DecoyOcelot: it should need less and less power as it gets hotter
[7:14:40] DecoyOcelot: the core i mean
[7:14:48] Evoti: 8000kk is max temp?
[7:14:51] YOhodges: can you make more an charge them and swap them out or too much material needed
[7:14:55] CallofDuty_Monster: once it reaches 8000kK you just need to power the ring
[7:14:58] Biddy2004: take the ones that are empty and refill now?
[7:15:02] alek_199: Turn off cooling?
[7:15:03] DecoyOcelot: 8000k is starting temp, not even close to max
[7:15:07] Xantalus: @giantwaffle u need a lever to turn it on if i remember correctly otherwise it will heat up and do noting
[7:15:17] Trucker_Torpedo: you dont need any cooling before its on tho
[7:15:19] Quivering_Dreams: PepLaugh he doesn't know
[7:15:29] Sanduckchan: slowing down
[7:15:29] Trucker_Torpedo: cooling is for efficiency
[7:15:47] GirthGirls: dang its slowing down
[7:15:49] nwl1515: delta K is going slower
[7:15:50] DecoyOcelot: thats correct, its the opposite of the fission reactor, cause reasons
[7:16:13] Quivering_Dreams: yes, and if it activates you can reconnect the cooling
[7:16:19] Trucker_Torpedo: eventually it needs cooling, but the temp rises very slow
[7:16:23] Orin_The_Sly: Shoulda levered the water pipe On/Off
[7:16:47] Orin_The_Sly: Could have rather...
[7:16:59] Trucker_Torpedo: you are at 4000k out of 8000Kk :P
[7:17:39] nesse007: make more cube?
[7:17:51] Mephesto_: what was the nerf gun waffle printed?
[7:18:24] Trucker_Torpedo: yeah but it needs to get to 8000Kk before meltdown
[7:18:42] HP_is_Alive: kinda wanna see the meltdown
[7:18:42] Moobot: You can find Waffle's Youtube channel here - https://youtube.com/giantwaffle
[7:19:47] UECNSNemesis: how expensive are the batteries?
[7:19:48] Quivering_Dreams: @hp_for3v3r that would be like 2 days worth of progress just... gone
[7:19:55] HP_is_Alive: yeah i know
[7:20:13] DecoyOcelot: the only thing that really requires it is glowstone
[7:20:22] DecoyOcelot: you could just make a bunch of fission reactors
[7:20:36] lalashkin_G: @Giantwaffle why not do another generator room? It will take more time, but gives you more profit in a long run
[7:20:41] Quivering_Dreams: like you could repair it, but he put the stuff that is sustaining the reaction in the same room as thereactor
[7:20:44] Ardrago: if you can start the temp back up at 2k you will get to 8k
[7:21:02] iTents: Why not put some more power in now so it gets up to about 6k before you fully charge
[7:21:17] akaCube: so the goal is to hit the fusing temperature?
[7:21:18] ecnerw4l: cooling is a bitch atm lol
[7:21:20] Trucker_Torpedo: get the top power block too?
[7:21:23] BONBONNIE13: three big pumps gachiBASS
[7:21:41] UECNSNemesis: can't you just charge batteries while another set pumps?
[7:21:56] ecnerw4l: he needs the power
[7:22:06] TelRehiad: they are actually very close to what scientists asssume reactors like them would work like
[7:22:14] TelRehiad: which is why they are so complex
[7:22:23] omar_i_: pump it NODDERS
[7:22:32] Ardrago: he cant cause the thing that allows the pumping of the temp is also what charges his batteries UECNSNemesis
[7:22:59] akaCube: are you cooling it right now?
[7:23:14] N3rvrackD: so unless im wrong aren't we basically doing a pump and dump? KEKW
[7:23:16] iTents: No he isnt @akaCube
[7:23:22] iTents: All power is being used to charge
[7:23:33] DimensionalShadow: Just need that big initial jump
[7:23:33] Ardrago: KEKW N3rvrackD
[7:24:24] TallicDragon: If this doesn't work, it might be worth making a small fission reactor to power the startup
[7:24:30] TelRehiad: once you ignite it, you only need the magnet power
[7:24:42] Trucker_Torpedo: ^^
[7:24:44] Quivering_Dreams: fusion reactor meltdowns would probably not be very hot from the plasma, but said plasma is full of things like very hot tritium which would react with ambient oxygen to make danger water
[7:24:45] joshdruzy77: Y is NLE chapa in here ?????
[7:24:51] Ardrago: you could also craft 4 more of those batteries to load it to 8k fully right? cause you had 8 last time for 4k, so 16 should get you to 8k
[7:24:52] stivie98: dont forget u added 4 more

[7:33:11] DimensionalShadow: lol
[7:33:11] Ardrago: most likely half a charge should be enoguh
[7:33:13] sdman12o: F
[7:33:36] Vidzargs: yes, but it's not working yet
[7:33:53] Alamose: the fluxducts have a sort of battery built into them, so thats why they kept running for a bit
[7:33:54] daemonaedryn: Building an arc reactor YEP
[7:33:57] TallicDragon: The fusing gas is so hot it would melt anything, so it's kept from touching the walls using magnets
[7:34:01] BigDplayz1: Just got and here and no clue whats going on lol
[7:34:24] grimmn: yes
[7:34:29] minegryf9: justneed bigger magnets
[7:34:30] galaxy_berry: yes the magnetic field weakens
[7:34:30] Silver_Skeeter: yes dramaticly
[7:34:31] Toxicplasm4: not sure on electromagnetic
[7:34:34] RevengeLetsPlay: @Giantwaffle The Elecrtomagnets are there to keep the Plasma Flowing steady in the  Stream. So it doesnt break it the Electromagnets are also cooled really hard. they are always in the negative degrees
[7:34:38] n8level: feels like we're building a device to restart the sun or something -- a Sunshine pack would be fun I think
[7:34:39] ShinyBadger: ye
[7:34:41] UECNSNemesis: Curie Temperature, ye
[7:34:43] Frankenstain: based on me watching Forged In Fire, yes
[7:34:44] orillion: helium
[7:34:50] orillion: for superconducting magnets
[7:34:54] TelRehiad: you are thinking of steel.
[7:34:54] kappathirteen: !launch
[7:35:10] abel_jvc: hello
[7:35:10] Moobot: Support Waffle by using his Epic creator code: Giantwaffle
[7:35:12] TallicDragon: I think the gas ionizes
[7:35:15] ReiydL: Because its weaker so maybe the other field has more influence on it?
[7:35:21] MrHashbrowns: because yoiu cant change the particles  charcge
[7:35:24] grimmn: The magnetic field contains the plasma in the fusion core
[7:35:24] Quivering_Dreams: the plasma is more similare to diamagnetic and stuff, it's curie temperature doesn't matter that much
[7:35:25] B3rs: they use superconductors cooled with helium to generate a gigantic magnetic field
[7:35:27] RevengeLetsPlay: @Giantwaffle It only looses its own Propeties its still Affected
[7:35:28] UECNSNemesis: Plasmas are composed of ions, so they can still be manipulated by fields
[7:35:29] TelRehiad: steel loses its magnetics at temperature. plasma is very different
[7:35:32] JetMike11: i love ferret magnits
[7:35:33] Vovosunt: that's for metals...
[7:35:38] 413_Payload_Too_Large: Plasma consists of charged particles, which care a lot about magnetic fields because of Lorentz forces
[7:35:38] WoofWoofDude: well electrons are still electrons. they keep their negative charge.. that said maybe the charge is bigger or lower so you may need a stronger magnetic fields
[7:35:43] n8level: its a rotating current shaped by the magnetic field
[7:35:48] YOhodges: thats the problem with it is that its not a simple field it becomes super complex so keeping it away from the edges of the vessel becomes very difficult
[7:35:50] Vidzargs: cause it's hot as fuck, it will melt the walls if it touches it
[7:35:55] NBtncrt: @giantwaffle, I'm pretty hot, so my magnetic properties are through the roof, women are very attracted to me Kappa
[7:36:06] UECNSNemesis: F = v x B
[7:36:21] UECNSNemesis: oops, that was left handed
[7:36:36] akaCube: Don't quote me, but i believe it works by passing massive electricity forces through the plasma so it creates its own magnetic field, which holds it in place.
[7:37:10] YOhodges: brothers?
[7:37:12] RoninStorm: @Giantwaffle Ever read about the Boltzmann brain hypothesis?  Fun little physics thought experiment to ponder... :D
[7:37:13] Toxicplasm4: its science, love it :D
[7:37:16] WableWeebleWoo: @giantwaffle a plasma is an electrically charged gas so it still "feels" the magnetism
[7:37:30] Brianmose12: YEP
[7:37:38] Trucker_Torpedo: physics way above minecraft level LUL
[7:37:44] Quivering_Dreams: yes
[7:37:44] SpiderQueen7202: I imagine positively charged because aren't plasmas stripped of electrons?
[7:37:44] RevengeLetsPlay: I actually Built my own Fusion Reacot Kappa
[7:37:49] Warkless: KomodoPause
[7:37:54] Quivering_Dreams: plasma is electron soup
[7:37:58] akaCube: cooking was active last time as well
[7:37:58] YOhodges: fusion apricot
[7:37:59] RevengeLetsPlay: Plasma is Positivly charged
[7:38:00] Evoti: Chat can you feel it Hype Hype!!
[7:38:03] wsd7: comrade dyatlov Kappa
[7:38:07] Brianmose12: plasma is weird Kappa
[7:38:13] WableWeebleWoo: typically passively because the easiest way is to strip electrons from the atoms
[7:38:14] JetMike11: What would happen if it over heats?
[7:38:17] GTLugo: plasma is a soup of ions
[7:38:19] WableWeebleWoo: positively*
[7:38:45] BeastboySAW: I’m positive I don’t know.
[7:38:50] davethulhu: Plasma is typically an electrically quasineutral medium of unbound positive and negative particles (i.e. the overall charge of a plasma is roughly zero).
[7:39:10] lasarian: "plasmas are made up of atoms in which some or all of the electrons have been stripped away and positively charged nuclei, called ions, roam freely."
[7:39:21] MetalBBA: shouldve left the cables, they wouldve helped balance the load and keep max output longere
[7:39:31] Quivering_Dreams: no
[7:39:33] Vidzargs: how much's your passive cooling?
[7:39:40] davethulhu: the electrons are still there

[7:39:53] lasarian: man idk i just googled the question
[7:39:55] DimensionalShadow: Fusion reactor to the moon
[7:39:58] GTLugo: No, the electrons are still there
[7:40:04] SpiderQueen7202: Yeah but they're free flowing. The element that is being contained by magnetism is positively charged
[7:40:06] GTLugo: They just are not bound to the atoms

[7:50:44] Orin_The_Sly: In dynamos KEKW
[7:50:49] Quivering_Dreams: yeah the problem with protium/protium fusion is that 2 proton helium doesn't want to exist and i THINK decays into deuterium through beta+ emission

[7:55:30] omar_i_: no fukin way
[7:55:33] ecnerw4l: @giantwaffle i think you should make sure that you can't draw power from the outside ring power gen
[7:55:34] daemonaedryn: So approx 930 should be 2% then 1860 should be 3%?
[7:55:35] orillion: Clip it Ship it D:

[7:57:11] MisterMOONDog: at the low end of a log scale though, you'd expect the numbers to be sort of linear
[7:57:17] Billy7879: 100mil KEKW
[7:57:18] Brianmose12: COPIUM
[7:57:25] MrHashbrowns: stack another on top double your output
[7:57:30] daemonaedryn: I think the configs tell you how much each fuel produces
[7:57:50] Owski_83: so it's actually making 15k RF/t counting the energy it consumes
[7:57:51] HostileLogOut: no. just make it max size. and passive cooling
[7:57:51] RoninStorm: If at 3% it is still around 1300rf/t then you may be right
[7:57:55] Warkless: Believe COPIUM
[7:57:56] mechoriet: COPIUM yes believe
[7:58:02] Ardrago: oh boy, still looking pretty linear Sadge
[7:58:06] Trucker_Torpedo: what size cube is this in? 13x13?
[7:58:08] Alsabatini: how do you get better efficiency?
[7:58:15] daemonaedryn: YEO
[7:58:17] daemonaedryn: YEP

[7:59:03] Trucker_Torpedo: this reactor isnt for power, its for glowstone LUL
[7:59:05] CallofDuty_Monster: better fuels make more power?
[7:59:06] MiraPacku: NODDERS maybe with better fuel
[7:59:07] MrHashbrowns: one to run 2. 2 to run 4 its easy
[7:59:08] TelRehiad: need to switch fuels
[7:59:10] daemonaedryn: Changing the fuel may be worth i
[7:59:17] blu3gamr: blow it up trash reactor
[7:59:17] Tithonius: the power could continue to climb after hitting effeciency number
[7:59:23] RodriCraft93: better fuel?
[7:59:24] Evoti: but will you not make 470k?
[7:59:30] ticket2hell88: 4 and 1726?
[7:59:37] Ardrago: start building the next reactor? PauseChamp
[7:59:48] mechoriet: would fuel types change how much power it makes or is it just heat?

[7:59:50] Orin_The_Sly: Build a reactor to run another reactor KEKW
[7:59:54] akaCube: could you switch this to deuterium/deuterium real quick?
[8:00:06] TheLurkingOne: when the pack is finished can you blow it up
[8:00:07] Billy7879: rip the 100mil dream
[8:00:10] saltyspitoon73: temperature monkaS
[8:00:12] Quivering_Dreams: see the way you are SUPPOSED to play this mod is use a large protium-deuterium to make things like tritium and helium-3 or something, and THAT's your power fuel
[8:00:23] Orin_The_Sly: The size limit is the real nut punch here...
[8:00:31] even__odds: is efficiency not related to how fast to goes up instead of the max power limit?
[8:00:31] AmazingBhop: 100 mil more like 40k sadKEK
[8:00:31] JackVaine: Pog
[8:00:32] iTents: Im going to guess 44,250Rf
[8:00:33] RodriCraft93: use this reactor make a bigger one maybe?
[8:00:34] RoninStorm: @Giantwaffle the average rf/t per percent is increasing so linear might be wrong afterall
[8:00:37] DimensionalShadow: Now its mmmkay
[8:00:39] Flobu_: kilo kelvin?
[8:00:40] MasterKraft: oh noes, still very linear...that would be sad

[8:01:56] Trucker_Torpedo: isnt there a pick specific to boron and lithium?
[8:02:14] d0peinc: Does the purple bar on the right side matter for efficiency ?? @giantwaffle
[8:02:44] RodriCraft93: use this one to pump a bigger one
[8:02:46] Cafn8247: 1 pump
[8:02:59] Billy7879: modCheck
[8:03:01] MasterKraft: with cooldown between
[8:03:02] Billy7879: rip
