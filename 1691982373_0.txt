[0:13:45] SimonSez: no
[0:13:48] SimonSez: lol
[0:13:57] bugsplatter23: so they sell you a garbage cable knowing you'll have to replace twice a year?
[0:13:58] HiddenDrop: Is there anything I can do with channel points?
[0:14:15] OrangeW2: they also replace it for free almost infinitely
[0:14:25] Pati: Ill join mc in a few Prayge
[0:14:28] OrangeW2: a friend of mine has had 4 replacements for free
[0:14:40] bugsplatter23: Quest 2 cable is $20 on amazon
[0:14:47] OrangeW2: they do, I got one recently
[0:15:07] OrangeW2: it's only if you're like 2 years out of warranty
[0:15:07] Seerion: Moon today!
[0:15:19] nxusr: air link on the oculus was life changing, idk if I can go back to a wired VR headset
[0:15:39] officialhunterx: why not hang the cable from the celling so you dont step on it
[0:15:50] Pati: Valve replaced my entire base station when it broke for free
[0:16:07] iWALL_E: hades soundtrack, thoughts
[0:16:25] mechoriet: COPIUM we get too the moon today
[0:16:33] OrangeW2: AFAIK the best thing you can do is to unplug it from the breakaway and untangle it every time you finish playing
[0:16:37] BuLLeT_LV: Moon today! COPIUM
[0:16:39] venom366: just buy liquid metal Kappa
[0:16:48] bugsplatter23: it sounds like the best thing to do is tie the cable to the headset so stress doesn't go to the connector
[0:17:05] officialhunterx: pati is cheating on you with streets
[0:17:08] SimonSez: Or use pulleys
[0:17:10] daemonaedryn: Everything
[0:17:10] Pati: Panda left a "present" in the basement if you can check
[0:17:11] zonizyde: i tend to punch my headset l0l
[0:17:11] OrangeW2: @bugsplatter23 unfortunately it's usually never the connector failing, it's the actual wire within the cable at any point
[0:17:12] mobfarmer: never use a cable, and it won't break
[0:17:13] Bulltank: All the things
[0:17:18] babyaddalyn: panda have a gift for you in the basement

[0:24:05] o0mates0o: o0mates0o subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 47 months!

[0:24:09] ohbi78: any ads at all with turbo?
[0:24:12] eldersage69: @zynithtv the adblocks can cause the ads if you have turbo
[0:24:16] orangecreamsicle3: did you like the gift in the basement? :)
[0:24:17] Koeckie: @ohbi78 no :)
[0:24:23] Zucate: ohbi78 now that i have experienced

[0:25:58] RevengeLetsPlay: @ninopanda i had a good idea there i wonder if Pati saw it yesterday xD
[0:26:01] Dagmoo: @zynithtv the adblocks can cause the ads. the only real way to fix it is disable the adblocker on twitch.
[0:26:02] Turnpoint: just slam some c4 in you
[0:26:08] Tro95: Didn't you make the EBF yesterday able to easily smelt any single items?

[0:35:44] Moobot: Come join the Waffle House Discord! <# https://discord.gg/fhGFtMuzdS
[0:36:05] officialhunterx: he said friday hopefully i think
[0:36:06] mechoriet: Ci back friday if no airplane memes
[0:36:46] xindianx: I have a southwest flight tomorrow, I have an american backup flight that I am tempted to just take to skip any foolery
[0:37:16] Thalmize: i think their software system fried
[0:37:21] thenightman___: their old software failed
[0:37:23] Thalmize: which is linked to the plains
[0:37:23] xindianx: apparantly their software system imploded
[0:37:25] DrYProtoss: bad infrastructure
[0:37:26] Thalmize: *planes
[0:37:26] Deystan: outdated software system
[0:37:28] Linkitch: Apparently a pretty shitty old system.
[0:37:29] laidher: flight attendants and software
[0:37:31] frainsbreeze: is southwest the ryanair of europe?
[0:37:32] OrangeW2: intern pushed to prod :^)
[0:37:32] mechoriet: old ass systems
[0:37:33] Apparentthreat: They didn’t spend money
[0:37:34] babyaddalyn: win98
[0:37:35] Venxuri: DNS
[0:37:35] Thalmize: really bad infrastructure
[0:37:37] TuomiO1: Their software is from the 90's
[0:37:40] R1Rider01: the USDOT is investigating them to see why they canceled so many
[0:37:41] pufflefump: Technical debt on an old crew scheduling system
[0:37:47] hydoto: LUL nobody spends money in a company
[0:37:47] silv: they got the Y2K bug Kappa
[0:37:50] Ipakk: ibm stuff if i guess
[0:37:52] SeriousPotatoBot: I turned it off :)
[0:37:53] P00nDozer69: They don't have live tracking of staffing, it's all based on expected location and has to be updated manually
[0:37:54] Deystan: why spend money on software when you can keep the money Pog
[0:37:55] Allmostdone: Supposedly that the software couldn’t match up crew with planes
[0:37:58] Archie8300: why invest in improving when you can scrape by
[0:38:02] PureSpider: hold up! you need to maintain infrastructure and software?! bamBam
[0:38:03] daemonaedryn: That must have cost them millions
[0:38:03] Droly: southwest doesn't have a hub like delta etc. So they have a plane go to 4 places if that flight gets canceled it is a domino effect
[0:38:05] elric689: they did stock buy backs instead of updating software
[0:38:05] Thalmize: it was only a matter of time
[0:38:06] Artzmann: @giantwaffle this is what happens when you spend all your money on stock buybacks instead of investing in the company
[0:38:06] xindianx: They said they were attempting to track ALL of their crew and pilots via paper while trying to sort it out.
[0:38:09] daemonaedryn: Shareholders
[0:38:09] kane1941: probably were using old dll made by some country guy

[0:38:58] frainsbreeze: did you sort the p2p problem from yesterday?
[0:39:00] PureSpider: yea unthinkable to operate without central hubs
[0:39:05] PureSpider: imagine lufthansa without frankfurt, wtf
[0:39:05] Kingia: That alone would be manageable if they didn't also use the cheap as fuck system of not having hub airports but expecting crews to jump from flight to flight
[0:39:14] Jell34: it was a not broke dont fix it or upgrade it  now they are paying for it
[0:39:17] d3vrand0m: $12M
[0:39:26] Dagmoo: government trying to make sure SW covers hotels/food etc for ppl cuz of the cancelled flights
[0:39:37] P00nDozer69: yeah it's called deadheading
[0:39:42] SeriousPotatoBot: waffleSPIN Last chance
[0:39:44] d3vrand0m: sorry that was wrong $5M
[0:39:54] frainsbreeze: that doesn't sound like an optimized solution
[0:40:06] EBrarian: let's hope it wasn't a hack or something
[0:40:16] gtluszcz: oh automated diodes, finally
[0:40:19] R1Rider01: aren't you making transitors already?
[0:40:19] mobfarmer: if a pilot is in new york but can't fly out of new york, the airline is screwed.

[0:45:49] kane1941: not automation something that takes 600 seconds to make pepeLaugh
[0:46:06] Venamah: id say yes cause circuits are in almost everything upi make
[0:46:12] Venamah: you
[0:46:45] thebubbajones1: Good morning friends, what’s the plan for today?
[0:46:50] dylan0806: Can’t you use receipts cards?
[0:46:56] mobfarmer: if it takes 600 seconds,  create 10 systemes. that it takes 60 seconds per process.
[0:46:58] kane1941: i think its intended to have like 20 specialized EBFs
[0:47:05] Manacaym: make a massive ebf room, you got the power now
[0:47:21] Venxuri: one per is enough tbh but best to passive them before you need it
[0:47:47] Manacaym: I mean make the room and slowly build it up. doesn't have to be all maxed right off the bat
[0:47:50] Dizz1227: are we still on track for automatic the vibrant gears? I get so lost watching this pack sometimes
[0:47:55] Venxuri: @Giantwaffle I'd recommend emitting base on the amount of boules that you have, since 1 Wafer cuts into so many boules
[0:48:01] Niceyyy: wafer or booles ?
[0:48:05] Venamah: your gonna need more EBF's for late game, id just bite the bullet and make more
[0:48:45] Turnpoint: just a 1000 in your system at all
[0:48:46] dylan0806: You should use the booles not the wafers
[0:49:13] micrud: Does waffle use lost cities or default overworld?
[0:49:14] the_madvillain: You running a chipFab here?
[0:49:22] dylan0806: Won’t the booles flood the system then?
[0:49:54] mobfarmer: let the booles hit the floor, let the booles hit the floor ;-p
[0:50:06] Venxuri: there is a cover for gt machines that makes them accept redstone signal than you can level emit straight to the ebf and it turns off
[0:50:37] Venxuri: your way is also good, tru
[0:50:44] mobfarmer: we need automated waffles...
[0:51:01] Tro95: put the liquids into the bank of pati
[0:51:06] kane1941: just move it, it is fine as MV

[0:53:53] Sui_Ume: did you at least figure the p2p network out?
[0:54:05] RingSong: random aside, I like how those tubes that connect everything are mod items. But many mods seem to use them now, so it's become like a staple for how tubes/cables look ingame.
[0:54:18] frainsbreeze: SIGN
[0:54:32] PureSpider: @RingSong what, ender i/o?

[0:55:47] OishiisDelicious: Roomful of Lube....title of my sextape
[0:55:52] iLu_786: Confirmed waffle doesn’t like excess lube. Prefers it dry.
