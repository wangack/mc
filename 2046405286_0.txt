[1:43:59] P3pp3rF1y: but turtles are so cute and cuddly
[1:44:28] Merry_Pippin: There have been some recent blogposts, and the developers are pretty active on Twitter along with jobs still being posted for Hytale.
[1:44:32] cptcinnabunny: turtles remind me of the anteaters in hunt and run
[1:44:50] samwich1991: @cptcinnabunny NODDERS
[1:45:02] samwich1991: HypeHands1 HypeHands2
[1:45:07] harif13: otters are cute

[1:45:24] SmokedEnderMite: red pandas
[1:45:25] BigFlameWolf: Bears?
[1:45:26] vebo_0: snappy turtles have one heck of a jaw pressure(?)

[1:46:25] aka_eliya: @cwisted_tunt Thanks for the gift sub!  thanks for the sub
[1:46:29] BigFlameWolf: @lenjenben There's a difference between turtles and tortoises: turtles spend most of their lives in water and have slimmer, more water-streamlined shells. Tortoises have more domed shells and spend most of their lives on land.
[1:46:29] aka_eliya: ^^
[1:46:30] vadskamanta: hbomb94LUL Seren
[1:46:53] Merry_Pippin: Cheer50 Any thoughts on what you want in the next season of Vault Hunters?
[1:46:58] cptcinnabunny: Did H talk about his charizard at the start of stream?
[1:47:07] BigFlameWolf: @cptcinnabunny He did!
[1:47:09] BigFlameWolf: Merry! hbomb94Dance hbomb94Dance hbomb94Dance
[1:47:18] aka_eliya: btw if u have monoliths doesnt that mean ur not on update 13?
[1:47:19] cptcinnabunny: @BigFlameWolf cool, I'll catch it in the vod
[1:47:23] aka_eliya: since its brazier now
[1:47:25] hynatos: @Merry_Pippin he wants ice cream : D
[1:47:26] zebrainap: dash gone???
[1:47:26] P3pp3rF1y: that's a radical idea
[1:47:29] sealife4ev: danks?
[1:47:49] cwisted_tunt: you made vault hunters fun
[1:47:51] avian946: remove dash…. what
[1:48:06] harif13: well that is just a preference
[1:48:10] Merry_Pippin: Choo Chooo 2020ByeGuys
[1:48:17] AndyLurks: They should add nunchucks to vault hunters
[1:48:23] BigFlameWolf: You used Dash basically all the time in VH S3.
[1:48:27] zebrainap: do you not like any of the dash options?
[1:48:31] BigFlameWolf: So it's probably from your challenge.
[1:48:32] Luxi86: speeed hryElp
[1:48:44] tyranno66: Also later levels dash feels pretty necessary to complete vaults
[1:49:03] vadskamanta: H doesn't like shields either, doesn't mean he won'y use them because it's necessary
[1:49:09] P3pp3rF1y: the vaults are definitely scaled with dash in mind
[1:49:10] aka_eliya: well thats a preference, u arent forced to use dash or any other mobility ability or upgrade but that ur choice that makes it harder
[1:49:13] kinghingle: u know, so ture
[1:49:13] lynx6008: If they remove dash, they have to remove the wings trinket
[1:49:16] kinghingle: *true
[1:49:20] maloki: So what does fragged mean for the difficulty Like what changes?
[1:49:24] emilyurmie13: I don’t think dash will go, Iskall loves dash
[1:49:36] cptcinnabunny: 1east home
[1:49:38] sealife4ev: so bring back vault chocolate?
[1:49:39] cwisted_tunt: level 70 n cant find a good build
[1:49:39] BigFlameWolf: @maloki Mobs have a lot more health and do a lot more damage.
[1:49:40] cptcinnabunny: I think
[1:49:45] vadskamanta: 1e home
[1:49:58] Merry_Pippin: 1 South to home, gotcha.
[1:49:59] P3pp3rF1y: I am not letting it go
[1:49:59] Sydni_Heiss: i will never not take dash for the overworld elytra
[1:50:14] samwich1991: Choo Chooo 2020Rivalry
[1:50:17] maloki: Yeah dash for overworld elytra is so niiice
[1:50:22] AndyLurks: What ever happened to the race for herald series
[1:50:27] kinghingle: LUL y not stand ur ground, go dash-less next season?
[1:50:35] maloki: @BigFlameWolf Thank you, I knew it got harder, but I just didn't know in what ways :D
[1:50:40] lynx6008: U can take dash with the eye of ender specialization
[1:51:05] headassvibes: hihi
[1:51:20] Sydni_Heiss: just get speed 4 before level 30 and run past them
[1:51:21] cptcinnabunny: Nice
[1:51:28] cptcinnabunny: Drake
[1:51:30] bas3j: Woo
[1:51:30] harif13: encause you prefer the casual looting as opposed to the smash and grab
[1:51:34] kinghingle: he did it! mr gear-bomb they'l call him
[1:51:35] tyranno66: You said please
[1:51:37] jackxlwashere: Drake
[1:51:41] sealife4ev: someone stop this man's luck
[1:51:48] vebo_0: Drake
[1:51:55] P3pp3rF1y: but maybe we could add modifier to your vaults that bans use of dash
[1:52:10] cwisted_tunt: hbomb94Dance hbomb94Dance hbomb94Dance hbomb94Dance
[1:52:19] kinghingle: that might be kinda cool actually, a moderfier per member of the SMP
[1:52:22] cptcinnabunny: @P3pp3rF1y Modifiers would be cool! Watching the mini series they did was pretty fun
[1:52:41] zebrainap: modifiers that ban abilities like dash or hunter that a lot of people use would be fun
[1:53:00] kinghingle: harrys - no damage abilities LUL
[1:53:02] superllumina: you have 2 shulker shells
[1:53:15] cwisted_tunt: i love hunter
[1:53:20] harif13: Hunter has been discussed as being too op by Iskal
[1:53:25] Sydni_Heiss: i dont use hunter.
[1:53:29] cptcinnabunny: how about every vault has void pools? LUL
[1:53:44] sophistic_ated: Champion mobs / bosses should be allowed to spawn with immunities, frost immunity, nova, poison etc...
[1:53:49] Merry_Pippin: There are too many hidden chests to try and find in some vaults.
[1:53:51] kinghingle: i honestly think it would be good to get rid of hunter and rebalance a bit. i think that'd be a healthier experience
[1:53:52] Terka_303: hii
[1:53:59] tyranno66: I kinda would like for the hunter effect to be trinket only
[1:54:12] cwisted_tunt: scav r horrible
[1:54:19] Sydni_Heiss: hunter for the turn ins and alters onlu
[1:54:19] zebrainap: had a scav today where i only needed one earing so i got gilded then found only 1 earring after 100 gilded chests lol
[1:54:21] cptcinnabunny: hi Terka!
[1:54:24] aka_eliya: they wouldnt remove it i dont think, they might make the cd higher and the mana cost higher but removing something people got so used to in the game wont happen
[1:54:38] ValueTown: scav is the best objective by far
[1:54:57] zebrainap: scavs are great until you get the earring, 2 zombie brain 30 ripped pages scav lol
[1:55:03] sealife4ev: i swear h liked elixer the most
[1:55:11] tyranno66: Scavs had the best glowup out of all the objectives
[1:55:21] ValueTown: @zebrainap that is totally doable. it's the 13 pottery shard scavs that are impossible
[1:55:21] SerenityUwU99: Hii Terka!!! peepoHey
[1:55:26] vadskamanta: @sealife4ev when?? H never liked elixir
[1:55:41] sealife4ev: season 2
[1:55:53] tyranno66: Season 2 didn't have elixirs
[1:56:02] P3pp3rF1y: I am starting to feel like we should keep them in just for this commentary
[1:56:03] sealife4ev: wait.........
[1:56:05] AndyLurks: Maybe you should unlock way stones first
[1:56:08] zebrainap: @ValueTown it was possible until i only got earrings after 130 gilded chests lol, had 15 soul charms lol
[1:56:11] sealife4ev: when was that then
[1:56:13] Luxi86: hryElp
[1:56:23] cptcinnabunny: @P3pp3rF1y YESSSS
[1:56:25] vadskamanta: Ah yes... He liked something in season 2 that wasn't in season 2
[1:56:35] ValueTown: i think the turtles are fine. the baby gummy bears are hell
[1:56:36] tyranno66: Elixir was season 3, Barry suggested it iirc
[1:56:48] diamondslayer64: Ornates
[1:56:55] diamondslayer64: You missed ornates
[1:57:05] Sydni_Heiss: i died from a turtle once because it was chillin in water and it was a theme where you couldnt see into the water very well
[1:57:07] passeri_starling: slimes can be very annoying too
[1:57:07] kinghingle: sweeping edge
[1:57:08] tyranno66: Sweeping
[1:57:10] zebrainap: sweeping edge
[1:57:17] harif13: chaining
[1:57:26] sealife4ev: @vadskamanta I can't think of who or when it was then. I guess it's been too long since i've seen streams
[1:57:29] ThatManCave: it would be worse if there was a turtle drowned jockey
[1:57:32] zebrainap: est
[1:57:34] cptcinnabunny: east?
