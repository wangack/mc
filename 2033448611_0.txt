[0:19:55] Sapph1cTw1tch: Oh that's odd? 'You can't touch her, but she can put her arm around you??'
[0:20:03] Ashes0fTime: why would you want white hot chocolate? darker is just better white just tastes of sugar

[0:21:03] itsphantomking: im saving my cute points...
[0:21:07] princesslyra1520: @saberwolf3607 I disagree
[0:21:08] GrimRhea: one of the most accessible cons ive actually been too tho, megacon was
[0:21:09] tiredtv09: Any of y'all streamers
[0:21:17] scarletfeisty: ill admit i have yet to encounter like- meet and greets and such but they seem like fun

[0:25:28] MaritDukker: Yeah, I can imagine the 'smaller' cons are nicer to go too. Have had so much stress about all the things I wanted to do at Twitchcon
[0:25:31] XamiraTheParrot: Hi! I'm back, what did I miss?
[0:25:32] GrimRhea: @kaorusetalover no i didnt have any anyway, normally i get some issues cause wheelchair but i didnt have any!

[0:28:54] lauri_silver: Im probs gonna have to wait to go to cons until next year I think
[0:28:55] Sapph1cTw1tch: Question; Has there ever been a Canadian Twitchcon/Megacon/Vidcon? Or anything like that?
[0:28:58] equliturd801112: @jenjen2201 hello
[0:28:59] GrimRhea: oh thats odd, idk whats been up with vidcon it feels a bit different now that it used to for some reason
[0:29:03] MaritDukker: I feel like VidCon has become much more TikTok focused nowadays
[0:29:08] exiled_sundew: I want to try to go to vidcon this year, I've never been to one before
[0:29:18] hoshizoraing: @grimrhea yeah it was awful.. even on a sunday you couldnt get through the artist alleys or popasia or anything.. im glad im not going until october LOL exams all through may until july
[0:29:25] GrimRhea: @MaritDukker yeah, its not quite the same
[0:29:25] lauri_silver: @MaritDukker Honestly it has had a lot of tiktok creators in the past
[0:29:29] naturesarah: @tiredtv09 same I'm sad I won't be able to watch the stream tomorrow tho
[0:29:39] lauri_silver: ngl there were like at least 30 when I went in 2019 XD
[0:29:42] FluffyBlaket: For me to go to vidcon, I would have to have own car and money, and vid co would have to be at a drives length
[0:29:53] FallPointPeak: I've never been to a con lmao it's on my bucket list
[0:29:58] AJfierce_: i wish i could go lol i live in Australia
[0:29:59] lauri_silver: !age
[0:29:59] Moobot: @lauri_silver Please Do Not post your age or talk about how old you are in chat. You must be 13 years or older to have a twitch account and if twitch finds out you're not, your account could be BANNED. So please reframe from doing so, thank you.
[0:30:03] itsphantomking: i saw in a comment the other day that you also have aphantasia! i do too, and its so wonderful to see you createing such incredible and unique builld, despite it!
[0:30:29] MaritDukker: @lauri_silver I don't know about the actual division, I've never been able to go
[0:30:33] MaritDukker: But it feels like it
[0:30:34] GrimRhea: ohhh, that makes more sense
[0:30:43] GrimRhea: its not like, a fandom in the same sense no
[0:30:45] tiredtv09: @naturesarah cool
[0:30:48] Mo_TheRoboticGirl: Mo_TheRoboticGirl subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 38 months! just renewed my sub a few days ago! smajorHeart
[0:30:58] SassyTigerDame: i got real confused at the first mentions of megacon tbh bc theres one in my state with the same name and I was like "wait did i miss scott coming to my state???" Lol
[0:31:05] Jakotens: tiktok's format is content-focused, not creator-focused
[0:31:08] MaritDukker: Yeah, people don't really follow TikTokkers the same way as they do with streamers and YouTubers
[0:31:10] MaritDukker: True
[0:31:12] tiredtv09: @naturesarah wt version of Minecraft do u have
[0:31:28] Bellatorinimi: is empires going to start a new season soon?
[0:31:31] GrimRhea: @Jakotens yeah, thats a good wording of it
[0:31:58] bobthebuilder0404mg: that looks cool
[0:31:58] Moobot:  Follow Scott on his socials! https://twitter.com/Smajor1995 https://www.instagram.com/smajor1995 https://www.tiktok.com/@smajortiktok https://open.spotify.com/user/113959489 https://www.youtube.com/dangthatsalongname https://www.youtube.com/@SmajorVODS
[0:32:06] lauri_silver: @Jakotens yeah hence why theres so many people putting out similar content on tiktok
[0:32:11] MaritDukker: Besides, TikTok makes enough money from the content, they don't need a con
[0:32:21] tiredtv09: @bellatorinimi I don't think so
[0:32:29] GrimRhea: yeah but those people kinda make their own thing too, but tiktok has stopped monetising vids under 1min long now
[0:32:38] Bellatorinimi: @tiredtv09 ü•≤
[0:32:39] hoshizoraing: tiktok con wuld just be full of children LOL
[0:32:40] MaritDukker: @GrimRhea Really? Didn

[0:33:16] FluffyBlaket: I JUST FOUND OUT I DON'T SCHOOL TOMORROW BECAUSE OF SNOW!!!
[0:33:25] GrimRhea: @MaritDukker yeah its wild, i only know cause people have had to extend videos to fit it because their career is tiktok
[0:33:30] tiredtv09: @bellatorinimi that series made me wanna be a streamer
[0:33:31] Sapph1cTw1tch: Have there ever been any cons hosted in Canada?
[0:33:40] hoshizoraing: wish it was snowing in london.... its not cold enough yet

[0:34:57] SaberWolf3607: I was trekking through so much snow today because noone cleaned up the paths
[0:35:02] GrimRhea: @lauri_silver 6 inches in wales we would close schools ngl
[0:35:03] MaritDukker: @GrimRhea I'm not on TikTok anyway, so it doesn't impact me much, but I do feel for the content creators who try to live of off TikTok. Must be stressful if everything changes constantly
[0:35:07] Sapph1cTw1tch: @kaorusetalover God, come to Canada, I have a fever, just because I took my younger brothers tobogganing, for like 15-20 minutes
[0:35:09] tiredtv09: @bellatorinimi wt is it like in America
[0:35:16] GrimRhea: @MaritDukker fairrr
[0:35:16] Bellatorinimi: @tiredtv09 oh shubble is good too, but grian was the reason I found all of them
[0:35:18] lauri_silver: @GrimRhea they did close school the next day
[0:35:22] itsphantomking: 6 inches in england hasnt happened in 10 years

[0:36:00] MaritDukker: Oh god, if it's snowing that much in the UK I fear for the coming days over here
[0:36:02] cydisnotvicious: cydisnotvicious converted from a Prime sub to a Tier 1 sub!

[0:36:46] GrimRhea: @MaritDukker thats fair, if it ever gets to that ill let you know in advance c':
[0:36:51] Sapph1cTw1tch: @kaorusetalover It sucks when it first hits, especially when it's late at night, and you can't really leave your room without waking everyone up
[0:37:12] princesslyra1520: @grimrhea is it warm in the basement?

[1:03:31] Moobot: @Sapph1cTw1tch Scott uses He/Him pronouns and we all know it can be hard to remember pronouns and that's okay. So we found this little extension where you can pick your pronouns and it will show up with a badge next to your name. https://tinyurl.com/2eabfnub We wanna be as welcoming as we can, So just download the extension to your browers and pick your pronouns. https://pronouns.alejo.io/
