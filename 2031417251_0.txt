[0:39:44] zvr1: a lot of costumization for the looks

[0:39:47] qwertyman0001: how long did it took u bg3\
[0:39:49] xAngelite: It's like sims where u can adjust like the nose height and all if you are particular
[0:39:49] XcarSpy: LUL
[0:39:54] krxsvictoria2: It depends in how you want your character to look like.
[0:39:56] LunaOfTheMoons: I think finding the right face is what takes a while
[0:39:56] sailorbren: there's a lot of details to the face plus learning to navigate through it
[0:39:56] Ben_fox_: the customisation does go pretty wild but I guess you can always change things if you change your mind inmage
[0:40:00] Ben_fox_: ingame*
[0:40:01] Crylching: But you can always get "surgery"
[0:40:03] purpmob_t: yes how long do you usually take to create characters?

[0:40:39] vvickyyy__: you can always change his face in game after
[0:40:41] LurkerCen: Big thing really is not to look "default" LUL
[0:40:41] krxsvictoria2: It can take a while because the settings can be new to you.
[0:40:49] sailorbren: you can also wear a mask like miyoung did and just continue your face creation later

[0:41:34] krxsvictoria2: We're not saying this to get longer GTA contents, YEP
[0:41:41] tezballin19: you can just wear helmets/masks like shoto and sykkuno

[1:45:50] morpheus7078: lily loves rp KEKW
[1:45:57] Protohobo: Server reset helped with new ppl joining
[1:45:59] neelerita: miyoung was overwhelmed but is a NATURAL

[1:46:15] neelerita: lily lives her life like its RP
[1:46:39] Fossabot: higaCheers Friendly reminder for everyone to hydrate!! higaCheers
[1:46:39] bunnyberg: @itsRyanHiga how many calories do you eat in a day
[1:46:49] Enpdzerg: Well, lily already played gta with sykkuno once and we didn't see too much of that at the time I don't think
[1:46:54] Protohobo: Plus the time skip as well sooo new storylines and no established groups... Though that changed
[1:47:07] banana_sav69: are you a gamer kid
[1:47:13] neelerita: if it helps you dont have to commit to a character at all, make something simple to learn controls and thenmake a decent lore
[1:47:28] Protohobo: ^
[1:47:35] ArchAngelesTV: Maybe be a one lifer for your first day?
[1:47:55] its_alma_: play the Hawaiian guy PLEASE its too good
[1:48:01] neelerita: i know some people were thinking of wanting Regina to come back, ex-youtuber went broke and moved here
[1:48:04] vuBerryPi: @Protohobo yuno came home BibleThump
[1:48:09] neelerita: yes
[1:48:15] neelerita: you can continue it
[1:48:18] ArchAngelesTV: Nah you can continue it
[1:48:18] neelerita: its not a big deal
[1:48:26] imMerlinVP: says Ryan would prefer to not play a character like "Regina" because it would be difficult for him to maintain that character at all times during RP.
[1:48:26] vuBerryPi: @ArchAngelesTV baboFlower higaHeart
[1:48:37] ArchAngelesTV: @vuberrypi Hai flowerr
[1:48:40] Protohobo: @vuberrypi he is home Gladge
[1:49:03] Lu_LuBean: vu hiii flowerr Hai
[1:49:03] xoericaaaxo: my vote is still with the Hawaiian character and probably always will be lmao
[1:49:13] neelerita: i think thats only for super established characters
[1:49:25] vuBerryPi: @Lu_LuBean baboFlower higaHeart
[1:49:26] HISPA__: well it’s a big deal in terms of RP since if another character kills you permanently it’s consider a crime and are investigated
[1:49:28] astoldbyganja: vu CatCozy
[1:49:29] Protohobo: Well this not WildRP server sooo Perma won't effect a lot of ppl
[1:49:54] neelerita: like if you made a lot of influence in the game with people, then yeah maybe keep that character around but not log on as much
[1:50:00] vuBerryPi: @astoldbyganja baboFlower higaWave
[1:50:06] neelerita: bc official story for other rp'ers like grieving
[1:50:15] Protohobo: ^
[1:50:24] brozee1: !time
[1:50:24] Fossabot: Ryan's current time is Saturday, January 13th, 11:18:27 am
[1:50:57] imMerlinVP: Yeah, but once you perma a character, you can never go back to them
[1:51:05] imMerlinVP: It's forbidden by server rules
[1:51:11] sisco87: powergaming
[1:51:11] ArchAngelesTV: ^
[1:51:11] neelerita: nah it has to be grounded
[1:51:25] imMerlinVP: You can't RP as a person with superpowers
[1:51:51] Protohobo: @immerlinvp unless burn is given the okay KEKW
[1:51:56] sisco87: Blau RP's as a streamer..lol
[1:52:05] BooniesLens: : 3
[1:52:15] neelerita: aside from the fact that you can be revived in the game when you deadge, everything else is 'reality'
[1:52:21] Protohobo: Burn is diff
[1:52:22] imMerlinVP: @Protohobo KEKW he's a special case isn't he?
[1:52:22] neelerita: you can pretend to have superpowers
[1:52:40] ArchAngelesTV: burn RP is something else KEKW
[1:52:59] Protohobo: The other rpers RPed
[1:53:23] Protohobo: Except the Burn Halloween Special
[1:53:26] neelerita: pretty sure other rp'ers played along
[1:53:35] ArchAngelesTV: Has he tried relogging in yet since tsunami is over?
[1:53:40] neelerita: but at some point your really good RP gets noticed by Devs and you can get occasional leniences or help for events
[1:53:43] Protohobo: That was a special case
[1:54:19] imMerlinVP: @ArchAngelesTV no not yet
[1:54:43] neelerita: yeah its really brief times that they do things for some RP players for the wow factor
[1:54:47] neelerita: but its not frequent at all
[1:55:18] DBrazzers: Whats good Ryan
[1:55:19] ArchAngelesTV: @immerlinvp ok ty
[1:55:34] neelerita: But ill say you're asking the right questions atleast, so you know how to approach the variety of people :)
[1:55:45] ToxicKnight671: Heyyo Ryan heyyo chat! Hope everyone is having a good day! Stay hydrated y'all!😁

[1:57:09] Ernieezo: my man is double jumping in minecraft how
[1:57:11] ArchAngelesTV: Just remember what you hear off game, your character doesn't know so you'd have to "unlock" the knowledge through rp
[1:57:18] neelerita: Anyways for RP its basically like how you create a character for your YT :D super basic but distinct personalities lol, Regina, Hanate, Rdizzle, are the ones i remember well
[1:57:38] ToxicKnight671: yiff7
[1:57:44] ToxicKnight671: yvonWave yvonWave yvonWave yvonWave
[1:57:45] neelerita: you got this
[1:57:53] HISPA__: it’s alright to mess up because you are new to RP and if you break some rules at the start they’re really lenient
[1:57:54] imMerlinVP: Is there a mod around that can add commands? hmjj
