[1:13:18] DeePick: because i have a blue check you MUST listen to me
[1:13:22] gr4ndmux: When i was using those services to pirate, its just added content from shutter on the amazon video server
[1:13:41] gr4ndmux: infact bams amazon streams sometimes are better than shutters

[1:20:33] gman304855: @jonbams Sorry to hear bro
[1:20:34] xopa: It's only $8
[1:20:39] CrazyCanadian: Just dont touch tweetdeck
[1:20:42] yungskittlez: I mean it's already kinda a meh experience
[1:20:42] DaveGuy_: xopa Gladge
[1:20:44] Rodimus_Supreme: Using the website as it is now is already a terrible experience.
[1:20:45] ALOJUB: Twitter is already a terrible experiance
[1:20:46] ChakonPablo: 8$ will probably be no ads as well
[1:20:47] gr4ndmux: i legit wanna pay and move over to twitter only, seems like the only transparent social site right now.
[1:20:50] MartinSable3235: @The_Hessian_ I guess the answer is no then...
[1:20:50] erebus56: i'll be paying $8 and i'm a no body
[1:21:00] DaveGuy_: its just gonna be 2 classes of users again
[1:21:06] rackyjacks: Hey good mornin
[1:21:07] BurritoMedia: Cheer100 Cheer100  we are not worried about the politicians. "Public Figure" a youtuber is NOT a public figure. and if they are how big do they need to be to be a public figure. is it 1 million and does that mean some one with 900k does not get the special tag and and someone can pay to have the same check mark.
[1:21:10] That1DudeTom: the easy way to get people to pay is to promote tweets
[1:21:14] doodlebop16: that drives people away from twitch too. 8 minutes of ads every few minutes
[1:21:14] BruisedCranium56: Twitter loot boxes!!
[1:21:15] ms_crafty_: As long as i can still see the people i want to see im good
[1:21:20] DaveGuy_: we will still be nobodys with or without those 8 bucks erebus56
[1:21:25] BikePaulie: what if Elon sold spaghetti
[1:21:33] erebus56: the_guy1604 i know
[1:21:44] snake_eyes955: elon is gonna flood the platform with tesla bots to make people want to pay $8
[1:21:45] gr4ndmux: i kinda feel like burrito media is a current tech writer worrid about his clout
[1:21:47] gr4ndmux: chilll bro
[1:21:56] erebus56: i'm sure other perks will come with the $8 and i'm going to want them. i use twitter A LOT
[1:22:00] tallpaul84: feels check mark man
[1:22:06] Wetware: Elon did just pay 44 billion for a company that lost 221 million last year, and people are wondering why he's trying to monetize it.
[1:22:08] DaveGuy_: the_guy1604 gifted a Tier 1 sub to xopa! 
[1:22:09] JarnoVH: bamPog the_guy1604 just gifted a sub to xopa!
[1:22:16] BornNaked2: bamHeart bamHeart bamHeart bamHeart
[1:22:17] ChakonPablo: @JonBams 8$ a month no ads, free double the ads... simple
[1:22:17] jjay4lifebtw: no checkmark = twitter
[1:22:17] That1DudeTom: its like Twitch Turbo
[1:22:20] cdbdbsabzb: I'm just gonna relax and see how it goes.
[1:22:26] thatwentBTE: How's is Bams holding up today chat?
[1:22:30] snake_eyes955: @xopa bamHi bamHi bamHi

[1:22:33] DeePick: MyFitnessPal just made the free experience terrible by removing barcode scanning and I just deleted the app.... it does backfire to do it that way sometimes
[1:22:36] jjay4lifebtw: checkmark = twitter prime LUL
[1:22:46] BurritoMedia: Cheer100 Cheer100  the worry can go away when I see it. right now it is all speculation and all view points can be valid if you think about them from a scammer point of view
[1:22:51] BikePaulie: half ads?! fk that
[1:22:52] xopa: Thanks @the_guy1604 bamHeart
[1:22:52] That1DudeTom: You dont have extra clout for having Twitch Turbo
[1:22:52] ChakonPablo: @JonBams That sucks balls
[1:22:52] tallpaul84: is this the banger ?
[1:22:57] ms_crafty_: i have a friend with a check mark with less than 2k followers
[1:22:58] DaveGuy_: xopa Gladge
[1:23:01] ladyravennhawke: feel better wishes and prayers! <3
[1:23:10] Freato: yall nerds just need to get off the twatter
[1:23:10] rackyjacks: Seems like so basically Elon ruined twitter for profit
[1:23:11] The_Hessian_: there was a time when there was ZERO chance I'm paying for Twitch Turbo... now you can pry it from my cold ded hands.... I stopped using Twitter, but never say never
[1:23:16] ytbtank: IS THE 1 XTRA HOUR WHEN U FEEL BETTER JON???
[1:23:17] snake_eyes955: @jonbams do you think there will be paid tiers? like $20 for max tier and 8 for min
[1:23:19] tallpaul84: has jon got his tin hat on
[1:23:26] Denbrew: You know how I get away from ads on twitter fucking tweetdeck
[1:23:29] MalsDepot: If you don't like it. Don't buy it. If you don't like it after.... then don't use it. It is kinda simple.
[1:23:33] DaveGuy_: snake_eyes955 surely in the future
[1:23:35] doodlebop16: Cheer100 Cheer100 making free people's experiences terrible drives people away from twitch too. 8 minutes of ads every few minutes. you were one of the my first experiences with twitch and 1 minute of ads an hour is bare-able. if my first experience was 8 minutes of ads I would've noped out of the site
[1:23:46] gr4ndmux: burrito thanks for the ideas tho man, but very much should wait for the actual changes to launch
[1:24:04] gr4ndmux: dont forget the bits thing they did to us, are we going to keep bits this way forever ?
[1:24:04] GADORCHA: bare able sounds like me
[1:24:07] CahntDracula: Chat we have established already if you disagree with Elon you are woke... we are is a binary stream..
[1:24:08] snake_eyes955: twitter $100 tier: twitter tweets for you
[1:24:11] The_Hessian_: careful @MalsDepot people _need_ to be mad - don't inject too much logic
[1:24:13] tanmansam69: Hope you are feeling better Bams!
[1:24:17] jmaybe656: bruh.. 6 in a row 8 in a Rowww fuckin hell its unbearable
[1:24:26] DaveGuy_: ok we are making way too much sense in here someone drop some LLLLs or something
[1:24:30] tallpaul84: i think some of the ads on twitch are pretty good LUL
[1:24:32] xBuckeyex: Is fatty still sick?
[1:24:34] jmaybe656: wolfMikey
[1:24:38] Grouchy_Hermit: i pay 8 a month to avoid ads. so worth it
[1:24:46] xBuckeyex: Elon is dropping the ball big time
[1:24:54] Color0finfinity: The bots will probably pay for it bc they make enough money to do it
[1:24:56] TheNumbersMan47: free speech... never heard of it
[1:24:58] BornNaked2: LUL
[1:24:59] Rodimus_Supreme: @rackyjacks "RuInEd TwItEr" is something only poitically-crazed "AcTiViStS" say because they know they're gonna lose that. Twitter is a shithole that needs to be turned upside down to be fixed.
[1:25:05] jmaybe656: your poor ears
[1:25:06] RollyPinder: Sorry about your turn for the worse Bams, we will never forget you man
[1:25:06] ktorn_: he's upgrading the clout tag, and you can pay for the old one for $8 a month
[1:25:07] Denbrew: Wait we are supposed to read all of the tweets bams
[1:25:10] BornNaked2: You are delirious, you are making sence Kappa
[1:25:14] DeePick: yeah i pay my $10 for turbo but i'm on twitch way more than twitter - can't see putting coin into twitter
[1:25:20] thebigdogjay: I hope you would still be able to see my half sarcastics tweets :)
[1:25:22] jmaybe656: question would you say she's talented or popular
[1:25:22] The_Hessian_: twitter-bots is just the first step in the grey goo
[1:25:26] gr4ndmux: free speech never once ever included the internet nor should it
[1:25:28] BurritoMedia: Cheer100 Cheer100  Show me the different badges is what i'm saying until I see they are different he is just blowing smoke. keep in mind I care less about virtue signaling I take Every ones messages with scepticism. All that being said can we see the froglight farm for a while
[1:25:34] krittermeister: What does the wool count look like?
[1:25:37] rackyjacks: @rodimus_supreme I just don‚Äôt want ads like crazy, you took that to a weird place
[1:25:48] DBKynd: bro. lol
[1:25:49] beamer222: How is Bams feeling
[1:25:57] xBuckeyex: Elaboration: he's going back to the existing "civics board" who are the same people that turned Twitter into the echo chamber it is today.
[1:25:59] Hat_chling: Never thought I would see the day. JonBams being resonable. lol I love it, hope you feel better soon! Cheer200
[1:26:01] erebus56: krittermeister FishMoley
[1:26:02] CahntDracula: You don't need to pay Twitch to remove ads... Just use Streamlink Twitch GUI ...simple
[1:26:08] jmaybe656: I'd say she's just popular tbh
[1:26:20] Denbrew: Kritter how ya doing dude
[1:26:22] DaveGuy_: krittermeister bamHello
[1:26:29] BornNaked2: Meatball bamHug
[1:26:30] TheNumbersMan47: can we afk gold or coal farm? need that more than wool
[1:26:31] Cinossu: Cheer200 Best way is to just wait and see until it goes live. If things go tits up nothing is different, if it makes things better then all the better. / / / / That said where does he say the new $8 tier ones are different from the existing ones? Or that the older ones are getting an upgrade? I missed that one it seems.
[1:26:42] xBuckeyex: If his goal was to make Twitter a platform rooted in free speech he needs to expand the board to achieve equal social representation or eliminate it completely
[1:26:45] erebus56: hypeE TITS hypeE
[1:26:45] CahntDracula: Everything on the internet is free only lazy people pay
[1:26:51] ChakonPablo: @JonBams When you come back have a 100sub goal to turn cam on to monetize properly. When the cam turns on its just the chair, we then have to dono another 100 for you to show up
[1:26:52] DaveGuy_: fuck it ill go back to myspace Gladge
[1:27:05] ayyfro: KEKW

[1:27:15] ArcticXen0: Bread
[1:27:24] jmaybe656: can we do a Poll for a farm to AFK?
[1:27:25] notnogood: @the_guy1604 I never left

[1:27:26] BikePaulie: allegedly
[1:27:27] ayyfro: wait where does it say the new ones are different JonBams ?
[1:27:34] talks_a_lot: I go out in public. Am I a public figure?
[1:27:35] erebus56: that 404 donut looks soooo good
[1:27:38] pg_tips_monkey: hows the sorting room going ?
[1:27:38] krittermeister: Leak your dms
[1:27:43] erebus56: i want a donut now
[1:27:49] thebigdogjay: Jon, maybe you can go through the ice farm once whilst youre ill LUL
[1:27:53] DaveGuy_: Denbrew PogU
[1:27:56] erebus56: krittermeister just wants to see my d pics KEKW
[1:27:56] BurritoMedia: @JonBams I want to know that threshold is to get to be a public figure that is the new clout tag
[1:27:57] rackyjacks: Yea I don‚Äôt give a shit about the checks, I just don‚Äôt want to be flooded with ads until I pay for a check mark
[1:27:57] IronTailFratley: @CahntDracula works if you're on a desktop computer.  otherwise, no
[1:28:03] Denbrew: I‚Äôm eating sour gummy worms

[1:28:04] thatwentBTE: get well soon Bams bamHearts
[1:28:04] ChakonPablo: once healthy have a 100sub goal to turn cam on, then another 100 to show up on cam @JonBams monetize us like daddy elon
[1:28:05] xBuckeyex: @JonBams my two elaborations are above. The $8/month thing is a good bot deterrent and needed.
[1:28:06] sarosa25: @jonbams ok back to Taylor give your review!!!
[1:28:07] jmaybe656: bamHeart bamHearts wolfCrown

[1:28:38] erebus56: minooka b/c so many ppl are on twitter
[1:28:40] talks_a_lot: A better way to phrase it would have been...As is already the case for politicians, other public figures will also get a tag
[1:28:47] BurritoMedia: you hope it is the same threshold @JonBams and yes i am pessimistic
[1:28:47] hansbla666: Politicians deserve an additional third checkmark, called a twat-check LUL
[1:28:49] Hat_chling: Cheer200 How much wool does this thing make per hour?
[1:28:50] jmaybe656: if only
[1:28:58] DeePick: superbowl champleen ddHuh
[1:29:04] Kaladas_: bamCheer100 bamCheer100 In my opinion Elon never planned to charge 20 bucks for just a badge. He let people freak out about it, interacted with people that said things that supported his actual plan, then announced 8 dollars with more benifits. Makes people feel like they are getting what they want.
[1:29:05] Naafan: Kritter is too good to play for the bills.

[1:30:42] Kaladas_: @erebus56 dont fart in the room

[1:32:57] thebigdogjay: @JonBams He's selling twitter as a gucci belt. Most of the  people who buy the gucci belt are the eople with low incomes wanting to seem rich. People will be wanting to buy the bluecheck mark to seem something theyre not. OhMyDog

[1:33:06] gman304855: @jonbams ayyyyeee I see you used one of my suggestions (loot drop) for sub alert
[1:33:07] ZeroLevels: I don't understand how it's a "lords and peasants" system. Like, the checkmark is just meant to differentiate the genuine accounts of already-massive public attention from anyone trying to impersonate them for monetary/clout gain.
