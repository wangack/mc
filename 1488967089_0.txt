[0:45:47] PearishPlays: im still over here grinding yoho for my dailies :(
[0:45:57] celadriel23: i like the deskaluda fight
[0:46:00] Blasian__: deskaluda is great valtan practice. the amount of bard counters I got last night on valtan was insane
[0:46:06] celadriel23: if you dont counter when he does that flight thing he moves areas
[0:46:10] jambagei: is it worth joining a guild?
[0:46:16] celadriel23: yes
[0:46:29] h00k__: Morning!
[0:46:32] Neonnimbus: @Blasian__ you still run buckshot for counter or just prelude? I feel prelude windup is too long for me
[0:46:37] Mandorake: @Giantwaffle I spent 10k gold on the casual wear and glad i did.
[0:46:58] Blasian__: just prelude. but you can drop soundholic for buckshot
[0:47:53] Coulby: when its blue Kappa
[0:48:04] Neonnimbus: Yeah, if there's no stagger checks than buckshot would be better but soundholic gives some dmg at least
[0:48:59] Warkless: Valtan teaches how to counter NODDERS
[0:49:48] warmwalrus: hitting his counters is so satisfying
[0:50:13] warmwalrus: most of counters are telegraphed too
[0:50:32] ayaya_prime: Legendary wealth rune
[0:50:35] Nnnxia: legendary galewind?
[0:50:36] ayaya_prime: galewind
[0:50:36] Coulby: galewind
[0:50:37] Neonnimbus: back attack classes figuring out how to counter and then go around the back
[0:50:47] Nexhunter: and i need that galewind now
[0:51:03] SlyPoooper: people dont counter in mm
[0:51:10] intersectt: you watching FP2 in 50 minutes?
[0:51:13] itzSimondr98: Just did Valtan with randoms PogChamp
[0:51:18] Coulby: SlyPoooper COGGERS hi peepoPooPoo / how did valtan go?
[0:51:18] Venxuri: not getting galewind on first try pepeLaugh
[0:51:19] warmwalrus: a lot of counters are telegraphed so even back attack classes have time to counter
[0:51:33] SlyPoooper: peepoPooPoo / we stopped cause we lost supports
[0:51:34] AceBlizzardz: I already have my 4x3 +1 ready for valtan
[0:51:36] itzSimondr98: 8 hours grinding NODDERS
[0:51:37] Mandorake: I'm pretty sure my Gunlancer coutner can travel all the way through Desks body
[0:51:44] Coulby: SlyPoooper o rip Sadge

[0:55:31] warmwalrus: yea, hm valtan will be a struggle for supports for a while
[0:55:44] Coulby: as a support feels shitty to take money from people so i join them BaTu016
[0:56:08] BaTu016: widepeepelaugh
[0:56:17] Coulby: but maybe thats just me monkaHmm
[0:56:27] BaTu016: yea its awful tbh
[0:56:31] TigersLionsBears: its surprising how eaasy this guardian is compared to the past 3
[0:56:50] Coulby: @BaTu016 ye
[0:57:10] Nostalgic_am: This guardian is so comfy. I love it almost as much as yoho
[0:57:11] Coulby: because first guardian is usually the easiest from a "tier" TigersLionsBears so it makes sense
[0:57:27] TigersLionsBears: I actually hate yoho.
[0:57:39] TigersLionsBears: the mechs where she throws out tornados are resident sleeper
[0:57:48] TigersLionsBears: I hate bosses that have mechanics where they want you to slow dps
[0:58:09] TigersLionsBears: That makes that artficially take longer because of a sleeper mech
[0:58:21] Dagmoo: Dagmoo subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 50 months! waffleHeart
[0:58:26] Coulby: COPIUM
[0:58:36] sam1390: I think maelstrom stacks are independent from the other skills, so you get double stacks, one from mael and one from other skill
[0:58:37] ninopanda: https://imgur.com/kXgS8Wf my outfit is better @Giantwaffle
[0:58:52] Coulby: you get buff at this boss
[0:59:04] Nostalgic_am: I think thats the buff you get from breaking the birds armor @Giantwaffle
[0:59:05] TheResinger: weapons ironically arent the biggest dps buff
[0:59:05] caveat_empt0r_: it is friday
[0:59:08] F0xyTheFox: is mc planned for today? monkaHmm
[0:59:13] Nexhunter: the boss gives a random crit and random healing buff
[0:59:20] Nexhunter: whenever you do things of sorts
[0:59:22] itzSimondr98: Man valtan was hard widePepeLaugh
[0:59:25] Nexhunter: oh that a nice bug KEKW
[0:59:27] sogerr: when you break this boss tail it gives a big buff after 30s(i think) if you dont get hit
[0:59:34] Apparentthreat: ninopanda what's with her one eye?
[0:59:41] Triz08: ive had that happen twice yesterday
[0:59:42] celadriel23: switch chars
[0:59:44] TheResinger: just swap characters
[0:59:44] Coulby: widePepeLaugh
[0:59:45] Nostalgic_am: Nice rock KEKW
[0:59:45] celadriel23: and it fixes it
[0:59:47] Miskav: @Giantwaffle Change zones
[0:59:48] Neonnimbus: switch chars fix it
[0:59:48] sam1390: just switch char
[0:59:49] SolarQuak3: just reload area or zone
[0:59:53] Biuntx: @Giantwaffle its a bug
[0:59:54] Nnnxia: go to stronghold
[0:59:55] Itchyy_: How does that bug even happen?
[0:59:57] sindraxx: just go to char select
[0:59:59] Biuntx: u can switch maps
[1:00:00] sindraxx: had it yesterday
[1:00:02] Blasian__: imagine that bug but with your 800 stack of GHLs lol i was nervous as hell
[1:00:20] Proxzyn: devCheck still talking about it
[1:00:57] warmwalrus: im so happy you can buy the skins for gold like wtf
[1:00:57] Moobot: You can sub to Waffle by clicking this neat link -> twitch.tv/giantwaffle/subscribe

[1:01:06] sam1390: @2lunah hahaha
[1:01:13] daemonaedryn: yo waffle have you considered trying V Rising? Ive seen a lot of people playing it lately
[1:01:30] Nostalgic_am: I got Legendary Gale rune last night on my first run PogChamp
[1:01:32] Apparentthreat: DaemonSzyman is this sarcasm?
[1:01:35] itzSimondr98: Time stop is a must for Valtan btw NODDERS
[1:01:43] Blasian__: you should cut a preemptive for chaos. it gives so much qol just to one tap everything even elites
[1:01:43] Nexhunter: @itzSimondr98 actually not KEKW
[1:01:50] TigersLionsBears: yea infinite chaos dungeons forever
[1:01:54] daemonaedryn: @Apparentthreat wait what monkaHmm
[1:01:56] itzSimondr98: Nexhunter good luck without it widePepeLaugh
[1:01:58] TigersLionsBears: Its disgusting man.
[1:02:02] Proxzyn: wtf
[1:02:04] warmwalrus: lol
[1:02:08] Nexhunter: @itzSimondr98 we got to line 38 on hard mode without them NODDERS
[1:02:09] TheResinger: thats not bots that are flooding the relics
[1:02:14] Apparentthreat: DaemonSzyman oh. I think he's mentioned it at least. don't know what his sentiment towards it though waffleD
[1:02:16] TheResinger: the infinite chaos dungeon items are called corrupted
[1:02:17] TigersLionsBears: KR doesn't have that same issue.
[1:02:18] Neonnimbus: that means the bots have to be 1415. It's not bots but prob people at 1415+ botting
[1:02:20] Nexhunter: cause T3 needs income source to lower costs NODDERS
[1:02:25] sindraxx: nothing like that in euw
[1:02:27] daemonaedryn: @Apparentthreat Oh I wasnt aware I just got here LUL
[1:02:27] itzSimondr98: Nexhunter u start needed them after that pepeLaugh
[1:02:31] TheResinger: and there was only like 300 pages out of the 2000 pages
[1:02:34] Sanistic: seems like an easy solution idd, just make the infinite chaos dungeon items bound
[1:02:35] warmwalrus: bc korea didn't have a botting problem really
[1:02:42] Nexhunter: @itzSimondr98 sodaMad stop getting hit
[1:02:47] BaTu016: i did back in t2
[1:02:50] Apparentthreat: DaemonSzyman not today but in the past, when it became popular.
[1:02:52] BaTu016: not anymore KEKW
[1:02:54] TheResinger: bots werent really contributing to the relic amount on the market lol
[1:02:55] sam1390: @Neonnimbus there are definitely bots 1415+
[1:02:56] Splitte92: @Giantwaffle i think it was proved to be faalse. Relics from chaos have the prefix chaotic in the name. Only 600 pages out of the 5k had that
[1:02:58] itzSimondr98: Nexhunter have fun dodging the swing hammer widePepeLaugh
[1:03:02] Dagmoo: @warmwalrus yeah thats the real reason
[1:03:04] Nexhunter: @itzSimondr98 just get good Kappa
[1:03:14] itzSimondr98: Nexhunter I just did it tho NODDERS
[1:03:14] Nnnxia: but most of the 5000pages is crap
[1:03:20] daemonaedryn: @Apparentthreat Ah I thought it just released cause suddenly saw like 6 big streamers playing it on the same day
[1:03:41] Nexhunter: @itzSimondr98 yea get good Kappa

[1:04:51] Proxzyn: RNG is always 50/50. either you get it, or you dont pepeLaugh
[1:04:51] Nostalgic_am: To be fair 30% is really low
[1:04:52] Sanistic: rip void strike
[1:04:54] Iiiiiiiii9999: rip lv4
[1:04:55] Neonnimbus: Wrong Skill KEKW
[1:04:59] BaTu016: rip KEKW
[1:05:00] sindraxx: i mean with 30% you can do even 20 tries with nothing

[1:05:11] eefe: wrong skill KEKW

[1:08:37] Proxzyn: monkaS h-h-h-hones... ?

[2:22:25] WellBrained: @Nexhunter could get permit shortly for an engraving site?
[2:22:44] Yurekah: aint it better to go most expensive as legendary as you can use those on alts, alot of cheap ones are not good allrounder for all classes
[2:22:49] d_b_a_k: This is too much
[2:23:10] itzSimondr98: Grudge, cursed doll etc.. is better as book NODDERS
[2:23:12] Scotty_1977: I just came into the stream and I am so confused, LOL.
[2:23:30] Argentwingss: can you buy 10/10 stones?

[2:23:58] freshlife: bruh
[2:23:59] DeadlyBrother: better
[2:23:59] sam1390: thank you
[2:24:00] BadLa: thats just 200 attempts YEP
[2:24:03] BilusTheTiny: ty
[2:24:14] akdk29142: 97 is 0.12%
[2:24:16] freshlife: bruh ..
[2:24:18] hebelek2: theres a chance of 10-10-0 stone too
[2:24:35] akdk29142: 97 or higher
[2:24:46] freshlife: "difficult" LUL
[2:24:56] Nexhunter: movement speed reduction uhnSuffer
[2:24:59] chikushoubaka: What would be the estimated price on a 10/10/0 if it were tradeable? ^^
[2:25:13] Dagmoo: billions of gold
[2:25:22] freshlife: What if I roll it
[2:25:23] theRealDuku: can relic accessories ever be 4/4?
[2:25:34] DeadlyBrother: 10 9 is best i think
[2:25:35] freshlife: what happens if I roll 10 10 0
[2:25:38] SolarQuak3: give it 10 years we'll see one
[2:25:42] F0xyTheFox: @freshlife u win
[2:25:54] Villanta11: Isn't a 10/10 kinda useless compared to 9/7 as you cant get an extra +5 from it?
[2:25:55] freshlife: No what happens...
[2:25:59] xIGBClutchIx: Is it even possible to roll it? Like I know the numbers say but possibly in the code there is a limit?
[2:26:13] 89Puppies: Also chat if you roll a good relic stone you don't have to worry about ancient stones, apparently you just transfer your rolls
[2:26:16] Mandorake: I got a grudge/combarreadiness 3/5 acc and very happy about it
[2:26:16] freshlife: Lets says one of us roll a 10 10 0, what happens then?
[2:26:16] Blasian__: @Villanta11 any more pips above 9/7 is cheaper accs. so not useless
[2:26:30] Blasian__: can get higher quality for cheaper if you can go 4/3 or something
[2:26:42] SolarQuak3: kind of like the odds of us existing in the universe
[2:26:43] F0xyTheFox: @freshlife u sell it and never need to worry about money
[2:26:45] Villanta11: @Blasian__ if we just ignore the cost of getting a 10/10 lol
[2:26:46] theRealDuku: what about using a t2 relic stone
[2:26:46] victish0nor: @Giantwaffle took after u and went for a ambush/adrenaline stone, got 8/6 first try :)
[2:26:48] xIGBClutchIx: If you roll 10 10 then got to lottery right away
[2:26:51] freshlife: @F0xyTheFox irl?
[2:26:57] Blasian__: @Villanta11 just one shot it EZ
[2:27:06] akdk29142: 10 10 is much lower probability than most lottery
[2:27:12] Dagmoo: i would hope if you rolled a 10/10/0 stone Smile Gate would give you lifetime aura/sub LUL
[2:27:13] Larklen: @xIGBClutchIx if you roll a 10/10 its too late to do lottery, used up your luck already KEKW
[2:27:36] Auradus: is it even worth getting 5x3 when im already 4x3
[2:27:37] Nexhunter: 9/7/2 wtf @dookiegookiejookiexookie
[2:27:44] freshlife: bruh imagine not knowing about this stuff and listen to this giant waffle spew numbers non stop
[2:27:45] victish0nor: MONKERS
[2:27:52] Blasian__: I would use a 10x3 lol
[2:27:53] xIGBClutchIx: @Larklen Peaked hit everything is downhill from there
[2:28:03] Villanta11: Wouldnt 10/10/0 be easier to get than 10/10/10 lol
[2:28:09] Mekto89: 10/10/0? how about 0/0/0 Kappa
[2:28:20] freshlife: no guys
[2:28:23] chikushoubaka: You can win euromillions, 200 million, invest all in stones and not come close to get a stone like that lol
[2:28:56] Dagmoo: oh from reddit that dude who 9/7/2 on his first relic stone?  LUL
[2:28:56] F0xyTheFox: @freshlife I don't think selling ingame items for real money is legal in LA probably perma ban and i meant ingame money i don't know how much you would get + it would be sketchy as fck trying to sell it
[2:29:11] fatalshizot: you should be able to sell/buy cut stones
[2:29:37] hisdue: magick stream YEP
[2:29:38] Parzzs: 10/7/0 is the best stone in korea
[2:29:38] akdk29142: heavy armor 1 is nice addition
[2:29:49] Nexhunter: 18
[2:29:55] Nexhunter: cause you have 2 select books NODDERS
[2:29:59] Archelonde: Sold my grudge for 16k EZ
[2:30:37] Hazno: Keen Blunt Weapon is generally attractive as well
[2:30:37] Moobot: You can find Waffle's Youtube channel here - https://youtube.com/giantwaffle
[2:30:50] Mekto89: increased mass
[2:30:54] Blasian__: sight focus for surge?
[2:30:57] Mandorake: Hit master
[2:31:00] Neonnimbus: If you plan on doing more than 1 dps class that don't have another common engraving grudge is best
[2:31:11] Hazno: Spirit Absorption
[2:31:11] Parzzs: stabilize status
[2:31:12] Neonnimbus: like if you do gunslinger and sorc hit master leg is great
[2:31:13] hisdue: necromancer pepeLaugh
[2:31:14] Crewe_DK: ambush master?
[2:31:15] AtheonBarcota: Mass Increase is easy to offset with Spirit Absorb
[2:31:20] Coulby: when i redo my engravings im gonna get rid of heavy armor rather get drops of ether since im a paladin
[2:31:23] Crewe_DK: raid captain maybe
[2:31:23] 89Puppies: mass increase is a Glavier engraving
[2:31:25] DeadlyBrother: Spirit absoption, lightning master
[2:31:27] AIex_0: I used sight focus for fun LUL
[2:31:27] Parzzs: stabilize status is a good one
[2:31:28] Dagmoo: sight focus you need the chat spam LUL
[2:31:29] dookiegookiejookiexookie: What most people suggest is +12 class engraving, since +5 class engraving jewlry is ridiculous
[2:31:29] Blasian__: you just make a macro for it
[2:31:31] Y0kaa: Theres Macros for that
[2:31:33] AIex_0: you can use the macro
[2:31:35] Y0kaa: Ingame Macros
[2:31:38] hotdove911: can't you make a macro
[2:31:38] Blasian__: look how much it would pump surge
[2:31:43] itzSimondr98: mass increase is also decent as a pal
[2:31:51] AIex_0: The macro makes sight focus much more viable LUL
[2:31:54] sindraxx: 2 pities in a row... fuck me
[2:32:01] Blasian__: for 73g a book, look how much it does for surge lol
[2:32:11] akdk29142: cursed doll is popular choice for common legendary in kr
[2:32:19] AIex_0: you don't have to type
[2:32:22] TheResinger: just make a macro
[2:32:23] findi24: I think a couple weeks ago, Cursed doll was sub 2k and Grudge was sub 3k on west coast
[2:32:31] Parzzs: just put it on macro
[2:32:32] AIex_0: its just macro LUL
[2:32:35] Yurekah: macro it :p
[2:32:43] Hazno: just make a funny text with it LUL
[2:32:44] Nexhunter: why the fuck is that even a thing
[2:32:45] Nexhunter: KEKW
[2:32:45] dookiegookiejookiexookie: @Giantwaffle you can macro it next patch so that u can tie the macro directly to ur skill use
[2:32:47] Blasian__: 28% on surge i can be that dude
[2:32:47] DeadlyBrother: the new macro makes it auto type when u cast the skill
[2:32:51] AIex_0: its top tier trolling Kappa
[2:32:51] Cpt_Ruby: !!!!!
[2:32:52] Nexhunter: especially if you are legion raid lead
[2:32:56] Neonnimbus: i think best legendary books for multiple classes are hit master, keen blunt, grudge, and awakening
[2:32:57] hotdove911: imagine leader always posting !!!!
[2:32:58] Nexhunter: that gets spammed toa ll KEKW
[2:33:01] Asacai: i always chuckle whenever i see those LUL

[2:33:13] Darreus: surge is identity, not awakening
[2:33:17] TheResinger: surge is not awakening
[2:33:20] theRealDuku: awakening is V skill
[2:33:25] Hazno: yeah, identity not awakening
[2:33:30] Mekto89: yea awakening is V
[2:33:32] Blasian__: your v skill is that iframe thing

[3:19:14] Moobot: You can find Waffle's Youtube channel here - https://youtube.com/giantwaffle
[3:19:56] Monty0x: To put a grid upstairs you will need to either run a cable, or use a transmitter and reciever to transmit your network to another location.
[3:19:58] johnshepherd104: Im having Curry Cauliflower with a Salmon Fillet
[3:20:00] Mr__Kovacs: it's definitely for enthusiasts
[3:20:02] sytar023: theres a difference between hard and tedious, this is leaning towards tedious
[3:20:04] TheBigBIFF_: is it like dungeons dragons and space shuttles?
[3:20:05] BMYGRLFRND: I'd say more than extremely hard it's extremely convuluted

[3:24:30] GalacticDrew: unless you have inside knowledge *cough* *cough* Congress
[3:24:45] Mr__Kovacs: etherium? you mine it
[3:24:46] Pashoopati: Long-term shorting is betting against company and leadership. Short-term shorting is more betting against the market and sentiment.
[3:24:47] ballz7777777: @Ethosbender what if you're just getting out of a position?

[3:25:57] jmm548: over the shoulder bolder holder ?
[3:26:05] Allmostdone: you need a bra? Wha?
[3:26:14] Exorcimus: Shorting is a way to make money when the market goes down
[3:26:40] johnshepherd104: Great analogy
[3:26:44] Face_32: they have that in sports betting too
[3:26:56] johnshepherd104: Oh I see
[3:26:58] johnshepherd104: Thats deep
[3:27:05] ballz7777777: more like bigger risk with lower reward.. it can only goto 0 .. max 100%
[3:27:08] FoomDog: The unethical part, is not having to close shorts, if a stock/company tanks. A.k.a why we see BB having beautiful gains even now-a-days

[3:31:15] GalacticDrew: NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[3:31:18] Sup4545: Currently worth it only because their cars still have full features. almost every other car brand on the market had to stop having newer features due to lack of microprocessors.
[3:31:23] johnshepherd104: Imagine being leveraged on a second morgage and the stocks crashed
[3:31:27] simplystream: what is 401k?
[3:31:32] ajman225: Ya my parents wanted to retire this year rip
[3:31:35] Monty0x: "Range Upgrade" can be added
[3:31:35] DigitalVortex92: OMEGALUL
[3:31:39] Chronoes: it will only be temporary, wealthy will just buy more and when the stocks go up as it usually will, the gap increases even further
[3:31:44] DigitalVortex92: @ballz7777777 That's a very uneducated view
[3:31:50] ObsceneSanity: passive stock trading for retirement simplystream
[3:31:55] ballz7777777: your 401k should be rolled out of a 30% move when you retire
[3:32:06] Larklen: 🤨
[3:32:16] P05erThe: rich people cant go through a period of red numbers much more easily than poor people so the divide will be even bigger as a result
[3:32:20] P05erThe: *can
[3:32:22] ballz7777777: well the Fed is saying raise interest rates to lower equities. which reduces the wealth gap, which isn't a terrible thing
[3:32:40] ballz7777777: yes your 401k lost 30%. but it shouldve been rolled out if you're retiring
[3:32:50] Larklen: wtf you goin on about lmao

[3:41:08] daemonaedryn: I swear it was way bigger? Might have been the modpack I was playing though
[3:41:32] maccabeus: @maccabeus no? are they scaling upgrades or did they just disable stacking in this pack?
[3:41:39] F0xyTheFox: @DaemonSzyman i will check it

[3:47:46] Face_32: it is OP yes but i dont think its so OP it makes the pack easy. some of the stuff you have to send out later is like 100s of 1 item that takes a long time to craft each single item
[3:48:11] Acarea: some modpacks get exponentially more complex so its required to progress
[3:48:34] trebor_yeet: qustion is this a solo smp
[3:48:41] trebor_yeet: or singleplayer
