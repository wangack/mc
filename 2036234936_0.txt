[1:28:55] shanesunil: Calcite?
[1:29:13] OrionsFoot13: bone blocks would look good for the pillar part.
[1:29:25] poisso3: Yes! I discovered this look by accident.
[1:29:42] uloncl: i feel like u need to think about when the thing ur building would have been built, a newer temple should have more darker/tan colours
[1:29:46] OrionsFoot13: looks like marble.
[1:29:48] BrokenPhysics13: @BlastJordan563 hello to you as well! i'm doing fine, just been lurking, since i just woke up an hour ago! pixlriHype pixlriGood
[1:30:04] OrionsFoot13: try bone blocks?
[1:30:05] Vinka90: in comparison it resembles the pillars in the background with the shadow
[1:30:18] shanesunil: someone mentioned bone blocks, so maybe try that
[1:30:24] BlastJordan563: @BrokenPhysics13 Great to hear, as always! DinoDance joelduLove
[1:30:26] Toboshi: Could you surround it with iron trapdoors to give it a bit of a base without adding much bulk?
[1:30:32] BlastJordan563: @Vinka90 Hello! joelduLove DinoDance
[1:30:36] hazy_knight: hii
[1:30:37] Vinka90: bone blocks are quite yellowish
[1:30:40] GingerTheLily: @hazy_knight Hello and welcome in!
[1:30:45] Vinka90: @BlastJordan563 hey Jordan!
[1:31:19] hazy_knight: @GingerTheLily thnx!

[1:32:20] the_jon_b: what does white terracotta look like with quartz?
[1:32:20] Toboshi: Yeah, they do look a bit out of place.
[1:32:35] BertPotato: and birch has too much detail, but it's the next lightest trapdoor right?

[1:33:48] BrokenPhysics13: @the_jon_b if it's white terracotta, it looks even more pink next to quartz
[1:33:52] jarjarbinks96: We need vertical half slabs added!
[1:34:08] swordmiko: I like that
[1:34:12] BrokenPhysics13: @BrokenPhysics13 more pink than it already does
[1:34:38] shanesunil: Also the absolute pain it will be while placing hem in survival
[1:34:38] the_jon_b: oh yeah, it is a pinkish color, isn't it....i was remembering the hue wrong
[1:34:45] poisso3: too chunky
[1:34:51] GingerTheLily: snow blockd look white, but make the quartz look coloured
[1:35:01] johnnynicely: try upside down stairs on the face and full blocks on the corners
[1:35:03] OrionsFoot13: bigger gives you more options.
[1:35:06] swordmiko: slabs
[1:35:17] poisso3: @GingerTheLily It's interesting the shades of white the game has
[1:35:34] GingerTheLily: @poisso3 there are a surprising number of them
[1:35:53] shanesunil: brick and cracked brick as well
[1:35:55] GingerTheLily: then there is white concrete wihich is different again
[1:36:06] BertPotato: chiseled maybe?

[1:38:22] BlastJordan563: @Dan_Grice85 Hi Dan! Hope you are well! joelduLove
[1:38:27] OrionsFoot13: same problem with the texture direction.
[1:38:30] ErnestoJR20: Hello
[1:38:41] GingerTheLily: granite would be reallu busy!
[1:38:45] shanesunil: Also no need for silk touch to get andesite in survival, so it is a bit easier to collect
[1:38:47] GingerTheLily: @ErnestoJR20 Hi!
[1:38:51] TheN00K1E: dead coral?
[1:38:59] CoraxChimera: mushroom stem?

[1:39:16] daredevil2300: acasia?
[1:39:19] LadyHespeth: tuff?
[1:39:25] e_sonofander: And the other problem is the vertical bit of deep slate is only on one side
[1:39:32] shanesunil: Acacia logs maybe?
[1:39:55] swordmiko: it kind of cool looking
[1:39:57] shanesunil: nah too dark
[1:40:00] OrionsFoot13: @shanesunil was just about to suggest that.
[1:40:28] swordmiko: bambo
[1:40:28] begaydocrime2: I never thought to use dead coral as wallpaper, I might have to try that sometime
[1:40:31] vikingmama901: Random off topic question: can you bone me a living coral to get more coral? The nearest warm ocean from me is thousands of blocks away
[1:41:04] e_sonofander: Coral is non-renewable in vanilla (outside of wandering trader trades)
[1:41:06] GingerTheLily: only coral fans if I remember correctly - blocks have to be harvest from a reef
[1:41:07] CoraxChimera: does concrete have stairs?
[1:41:11] DarthMario64: there's not much that beats quartz on looking intentionally carved vertically
[1:41:12] CoraxChimera: or is that too texture-less?
[1:41:15] the_jon_b: I think you basically have to just destroy the coral reef to get the blocks unfortunately
[1:41:22] GingerTheLily: @CoraxChimera no!
[1:41:27] CoraxChimera: ugh
[1:41:28] PhilHallBio: polished andesite stairs?

[1:41:52] GingerTheLily: basalt colums?
[1:41:53] the_jon_b: I chose a coral reef that's like 20k blocks away from my base for that reason. Didn't want to destroy the one that's closer to me.
[1:41:53] BrokenPhysics13: yeah, coral blocks are non-renewable outside wandering trader. only coral fans can be farmed

[1:43:00] mad_blue_duck: are Tuff stairs coming in the next patch?
[1:43:00] shanesunil: What are these words?? The only one I know of is Column haha
[1:43:07] TheN00K1E: I had to stop myself from throwing away tuff now :D
[1:43:17] TheN00K1E: because of the things that will come
[1:43:25] GingerTheLily: I have been collecting tuff for the last 6 months
[1:43:38] TheN00K1E: I also neet to xD
[1:43:43] poisso3: I have been building in my survival world with the new Tuff blocks in mind. As soon as they are in the game, I will replace the existing blocks with the new uses of Tuff
[1:43:44] shanesunil: ooh neat!

[1:45:55] vikingmama901: @rookinde He's the best there is!
[1:45:57] doxisontwitchnow: @e_sonofander I mean, is it though, looking at the amount squeezed in moving up just one block of square footage, I wonder if it is as much as we think
[1:46:05] GingerTheLily: Oooh thats like a manor house I build last season!
[1:46:18] LadyHespeth: it even has cherry trees!
[1:46:20] poisso3: Yes it is
[1:46:25] TheWormbo: I made one of those for a previous base entrance
[1:46:46] TheWormbo: it was huge
[1:46:47] DarthMario64: there are fire pits on the roof,. but no access; lol
[1:47:00] Techdawg77: totally awesome. happens a lot in southern US plantations
[1:47:11] doxisontwitchnow: @vikingmama901 That was iconic.
[1:47:15] Vinka90: it skipped leg day
[1:47:18] e_sonofander: @doxisontwitchnow depends on just how much of the detail you're looking to include

[1:48:25] e_sonofander: I've done this exact exercise in a creative flat world looking at column designs, lol
[1:48:28] doxisontwitchnow: @e_sonofander true. I'm just fascinated by how much difference in proportion a single block made
