[1:10:11] BazHicks: you'd have to win the 50million lottery 1200 times to buy Blizzard KEKW
[1:10:12] FallenSmp_: No chance anti trust will kick in
[1:10:13] MiesterTee: They have better taste
[1:10:14] MiesterTee: :)
[1:10:16] aeadon: can't afford it anymore
[1:10:21] FallenSmp_: its all political right now and no way anti trust will kick in

[1:10:34] Joshuapetch: leamnjSip
[1:10:35] Nexhunter: they will still only be the third largest publisher @Giantwaffle
[1:10:35] Archelonde: There should be no issues with antitrust with this

[1:10:36] NephilimXS: They've been gunning for Konami too
[1:10:39] Arctic_S: the World Chico

[1:10:48] Apparentthreat: Joshuapetch farming sim already on game pass at least for previous versions
[1:10:56] Apparentthreat: it's like 1 v behind
[1:10:58] Krecik58: GiantWaffle Software when ModCheck
[1:10:58] Joshuapetch: @apparentthreat very true
[1:10:59] KABBL: games are not critical goods, should go through
[1:11:00] RehnMan48: They are still smaller than Sony Gaming, so I dont think anti trust will be a problem
[1:11:00] Nexhunter: Bobby is staying on per Spencer for a while
[1:11:02] MiesterTee: Agreed
[1:11:06] Taw_: They need to cycle the entire admin staff
[1:11:08] Sirgevz: yeaaaa....
[1:11:10] Archelonde: kotick is staying till the merger is complete but he for sure will leave after
[1:11:11] TinaCarlysle: @Archelonde no at this point it'll be game monopoly issue, recently aquiring bethesda now this will raise concern they are trying to gobble up slowly
[1:11:12] Apparentthreat: Joshuapetch though it's the xbox version and not great lmao
[1:11:12] Nexhunter: but Spencer will probably clean house once the integration is done
[1:11:16] OrangeW2: jeff kaplan 😭
[1:11:17] Archelonde: hes notone to be under someone else
[1:11:19] ymelus: didnt alot of them join that new studio that was created by the old ceo?
[1:11:20] NephilimXS: Bobby's contract is good until march of 2023
[1:11:21] Apparentthreat: Joshuapetch so no 3rd party mods
[1:11:24] ModestGlottis: maybe Ms will make WOW2 happen
[1:11:31] Joshuapetch: @apparentthreat leamnjFine
[1:11:36] ryanforresterdev: I own Microsoft :)
[1:11:36] iSketchy: how long till Captain Price shows up in halo infinite now that Microsoft has Activision LULW
[1:11:37] wsd7: thats true with most studios, BIoware, DICE etc Sadge
[1:11:37] Myndracat: I don't know why money even matters to most people. It can't make you happy!
[1:11:44] HKRage: Cant wait for WOW x Halo crossovers
[1:11:48] Apparentthreat: mainly upper level management
[1:11:49] Nexhunter: tbh Microsoft probably just wants King cause candy crush is the money maker
[1:11:50] Nexhunter: KEKW
[1:11:52] HumanAres: do you think they could break wow from blizzard due to microsoft would then own 2 mmos or what do you think would happen
[1:11:56] BiJay0: from the bottom or the top?
[1:11:57] Apparentthreat: don't need new talent unless they're the problem
[1:12:02] Nexhunter: devs have issues also
[1:12:06] StardustDragon08: Maybe MS will kill Blizzard like most of the companies they buy KEKW
[1:12:06] carmeret: might be faster to kill the blizzard
[1:12:10] Apparentthreat: get rid of devs then pepeLaugh
[1:12:15] carmeret: name blizzard*
[1:12:16] Baenjamin: @Myndracat it cost money to make twitch and probably a lot of things you use, doesn't any of that make you happy?
[1:12:17] Sweezenator: @HumanAres what is the other one?
[1:12:19] wsd7: NFTs BatChest
[1:12:19] Myekos: devs do as told
[1:12:21] Nexhunter: @StardustDragon08 nokia pepeLaugh
[1:12:28] HumanAres: @Sweezenator eso
[1:12:29] Taw_: The issue is that management wasn't dealing with the individuals. By replacing management, people can bring individual complaints properly.
[1:12:29] ForgottenTime: Blizz made the culling of srathlome now it’s time for the culling of blizzard KEKW
[1:12:30] Karnaxx: This is Microsoft we're talking about here. It's all about investors
[1:12:34] HKRage: Microsoft is probably the best company to rebuild Blizzard, they went through their own rebuild when transitioning from Balmer to Nadella
[1:12:35] Kuroiorb: there's an overwatch 2??
[1:12:36] akiiboi: overwatch 2 LUL
[1:12:37] Taw_: That wasn't happening before because management was ignoring them
[1:12:44] Nexhunter: @Karnaxx the xbox division is more isolated from that feeling
[1:12:44] breakingn8: Call of Duty might get revived if Microsoft pulls them away from their tiresome yearly release cycle.
[1:12:54] seatea07: Crazy to think that COD and Halo are now owned by the same company
[1:12:57] BIFF72OL: microsoft better give treyarch some good budget for zombies
[1:13:05] aeadon: it's profitable to make good games, not mutually exclusive
[1:13:08] PuggoThuggo: surprise surprise gamers dont want to play games made for investors
[1:13:08] BiJay0: disney of gaming KEKW
[1:13:09] Karnaxx: NODDERS
[1:13:12] VaultPls: @Giantwaffle that feel when microsoft has a better mmo than amazon with the swipe of their credit card KEKW

[1:13:48] seatea07: Will all blizzard games be on game pass now
[1:13:49] Apparentthreat: imagine an individual having that much buying power w/ credit
[1:13:51] Nexhunter: actually true @aed
[1:13:57] musicmad1278: Do you know who Elon Musk banks with?
[1:13:59] TinaCarlysle: how much you get King makes more money than blizard right now :D
[1:14:00] OrangeW2: @saaine They want to move Diablo and Overwatch to game pass, apparently
[1:14:05] Fufcia: Minecraft Dungeon x Diablo collab KEKW
[1:14:06] Apparentthreat: some credit cards have "no limit" but I bet there's a limit
[1:14:06] OrangeW2: more to come, perhaps

[1:14:32] aeadon: Diablo: Zune
[1:14:34] AIex_0: they had phones
[1:14:35] trashbaguette_: it's a bad thing for the industry as a whole. Less competition. Good thing for blizzard fans though

[1:14:36] Nexhunter: KEKW
[1:14:38] OrangeW2: windows phones KEKW
[1:14:39] BBQ1: the skype of video games KEKW
[1:14:41] Archelonde: Phil said they were re-evaluating their relationship with blizzard with the whole fiasco, what he meant was im gonna buy you and clean house LUL
[1:14:41] Mrtoastedjelly: If amazon actually didnt ditch the LOTR mmo, then maybe they would have had a better mmo
[1:14:45] Frankenstain: Get some Bethesda people working on Diablo
[1:14:45] AIex_0: windows phones are already dead KEKW
[1:14:47] ModestGlottis: im never playing another mobile game as long as i live
[1:14:59] KABBL: Orc skype avatars

[1:15:17] Cannonboot: wow wow wow, what d3 wasnt a disaster , it was good at the release and for like couple of years, but when a single person was developing it, then yea it got fked by the raise of other game like PoE
[1:15:19] aeadon: any game is mobile if you're strong enough
[1:15:19] FamousLikeFluSeason: arknights was fun as ngl
[1:15:27] Beufff: It just felt like the last 2-3 yr of blizzard had no direction and they were just spiraling with highly anticipated IPs. Hopefully MSFT c-suite can right the ship.
[1:15:29] VaultPls: so when is amazon buying take two i wonder
[1:15:32] stoner204: @Giantwaffle so do i have to wait to make a league acount then get members or do i put members on a character and i will be able to create a league account?
[1:15:33] Nexhunter: candy crush revenue alone will pay for the deal in 65 ears timmacLAUGH

[3:42:35] Makaheehee: Was this staircase even planned when the statue was built? ...
[3:42:48] robocahp: Wish they would’ve done the statue out of different brick so it wouldn’t blend in to the cliff behind it
[3:42:49] Makaheehee: Maybe whoever built the stairs didnt put forethought into where the knees were. Kappa

[3:43:11] Lapideous: I think lady statue would look better in different blocks. Just something different from the path so you have more contrast.
