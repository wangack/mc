There used to be a very large train bridge there called the Kinzua bridge. It was over 300 feet high. You could hike across it because it was out of commission. There were huge gaps between the boards that hold the train track. Not large enough to fall through, but way large enough to see 300 feet down. I got halfway across. My knees locked up. I pooped.  cheer200

[3:38:19] jerrythomas55: fun fact SNL fired Shane Gillis. looks like he won.

[3:40:33] Harlando: Shane gives a good impression, some say a great impression. I saw it and I said wow, what a great impression.
[3:40:35] Dangerprone22: yeah
[3:40:38] StardustDragon08: Having seen Baldwin's past behavior, zero sympathies from me
[3:40:42] Chonfelito: trigger it manually
[3:40:45] MastrRob: Did they say how long he potentially would go for?
[3:40:47] Ceilnguy: if you point a gun at someone..loaded or not..and kill that person..IT'S YOUR FAULT
[3:41:12] momma_TJ: why did the Prop have a real bullet?
[3:41:13] infxmhc2: The short answer is. If the cops ask you questions and your lawyer isn't there. Shut the phuck up
[3:41:13] netherite_bong: wasnt it an act tho
[3:41:18] RealWickedBrew: NODDERS @Ceilnguy
[3:41:24] OmIAm: It is *ALWAYS* the responsibly of the person with the gun.  Manslaughter at the very least.
[3:41:26] JTSmith44: Gross Negligence
[3:41:29] StardustDragon08: Oof yeah he's screwed
[3:41:29] hardlined: manslaughter
[3:41:29] Ztephenn: oh thats jail
[3:41:29] JTSmith44: Manslaughter
[3:41:32] jerrythomas55: rule number one of gun safety is you trust nobody
[3:41:32] Ceilnguy: if they were filming and it happened..NOT his fault
[3:41:36] slackertron: he is a bag of ass not including the killing of that lady
[3:41:38] I_Am_Panta: Manslaughter
[3:41:39] BenV_: Great summary. Thank you
[3:41:40] dtkSZN: jon i have a project for you: what if you build a giant dripstone and inside of it you just like a hundred of those dripstone farms you’ve made? epic.
[3:41:41] dw33z1l: Probably negligent homicide
[3:41:43] flyingQtip: tinsel town got real
[3:41:45] StardustDragon08: Involuntary Manslaughter. Possible gross negligence
[3:41:47] JTSmith44: Gross Negligence resulting in death is also a charge
[3:41:48] talks_a_lot: I honestly can't believe they went ahead and made that movie. Regardless of your opinion of Baldwin, you couldn't pay me to watch it. Such a tragedy, why should it be memorialized for whatever profit they will get. phucked up. Cheer200
[3:41:54] hardlined: would he have known the diference even if he checked it?
[3:42:01] Ztephenn: did the armorer catch any charges?
[3:42:06] thatwentBTE: How was real ammo even a possibility?
[3:42:07] connor_assassin5: but he’s not an expert. the expert should be held responsible. what if he checked it and had no idea what a real bullet looked like and then the same thing happened. what then?
[3:42:14] Maneo_86: theres a manual trigger for the dripstone farm?
[3:42:15] JTSmith44: Yeah, the movie should have been cancelled 200%
[3:42:16] Ceilnguy: he'll be out in 3 months..
[3:42:18] talks_a_lot: ITS IN PRODUCTION
[3:42:23] OmIAm: Jonbams: Yes.  Baldwin went back to set several months ago.
[3:42:29] busterhwk: the parents of the person who dies wanted it to be released
[3:42:29] StardustDragon08: @connor_assassin5 he still shouldn't have been pointing it at people
[3:42:31] jerrythomas55: do we get the part where he shoots the lady?
[3:42:34] Hambbage: They released The Crow after Brandon Lee
[3:42:54] YourNotScaryy: @JonBams i got arthritis in my one toed foot now
[3:42:55] infxmhc2: BamCheer200 now that Baldwin is going to jail. Think of the street cred he'll have. Rap album incoming?
[3:42:56] JTSmith44: He also got shot, yeah
[3:42:58] connor_assassin5: @stardustdragon08 yes because in movies they never point guns at characters
[3:43:04] Tori2shoes: @jonbams  I saw some dripstone in a box!
[3:43:05] BubbleGuts32: how did real bullets end up in a prop gun?
[3:43:08] JTSmith44: OMEGALUL
[3:43:10] b_r_a_y: they did.. was a really good movie.. that wasn't a real bullet though
[3:43:12] Benhoolio_: LUL @ TTS
[3:43:13] Ceilnguy: @jerrythomas55 they weren't filming..he was fucking around
[3:43:18] jerrythomas55: you ALWAYS check yourself. I don’t care if someone just checked it before you

[3:43:58] StardustDragon08: @connor_assassin5 really dude? Ok. Most of those actors don't have the pretentious ego of Baldwin either.
[3:44:01] edosilthehunter: DRIPSTONE in that chest
[3:44:04] zestytreats: why were there real bullets ANYWHERE on set though?!
[3:44:06] notnogood: dripstone and chests in there
[3:44:08] dw33z1l: Did they say why the gun had real bullets in it?
[3:44:16] edosilthehunter: 28 dripstone in that chest
[3:44:17] Corrum: why did they even have live rounds on set?
[3:44:19] Tori2shoes: There's 28 dripstone in the box
[3:44:25] flyingQtip: it's like a script where the bullets got changed before the take
[3:44:25] momma_TJ: still blows my mind that the prop had real bullets
[3:44:26] notnogood: one of the purps
[3:44:39] WunUP: A stack and 28

[3:46:34] Lekerstein: @connor_assassin5 Hard to tell. That would be a different set of circumstances
[3:46:36] StardustDragon08: @connor_assassin5 if being an actor means he can't figure out to not point a gun at someone if he hasn't checked if it's loaded, he should drop any role that requires him to use a gun. It's not that hard to learn basic gun safety. Guessing his ego prevented him from doing so

[3:53:57] vincesola: Cheer200  Media scoffed at my Embiid tweet, but it's all true. AMC's share price is so frustrating. The 2023 actors/writers strikes have ruined the early 2024 box office. Almost all I think about is rebuilding AMC. But: AMC based in Kansas City since 1920. So, "how 'bout those CHEEEEEFS."
