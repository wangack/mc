[0:09:50] samuelphilips98: You can break them with your fist
[0:09:57] 1SherlockSpock1: Do you have items auto deleting?
[0:10:00] uncivilcivilservice: Oh my bad, I'm the fool
[0:10:07] phillykd11: Is there a hopper or something underneath the block?
[0:10:08] WhatABees: i mean you are crazy but it also should've dropped
[0:10:10] Fletcherpauley6: lauren
[0:10:13] titus_fear: but at the start of stream i thought jardoon said no breaking anything?
[0:10:17] BroCox1: Break another block. Maybe buggy
[0:10:19] raffkaisa: WYHA
[0:10:21] tyranno66: This is off to a great start
[0:10:23] uncivilcivilservice: @BroCox1 In the game itself
[0:10:24] soybean525: drop the pickaxr
[0:10:24] lewkis01: They're special
[0:10:27] Crazy3wok: maybe lag
[0:10:28] PikaPower04: is the gamerule that stops items dropping from broken blocks?
[0:10:29] Fletcherpauley6: u wut m8
[0:10:30] OGPirate_Bob: hmmmmmm
[0:10:32] big_cube: Maybe it's something with the commands?
[0:10:33] Dethstroak: is TileDrops false in the gamerules
[0:10:34] 1SherlockSpock1: hmm
[0:10:35] jessaa121: cptOof
[0:10:35] ingapotejtoo: hm
[0:10:37] engineerlady13: that's not right
[0:10:42] nemanja367_: F3+a maybe
[0:10:43] titus_fear: so was the stream not started with you saying not to break blocks?
[0:10:44] danieljpb2004: Is it just shulkers?
[0:10:46] raffkaisa: jordan join my hermitcraft server it actually works lmao
[0:10:47] remagstreams: hey cap
[0:10:47] padawandom: Probably relog
[0:10:47] Endersouled: doTileDrops
[0:10:53] raffkaisa: thats a joke
[0:10:58] nemanja367_: nope
[0:10:58] Merry_Pippin: Set to true?
[0:11:02] foxinatorz: enter without setting it to see what state its in
[0:11:04] soybean525: no that should be true
[0:11:12] BroCox1: Should be vanilla minecraft.
[0:11:13] RedStoanPhD: game is completely survival, no special game rules required
[0:11:18] soybean525: ???
[0:11:20] Merry_Pippin: HMMM
[0:11:22] TheWyoLP: The heck?
[0:11:22] ingapotejtoo: relog?????
[0:11:24] hennathefinn: oh odd
[0:11:25] nemanja367_: maybe x changed it while preping the wold
[0:11:27] Merry_Pippin: Mine the stone?
[0:11:27] Fletcherpauley6: what the balls
[0:11:27] odd_dragon: Hrmmm
[0:11:28] Crazy3wok: quick someone call Tango
[0:11:29] uncivilcivilservice: cptHuh
[0:11:30] woagopossum: maybe the tick rate command?
[0:11:34] remagstreams: probably not going to watch the stream today, ima watch how it's made lol
[0:11:40] 1SherlockSpock1: What happens if you break a block with the pick?
[0:11:48] Uskall: the sign did say open to lan cptHmm
[0:11:48] foxinatorz: Tile Drops I believe is only for when you break like a block with a torch on it the torch wont drop
[0:11:49] big_cube: Read book?
[0:11:50] Iconicbluejay: i have dinner Happi it's not mozz sticks this time, dw jessaa xD
[0:11:52] ingapotejtoo: oh what the
[0:11:54] lewkis01: Would opening to LAN make a difference?
[0:11:54] Xero_0001: what is this?
[0:11:57] padawandom: What is going on
[0:12:00] soybean525: whuh
[0:12:03] 1SherlockSpock1: I have never seen this
[0:12:08] Fletcherpauley6: CaptainSparkles breaker of games
[0:12:09] nemanja367_: how did he manage to bust minecraft
[0:12:10] Malliaboo: cptHi
[0:12:16] notekatha: I'd believe that they put that rule false to prevent anything from breaking due to random farms but weird
[0:12:21] Crazy3wok: The dungeon master has forbid you from playing
[0:12:21] neutral_nobody: this the universe saying sparklez will never be on hermitcraft
[0:12:21] DialingSpoon527: what version u on?
[0:12:25] odd_dragon: Congrats on the bug Jordan
[0:12:25] ozzywho: captain troubleshooting is back
[0:12:29] Merry_Pippin: Try placing a block and breaking it?
[0:12:30] 1SherlockSpock1: What if its a block you place?
[0:12:30] BroCox1: Bro too stronk.
[0:12:32] lewkis01: Someone send out the Tango Signal lol
[0:12:33] jedi_iwakura: great consistency on the breakage sir
[0:12:34] jessaa121: @Iconicbluejay karaPog
[0:12:36] soybean525: hasn't even started playing decked out and it's already broken
[0:12:37] woagopossum: maybe look at your command blocks again?
[0:12:39] DialingSpoon527: fine 4 me
[0:12:39] hennathefinn: this is kind of impressive from you honestly
[0:12:41] uncivilcivilservice: Worlds best beta tester
[0:12:42] padawandom: I feel like you are
[0:12:43] Iconicbluejay: @jessaa121 it's pizza pepeD
[0:12:45] TimeHeist3000: par for course
[0:12:47] Fletcherpauley6: you pulverized it sir you to stronk
[0:12:55] raffkaisa: i have a public hermitcraft s9 server if u need that? idk why thats doing that
[0:12:57] zainic_id: maybe it supposed to be that way
[0:12:58] soybean525: try redownloading the world or something??
[0:13:01] MistikKnight: Not sure, the version of the download I have doesnt have the command blocks outside the main doors
[0:13:02] ingapotejtoo: time to get tango on the call lmao
[0:13:03] AkiraGatr: ayyyy Decked Out
[0:13:09] jessaa121: i've only seen peeps take things from the shulkers and not try to take the shulkers
[0:13:10] Merry_Pippin: Is this the universe fighting against Cap playing Hermitcraft?
[0:13:13] Fletcherpauley6: lol
[0:13:19] fezzaf40: i mean it said dont break anything Shruge
[0:13:21] sprinklequeen: huh
[0:13:25] nemanja367_: @jessaa121 he should break it
[0:13:34] Iconicbluejay: @fezzaf40 now he's broken everything KEKW jk
[0:13:36] remagstreams: I guess this universe hates jardon
[0:13:38] titinna: how
[0:13:40] Merry_Pippin: Maybe it's just this area?
[0:13:42] ozzywho: call tango
[0:13:42] uncivilcivilservice: Might need to reset the map and try just taking cards
[0:13:47] OGPirate_Bob: does the books say anything?
[0:13:47] danieljpb2004: What is this?
[0:13:48] TheWyoLP: Is a mod doing something weird?
[0:13:50] tuuuuuuna: Are you tick warping your drops?
[0:13:51] Fletcherpauley6: are mobdrops set to false?
[0:13:56] Merry_Pippin: Do they drop in different parts of the world?
[0:13:56] SophieStays: you need the shulker
[0:13:59] phillykd11: Open a different copy of the world maybe?
[0:14:01] grossly1: what about other worlds
[0:14:03] tillythehun: yes
[0:14:04] danieljpb2004: How did minecraft forget how to be minecraft
[0:14:04] nemanja367_: yes you do this is super weird
[0:14:06] DiamondDustBunny: you can give yourself a shulker
[0:14:07] sprinklequeen: yea
[0:14:08] ingapotejtoo: yeah??
[0:14:09] 1SherlockSpock1: Your deck will be a shulker box
[0:14:09] phillykd11: That is true
[0:14:14] engineerlady13: yes, need the shulker to add/change cards
[0:14:17] jessaa121: @nemanja367_ ok
[0:14:24] phillykd11: the shulker goes into a chest
[0:14:27] pixiesiren: You place the shulker against a block to start the game
[0:14:28] fezzaf40: @remagstreams that's because he didn't create this one like in universio :p
[0:14:29] zainic_id: I think that shulker is builder's shulker
[0:14:31] SophieStays: reset?
[0:14:37] Fletcherpauley6: check le settings
[0:14:41] Plantho491: ctrl middle click to get the sulker with data?
[0:14:43] samuelphilips98: middle click the shulker
[0:14:44] remagstreams: UwU
[0:14:46] RandomJackJackson: Did the tick rate command break it?
[0:14:49] soybean525: redownload world maybe?
[0:14:50] jessaa121: @kingmodus123 cptHi
[0:14:50] fezzaf40: Shruge
[0:14:51] raffkaisa: check mods?
[0:14:57] fezzaf40: limeUwU
[0:14:59] Merry_Pippin: Is it just this world, or do items drop in your other saves?
[0:15:09] DialingSpoon527: `/execute as @e[type=minecraft:item] run say @s`
[0:15:11] soybean525: you could ctrl middle mouse but the shulker gets broken by a piston later and wouldn't drop anyways
[0:15:11] Iconicbluejay: that's a workaround i guess
[0:15:12] notekatha: but can't you just take cards out and delete shulker safely?
[0:15:16] That_Bat13: If breaking blocks is broken the game won't start because the piston won't break the shulker to start the game
[0:15:19] sprinklequeen: hrmm
[0:15:21] danieljpb2004: That sounds tedious
[0:15:25] Iconicbluejay: ohhh ^
[0:15:25] fezzaf40: cptHmm
[0:15:25] hennathefinn: this is weird considering that you haven't done anything to this. like i don't know how any of this works but the fact that it's borked right off the bat is impressive
[0:15:27] Faiataiga: gamerule?

[0:15:37] raffkaisa: what mods do you have installed? maybe they can be affecting it? i have a s9 server up running rn do you need any info from that?
[0:15:38] ingapotejtoo: yup
[0:15:38] woagopossum: well if items arent dropping at all is that a whole other problem
[0:15:40] grossly1: use a different instance?
[0:15:41] nemanja367_: yes
[0:15:44] titus_fear: oh, so it was the now break rule?
[0:15:47] iagrams: yes
[0:15:52] OptionalPoop: Try the game rule command
[0:15:53] MistikKnight: Try breaking something out something outside by the nether portal?
[0:15:56] 1SherlockSpock1: Not like how you described, but there is a shuffler
[0:15:57] soybean525: no it just pulls the items out of the shulker later down the line but still it's weird
[0:16:01] darccosmic: Something tells me the problem's client side and not the map
[0:16:03] someonewing125: hiii
[0:16:06] Iconicbluejay: hmmmm
[0:16:08] Plantho491: huh

[0:16:22] CanadianJet: what
[0:16:22] phillykd11: NANI
[0:16:23] Iconicbluejay: maybe restart the map from new??

[0:16:29] That_Bat13: Ok disregard what I said lol
[0:16:31] grossly1: NANI
[0:16:32] titus_fear: so uhh, its survival mode?
[0:16:32] titinna: how is this happening
[0:16:34] remagstreams: is it the pickaxe?
[0:16:34] McDancer29: ???
[0:16:34] zainic_id: are we get inverted mode
[0:16:35] Twodo: ???
[0:16:35] Iconicbluejay: mcscuse me?
[0:16:36] Tntaap1: Wait what
[0:16:37] danieljpb2004: Is creative survival?
[0:16:37] 1SherlockSpock1: Sir what have you done?
[0:16:39] PikaPower04: break another block in creative?
[0:16:40] Fletcherpauley6: the straight face he just had
[0:16:43] hennathefinn: tangotek to you we pray
[0:16:43] hypheneC: umm
[0:16:44] 128ajb_02: i highly doubt it, but is it the pick?
[0:16:45] Supercat_14: Jardon.json broke hermitcraft
[0:16:46] gabriel83477474: this isn’t because of the map it’s probably client side
[0:16:46] darccosmic: Minecraft is not minecrafting guys
[0:16:47] phillykd11: Inverted minecraft
[0:16:49] mwr1021: break another block in creative
[0:16:53] Merry_Pippin: Where did you get this world download...?
[0:16:54] woagopossum: you have problems never seen before
[0:16:56] DadbodRocCity: Looks like call iskall
[0:16:57] odd_dragon: I love how things break in the weirdest way for just you
[0:16:58] remagstreams: break the shulker with your fist
[0:17:01] soybean525: your honor my minecraft client would like to plead insanity
[0:17:01] 128ajb_02: maybe the lever breaking with the hand drops?
[0:17:06] Fletcherpauley6: look below the stone blocks sir
[0:17:08] DialingSpoon527: mods folder moment?
[0:17:18] phillykd11: Initiate the game while in creative, but then switch to survival to play?
[0:17:18] zainic_id: you should remove jardonk. json
[0:17:29] darccosmic: might be either the mods problem, or a datapack problem but not the map

[0:17:29] tuuuuuuna: can you get berry drops?
[0:17:35] uncivilcivilservice: You truly break games in the most creative ways
[0:17:39] danieljpb2004: Maybe ask a hermit
[0:17:55] odd_dragon: @cyber_doughnut but this is content
[0:17:58] uncivilcivilservice: Like, other people have played this fine I'm fairly sure lol
[0:18:00] titus_fear: might be fricked, so we restart?
[0:18:06] Fletcherpauley6: cptFace
[0:18:08] Animenetra: there are berries in the dungeon
[0:18:09] Iconicbluejay: cptHmm
[0:18:11] uncivilcivilservice: But it's just your luck that you run into issues
[0:18:14] danieljpb2004: What is going on
[0:18:14] chelseyymariee: greetings HypeMyHeart
[0:18:15] Iconicbluejay: cptHuh
[0:18:15] hennathefinn: how does this happen to you specifically
[0:18:15] titinna: this is so confusing
[0:18:16] zainic_id: ask eskalator 5
[0:18:16] sprinklequeen: ok ok
[0:18:17] soybean525: bwuh
[0:18:18] Crazy3wok: do droppers and dispensors work?
[0:18:25] TheWyoLP: This might be one of the weirdest issues I've ever seen
[0:18:26] Plantho491: @chelseyymariee o/
[0:18:26] meggoeggos: AHHH so sad I have to miss this stream!! but I’ll definitely be catching the vod!!! good luck captain! o7

[0:18:29] MistikKnight: I so lost
[0:18:29] Moobot: Jordan has been streaming for: 18m 35s This command is on a timer and is posted every 2 minutes.
[0:18:31] sprinklequeen: cptHuh
[0:18:32] Animenetra: what is he confused about??
[0:18:38] remagstreams: are block drops and tile drops different game rules?
[0:18:42] odd_dragon: @hennathefinn he's the best special snowflake
[0:18:47] TheWyoLP: So it's JUST you breaking things then
[0:18:48] danieljpb2004: @Animenetra Things don't drop
[0:18:49] valkojam: What seems wrong?
[0:18:50] uncivilcivilservice: @Animenetra why blocks are not dropping when he breaks them
[0:18:54] padawandom: Have you tried /gamerule doitemdrops true
[0:18:55] ingapotejtoo: i am so confused
[0:18:57] phillykd11: Could the souliers be dropping as invisible blocks in survival?
[0:19:04] Merry_Pippin: @Animenetra Items aren't dropping when he mines them in survival.
[0:19:09] darccosmic: @Animenetra Items that he breaks won't appear for some reason
[0:19:09] EdgedancerTSS: HUH
[0:19:09] raffkaisa: jardon try a vanilla mc installation
[0:19:10] lewkis01: Been trying to search for this problem on Google/Reddit and haven't been able to find it

[0:19:17] sprinklequeen: this wasn’t in the tutorial video
[0:19:21] Fletcherpauley6: maybe it’s something with an inventory
[0:19:24] heckinhecc_: whatre we up to
[0:19:26] Iconicbluejay: why are we taking her pillow
[0:19:30] Iconicbluejay: are they my cat?

[0:19:39] EdgedancerTSS: how did you manage that jardonk
[0:19:40] Iconicbluejay: are they cats?*
[0:19:42] CanadianJet: tango didn’t account for this….
[0:19:43] 1SherlockSpock1: By the way, The moment of clarity card is a one time use. I do not recommend using it for your first run.
[0:19:43] padawandom: Are you on 1.20.1
[0:19:46] Fletcherpauley6: uhh minecraf u good?
[0:19:49] odd_dragon: @brocox1 1.20
[0:19:53] Animenetra: luckily he shouldn't need to break anything play decked out
[0:19:56] uncivilcivilservice: minecraft looks frozen?
[0:19:58] valkojam: That seems strange for sure.
[0:20:08] uncivilcivilservice: Ahhh okay
[0:20:10] McShrooms411: @Animenetra The shulker box is the main issue

[0:21:18] hennathefinn: ah yes the rest of the game as opposed to all of minecraft
[0:21:22] padawandom: Are you sure we can't try again in survival
[0:21:26] ingapotejtoo: wild
[0:21:28] gurophobe: oh my god

[0:37:16] tyto13alba: the first run is about learning

[0:37:26] 1SherlockSpock1: there is always a path
[0:37:28] xade_n: there is always a path
[0:37:30] rdschmid: There will always be at least one path
[0:37:31] badluckcharming: you don’t need to worry about keys
[0:37:31] CanadianJet: if you don’t make it to level 4 on the first run you are considered washed up like etho
[0:37:32] AkiraGatr: the hazard door already closed in this room
[0:37:33] SophieStays: I think there is another way
[0:37:36] Kelianthus: some only last like 30 secs on their first round
[0:37:36] nemanja367_: there is always a way its made that way
[0:37:37] uncivilcivilservice: This is like tripping in impossible minecraft lol
[0:37:38] Animenetra: stumbles are added to your deck every 2 min
[0:37:38] big_cube: Its been blocked from this way

[0:37:51] TheWyoLP: Yep, no artifact = You get nothing
[0:37:52] woagopossum: there is always a path unblocked, it might be guarded by ravengers
[0:37:52] rdschmid: It's a true rougelike
[0:37:53] lewkis01: You trade 4 coins for 1 crown, which you can keep. As long as you make it back out alive
[0:37:53] padawandom: Yes
[0:37:54] big_cube: Need the river room
[0:37:56] pseudopenguinbot: There will always be an open path
[0:37:56] darccosmic: 7 coins and a key for a first run is craazy
[0:37:58] AkiraGatr: It's a speed vs. noise game
[0:38:00] Animenetra: you can get through
[0:38:00] aeyadice: there is another way

[0:38:21] soybean525: permablocked
[0:38:21] Fletcherpauley6: why the riddles
[0:38:22] RipCityKnights: Go all the way around again
[0:38:27] Animenetra: hazard blocks your options, not your ability to get to rooms
[0:38:29] nemanja367_: there are multiple ways into almost every room
[0:38:31] BroCox1: That route is blocked. There is always a open path. You will need to go around
[0:38:32] ingapotejtoo: bro that aint the way
[0:38:32] rdschmid: Perma when it closes, just need to go back further sometimes
[0:38:32] darccosmic: 9 coins in first run is crazy
[0:38:39] iagrams: won’t do you any good

[1:23:21] sonic4spuds: You have to have that much from the run
[1:23:25] CanadianJet: turn around
[1:23:25] gamingnscience: the deeper you go the higher the ember reward
[1:23:26] ingapotejtoo: yup
[1:23:27] AkiraGatr: the harder difficulty artifacts are much better
[1:23:27] 1SherlockSpock1: yep
[1:23:27] SemGamerNL: yes
[1:23:28] darccosmic: You gotta go for the deeper levels for those embers
[1:23:29] thepineapple___: yes
[1:23:29] factorization4: Yes
[1:23:29] Bemperor: next future jardon has ravager on entree, but thats ok ;p
[1:23:31] lewkis01: Yeah. You get more later when you can do longer runs with more cards
[1:23:31] pseudopenguinbot: The artifacts are worth more the deeper you go
[1:23:32] TheWyoLP: AND the shop has to pick them
[1:23:32] Endersouled: you need to do a higher difficulty
[1:23:32] TheWillOfTexas: yep. the max ever was 90 in a run
[1:23:33] sprinklequeen: the artifacts are worth a ton more the deeper you go
[1:23:33] Ixisten: Artifacts get much better later
[1:23:34] danieljpb2004: That's wild
[1:23:35] chanphillip: deeper artifact
[1:23:35] odd_dragon: Correct
[1:23:38] kozziollek: they played for 8 weeks, ~10 runs each
[1:23:39] GnomesSkull: the easter eggs should all still be there, I don't know if they have any crowns with them
[1:23:39] unknownbasket: Later levels will give you more
[1:23:39] McDancer29: yep, frost ember cards help
[1:23:39] MistikKnight: the record in 100 I think in a single run
[1:23:40] Animenetra: higher difficulties = lower levels = more embers
[1:23:40] RipCityKnights: Go deeper for more points
[1:23:41] WhatABees: try a hard run :)
[1:23:41] n1k3xgod: yooo
[1:23:43] Taticles: there are cards that drop embers like treasure
[1:23:47] Zarey_z: Record is 112
[1:23:47] Tntaap1: Yes
[1:23:48] TeaRosePedall: @fezzaf40 Stop! do you not care for my delicate legs!…and the law!?
[1:23:48] CanadianJet: see the other side
[1:23:48] darccosmic: You should get sneak
[1:23:52] gamingnscience: Pearlescant Moon has managed a record of 111 embers with a single run
[1:23:58] sonic4spuds: Harder runs are more likely to have better artifact rewards.
[1:24:00] Animenetra: lots of sneak is good
[1:24:00] darccosmic: Yeah you need clank block
[1:24:02] odd_dragon: Clank is good, yeah
[1:24:08] GnomesSkull: yes, the harder artifacts are worth a lot more frost embers
[1:24:10] factorization4: Take whatever you like, you will max it out eventually
[1:24:11] ztevs: Record by Pearl is 90 embers in one run, I believe, unless she beat it
[1:24:16] RipCityKnights: Go Difficulty level 2!!!

[1:25:45] McDancer29: you could take a peek
[1:25:45] ingapotejtoo: stick on easy
[1:25:45] Bemperor: maybe 2-3 more cards?
[1:25:45] CanOfAmberSoup: tea :D!!
[1:25:46] Edrymis: Just do it
[1:25:46] 1SherlockSpock1: You need more level knowledge

[1:25:48] darccosmic: Check out the training area upstairs
[1:25:48] ingapotejtoo: for the love OF GOD
[1:25:50] GrailknightMonty: try level 2
[1:25:50] gamingnscience: you haven't even seen the whole of level 1 yet, stick to easy for a couple more runs
[1:25:51] CanadianJet: no, stay lvl 1 till you have 10 cards..
[1:25:52] lewkis01: I'd do easy til you learn the 1st level really well
[1:25:52] sprinklequeen: maybe get a few more cards,,,
[1:25:53] WhatABees: no harm in trying
[1:25:53] TheWillOfTexas: easy until you get all of the commons probably
[1:25:54] factorization4: Medium is 50/50 level 1 or 2
[1:25:56] Animenetra: medium is a 50/50 chance of taking you to level 2
[1:25:58] danieljpb2004: Try a hard level to see how it goes
[1:26:00] chanphillip: explore the map a bit
[1:26:00] TeaRosePedall: Can we gamble if cap can survive more than 7 minutes?
[1:26:01] jrb4562: you are it is the same level in the dungeon
[1:26:01] 1SherlockSpock1: try exploring level 1 first
[1:26:02] MistikKnight: it's still most likely level 1 compas just worth more
[1:26:03] AkiraGatr: you COULD potentially do Medium, but not likely
[1:26:06] RipCityKnights: L2 will give him more knowledge
[1:26:06] titus_fear: honestly that first run proved you could take on floor three no problem
[1:26:09] anonymous_2006_13_12: You need more treasure cards for level 2
[1:26:09] danieljpb2004: and to see what you can expect
[1:26:11] kozziollek: difficulty doesn't mach 1:! to levels
[1:26:11] jessaa121: @TeaRosePedall no
[1:26:13] unknownbasket: Prodon has got this
[1:26:18] WhatABees: if he dies he can go back to easy
[1:26:27] odd_dragon: Does he even know how to get to level 2 yet?
[1:26:31] Tntaap1: A couple more easy to map out lvl 1 I would say
[1:26:31] ingapotejtoo: you dont even know how to get to lvl 2 yet
[1:26:32] GnomesSkull: har is only a bit harder, if you're really feeling like a gamer you could do it
[1:26:33] darccosmic: You should practice in the training area while youre at it
[1:26:33] TeaRosePedall: @ingapotejtoo INGA you new art!!!!!!! Very delish!!!! much good food for my eyes
[1:26:35] Taticles: medium on level 2 the artifacts are near the enterence
[1:26:41] ingapotejtoo: explore it on easy still

[1:27:23] gamingnscience: on medium or hader you can get a level 2 compass
[1:27:23] IrishGoddess17: higher value artifacts
[1:27:24] Taticles: to get to level 2 you need the key so need a few treasure cards usually
[1:27:26] just_jeni: Won't hurt to try medium to see how you go. You may end up with better artifacts and more treasures
[1:27:35] WhatABees: try medium
[1:27:36] 1SherlockSpock1: better artifacts and loot on lower floors
[1:27:37] Ratedjr07: make a remake of first person shooter mode, by drake FT Jcole. but in minecraft.
[1:27:37] odd_dragon: Not much, loot, but not worth the risk with a small deck
[1:27:47] unknownbasket: Your compass will tell you
[1:27:50] 1SherlockSpock1: no
[1:27:54] kozziollek: always start from level 1
[1:27:54] iagrams: no.
[1:27:55] Ixisten: Difficulty only changes the compass location
[1:27:56] jaybirb13: no you have to work your way dwon
[1:27:56] Ratedjr07: but make it ai generated
[1:27:57] sprinklequeen: no you need to get there with keys
[1:27:57] Endersouled: you still start at lvl 1
[1:27:58] IrishGoddess17: yes but you'd never make it without treasure cards to get keys
[1:27:59] Animenetra: you have to go through level 1 and 2 to get to level 3
[1:28:00] 1SherlockSpock1: you have to get to the third level
[1:28:01] jaybirb13: *down
[1:28:01] titinna: you have to go down yourself
[1:28:01] vansanoos: 2nd or 3rd
[1:28:02] odd_dragon: Hard is 2 or 3
[1:28:03] factorization4: Hard is 7/8 level 2, 1/8 level 3
[1:28:07] Taticles: but if you don’t get keys you can’t get down lower levels
[1:28:08] ebi_lyn: u have to get to the third levle
[1:28:09] queenofdarkness93: Medium will give you level one or two compass
[1:28:09] RipCityKnights: No u still have to do the traveling
[1:28:10] TheWillOfTexas: you have to traverse the whole dungeon everytime
[1:28:15] big_cube: Need more cards to last that distance
[1:28:17] chanphillip: need to find keys for each level
[1:28:21] Tntaap1: No you start at 1 you have to go down by using keys
[1:28:25] Bethylee: yeah the difficulty is what floor the artifact is on, not where you start
[1:28:25] gamingnscience: you can buy random keys in the crown shop, though
[1:28:26] Ratedjr07: cause youre the best
[1:28:27] queenofdarkness93: You have to get through each floor to get to the next
[1:28:34] odd_dragon: Yeah, you have to always traverse from the first level
[1:28:46] lewkis01: Yes

[1:29:05] IrishGoddess17: they tell you the dungeon level and floor of that level
[1:29:05] tyranno66: Compass tells you level and height
[1:29:06] vansanoos: i'd advise getting more cards before getting to the lower level and getting more knowledge of level 1
[1:29:08] hennathefinn: this time go with your minecart
[1:29:11] Tntaap1: Yes it always says the level

[1:32:09] padawandom: Because Hot Breath is evil
[1:32:09] lewkis01: He's just looking for breath mints sir
[1:32:11] Edrymis: The nice thing is once you learn the paths they'll change slightly with difficulty
[1:32:11] ztevs: I think Tango had 118 days of playtime this season
[1:32:12] darccosmic: You gotta take Hot Breath downstairs
[1:32:15] 1SherlockSpock1: you are stealing from his dungeon

[2:01:12] Ixisten: The number is on the artifact
[2:01:16] WhatABees: you can buy another
[2:01:19] Archermaster24: half the time medium is still a level 1 artifact, or its pretty early on in floor 2, I think you can manage medium if you are careful
[2:01:20] lewkis01: There's a number on the artifact that tells you how many embers it's worth
[2:01:21] SemGamerNL: yea insane, all redstone and a custom resourcepack, thats it

[2:02:09] tillythehun: it was dlc that wasn’t finished
[2:02:10] jaybirb13: moment of clarity makes a bigger difference early on when you don't have as many cards
[2:02:12] 1SherlockSpock1: he was too busy making the rest of the game
[2:02:18] grossly1: the forge wasn't completed sadly
[2:02:23] Archermaster24: @uncivilcivilservice you don't lose cards ever, they are permanent, except the etherial ones
[2:02:25] netherdude1313: its a bad tease
[2:02:34] odd_dragon: @Jasaland he's had some verticality issues, but has figured it out pretty quickly every time
[2:02:50] 1SherlockSpock1: next time you get 7, you should buy a moment of clarity so that you have 2 you will never use
[2:03:08] netherdude1313: go medium then

[2:04:08] 1SherlockSpock1: it is on the ground at a treasure spot
[2:04:10] GlacierHero: can we get a gamba
[2:04:11] gamingnscience: generally embers can spawn in the same locations as treasure, but less frequent
[2:04:19] Iconicbluejay: PeepoChat
[2:04:22] DialingSpoon527: i recommend simulation distance 10 and render 16 (minimum for D.O.) if not already for quicker tick sprint
[2:04:23] SwanNebula: hello, how is cap doing?
[2:04:24] Taticles: get a toot sound when ember released

[2:04:32] TheEthereality: He's gotta add 600+ more runs to Decked Out
[2:04:35] CanOfAmberSoup: he's adding decked out 24/7 for the next week
[2:04:40] CanOfAmberSoup: ?????

[2:05:39] woagopossum: pearl n etho hours /j
[2:05:40] CanOfAmberSoup: silence decked out
[2:05:41] LunarbladeDK: Embers only spawn with card prompts embers don’t spawn naturally. Keys, crowns and coins spawn naturally, but accelerated with treasure - so until card with ember spawns are played, only way to get embers is artifacts
[2:05:41] tyranno66: Do a decked out subathon
[2:05:41] TheEthereality: Diapers would be helpful

[2:56:59] chanphillip: how about doing it in reverse
[2:57:06] cb_915: I have an idea, maybe you could hire someone and pay them to place them in the pedestals manually
[2:57:15] TheStickyManatee: I think finding a way to limit the arm from placing any more pieces into the deployer until it is cleared may help
[2:57:21] dr3mmy: NBT check the main pedestal that controls the arm?
[2:57:28] WhatABees: what if you made the depolyer slower so that the process is finished before it places another
[2:57:46] MistikKnight: Is there a way to only get the arm to fill everytihing with one item and stop?

[2:58:03] uncivilcivilservice: Time for words to go in one ear and out the other peepoSit

[3:04:33] flyleider: :( :(
[3:04:34] smolilpanda: @Null__Void the feeding when all are empty could still face the same problem with the place and pick up mechanism. The deployers have to be stopped during the ritual, so timing the middlepart is key. So there wouldn't be a way, theoretically for the deployers to activate after placing the eternal stellas, which would happen after the other materials are placed. But it's not a certainty it works

[3:06:40] cb_915: Maybe light it on soul fire first and move it into the rose while still burning?
[3:06:41] tyranno66: Fan with soul fire?
[3:06:42] Tip11000: is there a soul fire version of a flint and steel? if so, you could light the skeleton directly instead of lighting the block below it
[3:06:58] ykAwsOme: Wither rose will kill skeleton too
[3:07:07] cb_915: Fans move mobs right?

[3:53:32] gabriel83477474: @kendi_artista yes
[3:53:36] bottomsley: Lag and frames are different y'all, lag is server side (too many calculations), low frames is rendering too much stuff

[3:56:43] jneedspopcorn25: 2 fire
[3:56:48] jneedspopcorn25: ?
[3:56:50] WhatABees: placing more fire would burn more drops
[3:56:57] NachitoMiCullo: maybe because its swapping to normal fire due to day time?
[3:57:02] smolilpanda: fair
[3:57:02] lewkis01: Fan should blow the drops away from the fire anyway
[3:57:03] CSquared_1: i think its because he burned in the sun thats why the fire switched
[3:57:04] jneedspopcorn25: ah
[3:57:05] jedi_iwakura: what if 3 fire
[3:57:11] notekatha: @Iconicbluejay tea is nice and good

[3:57:29] SwanNebula: i petition we call soulsand dr pepper from now on
[3:57:29] Tip11000: true, sunlight would change him to normal fire
[3:57:33] Animenetra: @jedi_iwakura that might be too much, what about 2.5 fires?
[3:57:35] jneedspopcorn25: more roses? and more fire?
[3:57:45] smolilpanda: maybe it should drop one block after contact with fire right next to the fan
[3:57:46] Wyvernity: yeah might be better to cover up the roof so the sun doesnt burn them
[3:57:51] WhatABees: does fire melt ice?

[3:58:40] Tip11000: @CaptainSparklez you may be able to have the fire one back. I think the sunlight was changing it to normal fire
[3:58:57] lloyd_gachaaddict: It pushes into an inventory directly
[3:58:58] hypheneC: yes he does indeed have an imbument chamber and not an enchanting apparatus
[3:59:11] not_quite_quiet: You put a 2x1 drawer to filter it
[3:59:28] lister_elite: compacting drawer for bones
[3:59:30] Wyvernity: no it automatically inserts into the inventory the pedestal is on

[4:05:47] dragonmaster3707: that pedistal is display only
[4:05:49] not_quite_quiet: Pedestal (display only)
[4:06:07] smolilpanda: I was thinking you did that on purpose lol
[4:06:44] Wyvernity: Smart
[4:06:46] WhatABees: i do know how it is
[4:06:46] lewkis01: If you use a compacting drawer for the bone blocks you won't need to set up all those crafters and stuff

[4:07:30] lloyd_gachaaddict: shift+right click the coin to activate it too
[4:07:31] not_quite_quiet: These bones do not have compacting recipe?
[4:07:35] WhatABees: is the coin on?

[4:08:02] hadesruby: clap clap
[4:08:12] lewkis01: Actually that's a good point. Wither bones probably don't compact into blocks.
[4:08:16] lewkis01: Sorry, didn't think about that
[4:08:37] LogicPW: bonemeal indo to drawer
[4:08:46] Kobra652: Bone blocks are made of bone meal

[4:09:43] jedi_iwakura: @McGuster a good candidate for the skelly crusher there, eh?
[4:09:49] not_quite_quiet: Pushing upgrade?
[4:09:57] smolilpanda: are there no double drawers or is that only limited to compacting drawers
[4:10:01] SwanNebula: do they make whither bonemeal?
[4:10:09] Tip11000: @SwanNebula no
[4:10:18] lewkis01: Nice little setup
[4:10:21] Oux_y: launcher?
[4:10:25] Tip11000: @CaptainSparklez does crushing give more bonemeal?
[4:10:34] SwanNebula: then do we not need it as whither bones?
[4:10:35] zaharozoe: @mcguster the door jamb had it coming tbh
[4:10:54] lewkis01: @SwanNebula He needs wither skulls for something else, so it's a multi purpose machine

[4:11:52] SwanNebula: i was trying to figure out the point of whither bones, ty. I didn't know it was just a byproduct
