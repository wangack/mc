[1:38:55] rth4n: make sure ur out of reach too
[1:38:57] sharkman1221: USE WATER
[1:38:57] parsifal990: dont use water
[1:38:59] ayacraft: both work
[1:39:03] AneTorisaki: he teleports so you can't trap him but a boat can keep him still
[1:39:03] lvl10cybermancer: Water also hurts them yeah
[1:39:09] skeletoncow5: a 2 high ceiling is an easy way to cheese them
[1:39:12] tricolorhades: enderman is 3 blocks tall so they can't fit in a two block tall roof
[1:39:13] CaptainOblivion26: ok they hate water and are 3 blocks high NODDERS
[1:39:15] kaeeede999: Water kills him

[1:39:20] VeryVishas: yeah you'll clear out your torches
[1:39:20] DataRew: 2 high cieling sounds easiest
[1:39:21] ayacraft: well yes
[1:39:21] parsifal990: he will teleport away if you use water
[1:39:23] DragonBone_TV: dont use water it will just tp away
[1:39:23] killadude00: you also respawn 5 feet from him you can probably just brute force it LUL
[1:39:24] lvl10cybermancer: true
[1:39:25] Mina_the_Engineer: he teleports and hates water, but the easiest way is to go under that overhang where tomato hasn't finished yet where it's 2 hight
[1:39:25] kaeeede999: no
[1:39:27] GuruBuckaroo: No, but you'll put the torches on the floor out
[1:39:29] stmaxim: can you butcher your own body ?
[1:39:29] TheBaronFD: a little, but he wouldnt spawn
[1:39:30] atsutane13: a 3 by 3 ceiling above your head no?
[1:39:30] darkzyrik: as long as you dont look at him directly he wont attack you
[1:39:30] rylexander0: Youd be able to pick up the water again
[1:39:31] raiga_23: also ya'll gotta remember this mod makes things more aggressive too
[1:39:31] StevoreenoElcamino: Enderman love bananas, just give him a banana
[1:39:32] Ralsd0wer: 2 high ceiling is easier
[1:39:34] Cloudsleeper: Water actually does hurt them. You can drop a single bucket's worth and pick it up repeatedly
[1:39:42] verus_b: unless you build a little pond around him
[1:39:44] TitanCamper44: two block sealing look at him and kill it
[1:39:45] GuruBuckaroo: That's why you don't put torches on the floor.
[1:39:48] ayacraft: the 2 high method is best since then you get the loot
[1:39:48] rylexander0: fair
[1:39:51] CluxDX: There are a number of ways to do it, but yes if you make the ceiling 2 blocks high they can't get past

[1:43:42] Saeko_Akumachi: Press f5 to see your size third person if that help. You can build something higher than you but not higher than the enemy.

[2:29:06] RattleThyBoness: You have a very nice looking base.
[2:29:06] J0ker_JD: oooo def
[2:29:07] Sellineth: use speedrun strat to make portal
[2:29:08] Ahtalos: if you really want ot do it, all you need is lots of lava and water
[2:29:08] Skurai21: in before this modpack makes hell mobs come out of the portal
[2:29:10] thorangar: Casually opening a portal to Hell
[2:29:15] Oona46: Netherrack can also be found around ruined Nether portals.
[2:29:15] Amadeas: Probably don't want to explore it too much without, but just like popping in for some stuff seems fine
[2:29:16] OneYeetyBoyo: Just need a diamond pick if you have solid lava and a water bucket
[2:29:17] yumbibble: You need more lava than that
[2:29:17] queen_of_vermin: Doubtful, but water and lava are easier to find than diamonds and pearls, I don't recommend just one lava block
[2:29:19] MolecularNanoscientist: the portal works both ways though.
[2:29:20] BobTheJanit0r: I mean how will this modpack handle a portal to hell?
[2:29:20] TitanCamper44: craft a clock

[2:29:41] CluxDX: Seriously, every house needs that room. Really ties the whole thing together.
[2:29:45] verus_b: you need to make 10 (min) obsidian with lava
[2:29:46] OneYeetyBoyo: Still pretty nice, though I would very much like it if you moved Adinky out of the meat room
[2:29:48] therizzler_real_: I love the echo lol

[2:29:54] voidelessdna: For fun
[2:29:56] therizzler_real_: Netherrack
[2:29:58] GreyWardenZombie: Layna literally created an unground cathedral
[2:29:59] killadude00: do you already have a portal?
[2:30:02] Jiziason: nether crack to get in the nether region
[2:30:04] verus_b: Water on lava
[2:30:05] cyberneticReverb: nether portal to get netherrack, which when lit on fire, stays lit forever
[2:30:06] elbumptitude: thatsa a lot of fursuits on the wall
[2:30:07] wondering_whisp: No it's water over lava
[2:30:07] OneYeetyBoyo: Water over a solid block of Lava
[2:30:07] YourFinalWish: Water over lava
[2:30:08] squideater_: this model is amazing!
[2:30:08] MolecularNanoscientist: lava or magma
[2:30:09] Neafie2: Water for lava source
[2:30:09] dream_on_stardust: It has to be still lava
[2:30:10] mistermister_4: water over lava
[2:30:14] queen_of_vermin: Water over still lava, it will delete the lava however
[2:30:19] Falkorv: Diamond pickaxe and water bucket while exploring some caves
[2:30:20] Reetyh: Remember to hang the demon sheep laynaBatlove
[2:30:20] redstone68: You want netherack for fire to stay lit
[2:30:23] Amadeas: water, flowing or block, on lava block specifically. Flowing lava convers to cobblestone
[2:30:24] CluxDX: "Oh, you don't have a room of various animal corpses? What is this, ameteur hour?" Kappa
[2:30:25] driv3nbymalice: water on lava source, not flowing lava
[2:30:29] JoyBoyMilo: Water has to touch a lava source block
[2:30:33] OneYeetyBoyo: It has to be a flat lava block, not running lava
[2:30:37] yumbibble: There is no infinite lava, so you need a lot of it
[2:30:42] Sellineth: make the shape of the portal with dirt and than put the lava on one block and water over it to turn the obsidian in place, without using diamond pick
[2:30:49] mykezero: The grand hall
[2:31:04] redstone68: Aloo
[2:31:06] andy_n0: you need a diamond pickaxe to pick the obsidian up.
[2:31:07] goopsale: dance moms is actually crazy, anyways im back
[2:31:10] cheese8crakers: Think you need a morter and pestle
[2:31:11] kuroyami_nzk: Buhh too advanced for layna
[2:31:11] killadude00: you might need 10 lava
[2:31:14] BxRockShooter: Scaredge
[2:31:14] kokonutdoggy: just look up speedrun portal
[2:31:17] Ahtalos: do this have stalagmites in it, and if so, do you have any? you can use them to make infinite lava.  takes time though
[2:31:19] therizzler_real_: Why do we want eternal fire again?
[2:31:24] asianwithfriedrice: uuh 󠀀
[2:31:24] RattleThyBoness: JEI is also your best friend for anything can craft
[2:31:25] queen_of_vermin: Be careful of lava, it can destroy your body
[2:31:31] formalbutter: you need to understand source blocks and flow blocks. encourage you to play arround with it till you understand
[2:31:34] cyberneticReverb: @therizzler_real_ to keep a fire lit under a cauldron
[2:31:35] OneYeetyBoyo: @queen_of_vermin If nothing else, aesthetics
[2:31:37] killadude00: laynaEatPop
[2:31:37] VeryVishas: yeah just mine the obsidian itll be faster than chat trying to explain the other way lol
[2:31:46] mykezero: Where's the throne room? Need the pile of chat to be lore accurate XDD
[2:31:47] plasticsinue: the mold method might me a bit difficult to explain with layna needing visuals
[2:31:49] YourFinalWish: You don’t need to use the “speedrun strat”
[2:31:49] redstone68: Question why do we need fire?
[2:31:53] xNerwinxx: Yes
[2:31:54] asianwithfriedrice: You can do @ "name of mod" in the JEI to find specific items of a mod
[2:31:54] MolecularNanoscientist: Do you like my sword my diamond sword
[2:31:57] goopsale: 12 pieces of obsidian
[2:31:59] verus_b: at least 10
[2:32:02] gartoks: 10 lava / obisdian
[2:32:03] TitanCamper44: u need a clock so u can see when its going to be night
[2:32:03] Mina_the_Engineer: diamond pick is easiest and least likely to cause an error you can't undo, if you don't have that you can cast the portal but it's kind of complicated
[2:32:03] GrumlingGaming: And a partridge in a pear tree
[2:32:05] willriker01: thats a fancy trick. just hit a lava source with water, mine with diamond pick
[2:32:07] TitanCamper44: or day
[2:32:08] therizzler_real_: @cyberneticreverb would a bonfire do the trick? Or nah?
[2:32:08] goruden_experience77: Yea 10

[2:32:24] dream_on_stardust: that is such a spooky place for him to spawn
[2:32:25] goopsale: 10? Is it 10?
[2:32:31] OneYeetyBoyo: Just need 10 pieces of obsidian, so you just need to find a flat surface of lava with 10 of spaces
[2:32:36] mistermister_4: D:
[2:32:37] mykezero: Why, just why?
[2:32:38] NaetViking: Why are you crawling lol

[2:33:08] ArthalossXI: i dont think so
[2:33:11] NaetViking: Nothing is scarier than minecraft cave sounds
[2:33:11] queen_of_vermin: You live in stone, so I don't think you will
[2:33:13] T_blazian: not unless it's wood around it
[2:33:15] mech_w: campfire works
[2:33:17] BatmanMCX: should be fine but the fire would go out
[2:33:18] Sekeer: fire only spreads to wood/leaves in a 2 block radius around it
[2:33:18] capriceppv: Do you need the corners for a portal in this mod or can you do economy one
[2:33:20] verus_b: something in your walls

[4:55:05] kokonutdoggy: thought creepers only explode when they make direct eye contact
[4:55:13] Amadeas: you're at 21, fine for iron

[5:00:38] Gary0_o: laynaHuehue
[5:00:43] mykyx: Gotcha LUL
[5:00:44] killadude00: Tomato says he doesn't do that because he never gets lost but he does and that's probably why LUL
[5:00:45] Slime_: i think they will also be using iron for some of the other modpacks to make machinery
[5:00:50] DrMooseNipples: ooo lead
[5:00:51] Rinkimah: Should really rebind your drop key so you don't do it again
[5:00:51] LuffyDSoul: Layna the gold pickaxe have fortune 2 by default, with fortune 2 you have a posibility when mining iron you get more than 1
[5:00:59] willriker01: armor would help you a looot on the surface
[5:01:02] verus_b: At least you didn't fall in the lava
[5:01:12] Vkmgl: It's still three iron for a iron pickaxe still?
[5:01:17] Mina_the_Engineer: I find it slightly wild that in this pack being in a 1x1 hole on your belly deep underground is no good for sanity, but if you have a burning stick next to your head it's all good laynaSmug
[5:01:19] Cobnor: https://clips.twitch.tv/AverageApatheticCoyoteRuleFive-KKBf392xVxRVgFkV
[5:01:32] steampowerdlady: you cant mine iron with gold
[5:01:35] skeletoncow5: That must be modded
[5:01:38] Slime_: gold doesnt work on diamond tho
[5:01:38] mykyx: @mina_the_engineer I mean, light = good
[5:01:43] LuffyDSoul: @steampowerdlady yes you can
[5:01:43] Amadeas: I think fortune only works for things that don't drop blocks though, right? So diamond, not iron?
[5:01:47] VeryVishas: ??? yes you can
[5:01:48] DrMooseNipples: gold tools break very easily though
[5:01:51] Neafie2: Oh thats cool, it tells you the block and where its from i the top left corner
[5:01:52] Slime_: i think you can get iron, just not diamond
[5:01:54] VeryVishas: You cant mind diamond with gold
[5:01:58] TitanCamper44: u can make a flamethroer i think with immersive engineering
[5:01:59] GreyWardenZombie: laynaComf
[5:02:04] Gary0_o: test it for science
[5:02:06] LuffyDSoul: with golden pickaxe you can mine iron, gold and diamonds
[5:02:07] Slime_: comfi
[5:02:09] Slime_: Comfi
[5:02:13] SeeAndShudder: you can get iron with gold but not diamond
[5:02:13] BigSwig13: laynaComf
[5:02:17] skeletoncow5: @Amadeas Iron ore drops raw iron instead or iron blocks now, they added that a while back
[5:02:18] mykyx: Pretty sure gold can mine iron

[5:02:38] LuffyDSoul: @queen_of_vermin yep im playind this mod pack in my world
[5:02:39] cg1003: resource pack is the textures of the blocks and items
[5:02:39] OneYeetyBoyo: !modpack

[5:02:45] mykyx: @maunisphiehouse yes, it came with the modpack
[5:02:46] Darkpieslice: Elon could make us a flamethrower. May b scury though
[5:02:50] KuroYamiko: Ot's what makes the tools look different
[5:03:01] Panterbell: What is this Fov setting SabaPing
[5:03:02] Mina_the_Engineer: resource pack is the thing that's making the game look like that compared to when you played on your own, lets you change textures, sounds, etc.
[5:03:09] rudi0415: why are u crawling ?

[5:03:15] TitanCamper44: iron is most common between Y levels 15 and 232. @LaynaLazar
