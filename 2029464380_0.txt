[0:34:40] GrimBirb: theres a spot or two evoker spots that are bugged
[0:34:41] mcswizzle7: lol me any time there's a vex
[0:34:44] itsthenars: yeah its just a bit buggy
[0:34:45] gamingnscience: there is an evoker who has iron bars not glass in his head, they see you when close
[0:34:48] factorization4: It sometimes happens if you stand too close to the wall
[0:34:50] vadskamanta: Tbh, it depends on the waffles and the pancakes for me, there are some waffles that I don't like at all so
[0:34:56] secret_agent4706: Need to replace iron bar with glass block
[0:35:04] itsthenars: if you step on the ice in that one hallway, the guy can see you, so
[0:35:06] BigFlameWolf: @vadskamanta Generally speaking, I prefer Belgian waffles.
[0:35:07] PRIPYAT715: the vex thing is a bug that happens
[0:35:07] SerenityUwU99: That's true Vads!
[0:35:09] Kitten_74: Tango! Fix your game :P
[0:35:13] rhinorkw: A block of ice it can see through when u get real clise
[0:35:16] mister_rj73: He can see you at some really specific spaces
[0:35:25] secret_agent4706: Ok
[0:35:26] vadskamanta: @BigFlameWolf I despise Belgian waffles hbomb94LUL
[0:35:42] BigFlameWolf: @vadskamanta They're so big... and you can fill them with so much syrup...
[0:35:45] itsthenars: oh no! your vibes! theyre broken!
[0:36:01] vadskamanta: @BigFlameWolf But they don't taste good
[0:36:08] sparkie1904: i love belgian waffles
[0:36:12] RohanaDArilin: do not even compare waffles and toast, please...
[0:36:18] goodtimeswithiona: what level is this on?
[0:36:24] BigFlameWolf: @vadskamanta You've probably just had ones that had bad batter mixes.
[0:36:30] cptcinnabunny: I am not huge on waffles overall. Much prefer pancakes
[0:36:38] BigFlameWolf: @RohanaDArilin I thought he said "french toast". did I mishear?
[0:36:41] cptcinnabunny: But one time a friend and I got a stack of 13 to share and it was a mistake
[0:36:51] vadskamanta: @BigFlameWolf I've eaten belgian waffles in belgium, don't think it was a batter mix
[0:37:06] BigFlameWolf: I make blueberry pancakes every now and then. Haven't actually had waffles in years.
[0:37:18] cptcinnabunny: Has anyone had taiyaki?
[0:37:32] BigFlameWolf: @cptcinnabunny I've not.
[0:37:37] cptcinnabunny: that's takoyaki H.
[0:37:40] RohanaDArilin: @BigFlameWolf still toast. it's toast dipped in egg mixture and fried.
[0:37:42] cptcinnabunny: Taiyaki is the fish shaped dessert
[0:37:49] AmieT9433: takoyaki
[0:37:51] darktyping: Yes, love taiyaki.
[0:38:06] cptcinnabunny: Yeah, with red bean. so good! I bought myself a pan for it
[0:38:10] AmieT9433: indeed they‚Äôre yummy
[0:38:15] haggleslag: takoyaki always burns my mouth, i like them tho
[0:38:17] vadskamanta: LMAO
[0:38:18] itsthenars: jinx
[0:38:23] BigFlameWolf: @RohanaDArilin Just because both are made from bread, that doesn't make it the same thing. It has a different texture, consistency, and flavor. It's way better.
[0:38:24] AmieT9433: call and you shall receive
[0:38:26] mikwons: the dungeon master was listening
[0:38:30] Kush_06: jedi mind tricks
[0:38:48] factorization4: I guess the HBomb mode is the call for bounding strides and it will come
[0:38:54] gamingnscience: can go over the fence to willy

[0:39:04] taulover628: ravager also has bounding
[0:39:14] HiroZebra: yo
[0:39:17] darktyping: That's exactly what Pearl says about this level.
[0:39:21] ANTdentarg: Have you found Cub's book in Rusty's room?
[0:39:24] Kush_06: i think they meant bounding strides by BS lmao
[0:39:35] itsthenars: willie is in the trenches
[0:39:41] darktyping: Willy be willy-ing
[0:39:57] saleo37: Hellouuu! pearlieHeart
[0:40:16] itsthenars: ~Swagger~
[0:40:19] vadskamanta: OMEGALUL
[0:40:30] gamingnscience: bounding ran off while in the airt
[0:40:30] Fred_the_Seagull: lost bounding mid air
[0:40:39] Ponybande: jump boost ran out at the exact wrong time
[0:40:43] idlo09: LUL
[0:40:49] BigFlameWolf: Bounding Strides ended midair, so you lost the fall damage protection while doing a higher jump.

[0:42:03] gamingnscience: I heard Sparklez is going to join in on DO fun today
[0:42:10] vadskamanta: Pretty okay Briana, just long and stressful days at work so a bit mentally exhausted
[0:42:13] name_under_rennovation: ooooo
[0:42:30] thatbrianagirl: i totally get that, i swear we are all just so burnt out lol
[0:42:39] Kush_06: very little loot for swagger playing

[0:43:21] Streamlabs: Please no backseat gaming chat! H appreciates it if you just enjoy the stream instead of telling him how to play & what to do. Thanks & continue to enjoy the stream hbomb94Love
[0:43:43] factorization4: Just wait on the top level for key

[0:44:33] itsthenars: I can smell you... I can smell your fear... /reference
[0:44:33] factorization4: Cuz Wardens tend to gather on the lower levels
[0:44:36] vadskamanta: !do
[0:44:36] Streamlabs: Decked Out is a deck-building, dungeon crawler game created by TangoTek on Hermitcraft. The objective is to build your deck, run vaults and find the artifact the compass is pointing towards, all while fighting sneaking past mobs and not making any sound. You can play it yourself by downloading the Hermitcraft Season 9 world. You can find the download in the description of Xisuma's video where he explains how to set it up: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7QXFbBHCX4&t=1s
[0:44:45] Blommmmie: ty! <3
[0:44:46] samwich1991: PETTHEVADS

[0:45:22] itsthenars: issabat
[0:45:27] PRIPYAT715: i got 41 embers from 2 pay to win and a medium artifact, also had 3 ember seekers.  it is random on the amount you get based on the chances that they give
[0:45:31] Kush_06: thats shortcut to lower level but you take damage
[0:45:31] oatmealcookie02: is a slime

[0:45:43] thatbrianagirl: oops caps lol
[0:45:46] ANTdentarg: How does he replace/heal the Ravagers/Wardens?
[0:46:00] factorization4: The best treasure spots on top level are on the back side
[0:46:06] gamingnscience: @ANTdentarg tey are invulnerable on world download
[0:46:23] thatbrianagirl: @ANTdentarg theyre nametagged so they dont despawn i believe, and they dont get damaged usually
[0:46:24] blu35cr33n: asking to see is asking for too much in this game
[0:46:24] ANTdentarg: @gamingnscience nice
[0:46:42] vadskamanta: No keys for you
[0:46:45] haggleslag: gem is great
[0:46:46] Kush_06: @ANTdentarg all mobs got given the invincibility tag so no need for any of that

[0:56:47] cptcinnabunny: So if we complain at H, he'll listen to us? NODDERS
[0:56:52] factorization4: I think Cub got the exact same spot on his first deadly level 4 success run
[0:56:53] SerenityUwU99: PETTHEVADS
[0:56:55] saleo37: You said twitchin and loaning right?
[0:56:59] vadskamanta: No Bunny, H is immune
[0:57:05] secret_agent4706: Use this command
[0:57:18] samwich1991: @cptcinnabunny Copium
[0:57:20] secret_agent4706: Use this /setblock -545 46 1958 minecraft:glass
[0:57:24] itsthenars: theres a dip in a hallway with ice in it
[0:57:27] Kush_06: basically, trapped modifier now decreases your trap disarm instead of adding more trapped chests
[0:57:31] Kitten_74: ahh, yeah, no dungeon master to fix things :D
[0:57:59] cptcinnabunny: @vadskamanta I hoped we could use his own powers again him but H is too strong for that
[0:58:02] saleo37: What band is this?
[0:58:06] gamingnscience: yeah, the iron bar to glass in his head
[0:58:42] vadskamanta: Yes
[0:58:53] Monday_from_M: Try better, lol :D
[0:58:57] itsthenars: someone made a mess lmao
[0:59:01] BigFlameWolf: You fixed part of it, but had to leave for a meeting or something before finishing.
[0:59:09] Monday_from_M: Veeery cheaty
[0:59:15] factorization4: Yes...
[0:59:16] Kitten_74: Indeed it is
[0:59:23] itsthenars: yeah thats it
[0:59:49] saleo37: Unfollow, immediately :P
[0:59:50] Kush_06: there is a new thing where you can get completion streaks, each streak makes the next vault harder but better loot. you love the streaks if you die/bail
[0:59:57] itsthenars: god look at all this. tango's work is something else
[0:59:58] Monday_from_M: Kill for Pinky
[1:00:27] gamingnscience: there are still secrets on level 4 you have no idea about yet to ‚Äûbeat the game‚Äú
[1:00:53] itsthenars: did that make you jump?
[1:01:02] BigFlameWolf: Level 3 top, it looks like.
[1:01:11] Kush_06: @itsthenars he wont get the reference
[1:01:43] saleo37: @kush_06 why?
[1:01:45] Kitten_74: LOL, I¬¥m always hearing Ethos voice reading "Did that make you jump?"
[1:02:02] icklepxy: yes it did
[1:02:10] Kush_06: @saleo37 less likely he'd have seen the life series
[1:02:12] Cronssi: Etho'd
[1:02:13] saleo37: xD
[1:02:36] factorization4: You actually got +10 embers
[1:02:48] Kush_06: vh update 13: there is a new thing where you can get completion streaks, each streak makes the next vault harder but better loot. you love the streaks if you die/bail
[1:03:13] itsthenars: have yall seen how the life series peeps kept repeating "did that make you jump?" to the point that now their coworkers are repeating it without knowing the origin? its so funny to me
[1:03:36] icklepxy: Greed kills
[1:03:51] avian946: oh there is drip stone missing there
[1:03:54] li0nli: Hi
[1:04:15] itsthenars: tango removed the dripstone cause it kept killing ravagers, p sure
[1:04:20] Streamlabs: Have you followed yet? If not, make sure you hit that follow button to get notified every time H starts streaming! It's very helpful to the channel and we really appreciate it! hbomb94Love
[1:04:29] saleo37: @itsthenars true
[1:04:31] Kush_06: @avian946 not missing, tango removed it coz ravagers kept unaliving
[1:04:32] GrimBirb: @avian946 they were removed in the 3rd phase (i think 3rd?) of Decked Out, because ravagers kept dying to them
[1:04:39] avian946: ahhhh thanks all
[1:05:05] clairebearstare: the dripstone didn't add that much difficulty for the player anyway tbh
[1:05:23] Kush_06: @avian946 it was removed much much later
[1:05:26] saleo37: @clairebearstare it was just for ambiance
[1:05:33] clairebearstare: yeah
[1:05:52] clairebearstare: not worth ravagers constantly dying
[1:06:09] saleo37: @grimbirb in the last phase if I remember right
[1:06:21] Kush_06: @saleo37 yep last phase
[1:06:27] skepoozle: this has me on the edge of my seat
[1:06:27] avian946: suppose i missed that. a lot of hunters cut a lot of level 1 from their vids towards the end
[1:06:46] avian946: not hunters. you get it lol
[1:06:46] samwich1991: hey avian!

[1:12:21] tyto13alba: can't find willie Sadge
[1:13:00] shanesunil: @saleo37 never saw him do that jump, so no

[1:13:46] AmieT9433: he wasn‚Äôt streaming
[1:13:58] clairebearstare: etho vids are just iskall's behind the scenes videos lol
[1:14:06] cptcinnabunny: can you do multiplayer skyvaulting?
[1:14:27] TheGreatestP0tato: Swagger? Did I hear my name?
[1:14:37] tyto13alba: but if you don't stream you don't get to talk to your amazing and awesome chat Sadge
[1:14:52] skepoozle: @kush_06 what's the server?
[1:15:04] DumbSanny: You know etho joining vhsmp
[1:15:10] Kush_06: etho is like level 80 (highest on hermitcraft vh smp) and has made 4 videos. he mentioned that he'll be updating the viewers of his progress but he is more so just playing for funsies
[1:15:11] shanesunil: Fun Fact: Swagger is one of 2 cards Pearl doesn't have at all, the other one being Eyes On The Prize. Good job H
[1:15:27] Kush_06: @skepoozle there is a hermitcraft vh smp ongoing rn
[1:15:47] skepoozle: @kush_06 ouuhh

[1:16:37] vadskamanta: pepoG

[1:17:18] factorization4: Probably just use bounding to escape level 2
[1:17:21] shanesunil: Dang, that's the lowest on Deadly!
[1:17:38] Vex_Vx: Hmm
[1:17:57] shanesunil: And I'm pretty sure that that location is the only one in level 3 to get Bionic Eye for Deadly Difficulty
[1:18:06] Kush_06: so waiting for you to get the slab artefact
[1:18:12] shanesunil: Wow

[1:21:53] vadskamanta: gambaping
[1:21:54] ar_pachauri: Death note falls off after The Big Thing (not saying the spoilers)
[1:21:55] AmieT9433: bungou stray dogs is awesome
[1:21:58] Monday_from_M: Add kills?
[1:22:10] stargirl2086: DinoDance
[1:22:12] SuiteSunrise: @ar_pachauri thank you. i just started watching

[1:22:43] Vex_Vx: no
[1:22:43] Emila_25: Yes
[1:22:44] tiredfoxtf: yea
[1:22:45] NamelessGM: Bingo Stray Dogs is excellent!
[1:22:47] SanAdjiP: nope
[1:22:49] SerenityUwU99: I liked it PrideShrug
[1:22:49] kyosgirl92: I would say so
[1:22:51] B0NES88: Close
[1:22:52] KingPurpleMoon: It's been so long since i watched it so maybe?
[1:22:53] samwich1991: no cleo Sadge
[1:22:56] scotchramune: yes
[1:23:02] Teeldove: No but I don't stray outside of what I know often
[1:23:03] kyosgirl92: I only know my top 2
[1:23:09] kyosgirl92: for sure
[1:23:11] SerenityUwU99: What about AOT?
[1:23:24] ar_pachauri: HunterxHunter ?
[1:23:24] xantilo: FMA:Brotherhood is my #1, that's allI know for sure.
[1:23:28] catybatt: FMAB?
[1:23:38] TheGreatestP0tato: AoT and Gintama are top tier
[1:23:42] actual_supernova: very excited for the next season and for excited i mean im scheduling therapy for mha god NotLikeThis
[1:23:44] cptcinnabunny: code geass is probably one of my top but I don't want to watch it again ever
[1:23:51] saleo37: I dont know death note yet
[1:23:55] kyosgirl92: which did you watch
[1:24:07] kyosgirl92: fma or fmab
[1:24:17] SerenityUwU99: I need a new anime to watch PrideShrug
[1:24:34] SanAdjiP: FMA or FMA Brotherhood??
[1:24:41] ar_pachauri: For me, it's better than Death note atleast
[1:24:42] cptcinnabunny: Do you read manga too H?
[1:25:04] kyosgirl92: so I think the issue with brotherhood is honestly the beginning it‚Äôs too fast to give you time with people watching fma first lets you have attachments
[1:25:07] clairebearstare: library
[1:25:12] samwich1991: library?
[1:25:14] ar_pachauri: If you do, read Onepiece instead of the anime
[1:25:19] TheGreatestP0tato: Do you ever plan to watch Gintama? I definitely recommend it since it is very good comedy with a lot of great characters. It can be a bit slow at times but the peaks go hard. It has consistent high rating so a lot of people really like it
[1:25:31] actual_supernova: imagine spending money on your manga KEKW
[1:25:31] samwich1991: sounds like a skill issue smh
[1:25:33] saleo37: Get used ones.
[1:25:55] actual_supernova: but ngl at cons the manga is really cheap here, in bookstores its like 18 euros per book
[1:25:57] SerenityUwU99: pepoG H going Garage sale'n Saturday
[1:25:59] samwich1991: nova did i say hi to you? (hi if i didnt)
[1:26:12] actual_supernova: at a con its like 8~10 ish
[1:26:19] actual_supernova: yes sam, hi again though
[1:26:48] xantilo: @kyosgirl92 I feel like Brotherhood was made assuming most people watching it had seen the original, and wanted to get to the part where the story split off to focus on that.
[1:26:48] samwich1991: @actual_supernova <3 sorry brain is tired again today lol
[1:27:14] BigFlameWolf: I never saw FMA, just FMA:B, and understood it just fine.
[1:27:53] TheGreatestP0tato: FMA is kinda generic
[1:27:56] factorization4: I feel like the strong treasure cards are giving too much clank
[1:28:21] actual_supernova: @samwich1991 lmaoo its okay <3
[1:28:42] shanesunil: Uh oh, a lot of good treasure cards are being played in level 1 already
[1:28:47] ar_pachauri: Wait for the One Piece remake no ?
[1:28:47] TheGreatestP0tato: Do you ever plan to watch Gintama?
[1:29:34] factorization4: Probably good time to use bounding to bypass dripleaf
[1:29:36] castlebeki: What about Assassination Classroom?
[1:29:40] TheGreatestP0tato: It is very good comedy anime that has around 360 episodes
[1:29:45] B4n4n4zrgood: I have only watched death note
[1:29:57] SanAdjiP: try watch gintama and you gonna love it
[1:30:02] stargirl2086: Fairy Tail is a good anime
[1:30:10] castlebeki: I agree
[1:30:41] kyosgirl92: I mean to be fair I‚Äôm basic and I‚Äôve been watching anime for like 17-18 years basic is fine
[1:30:47] castlebeki: even if it was a bit repetitive i actually felt like it was progressing
[1:30:56] ar_pachauri: Vinland Saga ?
[1:31:01] cptcinnabunny: kimetsu has a good pace in my opinion, at least for an anime LUL
[1:31:10] stargirl2086: Spy x Family
[1:31:25] TheGreatestP0tato: Durarara
[1:31:27] vadskamanta: pepoG Fish willie
[1:31:31] Monday_from_M: #FreeWilliy :D
[1:31:31] castlebeki: fairy tail always follows that same pattern in each season but the characters are good
[1:31:32] tiredfoxtf: Spy x Family is fun
[1:31:40] samwich1991: pepoG do the thing
[1:31:44] Heart123_: yea spy x family is great
[1:31:50] castlebeki: true, but I like it better in manga
[1:31:59] ar_pachauri: Watch Vinland Saga
[1:32:10] SerenityUwU99: Ooo I'm all caught up on SpyxFamily 2020Rivalry
[1:32:16] ar_pachauri: The new season as well ?
[1:32:20] Kush_06: in the new cake vaults, the vault gets better and harder with more cakes consumed , the crake also becomes better and gets more artefact chance with more cakes
[1:32:44] TheGreatestP0tato: Do you know Bocchi the Rock?
[1:32:51] Monday_from_M: So how is everyone who doesn't watch anime doing?
[1:32:55] Monday_from_M: :D
[1:33:03] Kush_06: bounding will be huge rn, you could get a free rusty
[1:33:05] shanesunil: Tread Lightly recycled, pretty good
[1:33:23] starbaker77: Hello
[1:33:28] andydirk88: Don't believe so
[1:33:30] vadskamanta: NOPERS
[1:33:32] castlebeki: you can
[1:33:32] Kush_06: correct, no key in rusty loot
[1:33:33] Monday_from_M: Rusty has no keys
[1:33:37] starbaker77: How has your day been so far H
[1:33:40] xantilo: I've been watching Dr. Stone recently, and now I want a civ building game based on it XD
[1:33:44] SanAdjiP: I dont think rusty give keys
[1:33:47] shanesunil: Can't get a key from Rusty Repair Kit, only drops on the Iron Blocks in the centre of the room
[1:33:55] pbx36: Key could be in rusty room tho
[1:34:05] saleo37: Otherwise he could escape pearlieThink
[1:34:06] castlebeki: there is a treasure drop in rusty room but repairing rusty will not give a key
[1:34:11] ar_pachauri: Have you watched Jujutsu Kaisen ?
[1:34:14] Kush_06: @castlebeki only the treasure dropper over iron blocks in that room can give a key, not rusty itself
[1:34:16] TheGreatestP0tato: Do you know Bocchi the Rock?
