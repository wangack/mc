[3:01:58] Amandroid: !crunch blushPoint
[3:01:58] Snakez_Eu: link just curious but do u watch many films or / movies and have any favourites?
[3:01:58] StreamElements: @Amandroid, Linkzzey has hit the wall 10279 times. linkzzeyFly

[3:02:34] JulsCrafter: Heyyyy
[3:02:44] illu5ve: Little one though is health minus a few things we are trying to tackle
[3:02:48] Normalguy2424: link do you have a mini block that looks like the 100k bit badge? monkaHmm
[3:02:58] Wryfrost: We’re only allowed to park on the odd side of the road on one day and the odd the next bc of snow stuff. Anyway, that was just the prologue
[3:02:59] JulsCrafter: linkzzeyHi
[3:03:24] Snakez_Eu: disney movies are great, but i dont watch many recently but i have been watching so many films and series on netflix, i have too much time
[3:03:49] Amandroid: missing two
[3:03:52] Wryfrost: Step 2 - My car got plowed in. I spent about half an hour trying to dig it out with nothing but a snow scraper. I flagged down a plow guy and he did more good than bad but still not much. I asked a nearby church if I could borrow their snow shovel but they said no. Back to scrapering!
[3:03:58] Normalguy2424: 100k please, bone zone
[3:04:06] JulsCrafter: @linkzzey  how are you
[3:04:13] Snakez_Eu: i havent, ive seen it about but just never watched it, is it any good?
[3:04:19] ginga_ninge: Morning all
[3:04:36] gidney2: whats up link
[3:04:40] Wryfrost: I was eventually able to get my car out by repeatedly shifting between drive and reverse and bashing my head against the wall until I flopped out onto the road like a baby deer being born
[3:04:53] machocowz: alright gang im outta here! everyone have a good day!!
[3:05:04] Amandroid: @machocowz linkzzeyHugx have a good one
[3:05:08] Snakez_Eu: i love the scream movies, watched them a few times but there not that scary
[3:05:22] machocowz: @Amandroid linkzzeyHeart you too
[3:05:24] Wryfrost: Step 3 - I tried to park but underestimated the depth of the snow and got stuck again. Some helpful city people were able to get me out again. I give up, I’m just gonna get a metered spot
[3:05:32] freyacookie: Yes books everywhere!
[3:05:48] freyacookie: Yes please linkzzeyBlush
[3:06:19] gidney2: looking good
[3:06:22] snichard: hello
[3:06:29] Wryfrost: Step 4 - Find a metered spot but it’s snowy. Nah, I ain’t doing this again. I turned around AND GOT STUCK ANYWAY! Some good samaritans tried to help me but we didn’t get very far. Thankfully, some people with the city helped me by pouring sand under my wheels and pushing me. Parking garage time!
[3:06:30] freyacookie: Yeah have some spaces for micro blocks linkzzeyBlush
