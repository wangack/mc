[0:34:09] LzrBeamm: crypto took a big hit from tesla deciding not to use it
[0:34:24] Saisino: Yeah, when you get higher tier machines you can get extras. But in the basic one you won't get the extras
[0:34:27] sankhazo: @xChr1ss Wasn't China banning it?
[0:34:28] madseed15: maybe upgrade macerator
[0:34:30] CreamPillow: you dont get the extra tell the higher tier
[0:34:49] fallenzap: yeah china banned btc for like the 30th time
[0:34:52] LzrBeamm: @sankhazo  they banned it aswell i think but tesla did it just before from what i know ( which isnt alot
[0:35:03] orillion: @s7tungsten never stop mining :) atleast untill electricity is more expensive than buying it outright
[0:35:07] Quivering_Dreams: throw it into a full cauldron first
[0:35:18] Tomthegamer: China is only trying to slow down crypto because they don't have the power capacity to support it.

[0:41:00] MyPPsm0ll: oh i see
[0:41:02] AlphaSchnauzer: sorry
[0:41:08] Saisino: @ItsAdyx You don't have to use the void. It's there if you want to use it
[0:41:12] Soultiger777: foundations are always key
[0:41:21] rayanersss: Nice factory
[0:41:24] BlainL: you mean a spaghetti?
[0:41:31] Kaedonshi: Once you get to LV and EV levels of tech there is an insane amount of demand on computational resources
[0:41:33] 4729_zex: are you intrested in watching new veritasium video?
[0:41:42] Kaedonshi: So to avoid big lag using the void is almost necessary
[0:41:44] thomasausen: have you made plans for your base design yet ?
[0:41:47] fallenzap: are you not playing satisfactory anymore waffle?
[0:42:09] MyPPsm0ll: @Saisino ok but can you only use the void? like after some point? or you have to constantly switch to the overworld to get resources?
[0:42:20] lmarlb0r0: TRADE?
[0:42:30] ninopanda: waffle mah dude
[0:42:43] dontshot: Noob Question, what are some of the major differences between this pack and manufactorio?
[0:42:46] Saisino: @ItsAdyx At one point you can get  "microminers" which are like spaceships or whatever that gets resources for you.
[0:42:46] Rob_Kebab: shortyyyy grill
[0:42:48] Kaedonshi: @ItsAdyx Eventually you can get all the material you need from machines and stuff
[0:42:52] Geegum: did lirik and waffle have a falling out? why dont they ns anymore?

[0:45:06] Pati: I always check the wallet address like 5 times before i send
[0:45:32] W84M3: @Giantwaffle do you use ledger or some kind of hardware wallet?
[0:45:36] Venxuri: perhaps a storage crate above and below machines so you can chuck stuff in and forget PauseChamp
[0:46:06] ninopanda: what kind of flight is it?
[0:46:14] RonnieKoomba: I don't get any of what you're doing
[0:46:18] kiddofdeath: what's the ore getting method in this modpack?
[0:46:51] BlainL: @ninopanda jetpack
[0:47:01] RonnieKoomba: Is that a house or an apartment you live in?
[0:47:06] Saisino: @kiddofdeath first you mine normally, but the ore generation is different so they are in huuuuge veins. After that you can get resources from Deep Mob Learning and MicroMiners
[0:47:06] RonnieKoomba: Very nice
[0:47:18] Quivering_Dreams: it gets much more convoluted once you start making gregtech multiblocks
[0:47:27] kiddofdeath: @Saisino how does he find ore veins. isnt this skyblock?
[0:47:44] Venxuri: perhaps in primitive times they did
[0:47:47] Saisino: It's not a skyblock, there is a "normal" dimension

[1:05:48] Wazix11: Enigmatica 2 is also good
[1:06:03] dontshot: There's an explained video on Netflix about gambling that's really interesting

[1:08:00] Kohta_Sama: Or just don't play slots and end up being richer because you didn't gamble widepeepoHappy

[1:09:33] kiddofdeath: LUL
[1:09:34] Mintaz: I work as a slot attendant, from what i understand slots work based on internal statistics of the machine. Once we had a guy who played highest bets, on older machines that were recently formatted and beacuse of that machine had no statistics of high bets. This guy was winnig big for couple of months because of that
[1:09:35] kingmay1: like yotuubers vs tiktok
[1:09:48] Chronoes: what?
[1:10:04] kiddofdeath: @kingmay1 more likely for a 'tour de twitch'

[1:10:59] tpman24: He'd probably last 10 seconds LUL
[1:11:00] Acheront: 50-0 record
[1:11:04] kingmay1: flloyd is a great boxer, but logan has a lot of size on him tbh
[1:11:08] abomin4ble: yeah mayweather just wears people out though.
[1:11:11] Abs0lute_L: mayweather has massive stamina
[1:11:14] Kohta_Sama: idk anything about boxing, who are logan and floyd LULW
[1:11:17] kingmay1: flloyd hasnt fought someone as big as logan before
[1:11:19] punkgeek: Mayweather is one of the best ever, especially defensively. He's old but it won't matter
[1:11:35] Hunter1701: Imagine Floyd loses somehow, if you bet on logan instant rich
[1:11:51] Chronoes: Didn't Logan or Jake fight another boxer like a few years ago?
[1:11:57] Darkxant: its soon
[1:11:57] herpesman_: @kingmay1 yeah because flloyd is probably gonna fucking kill him or something
[1:12:04] Silver_Skeeter: maybe they pay him to lose
[1:12:05] officialhunterx: june something
[1:12:09] studstur: all about the money. logan has litteral 0 chance
[1:12:11] Kohta_Sama: wait do you mean logan paul? the suicide forest guy? LULW
[1:12:13] Slymph: there was something about the fight counting as a pro match right? so it will affect his match history no?
[1:12:22] Yemtron: it's not logan, it's  jake his brother
[1:12:22] kingmay1: @HugestManAlive not necessarily, logan has been training for multiple years now, i think a lot of people underestimate the level he is at
[1:12:24] Darkxant: sunday june 6th
[1:12:25] shauL__: plenty
[1:12:28] Chronoes: big stacks of BTC
[1:12:44] kingmay1: logan has a longer reach and weighs a lot more and is way taller, this fight is going to be closer than people think

[1:12:58] Kohta_Sama: LULW
[1:12:59] AceBlizzardz: Logan is fighting floyd

[1:13:32] officialhunterx: one punch to the liver and he is down
[1:13:32] Venxuri: Honestly, if I was in Floyds position I wouldn't even risk "my legacy" lol
[1:13:37] Traupick: mayweather has been boxing longer than logan has been alive
[1:13:41] Slymph: @FloydN Are ya winning son? KEKW
[1:13:41] studstur: logan wont land a strike. seriously
[1:13:43] highlandermccloud: Floyd almost killed the guy when he stole his hat this fight will be a joke
[1:14:03] ObsceneTwix: money talks
[1:14:04] Vistor1001: Do you watch UFC?
[1:14:05] officialhunterx: get the easy 70 million
[1:14:06] MrPooter: imagine losing your 50-0 to a youtuber lmao
[1:14:07] midmower: jake just fought ben, he's not fighting in the Mayweather card
[1:14:09] CoolReal: monkaS
[1:14:09] kingmay1: LOL
[1:14:12] botmaniac: yarrrrrr
[1:14:14] dogma802: Floyd's a money guy; if it's easy money, he's doing it
[1:14:20] Desszo: LUL
[1:14:22] Deadfox74: I think you guys think it’s going to be so much more of a blow out than it will be. I doubt there will be a KO
[1:14:30] FixDoll: I'm pretty sure they'll make a show out of it too, even though he has close to zero chance lmao
[1:14:33] midmower: careful what you say waffle trill handed lawsuits to anyone saying saying including h3h3
[1:14:35] kingmay1: im actually going to bet on logan lol logan has been trainig multiple years now on boxing and is bigger, thats my opinion
[1:14:37] That0neGeye: I’m sure someone will stream it on here
[1:14:40] SonOfAttila: better chance of getting a great fight in hockey
[1:14:45] zynithtv: isnt floyd terrible with money? i thought the reason he keeps fighting is cause he actually needs the income
[1:14:45] kiddofdeath: @Giantwaffle here's an an offer. What we get: 'Tour de Twitch, IRL Cycling'. What you get: HELTH
[1:14:52] Silver_Skeeter: @kingmay1 by that logic everyone who is bigger than flloyd can beat him KEKW
[1:14:53] 101101101: bamK bamNana
[1:14:56] shauL__: bro imagine ruining your flawless record for clickbait lmao
[1:14:59] Deadfox74: Paul has been training for years at this point. As much as I dislike the guy, he’s a professional now
[1:15:15] herpesman_: @kingmay1 dude flloyd has been boxing for longer than logan has probably been alive, what are you talking about
[1:15:17] Venxuri: I think you need 2 of those circuits btw
[1:15:21] kingmay1: @Silver_Skeeter not necessarily, flloyds entire career he has fought people that are smaller than him
[1:15:38] psyco_oe: maybe if you add a hot tub
[1:15:59] kingmay1: @HugestManAlive flloyd has fought people smaller than him his whole career, he is severely downplaying logans skill, logan has been training non stop for multiple years now and non stop since his ksi fight
[1:16:05] Minelmonia: I know its early but are we getting Snow Runners today?
[1:16:13] FixDoll: YEP Coal?
[1:16:23] Immow: when you get aluminum the world opens up for ya :d
[1:16:30] Traupick: i just want to say logan paul was born in 95 mayweather debuted in 96 KEKW
[1:16:40] MrPooter: who has logan fought? other than KSI?
[1:16:41] Vistor1001: Is there an angel ring in this pack?
[1:16:41] kingmay1: its really jst the size difference that is giving logan an advantage and his multiple years of training now gives him the boxing skill to compensate
[1:16:48] herpesman_: @kingmay1 alright, if you believe that, thats fine. I'm not saying you're wrong, it's just we both are looking at the situation from different angles.
[1:16:50] Venxuri: oh, I was thinking you wanted a loot fabricator thats why I mentioned you need 2, sorry for bad advice Sadge
[1:17:32] kingmay1: @HugestManAlive i understand your argument, its just i have been watching flloyd for years, all his opponents are either smaller than him or at the exact same measurements, in boxing a reach advantage is so massive
[1:17:43] kiddofdeath: random enchant LUL
[1:17:44] thomasausen: how far are you from a me system ?
[1:17:45] kingmay1: it will be interesting to see

[1:18:25] The_Jumb: The_Jumb subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 45 months! 
[1:18:32] officialhunterx: especially after the first press he is pissed he is gonna destroy logan
[1:18:40] herpesman_: @kingmay1 you definitely seem more knowledgable than me on the topic. All we can do is wait and see how it ends up.
[1:18:41] argosinator: odds are -1600 Mayweather and +700 for paul
[1:18:41] MrPooter: Is gregtech it's own mod? What is it?
[1:18:59] fallenzap: people who say it'll be close are people who don't know who floyd is
[1:19:06] Othixz: you bet 1600 to win 100
[1:19:18] Othixz: or you bet 100 to win 700
[1:19:27] kingmay1: bruh im definetely betting on paul with those odds
[1:19:29] argosinator: implied chance 94% Mayweather 12.5%paul
[1:19:40] ObsceneTwix: some match fixing coming in there

[1:19:56] theonlyglenn: @Giantwaffle Can you explain the sugarcane farm thing ?
[1:19:57] Robohornet: So it makes more sense to bet on paul
[1:20:12] Vistor1001: Waffle, if you trained boxing for 3 years, do you think you would be able to beat Floyd? People genuinely think Logan will win lol.
[1:20:14] metalwrath22222: he bought? dump it
[1:20:19] Venxuri: makes more sense to just not bet here lol
[1:20:23] CantTouchDisNow: remember that rocket :)

[1:20:32] herpesman_: Do you have any non-expert tech modpacks that aren't too grindy you would reccomend?

[1:20:34] Chronoes: ask*
[1:20:53] Othixz: floyd is literally one of the greatest boxers of all time... paul is an ok amateur.
[1:20:53] Vizion_TV: @canttouchdisnow LUL I was there
[1:21:00] Shmelf: thats why they call him floyd money mayweather, hes a 100% chance to win money

[1:21:46] kiddofdeath: LUL
[1:21:49] TheWonderLlama: I wish Ci would do that, then you could all get out when he buys
[1:21:53] Vizion_TV: bet 100 on Paul, and 1600 on floyd so that either way, you come out with the same, or you make 600 lmfap
[1:21:55] dogma802: He bought? Dump eet
[1:22:02] Vizion_TV: Kappa
[1:22:03] dogma802: He's FOMO, pump eet
[1:22:29] Venxuri: @HugestManAlive this modpack also has amazing letsplays and the questbook is very well guided, only issue is burnout, its a long pack
[1:22:57] Vistor1001: Would you ever play Tekkit?
[1:23:48] MrPooter: I played MCEternal, but the comabt sucked so bad. Everything just one shots you no matter the armor
[1:24:06] BrianW_: wasnt tekkit in like 2012
[1:24:26] Venxuri: tekkit was my first pack ever
[1:24:42] BrianW_: building a query for the first time was so cool
[1:24:44] Naboorunab: controversial ?
[1:24:51] zynithtv: make sure to put the torch back on the dirt block so no mobs spawn
[1:25:04] ArbitraryHubris: yeah, it was one of those controversies that actually changed the community for the better
[1:25:08] MrPooter: damn...... Was going to do factorio, but now I really wanna do mc modded.. again

[1:28:35] FixDoll: remember when modpack launchers didn't even redirected you to the official minecraft launcher? I'm amazed my account didn't get stolen for the amount I messed around with that stuff
[1:28:48] kiddofdeath: ooh, ive done E2E. It was pretty fun
[1:29:23] ShionSinX: momorizing recipies when you can search and one click it to import doesnt seem that useful tho?
[1:29:23] TomWithTime: @FixDoll maybe they were afraid of HOIC
[1:29:25] kiddofdeath: built an ME network with 2k channels with p2p. Now i forgot how to do ME. LUL
[1:29:27] SmokyMtnRed: If you like magic-style mods, then go E2E. If you only want Tech, go Omni

[1:32:55] JameserGames: what did he say?
[1:32:57] kiddofdeath: crypto stuff
[1:33:01] JameserGames: i need a translator
[1:33:05] GummiKu: Are we talking crypto or stocks?
[1:33:08] WoofWoofDude: i have an order at 25k, thinking of maybe putting a new one at 15k
[1:33:09] fallenzap: bull market has barely started just wait when inflation hits the markets
[1:33:25] MrPooter: @JameserGames Crypto bye bye 3 yeal
[1:33:27] douira: What is in 3 years?
[1:33:57] Silver_Skeeter: it doubles yes
[1:33:59] hoppersolid: apex?
[1:34:02] GummiKu: last peak was 2018
[1:34:03] BurnedAether: Not time based i thought. I thought it was number of blocks
[1:34:16] zzzDai: They halve the reward to mining blocks
[1:34:23] CiVR: jimmyhSnipe1 jimmyhSnipe2 jimmyhSnipe3
[1:34:26] douira: Oh halvening
[1:34:33] douira: Ah ok
[1:34:35] zzzDai: So either mining capacity dies or the price goes up so mining is still profitable.
[1:34:41] zzzDai: So far the price has gone up from it.
[1:34:42] degosac: nope
[1:34:55] hydronycteris: Did you see the Monaco qualifying?
[1:34:58] levikiller21: we mine i think 6.25
[1:35:00] Silver_Skeeter: this is why we will never witness the last mined block
[1:35:02] GummiKu: How many BTC are left to be mined?
[1:35:19] Ciube11: FED and regulations are coming, not easy to predict future bull trend
[1:35:25] Silver_Skeeter: i think 18mil out of 21 are mined
[1:35:28] FoxeVR: Cheer500 Hey Waffle, question for ya, I just started playing my first Expert modpack on MC, Enigmatica 2 Expert, was hoping to get some insight on how to be more efficient, and how to keep myself motivated to play consistently. Cheers man, hope you have a great day!
[1:35:33] Kohta_Sama: widepeepoHappy eventually it'll require the entire world's stock of silicon to mine a single block
[1:35:39] Kohta_Sama: widepeepoHappy all spent on BTC mining
[1:35:44] douira: Why does it go up when it happens
[1:36:06] Shmelf: It was cool to see ethereum doing its own thing a couple weeks ago!
[1:36:11] RodriCraft93: we are hoping that changes in the next years and we go to more efficient crypto
[1:36:23] Goldps1: POS will be future proof imo
[1:36:32] MrPooter: yeup LUL
[1:36:36] GummiKu: I guess it has to be a revolutionary type of crypto to disconnect completely
[1:36:38] Shmelf: What kind of notepad program was that? @Giantwaffle
[1:36:40] Kipyyyy: @giantwaffle are you invested in stocks?
[1:36:41] Kohta_Sama: why use sublime instead of np++ monkaHmm
[1:36:43] dogma802: Bitcoin would have to no longer be the dominant coin or stabilize
[1:36:43] Lost_Leviathan: Lost_Leviathan subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 54 months! 
[1:36:45] Venxuri: and than get sidetracked completely KEKW
[1:36:49] studstur: all the algos follow bitcoin
[1:37:23] xD_Ghost: i hope so
[1:37:29] MrPooter: Is etereum 2.0 going to be its own coin?
[1:37:42] MrPooter: ahh
[1:37:42] Moobot: Support Waffle by using his Epic creator code: Giantwaffle
[1:37:42] Shmelf: Theres lots of good news thatll come each month, there probably will be a bullmarket again, this fall is all just FUD around Elon and China lol
[1:37:45] FoxeVR: E2E definitely makes it tough to automate but I'll get cracking on it, definitely need to get over the need to make things look pretty atm
[1:37:50] Tomthegamer: It likely will
[1:37:50] Ciube11: Nope, indices and regulations from central banks will intervene
[1:37:54] Ciube11: imo
[1:37:57] JameserGames: July is the UFO meeting
[1:38:08] BigTsabe: what if 1559 is "sell the news"
[1:38:09] Tomthegamer: @Ciube11 Not in the next year at least
[1:38:27] dcel82: question is when is the bottom of the dip so we can buy
[1:38:38] Shmelf: Bank of Canada was talking about how they are worried about stable coins because they cannot use their policies to change the circulation
[1:38:48] Ciube11: @Tomthegamer Why? why not sooner?
[1:39:01] Tomthegamer: @Ciube11 Do you know how slow government is to react?
[1:39:03] levikiller21: Did you ever heard about a website that gives you 12% on stable coins every week
[1:39:12] Tomthegamer: @ShmelfShmelfShmelf That's the idea
[1:39:16] FoxeVR: luckily got an ME system already, and an auto heavy sieve so that seems to be a good step in the right direction
[1:39:38] Ciube11: Sure, but FED is not governement if the talk is about money, they act fast
[1:39:56] Ciube11: no>
[1:39:57] kiddofdeath: @FoxeVR envi tech is the way to go
[1:39:58] Ciube11: ?
[1:40:07] xD_Ghost: XD_Ghost subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months! :)
[1:40:20] Tomthegamer: @Ciube11 They aren't govt but regulating crypto won't help them. In fact I bet crypto helps them
[1:40:30] dabeda1: its called federal reserve but its not goverment
[1:40:31] FoxeVR: @FoxeVR Environmental tech? that mods pricey iirc?
[1:40:31] ArbitraryHubris: the fed is independent banks
[1:40:34] Tomthegamer: @Giantwaffle True. The Federal Reserve is NOT a govt organization
[1:40:35] MrPooter: lol
[1:40:39] dabeda1: it is literally not the goverment
[1:40:44] TheWumbologist101: no the federal reserve is a private corporation
[1:40:46] Ciube11: Federal reserve
[1:40:50] Ciube11: yep
[1:41:04] Tomthegamer: Central Bank = Crypto
[1:41:07] Tomthegamer: essentially
[1:41:11] dasmako: YEP
[1:41:12] Slymph: Pizza just arrived, PogChamp saturday
[1:41:14] Ciube11: If you think that US is in debt with a private bank is crazy
[1:41:26] kiddofdeath: @FoxeVR Ya, if u want automation, envi tech allows u to get good resource gen
[1:41:30] OhMyPog: @Giantwaffle You holding your crypto or sold already?
[1:41:46] kiddofdeath: @FoxeVR so just follow the book to unlock envi tech imo
[1:41:50] FoxeVR: @FoxeVR gotcha, I'll look into it then ^^
[1:41:52] Goldps1: @Tomthegamer centralized =/= decentrailized theyre pretty different
[1:42:09] MrPooter: I just do Index, and look at it once a month lmao
[1:42:14] Tomthegamer: @Goldps1 Those words are certainly different
[1:42:14] Chronoes: cult behaviour leaves you more vulnerable too
[1:42:15] Ciube11: "how the economic machine works" by ray dalio, in 30 minutes is a nice watch to understand it

[1:49:17] NordESA: Btw that new unlockable truck in SnowRunner is probably the best one in the game, absolutely nuts.
[1:49:22] Slymph: That truck you got yesterday, is it possible to just go get it if you havent been to that region yet? susHmm
[1:49:49] Venxuri: give apex a shot it will be fun :)
[1:50:00] Saisino: Honestly do blast furnace stuff first, cause you gonna need it for the ME Drive i believe. And that takes time
[1:50:02] xevos221: Electrolyzer is better
[1:50:36] Saisino: Yeah, i mean that if you go into the AE2 stuff now you're gonna get stuck before you can use it anyway
[1:50:39] xevos221: Pulverizing at MV level is really bad for secondary outputs
[1:50:48] Driatin: Did you consider trying sevtech ages of the sky? @Giantwaffle

[1:51:54] MoellerPoeller: What's the reason for the slab floor?
[1:51:59] kiddofdeath: no certus ore?
[1:52:00] xevos221: Maybe I'm confusing it with soemthing else
[1:52:05] Saisino: Pretty sure you have to mine it first
[1:52:10] Venxuri: finding a vein is the easiest play
[1:52:28] Venxuri: bzzz

[2:02:32] JameserGames: ^
[2:02:33] ArbitraryHubris: I got really sick on the first shot, but barely anything on the second
[2:02:34] dabeda1: getting my vaccine tomorrow, J&J so only 1 shot
[2:02:34] MaverickSpore: I had no symptoms from pfizer part 2 KEKW
[2:02:37] Fellwing94: Noon reaction means their immune system sucks
[2:02:42] JameserGames: one night and done
[2:02:44] Wazix11: I was awake for about 3 hours the day after my first vaccine
[2:02:46] NordESA: I went for a longer walk today and now I am so rekt I cba doing anything KEKW
[2:02:48] Othixz: Did you get symptoms from the first shot @Giantwaffle
[2:02:49] Tech: Just keeping it moving helps the muscle
[2:02:49] BaTu016: Thats actucally bad
[2:02:50] Hardsyboy: No symptoms here, pfizer and first dose
[2:02:56] ArbitraryHubris: @MaverickSpore same here. pfizer #2 was a breeze
[2:03:00] 4729_zex: that vacine is from pfizer?
[2:03:06] Tech: My arm isn't sore at all since I got it in ma right arm
[2:03:09] HentaiRuinedMe: No symptoms could mean you’re immune to covid too lol
[2:03:09] Xev_00: No one told me that D: my arm was hella sore
[2:03:17] ba_nanananananana: you can get it in your thigh, too
[2:03:20] JameserGames: same arm both times?
[2:03:26] ba_nanananananana: doing windmills like Don Quixote? Kappa
[2:03:33] JameserGames: i did left then right
[2:03:34] Arcinae: the fap arm
[2:03:35] Tech: I'm a lefty, but moving it for aiming in CS helps a ton
[2:03:36] MaverickSpore: @Tech I also recommend taking Vitamin C tablets (or equivalent) if you have any, to help your immune systom power through it maveri85Love
[2:03:38] kiddofdeath: both arms :)
[2:03:43] barkaway: you cant do that with both arms? cohhWow
[2:03:48] 4729_zex: where do they inject people without arms?
[2:03:49] RodriCraft93: i always do left arm even tho i do fap with my left hand
[2:03:59] Tech: Straight nerd way to make sure I'm moving it all the time LUL
[2:04:10] DanielBanielDK: At least you’ve gotten the vaccine - we are not even close to my age in Denmark, and I’m 24 lol
[2:04:20] Apakawata: What movie we talking about?
[2:04:41] DKJensen98: @DanielBanielDK I fell you man
[2:04:41] JameserGames: I prefer to Boof my vaccine but it wasn't an option Kappa
[2:04:43] ba_nanananananana: you can get it in any larger muscle really. Thigh works as well.
[2:04:50] DKJensen98: I feel you man
[2:04:57] HentaiRuinedMe: Butt works too
[2:05:13] ba_nanananananana: yah butt works but that sucks for sleeping LUL
[2:05:17] friznog_: sup chat!
[2:05:18] Tech: DanielBanielDK yeah, for sure. Just thankful I have the opportunity to get vaccinated
[2:05:35] Apakawata: @HentaiRuinedMe Gluteal injections are now contraindicated.
[2:05:42] DanielBanielDK: @tech Yea i understand
[2:05:43] JameserGames: is sitting difficult?
[2:05:46] Xev_00: But why though
[2:05:47] kiddofdeath: i got a tetanus shot in my butt when i was smol and now i have a lump
[2:05:48] TarMonA: arm is easyer to get at
[2:05:54] Samelie: i see people talking vaccine and here I am in germany probably not having the chance to make even an appointment for one in the next months qq
[2:06:03] friznog_: i get my first on Tuesday PogChamp
[2:06:07] MrArrig: A good tip for this modpack is to always make 1.5-2 times as much components than you need.  You always need more
[2:06:08] Xev_00: Imagine having to bend over and drop your trousers at the vaccine site LUL
[2:06:15] ba_nanananananana: Samelie I'm fully vaccinated in Germany. It's coming to everyone soon
[2:06:18] JameserGames: yes, glutious muscle is a valid option
[2:06:20] Tech: it depends on the shot you are getting
[2:06:22] Apakawata: If you're getting an IM injection it's the shoulder, hip, or thigh now.
[2:06:26] Samelie: @ba_nanananananana where you living
[2:06:27] Ape_lord: getting my first shot this afternoon
[2:06:34] ba_nanananananana: Samelie BaWü
[2:06:36] MrPooter: LULW
[2:06:41] DrHax_: did they use a blowgun to vaccinate you? KEKW
[2:06:41] JameserGames: LUL
[2:06:42] Xev_00: KEKW
[2:06:44] kiddofdeath: put your butt out the window
[2:06:48] xhaine_: sounds like a lot of car idling
[2:06:50] Hardsyboy: America has drive through everything lol
[2:06:57] BaTu016: Back when i was little my ass was sliced by a glass KEKW
[2:06:57] Apakawata: gluteal IM injections are now not considered best practice.
[2:07:05] kennycraig: YEP
[2:07:08] JameserGames: yup
[2:07:08] Samelie: @ba_nanananananana :O me too q.q
[2:07:08] HentaiRuinedMe: Reminds me of when ppl would do drive by moonings back in the day lol
[2:07:14] Tech: The decision of where it goes is dependent on how many mLs the dose is
[2:07:17] BroCreed1: I just got a tampon commercial. That was interesting
[2:07:19] Tech: IIRC
[2:07:20] DanielBanielDK: ‘Murica 😎
[2:07:32] MrPooter: same lmao
[2:07:36] JameserGames: Maderna, no side effects, switched arms between shots
[2:07:40] ba_nanananananana: Samelie I mean, are you priority 3? I am 2 so got my first shot weeks ago
[2:08:03] fallenzap: atleast you got a bandaid
[2:08:07] Mapleton: Needles monkaS
[2:08:15] Mapleton: came back at a bad time
[2:08:19] Surge43: I just had a normal needle
[2:08:22] Apakawata: It all depends upon what they're buying to draw it up in.
[2:08:24] MrPooter: I wanna bring my own bandaid
[2:08:26] MrPooter: dora
[2:08:38] forgivelol: @Surge43 tell me about it MONKERS
[2:08:41] RyanKile: 🩹
[2:08:48] kiddofdeath: i didnt get bandaid and had normal needle
[2:08:50] Apakawata: The factory sends out the vaccine in vials, not pre-filled syringes.
[2:08:59] JameserGames: dogecoin bandaid is where it's at
[2:09:02] Tech: I'm still bummed they didn't microchip me
[2:09:03] MaverickSpore: my place had one of those bandaids that you put on BEFORE getting the shot... the needles goes through the center of the bandaid PogChamp it was so easy to take off later!
[2:09:12] kiddofdeath: @Tech how do u know monkaS
[2:09:15] Tech: Like let me store my private keys in my arm for my wallet
[2:09:22] BurnedAether: I don't have 5g is how i know pepeHands
[2:09:40] Mapleton: You ever eaten at McDonalds? you got microchips in you pepeLaugh
[2:09:42] MrPooter: anyone else get in a rut where they dont really play anything?
[2:09:45] Tech: Yeah LUL
[2:09:45] StOrMy1100: Use the magnet method to find out I guess
[2:09:50] Samelie: @ba_nanananananana idk, i dont think im a priority at all, my mother works for the goverment and she and still hasnt got a date
[2:09:52] Tomthegamer: @Tech That was the idea for places in Africa....but medical records instead of wallet
[2:09:53] paulpkpk: RFiD injection
[2:09:57] Tech: I've wanted to do it for a few different things
[2:10:00] kiddofdeath: all that for 1 charged certus quartz
[2:10:00] Mapleton: @MrPooter yeah, when i was working full time
[2:10:17] Tech: @Tomthegamer Medical Records on body is something I will heavily advocate for anyday.

[2:10:35] Surge43: My dog has one.
[2:10:37] Tech: Dealing with people not carrying relevant medical info drove me nuts in fire/rescue
[2:10:39] JameserGames: inject it yourself?
[2:10:41] ba_nanananananana: Samelie if you want to help your mom get an appointment I can walk you through the process via pm
[2:10:43] IamWambo_: whats and rf id?
[2:10:43] MrPooter: I'd do it, fook it
[2:10:49] HentaiRuinedMe: The future is here
[2:10:51] Lazermage23: I have one of those for my puppers and it was a self kit. Super easy
[2:10:54] kiddofdeath: @Tomthegamer the movement against that would be bigger than the antivax unfortunately
[2:10:58] merscever: why not just have an RFID bracelet or ring....
[2:11:00] Apakawata: A friend also self-implanted a magnet between his thumb and index so he could feel live wires through the electromagnetic field.
[2:11:05] JameserGames: possible infections, putting it in the wrong place
[2:11:05] Valentin_PV: you know what's also useful? a flash drive
[2:11:09] dogma802: Radio Frequency ID
[2:11:09] BIRDFRUIT: Heroin YEP
[2:11:10] Tomthegamer: @kiddofdeath Not in Africa where people don't have safe storage for documents
[2:11:11] dabeda1: Radio Frequency ID
[2:11:12] Mapleton: @MrPooter I just had to find the one game to get me back into the hobby, rdr2 was that game for me
[2:11:14] Tech: Yeah
[2:11:21] merscever: NGC
[2:11:23] JameserGames: so many things can go wrong during the implant process if done slopily
[2:11:24] Antillarea: nfc
[2:11:24] merscever: NFC
[2:11:26] Tomthegamer: NFC
[2:11:28] i_W4tCH_i: NFC
[2:11:28] Tech: It's the same idea as transponders for toll roads
[2:11:29] dogma802: NFC
[2:11:32] Antillarea: near field communication
[2:11:35] Tech: Only one side needs to be powered
[2:11:36] MrPooter: @Mapleton yeah bro, I feel like I just have to start playing something and stop thinking about what Im going to play lmao
[2:11:40] officialzip: which is a type of rfid
[2:11:42] Allmostdone: you could always inject yourself with bull sperm
[2:11:45] dabeda1: NFC yup
[2:11:49] Tomthegamer: A lot of car keys use NFC too
[2:11:50] Apparentthreat: People insert magnets into their hands and other places pretty commonly
[2:11:51] DaGMC: there was a offer in germany from a bank where you could get the keys of the house implanted in your finger/hand
[2:11:53] MrWizard1974: Radio-frequency identification uses electromagnetic fields to automatically identify and track tags attached to objects
[2:12:09] JameserGames: does an MRI pull it out?
[2:12:12] GummiKu: basically just an ID
[2:12:13] Samelie: @ba_nanananananana its okay, its probably more time based, since she isnt in the age group 60+ or in a field that is prioritised or at risk
[2:12:18] Jypy93: can you use pay pass and stuff with rfid !?
[2:12:32] The_Holas: isnt RFID on expensive bottles in shops for example or are those something different ...
[2:12:42] DaGMC: it is
[2:12:46] MrPooter: bro, why doesnt twitch highlight replies.. theyre so easy to miss
[2:12:49] ba_nanananananana: Samelie is she in priority 3? Otherwise she'll have to wait for about mid June like everyone else. Some gov workers are priority 3 or even 2
[2:12:49] Jypy93: Ah, but it would be possible, that's sweet
[2:12:51] Mapleton: @Giantwaffle I'm excited for Artificial body parts to become more available. I want two hearts pepeLaugh
[2:12:53] HentaiRuinedMe: You can cut if out with a knife
[2:12:54] Tomthegamer: @The_Holas Similar concept
[2:13:12] DaGMC: its just printed circuit/antenna + microprcocessors/controller
[2:13:16] Samelie: she isnt 3 so thats probably the reason
[2:13:33] Jypy93: @Mapleton LUL
[2:13:41] ba_nanananananana: Samelie gotcha... well, open for everyone is about 3 weeks away so just hold out :)
[2:13:49] Apakawata: Just imagine the future where joining a corp would require an RFID implantation.
[2:13:50] Tech: I didn't think an MRI affected the rfid implants
[2:14:07] kiddofdeath: anythign that can be magnetized is affected
[2:14:17] Tech: Affect as in it will rip it out
[2:14:18] Apakawata: @Tech depends if the materials are magnetic in nature.
[2:14:22] Allmostdone: make sure you bring in you own oxygen bottle to that MRI @Tech
[2:14:28] DaGMC: I guess military would require neural link or more sophisticated solution
[2:14:30] Tech: Or else dogs would have never gotten them implanted for medical records

[2:14:45] Mapleton: A conductor?
[2:14:48] cheppard: eddys
[2:14:52] kiddofdeath: usually implants are made to not be affected by devices such as MRI
[2:14:56] ba_nanananananana: non-magnetic wires can still heat up and cause burns in MRI
[2:15:00] kiddofdeath: idk about the rfid
[2:15:03] J0niie: Induction?
[2:15:05] cheppard: eddy currents
[2:15:07] DaGMC: magnet down the pipe
[2:15:07] SonofaPancak: Eddy current
[2:15:09] randyf69: ^^ Eddy Currents - induced magnetic fields.
[2:15:17] isot0nic: hi @chat & @Giantwaffle
[2:15:21] Jugohuber: when i got an mri like 3 years ago, my gown had an rfid chip in to store patient data and that was not a problem

[2:15:32] KekPek_: NOTED
[2:15:35] DaGMC: magnets slows down
[2:15:39] The_SilentGuardian: it generates a current which generates a magnetic field which interferes with the magnet i believe
[2:15:53] kiddofdeath: oh, i've seen this
[2:16:02] MrPooter: I wanna see insideee
[2:16:03] paulpkpk: PogChamp
[2:16:05] Saisino: From this swedish site that FDA has made animal studies and that the RFID chips are supposed to be safe for MRI
[2:16:08] Slymph: Magic PogChamp
[2:16:15] Jugohuber: thats not 4 seconds
[2:16:20] DaGMC: the magnetic fields slows down the magnet

[2:16:59] Slymph: Time is up, back to minecraft mr strimmer monkaGun
[2:17:01] cheppard: you can do it at home whit a roll of aluminium foil and a magnet
[2:17:05] DaGMC: you should watch a video about superconductors
[2:17:06] kiddofdeath: @Slymph LUL
[2:17:11] Tech: I mean I'm pretty experienced in things lasting 4 seconds
[2:17:12] Fizintine: Hey :)
[2:17:16] Tech: and there is now way that was KappaHD
[2:17:16] Jypy93: Man I love your channel, it's always interesting <3
[2:17:36] kiddofdeath: Kappa
[2:17:37] Mapleton: It's important to know how to make a basic electrical generator incase you ever get transported back in time waffleThink
[2:17:49] Allmostdone: physic class 202. did the same experiment
[2:18:12] Tiggaboo: they released an F1 pack for Rocket League
[2:18:40] Apakawata: Cooking without spices other than what is local.

[2:18:49] Venxuri: kings were pretty insane, you make something bad you die 4Head
[2:18:49] ba_nanananananana: medicine and chemistry is the most valuable skill for time travel
[2:18:57] Goodmangammering: if you dont want to die quickly knowing how to make basic antibiotics will be more important than anything in that scenario
[2:19:03] Gnepcoyi: you'd probably get killed for your accent
[2:19:11] kiddofdeath: invent pineapple pizza Kappa
[2:19:17] S1rRogue: Depending on how far back you go, understanding simple mechanisms and kinetic energy machinery is more inportant.
[2:19:20] Samelie: @Giantwaffle you wouldnt understand the language depending on how far back you go. And people werent fond of strangely dressed outsiders
[2:19:20] Patchi_: a gun with unlimited ammo is most important
[2:19:31] Apakawata: @ba_nanananananana until the local chiurgeon doesn't like you and labels you a witch.
[2:19:37] Tech: I mean I don't think there is one single valuable skill, since all of our specialties rely on someone elses specialties these days.
[2:19:46] HentaiRuinedMe: They would think you are some magical witch and burn you.
[2:19:50] DaGMC: doesn't it apply to all languages
[2:19:53] Mapleton: "i can make some amazing steak using black pepper, thyme and basil"  "What the fuck is any of that and peasants only eat rats" LUL
[2:19:58] dabeda1: Dr.Stone who

[2:20:08] Pokesaurus_rex: Like Dracula's Wife
[2:20:13] MrDocth: eating something totally new can be scary for some ppl
[2:20:20] Goldps1: if ppl thought you were a witch or wizard probably
[2:20:21] Theubuntupenguin: sugar cane
[2:20:25] DaGMC: from plants
[2:20:27] Tech: Not without having the technology to transport it world wide
[2:20:27] zetadezorro_: how "hard" is this modpack? like what other modpack would you compare it tom
[2:20:30] zetadezorro_: ?
[2:20:30] Mapleton: I literally make sugar from trees LUL
[2:20:32] Samelie: there was a guy doing food comparisons, and the peasant food was super healthy
[2:20:38] S1rRogue: Honey is usually a decent substitute
[2:20:38] Apakawata: Think about that with our society as a whole today with the education of the past.
[2:20:40] Hobolito90: sugarbeet is a good bet
[2:20:40] Samelie: fresh fish and herbs and stuff
[2:20:42] DaGMC: its used even today
[2:20:43] Xev_00: Honestly the most important skill if you went back in time would be bullshiting LUL
[2:20:43] S1rRogue: as is most fruit based sugars.
[2:20:43] MrArrig: Cook down and caramelize onions
[2:20:44] Battokage: sure the church killed hunderts that tryed to obtain knowledge
[2:20:46] DaGMC: just locally
[2:20:51] Tech: Or power to increase the efficiency of the process.
[2:20:57] Ultranot20000: only grows near water too
[2:20:58] LordOfthePingu: just invent burger and french fries
[2:21:02] PxlSauce: The recipe for Porcelain will get you stupidly rich. since before someone in germany discovered it it needed to be importet from china
[2:21:03] The_Holas: isnt sugar made from beets too?
[2:21:04] DaGMC: once processed you can take it longer distances
[2:21:17] theonlyglenn: how do you get your sugarcane to grow so fast?
[2:21:21] Tech: Or decent fuel sources that have a high power/mass ratio
[2:21:29] Surf_x: sugar beets ya
[2:21:33] Tech: It's crazy to think how dependent we are on everyone else
[2:21:38] Mapleton: @theonlyglenn human fertilizer :)
[2:22:01] Battokage: steam engines
[2:22:02] Mapleton: Basic First aid knowledge would be godly

[2:22:10] Yudrohn: just a few years, for crypto Kappa
[2:22:13] FlammAlpha: egyptian machinists were already pretty insane with their accuracy
[2:22:14] kiddofdeath: @Tech Have you heard about "I, Pencil"
[2:22:16] Apakawata: We have also lost a lot of blacksmithing techniques. They would look at you as an uneducated imposter.
[2:22:28] Tech: Basic first aid relies on someone having the needed tools to create what we need
[2:22:34] Mapleton: i would know not to drain half a persons blood for a cough LUL
[2:22:37] BurnedAether: None of us are doctor stone

[2:23:00] Hardsyboy: @Mapleton you know know that cause of modern day logic
[2:23:06] Tech: I mean I feel like the biggest impact we would all have, would be spending our life documenting what we know
[2:23:08] PxlSauce: the recipe for Porcelain will get you rich
[2:23:09] Samelie: You would probably die of starvation or other natural causes before reaching a city
[2:23:10] n8level: well if I had a chemistry and physics book in my car's trunk ... SeriousSloth
[2:23:11] FlammAlpha: alec steele just make everything damaskus KEKW

[2:23:27] xevos221: I know how to make acetominophine from basic chemicals so that would probably make me popular
[2:23:30] Kimera89: design and build sail boats
[2:23:31] xhaine_: propeganda at it's finest
[2:23:34] Mr_Perril: I would travel back in time with a computer and let em reverse engineer it
[2:23:36] Saisino: Man if i went back 500 years I would be so good at leadership communication theories. They would be so impressed in me
[2:23:37] Surf_x: US military base ya
[2:23:39] The_Holas: they just blame it on someone KEKW
[2:23:41] Doomwyte: @xevos221 or murdered for being a witch
[2:23:53] rct33: Spanish flu came from NA, thanks Obama
[2:23:54] xevos221: @Doomwyte sounds like a win/win to me
[2:23:56] RodriCraft93: spanish flu cause itts where it hit hard and kill most people
[2:23:57] Tech: It was from censorship, right?
[2:24:07] Tech: They didn't want people worried about something in the US mid war
[2:24:08] mimicl: they added a hit tub category
[2:24:12] mimicl: hot
[2:24:20] Xev_00: Reminds me of that anime where the dude goes back in time and convinces people his phone holds an army LUL
[2:24:21] Allmostdone: Kansas flu. Damn you Kansas
[2:24:23] BrainGushersTV: would this pack be too complicated for someone who never really messes with tech in MC?
[2:24:25] n8level: 500 years ago, like, when they still used dialup? Kappa
[2:24:33] Surf_x: @Tech correct
[2:24:39] randyf69: WWI propaganda
[2:24:40] Tech: Because the first time americans heard about it was from reporting on spain
[2:24:43] Mapleton: @n8level Before they had wireless toasters
[2:24:47] Okkelsskov: @Giantwaffle got its name from Spain because they weren't involved in world war 1 and therefore had greater freedom to write about the flu
[2:24:50] RodriCraft93: yes
[2:24:53] Tech: Since they couldn't report on the USA status of the disease
[2:25:10] Tech: Yeah, crazy
[2:25:22] Robohornet: The US, UK and Germany kept their flu deaths under wraps because of the war so newspapers reported on the deaths in neutral Spain
[2:25:23] richie385: go back to world war 1\2 and tell them what's going to happen
[2:25:24] Othixz: It was because none of the other countries in WW1 wanted the other side to know they were having an epidemic
[2:25:27] Saisino: @brainstew0 Not the best place to start, no
[2:25:32] n8level: history through an imperfect lens
[2:25:45] CancerSurvivorFTW: they brought it home from Spain. Learn your history
[2:25:51] yellowspy: It’s somebody’s fault always, but not the Americans LUL
[2:25:51] Tech: I'm glad I remember random stuff that doesn't matter, but can't for the life of me remember half the libraries I use on the daily in go
[2:25:57] xevos221: You need lots of steel/dark steel/etc., my advice after playing this is make a separate machine for the things you use the most
[2:26:04] xhaine_: They are trying the same thing today by calling it the chinese flu, works less with the information age, but still works on some
[2:26:10] henriktheone: Did you watch quali today?
[2:26:20] Tech: wrought iron just has a really low carbon content
[2:26:20] Apakawata: Is this the entirety of Waffle's space or is there other dimensions I haven't seen?
[2:26:23] S1rRogue: Wrought iron is made in a bloomery, it is in fact melted.
[2:26:37] Mapleton: wrought iron means "worked iron"
[2:26:40] Robohornet: @xhaine_ More accurate this time around though
[2:27:01] Tech: wrought has less than like 1% carbon, and regular iron is what, 2-5?
[2:27:01] Moobot: You can find Waffle's Youtube channel here - https://youtube.com/giantwaffle
[2:27:04] Tech: Than we get steel
[2:27:07] CocoScruff: Meaty Erotic WeirdChamp
[2:27:22] n8level: star steel
[2:27:29] Mapleton: Damascus steal PepeHands
[2:27:47] Battokage: what was pig iron again ?
[2:27:47] MoopCo: obsidian glass is a lot better at cutting flesh than iron, you didnt need metal weapons until there was metal armor
[2:27:52] Tech: We couldn't pump out steel until like 100 years ago
[2:27:53] srgp2015: irl ore processing is crazy
[2:27:55] FroZenThai: I believe meteoric iron is pretty impure, so you can't really just make something big with it without falling apart
[2:28:17] DakotaFoxes: waffleHeart waffleHeart waffleHeart waffleHeart waffleHeart waffleHeart
[2:28:21] Samelie: the problem was the heat required to melt and manipulate the metal without also melting your tools^^
[2:28:22] KavokCollective: Don't we have an iron core?
[2:28:25] n8level: @MoopCo modern ceramic knives are pretty amazing as well
[2:28:27] kiddofdeath: just burn wood with charcoal to get charcoal Kappa
[2:28:28] MoopCo: nicekl
[2:28:29] DaGMC: iron is in the core
[2:28:33] fallenzap: bedrock
[2:28:43] Allmostdone: nope it s water
[2:28:43] Tech: aluminum?
[2:28:43] ttv_soccerboy_twich: Wait theres adds
[2:28:47] Tech: yeah
[2:28:50] Tech: Makes sense tbh
[2:28:53] DaGMC: its lighter
[2:28:53] IamWambo_: aluminium
[2:28:58] ttv_soccerboy_twich: When
[2:28:59] ItsNodens: You mean  aluminium?
[2:28:59] Allmostdone: the core is water
[2:29:05] CorSPACE: but aluminum isnt a solid ore
[2:29:09] Goodmangammering: iirc soil has a bit of aluminum in it
[2:29:10] dabeda1: imagine thinking the earth is not hollow Kappa
[2:29:10] ttv_soccerboy_twich: OhMyDog
[2:29:12] randyf69: All as Aluminum Oxide, which is expensive to smelt.
[2:29:13] Minelmonia: density?
[2:29:14] KekPek_: earth is flat KKona
[2:29:17] Pokesaurus_rex: Its only called "Rare" because they are not found in big veins
[2:29:17] Apakawata: You mean Alu-min-ium?
[2:29:32] Mapleton: Wood is more rare than iron in the solar system 5Head
[2:29:35] DaGMC: have you seen spiders growing from alumunium?
[2:29:36] CantTouchDisNow: because they dont care about just sifting through the whole earth they got
[2:29:39] Allmostdone: yep just like bitcoin
[2:29:40] StrangeStuff: Are they not found in other parts of the world?
[2:29:50] Tomthegamer: Yeah....that's also why they collect used phones and electronics
[2:29:51] kiddofdeath: @StrangeStuff they are
[2:29:55] Pokesaurus_rex: @Giantwaffle North Korea has a big supply of Rare Earth metals too but they cant access them cause they dont have the technology
[2:30:16] MoopCo: i give it 20 years before the average chinese person earns more than the average american
[2:30:18] Tomthegamer: China has huge operations in Africa too
[2:30:34] NE0POD: Omg Indiana jones new movie 1960s space race!
[2:30:37] Surf_x: I trade rare earth miners US has a big one
[2:30:43] Minelmonia: its due to laws, China doesnt care
[2:30:49] Battokage: there other areas too but to expensive to expliot
[2:30:50] TheWumbologist101: China has negotiated mineral rights to entire countries like Australia
[2:31:00] paulpkpk: Just pollute other planet 4Head
[2:31:03] Pokesaurus_rex: @Surf_x  We also have tons of Oil but due to environmental impact we dont do it as much
[2:31:06] Xev_00: Time to start polluting the moon PogChamp
[2:31:07] Unrealx2: MOON WARZ
[2:31:07] kiddofdeath: catJAM
[2:31:08] n8level: refining rare earth metals also produces some serious toxic waste, hard to engineer around
[2:31:13] Tech: I mean just mine the dark side of the moon
[2:31:19] DaGMC: with all the EV stuff on the horizon it would be required
[2:31:20] Tech: Than we can't see it 4Head
[2:31:21] Kinteshi: Kinteshi subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 2 months, currently on a 2 month streak! Good Evening
[2:31:21] Mapleton: Just send all our pollution to Detroit peepoHmm
[2:31:29] forgivelol: @Tech LUL
[2:31:38] The_SilentGuardian: moon based machinery probably requires oxygen? otherwise renewable electricity would be earthbound solution
[2:31:43] MoopCo: whats even crazier, is that our known oil reserves have like 40 years left, if we fnid no more, than thats no more plastics or fuel as we know them
[2:31:44] Surf_x: @Pokesaurus_rex US is an oil exporter now hell ya you guys do alot now
[2:31:45] Robohornet: We have plenty of rare earth deposits in the US but our environmental laws make it very expensive and difficult to produce them @Giantwaffle
[2:31:46] wasteless4: i thought the moon was just cheese
[2:31:47] paulpkpk: 5Head
[2:31:51] Vistor1001: Isn’t the moon made of cheese tho?
[2:31:56] TheWonderLlama: Once we can bring them back from the asteroid belt we will be set, there are some asteroids that are believed to have more rare and precious metals than we have mined in all of human history
[2:32:06] n8level: @MoopCo plant based plastics are a thing
[2:32:14] Pokesaurus_rex: @Surf_x  We have even more in places like Alaska current i think most of our Oil comes from Texas lol
[2:32:15] LaroStar007: LaroStar007 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 9 months! Sup Waffu? Hope you're doin well!
[2:32:18] Mapleton: @Vistor1001 Yeah but it's American cheese FeelsWeirdMan
[2:32:33] kiddofdeath: I feel like finding a very cost effecitve method to send stuff out of earth's atmosphere and orbit will help massively
[2:32:42] aman36000: Trillions*
[2:32:46] kiddofdeath: in regards to pollution handling
[2:33:06] DaGMC: then we get the belters Kappa
[2:33:10] Surf_x: rare earth minerals arnt even rare but try opening up a mine these days LUL
[2:33:17] MoopCo: cobalt
[2:33:22] kiddofdeath: there's lot of ice
[2:33:24] Samelie: first we gotta have a way more advanced space capabillity xD
[2:33:41] DaGMC: Gold is just made in supernovae
[2:33:51] Mapleton: @DaGMC beltalowda peepoH
[2:33:56] rct33: catalytic converter
[2:33:59] rct33: oh
[2:34:04] AceyDu_: exaustion
[2:34:07] taraxus: Exhaust
[2:34:20] xevos221: It allows for full combustion of hydrocarbons, so far less carbon monoxide
[2:34:24] ItsOnMax: people steal them now because of it
[2:34:48] HentaiRuinedMe: Oh yeah that’s why ppl keep stealing catalytic converters
[2:34:51] metalwrath22222: monkaS
[2:34:55] Surf_x: you talking mu wheel house i trade Canadian junior miners , all the metals
[2:34:56] taraxus: Primarily nitrous oxides, right?
[2:35:11] DaGMC: @Mapleton would be nice to be then, but w/e the political issues waffleHeart

[2:35:17] Mapleton: Bring a pickaxe?
[2:35:20] TheWonderLlama: 16 Psyche would be worth $700 quintillion. Which would be $93 billion per person
[2:35:23] metalwrath22222: Terraria molten pickaxe
[2:35:36] BoskoSlo123: wooden pickaxe
[2:35:39] TheWumbologist101: Fed pays out 1/3 of a trillion in repo loans on a daily basis right now
[2:35:41] Mapleton: @DaGMC I would rather be a new world rancher
[2:35:43] Gnepcoyi: yea it's so far off, all the energy required to get there and back
[2:35:48] Pokesaurus_rex: @TheWonderLlama But the economies for those commodities would instantly crash
[2:35:50] Gnepcoyi: but at some point
[2:35:59] n8level: John Ringo wrote a fictional book series where we spun up nickle iron asteroids, used giant lasers from earth to heat them up and turning them into giant solar mirrors, which were then used to make more mirrors which greatly accelerated asteroid utilization
[2:36:02] Xev_00: CiGrip Clap
[2:36:03] Minelmonia: You know what its nuts? Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos are more $$ than some of those asteroids @Giantwaffle
[2:36:10] The_SilentGuardian: i feel the difficulty is landing tonnes of material on Earth without burning up on re-entry
[2:36:16] kry0_: just mine mars
[2:36:21] DaGMC: Moon would be sufficient
[2:36:21] Pokesaurus_rex: @TheWonderLlama Have you ever seen that episode of Spongebob with the Hat? The "He was number 1 episode" its like that
[2:36:24] srgp2015: probably
[2:36:26] RodriCraft93: not surface mine
[2:36:31] Mapleton: Blow it up and pick at the pieces
[2:36:36] DaGMC: HE3 and other stuff
[2:36:49] RodriCraft93: and he is just doing nothing with it
[2:36:52] Tech: wouldn't say make, but his wealth increased a ton
[2:37:01] Pokesaurus_rex: Its all stock gain right not liquid cash
[2:37:03] Mapleton: low yield so it stays in it's own gravity
[2:37:12] fallenzap: enclose the asteroid then blow it up
[2:37:20] LordOfthePingu: can we build around asteroide?
[2:37:24] Meat_Skirts: the Expanse did it that way. space net around small asteriod and then blow it up from the inside. tow the net back @Giantwaffle
[2:37:30] wargig42: Robots that hilariously enough need rare earth metals lol
[2:37:40] yellowspy: Ksp?
[2:37:42] kiddofdeath: @LordOfthePingu it moving fast
[2:37:42] Surf_x: most of the palladium and platinum come out of South Africa and Russia thus the problem
[2:37:44] n8level: the future of space mining is .. far out
[2:37:45] RateMyFox: Crash asteroid into ocean lol
[2:37:45] TheWumbologist101: Yea but that’s not money they actually make it’s estimated value or the company which would plummet if they actually sold
[2:37:50] TheWonderLlama: Just crash it into earth and mine it here Kappa
[2:37:52] simonmccullis: Build an artificial moon from the worlds trash to attract them with gravity
[2:38:03] LordOfthePingu: @kiddofdeath yeah we need to stop them first
[2:38:05] DatoPotatoDato: would it even be able to be easily processed in space?
[2:38:06] Gnepcoyi: Probably as mass & volume effective as possible
[2:38:08] That0neGeye: Would anything happen to earth if we start adding mass to the planet? @giantwaffle
[2:38:10] RodriCraft93: yes so you leave impurities on space and not bring them home
[2:38:10] DaGMC: build the death star in orbit
[2:38:13] Mapleton: Anyone else play "shattered horizons" where a mining accident blows up the moon?
[2:38:14] KekMannetje: would it even go back to earth?
[2:38:16] ArbitraryHubris: shoot it at russiaa
[2:38:17] Apakawata: Find a giant asteroid in the belt and turn that into a refinery center.
[2:38:18] Askjong: Have you seen this? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8XvQNt26KI
[2:38:44] TheWumbologist101: What if you could develop a method for the re-entry heat to process it
[2:38:52] kiddofdeath: @LordOfthePingu gravitational pulls make it so its hard to stop it unless we constantly maintain its position using thrusts i think.
[2:39:00] DaGMC: no moon is going away from earth
[2:39:01] itzSimondr98: pepeLaugh
[2:39:02] The_SilentGuardian: @That0neGeye earth grows in mass anyway from all the space dust and asteroids constantly landing on it
[2:39:08] Apakawata: Day 4, still in "The beginning" tab.
[2:39:43] Surf_x: some Canadian copper miners are up 10x in a years , copper shortage coming with the world going green
[2:39:45] Vistor1001: @kiddofdeath Interstellar style?
[2:39:48] LordOfthePingu: @kiddofdeath you're probably right idk about space stuff :/
[2:39:52] Surf_x: in a year*
[2:40:03] kiddofdeath: @Vistor1001 idk, just theorizing
[2:40:11] Apakawata: I spent like 5 months on Ozone and I'm craving a nice long modpack.
[2:40:17] Tech: man, I gotta learn blender
[2:40:17] kiddofdeath: @LordOfthePingu just theorizing here
[2:40:18] Solacaria: i dont mind difficult and grindy packs, as long as you get a decent storage early on. hate having 40 double chests :(
[2:40:33] BossHog6295: Hi :)
[2:40:40] weightmaker: is chests or ironchests in the pack?
[2:40:43] RyanKile: i didnt even notice you were playing a game

[2:42:54] Minelmonia: is that the donut YOU made?
[2:42:57] axxid: A donut is nice but what about a giant waffle? Kappa
[2:42:58] Tech: I just want to be competent enough to make stuff to use for websites
[2:43:00] DatoPotatoDato: you should 3D print a donut @Giantwaffle
[2:43:00] Xev_00: Stop, this is making me want a doughnut NotLikeThis
[2:43:07] BrainGushersTV: ahhh I remember the donut tutorial

[2:43:44] Vistor1001: Would you ever able to render a bite into that donut? @giantwaffle

[2:45:24] pt0ughneigh: waffle have you tried vr minecraft ala quin69?
[2:45:30] Bastert55: the results doesnt always show the work
[2:45:38] Wetware: @Giantwaffle Took me a minute to find it, I read it last year. You should read 'Delta-V' by Daniel Suarez, its about the first commercial mining expedition to an asteroid. It's fiction obviously, but covers a lot of the stuff you just talked about.
[2:45:50] Tech: Basics are the hardest part IMO. A good base knowledge makes it easier to learn later on
[2:46:11] Tech: @Arimil yoinking this too. This is sick!
[2:46:26] Vistor1001: It’s crazy to think VR was invented in the 60s
[2:46:37] phenix2803: I think of learning blender and unity but I always procrastinate it for around a year now
[2:46:41] pt0ughneigh: imagine compact minecraft in vr lmao
[2:47:14] Chyrion: waffleHey
[2:47:20] Heavyy05: actual claustrophobia
[2:47:30] pt0ughneigh: so much spinning in circles
[2:47:35] Sairenix: I dont think theres a day where i dont hit something in VR
[2:47:42] Wetware: VR has been 'Ready in 5 years' for like 40 years LUL
[2:47:50] Tabakhase: could play roomscale tho, whats klinda nice LUL
[2:48:01] pt0ughneigh: o.o
[2:48:02] Tech: Gosh Dang
[2:48:06] Sairenix: I think i have around that alone in VRChat LUL
[2:48:56] Sairenix: I think like the first week or two is the worst but after that you really get used to where about you are in your room in comparison to VR
[2:48:58] 13bloomy37: What happened with the bicycle thing? You used to bike but havent seen that lately
[2:49:03] Tech: The only thing that I've seen as interesting for VR has been the RP communities in VRChat
[2:49:09] pt0ughneigh: ppl used to talk about vr like all games in the future would all be vr
[2:49:16] Tech: Otherwise I feel like I'm just not that interested in it
[2:49:18] Gnepcoyi: Yea and look how good VR is with some of these shitty games already
[2:49:23] Sairenix: TRUE
[2:49:38] Arimil: @tasty_waffles still is, although I don't think that's the current generation of VR
[2:49:39] Sairenix: The offstream RP communities are really good though
[2:49:41] Tech: I mean with the SO being huge into RP, you don't have to tell me twice LUL

[2:49:53] n8level: human interactions are messy in VR
[2:50:03] The_Holas: Waffle did you ever think about GTA RP?
[2:50:04] DaGMC: what was the epic creator code for waffle?
[2:50:06] Battokage: arcadum s vr rp mostly are chill

[3:47:46] kiddofdeath: there might be another method?
[3:47:50] madseed15: yah much faster
[3:47:52] galaxy_berry: I love AE2 computer systems but the crafting system is so dumb complicated
[3:47:52] qerutar: its like few seconds in chamber

[3:52:20] OsisNie: it's the "Crystal Growth Accelerator" that you normally make a bunch of. the @AE2 machine you're making usually has 6 in its recipe
[3:52:21] Saisino: if you put a chest with conduit and input/output to the same chest you can easily automate the charging flux crystal.
[3:52:42] CoolReal: You can do 5 crystal growth accelerators or 1 crystal growth chamber
[3:53:06] Apparentthreat: you can still automate it pretty easily
[3:53:11] Apparentthreat: wait til you need stacks of it OMEGALUL

[3:57:52] Saisino: the fluix crystal thing
[3:58:24] madseed15: Did u see the ina forehead sc tik tac toe video
[3:58:43] madseed15: it works inside
[3:59:09] Saisino: I'm not sure but i believe you could do the normal fluix crystal in water thing in growth accelerator as well. but i'm not 100%
[3:59:34] CoolReal: You don't have accelerators

[6:11:19] s_DeXTeR_s: blaind
[6:11:20] emzr: is this a fighting game?
[6:11:34] audunnolafsson: Most people on this map land at one location so people die fast
[6:11:37] Allmostdone: More of a walking sim
[6:11:39] JBourden: ye no barrel means you got no accuracy on either of those
[6:11:40] TheWonderLlama: I love walking simulators :)
[6:11:43] grayjacketguy: Spitfire monkaSoap
[6:11:46] Jamie7Gs: i swear this map is like this more often than not. You drop hot and die/fight in the first 90 seconds, or you drop safe and not see anyone until the end and the other squad is full red shields
[6:12:04] legendkim17: its a looting game with shorty and waffle
[6:12:37] grayjacketguy: You gotta push fights if you want fights tatsunMilky
[6:12:43] daemonaedryn: @Jamie7Gs Also if youve not seen a squad in a while, the first fight you enter will guarantee you getting 7th partied YEP

[6:15:30] xKamie: @Allmostdone there is a damage indicator on the person ur shooting at
[6:15:35] audunnolafsson: Gibralter has damage reduction
[6:15:56] ThatOnneGuy: peepoPat I go to bed. Night chat.
[6:16:03] audunnolafsson: And most people land at the same place so people die quick
[6:16:08] Allmostdone: @xkamie Is it that red arrow?
[6:16:09] daemonaedryn: @ThatOnneGuy Goodnight widepeepoHappy

[6:16:39] Supdeoop: Lets go to Mother Russia PogChamp
[6:16:42] shoes6699: so fun
[6:16:45] Jamie7Gs: they added little colored circles to the map to indicate hot drops (increased quality loot areas) that randomize each round.
[6:16:45] daemonaedryn: What is your style?
[6:16:56] JBourden: lifeline is good, you get loot drops
[6:16:58] Gnepcoyi: Pog

[6:19:59] pengeg: LUL
[6:20:09] boatymc_boatface_: sure a "trailer" than can handle two "logs"
[6:20:12] Slymph: You need to just manually load medium/long logs
[6:20:29] Adraythien: it can carry 2 logs?
[6:20:50] Slymph: If you manually load logs you can carry like over 10 "Medium logs" at once
[6:20:56] Supdeoop: did you finish the first delivery yesterday?
[6:21:01] NordESA: I took a 5 slot trailer around the world, through a terrible tight part through the woods and at the end have it get stuck on something completely random I couldn't see. Took me 30 mins to sort it out, so damn mad danSuffer
[6:21:34] Slymph: You load medium logs to the loading station, that gives you 1 log. 3 of those logs you can pack into a "Medium log"
[6:22:19] Slymph: And you can carry a ton of those singular logs
[6:23:10] Slymph: The quarry part takes a while to unlock, am doing it right now
[6:23:41] Slymph: Dump a load? PepeFlushed
[6:23:59] Unwanted_Endlessness: Loads, logs, dump, etc. All great for jokes
[6:24:00] Slymph: Yes
[6:24:17] BobPatience: watching these past few days, is the game really this tough or is Waffle making it look harder than it actually is? monkaHmm
[6:24:27] n00rman_: try reversing
[6:24:46] Slymph: Only thing you need to be aware of tho is how you deliver em
[6:24:51] nenado1989: hey Waffle
[6:24:53] Unwanted_Endlessness: Have you tried squeezing a log through a small gap with only a small amount of gas?
[6:24:56] EbbaBusch: i think the game is pretty hard thekru7Toebecca
[6:24:59] NordESA: I feel like the map gets harder and harder, this latest one in Russia is way harder than the others.
[6:25:09] DeadeyeWolff: i think you needed to unlock the  other graboxes
[6:25:17] NordESA: And it gets worse KEKW
[6:25:19] Slymph: you basicly need to empty the trailer, and load the trailer with 3 logs and then pack and deliver, rinse and repeat
[6:25:22] Mandorake: it would probably be easier if we had finished the other maps as well
[6:25:33] Slymph: Isnt too bad, just something to be aware of
[6:25:37] NordESA: Yeah
[6:25:39] Mandorake: Just more upgrades and stuff ya
[6:26:08] Slymph: Yeah you can carry a ton of logs

[6:26:25] Slymph: Just dont pack em when you drive
[6:26:34] NordESA: This new truck is probably the best one in the game atm
[6:26:49] DOOMinion: bruh this truck doesn't give a fuck
[6:27:06] Larklen: widepeepoHappy
[6:27:41] Rool_Gonzalez: ICB carriers from MAZ had panels attached to wheels,like duck feet to deal with mud or swamp
[6:28:03] potatowagyu: awww, did shorty get off?

[6:31:06] Rool_Gonzalez: so if the "feet" of the crane aint on ground you safe till you don't touch the metal

[6:31:31] weightmaker: is this trip number 2?
[6:31:43] Hunter1701: Waffle I made borgors want one tokkipComfy

[6:32:37] premalonetv: Dude wish they had snowscooters
[6:33:12] Vistor1001: This is so relaxing to watch
[6:33:14] none_the_wiser: Half tracks are very common.
[6:33:34] premalonetv: Man this kind of game requires some kkona kind of music
[6:33:35] ravor9933: the most certainly are
[6:33:35] emilslel: It would be cool if u could actually step out cars and go replace a tyre urself
[6:33:44] emilslel: Like when u puncture it
[6:33:45] ravor9933: russian trucks
[6:33:45] Gorignack: Bv 206/208 would be perfect as a scout
[6:33:46] AKAHurricane: You should check out Ken Blocks' Ford Raptor with snow tracks on it
[6:33:51] SquigPen: if hit by power line jump out of car and land om both feet together then "scooch" walk away without your feet leaving the ground
[6:34:00] potatowagyu: sheeeeesh, this thing can go anywhere
[6:34:01] God0fTrippy: Diesel brothers have built acouple tracked trucks

[6:37:07] Pustolov: They should add screw propelled vehicles to the game, those are very unique @giantwaffle  you should google those if you have never seen them
[6:37:22] Larklen: When will they add an "Ugly Bastard" tag? smh
[6:37:28] Rool_Gonzalez: Russians had them

[6:41:34] imShnaz: is there a mushroom biom?
[6:42:12] NemesisXKL: @Giantwaffle if you can only grab 2 it would make sense to fill it to 2 and dont make a tour with 1 log
[6:42:16] theunseen010: i'm uncomfortable with the double open-ended trailer full of loose logs LUL
[6:42:18] weightmaker: at least the physics are completely realistic
[6:42:23] SEANxZONA: Your just saving yourself multiple trips
[6:42:26] Unwanted_Endlessness: Waffles first day on the job, I have 300 hours in a simulator.  Moving these logs is a piece of cake
[6:42:37] Ghost0447: waffle if they fall of you can always pick them back up
[6:42:43] carefreedan: actually really struggling to get this game to run, I have a good PC done everything they told me to in steam support but still just a black screen instead of launching. Anyone else had this?

[6:43:10] Moobot: You can sub to Waffle by clicking this neat link -> twitch.tv/giantwaffle/subscribe
[6:43:11] Larklen: EZ
[6:43:12] bwofreedom2: a full load of individual logs can be packed into multiple medium log packs at the destination. its basically cheesing the system
[6:43:16] 11_343: 2 at once PogChamp
[6:43:21] Ghost0447: you only need 6? right?
[6:43:27] NemesisXKL: @Giantwaffle fil lthe load tray again, dont make a tour with single log, its waste of time :P
[6:43:47] BobPatience: Imagine wasting time SeriousSloth
[6:43:48] bwofreedom2: ^
[6:43:51] Supdeoop: dont you just need 6 logs ? if you pack medium with 3 and need just 2 at your destination?
[6:43:59] MountainLion01: Interesting way to haul logs, real nice if it works.
[6:44:09] theunseen010: monkaS
[6:44:15] bwofreedom2: @Supdeoop not if he loses some logs
[6:44:28] TonpaSama: monkaS
[6:44:29] theunseen010: you could take SOO many loads at one like that
[6:44:35] Slymph: They are surprisingly stable

[6:45:42] medisa_tv: @afridan I had this problem with the Epic launcher version of this game it wasnt that it was locking up it was that it litterally took 5-10 MINUTES to start, then once in the game alt-tabbing caused another 30-45 lag/locking scenario
[6:45:45] Rool_Gonzalez: fill it up and then Manually place them on delivery spot and get 6 loads in one go delivered timmacHMM

[6:47:38] medisa_tv: @afridan TLDR try starting the game and walk away for a few minutes to see if it will actually launch
[6:47:44] Rool_Gonzalez: he parked his car into curve blocking others,done!
[6:47:49] Skelly82: but they just "parked" their cars
[6:48:02] Anthony_Gossett: :D Mikel is my middle name!

[6:51:47] Vistor1001: What is the most exciting circuit in your opinion?

[6:59:05] Apparentthreat: can you put them perpendicular on the trailer?
[6:59:06] Domnonos: Can you hold a few in the crane and hold them on top of the other logs to keep them in place?
[6:59:09] BobPatience: this is like trying to get 6 baby dogs or cats to sit still for a photo
[6:59:22] Rool_Gonzalez: Secure them,go to delivery spot and unload on side,taking just 3 logs at the time ;)

[6:59:31] MountainLion01: This is like all shortcuts in this game, they are a lie.
[6:59:58] DaChibi: Is the rest of the way wide? Could rotate the logs 90deg so they are in between the uprights?
[7:00:23] Rhorge: These logs are definitely lubed up
[7:00:31] TarMonA: cant you use the rails as holder Kappa
[7:00:42] ReZPanTiVo: @Giantwaffle how about flatbed with the sides?
[7:00:47] Domnonos: katieHmm Could you put them diagonally so the stick through the back two prongs and the front two prongs on a side?
[7:01:07] Prot0Typ3: @Giantwaffle yut to let you know there is a red trailer with the vertival support beams like this that prevents the logs vorm falling of because its lower part is closed ound, bad english but just a hint
[7:01:19] Hikyy: the game has no sound?
[7:01:26] Ghost0447: @Hikyy ther is
[7:01:48] weightmaker: that one is easy to fix though.
[7:01:58] prongled_: why not tie them down?
[7:02:03] Ghost0447: how far are you from the destenation?
[7:02:04] weightmaker: another log might be harder to fix
[7:02:11] jaysaldivar: new update??
[7:02:14] KIFFIR: why game music off? its such a vibe @Giantwaffle
[7:02:21] JBourden: i think the sites that show this cheat say to take it slow
[7:02:38] skokpo: or put your own
[7:03:14] Orin_The_Sly: Music just causes problems now days. Not worth the effort
[7:03:22] gobbleractually: how close is he? pretty low of gas
[7:03:23] Mr_Biro: Hey!
[7:03:45] Riddixdan: do you use diff lock?

[7:04:17] DeagleShot1313: Whats up waffle and chat
[7:04:17] jaysaldivar: dont want to swap to gal/min instead??
[7:04:19] Riddixdan: getting final destination vibes
[7:04:24] Rool_Gonzalez: that's why it's sliding like cow on ice,all wheels turn at same speed
[7:04:24] Mr_Biro: i find it annoying tbh
[7:04:25] Supdeoop: That one Log still going strong
[7:04:36] BIGFANOFYOURSHOW: @jaysaldivar thought this was america
[7:05:06] weightmaker: remember the large rock this time
[7:05:07] Rool_Gonzalez: you can pick it up again
[7:05:07] DeagleShot1313: Mob it mobber
[7:05:30] Chronoes: log peepoSad
[7:05:32] Riddixdan: I'm confused, how is the ground so soft if it's winter?
[7:05:45] Mr_Biro: @Riddixdan its mud
[7:05:53] Mr_Biro: and its not rly frozen
[7:06:01] BobPatience: global warming :
[7:06:04] Riddixdan: that's the question, why isn't it frozen?
[7:06:07] Easy_Tizzie: @bbqgril i wish, farming sim is easier LUL
[7:06:11] weightmaker: this is where the trailer got stuck last time aswell
[7:06:15] gobbleractually: freshly frozen top of wet mud
[7:06:17] Wynja: Noone said it's midwinter, it has snowed a bit but obviously the ground isn't frozen yet
[7:06:23] BIGFANOFYOURSHOW: @Riddixdan even if it was, thats like a 20 ton truck
[7:06:37] Mr_Biro: @Riddixdan more like 35

[7:08:26] CoolReal: This looks insane
[7:08:28] Ghost0447: this was one of the hardest parts left right
[7:08:30] Pati: All these trees, why dont they cut down some near the site that its needed at smh
[7:08:34] DeagleShot1313: I like my logs moist
[7:08:39] gobbleractually: logs got better packed becuse of that LUL
[7:09:10] abhidingox: are you not able to strap down the load like you could in mudrunners?
[7:09:11] TheMatate: Damn the graphics in this game are amazing
[7:09:17] joar767: yoo man
[7:09:39] Mr_Biro: you may have a rpoblem whit those loose logs on the steep hill
[7:09:47] Mr_Biro: problem*

[7:09:56] dan1570: Is that truck good?
[7:10:08] Chronoes: uh huh
[7:10:10] drago1598: sure Kappa
[7:10:23] NordESA: These new maps are brutal compared to the others tbh
[7:10:24] Mr_Biro: love how you correct the truck last second before you fall of the bridge xD
[7:10:31] joar767: what truck are you driving?
[7:10:35] n00rman_: sliding is probably from the forced diff lock
[7:11:02] Slymph: @joar767 Its called zikz something
[7:11:07] dan1570: I think its the new Zikz season pass truck
[7:11:15] joar767: ty Slymph <3
[7:12:04] Ansaila: why we don't strap down the logs? i thought it had an option for it
[7:12:04] Kirit0ke: aaaand it's gone

[7:12:24] mohshiin: throw the logs
[7:12:31] mohshiin: THROW THE LOGS
[7:12:40] Davemented: oh is this the mission to get medium logs?
[7:12:49] Popowing: Ive never been this invested about logs before
[7:12:58] BlotOutTheSun: NotLikeThis
[7:13:11] LegitRoman: pog
[7:13:22] ElTankoJoe: It's big, it's heavy, it's wood.
[7:13:29] Davemented: the way the game handles medium logs is terrible. better to just get one of the mods that adds medium log carriers to the back of a bunch of trucks
[7:13:30] DeagleShot1313: Dont forget to LOG your hours
[7:13:38] NordESA: danCringe
[7:13:49] Buaha: @finnen_Hawke <3
[7:13:53] Mapleton: oh shit, almost missed snow runner
[7:14:08] MURDERDOME: get some ratchet straps
[7:14:09] Dagmoo: i love how chill this game is
[7:14:14] Mr_Biro: do you have straps for them ?
[7:14:35] Mr_Biro: LUL LUL
[7:14:36] nxusr: it's a StickBugged
[7:14:39] SnoLys: clever use of game mechanics?
[7:14:42] Davemented: keeping them loose lets you carry two loads instead of one
[7:14:42] Domnonos: Creative Use of Game Mechanics
[7:14:48] DeagleShot1313: What are you doing exactly
[7:14:57] Rool_Gonzalez: You CAN strap them down,but before offloading take half the logs off ;)
[7:15:04] Acrin_: they just need to change straps to function like farming sim
[7:15:21] kymset: Imagine if this doesn't work and waffle has been jebaited
[7:15:28] Mr_Biro: that went better than expected tbh
[7:15:28] Moobot: You can sub to Waffle by clicking this neat link -> twitch.tv/giantwaffle/subscribe
[7:15:33] Davemented: how does this Zikz handle on ice, since it has no chain tires?
[7:15:42] NordESA: Poorly
[7:15:45] lofffff: it never ends KEKW
[7:15:46] mohshiin: low hanging wires
[7:15:47] Chronoes: @DeagleShot1313 3 logs make up a trailer when packed but take much less space when unpacked. so bringing 6 logs means you can take 2 trailers' worth in one
[7:15:49] mohshiin: monkaSTEER
[7:15:49] Slymph: What powerlines? Kappa
[7:15:53] Venxuri: I had to leave for a while, how did you find apex waffle? :)

[7:16:02] DeagleShot1313: Ok ty
[7:16:04] Mr_Biro: @Chronoes Logic 101
[7:16:04] Jomeaga: I got really interested in this game when I first saw you play it a week ago. Now that I've watched more, I feel I will get too frustrated having to make the same trip many many times
[7:16:06] WoofWoofDude: can't you take the crane to clean the road ? if you go that way often
[7:16:29] Gennosuke_Tj: new side minigame with logs
[7:16:42] DeagleShot1313: Ty @Chronoes
[7:16:53] SandDanGlot: Youre are getitng good
[7:16:56] Davemented: @Jomeaga I've been playing since release and there really aren't that many missions like that. Yukon has some but if you have a heavy truck like a Kolob you can tow a LOT of cargo in the biggest trailer
[7:16:57] WaLDuZ: Thanks waffle, my power just went out sitting her on 160p with 2g out here in now where russia on my phone Sadge
[7:17:01] mohshiin: im surprised you cant strap them down

[7:18:23] DeadeyeWolff: it is a shortcut
[7:18:24] NarcisDuran: hasnt he gotten chain tires yet?
[7:18:25] ppparsifal: bending the rules
[7:18:26] Venxuri: easter egg? Kappa
[7:18:41] jaysaldivar: yeah like holding a item with the crane when your already fully loaded
[7:18:46] dotphantom: Are you using keyboard or controller @giantwaffle ?
[7:18:48] NarcisDuran: oh ok
[7:18:49] Davemented: and it's not just that he CAN game the system, but the route is so damn long and tortuous that you REALLY don't want to make that many trips
[7:18:52] turtle123321123: is this game in beta
[7:18:52] Silverjester1: How is snowrunners compared to mudrunners?

[7:19:38] whatwouldharveydo: Can the trees break?
[7:19:39] Mr_Biro: i think the winch is the MVP in this game
[7:20:02] Davemented: the winch in the game lets you swing from tree to tree like Tarzan
[7:20:05] NordESA: Yes, depends on how big they are
[7:20:14] Gennosuke_Tj: Therefore, this is not cheating, but real life experience)
[7:20:28] weirun_: this is just a chill game. i like it
[7:20:36] NarcisDuran: what level is he at?

[7:20:53] Wynja: @Gennosuke_Tj You'd strap them down irl

[7:23:11] Ghost0447: any plans on starting any starship prints today?
