[0:25:55] philipkatis: You would need another one for a 4090

[0:26:15] Str0ngPaprika: You cannot upgrade the breaker without changing the wires
[0:26:18] Bunjimus: it doesn't take much to add a circuit so it shouldnt be topo expensive
[0:26:18] SirNine: @Agnt_smith how does a grid affect the circuits in the wall?

[0:26:36] Lars_Keizer: Should be a fairly straightforward job for an electrician
[0:26:37] nothenewmemeguy: 20 breaker goes with 20 amp wires, if you change the breaker you're basically burning your house down
[0:26:52] underpantsfurlough: The new Eaton "smart" breakers are trash in new houses. They superseded the old ones with a more reliable one. I've had to replace 3 of them in my house built in 2018.

[1:58:01] Apparentthreat: lWhiteRangerl i think redstone spawns around other red ores in this game so it's probably similar to those ores/minerals
[1:58:22] stormblaz: What energy level we need for space travel?
[1:58:30] Venxuri: they are kinda meh, you hammer is better
[1:58:36] thebubbajones1: Drill time bois

[2:00:12] Apparentthreat: illussiat something like that would be hard to make in this pack. mining gadget too op
[2:00:13] XxPyrooxX: chat whyare they talking in chat and not ingame
[2:00:30] chaoskub: @mobfarmer I am a manager, so I end up taking on-call's if people have PTO. I am on PTO, but had to take some on-calls so my employees can have real PTO.
[2:00:37] officialhunterx: flux bore is the cheapest
[2:00:38] drsnaki96: mining gadgets are 1,16+
[2:00:39] Jibbur: not sure mining gadgets were out for 1.12
[2:00:39] brenner1265: Disctruction voids
[2:00:41] chaoskub: I refuse to ask my employees to do anything  I won't do.
[2:00:47] Jibbur: destruction just voids
[2:00:51] drsnaki96: and flux bore is HV tier

[2:01:56] colinbobolin: this mod pack is simply insane
[2:01:59] chaoskub: @XxPyrooxX Thanks, I just try to do right by my employees. I've had plenty of shitty managers in the past.
[2:02:00] Apparentthreat: DX_Plates it's probably the typo
[2:02:03] JJaaYY: Wouldn’t that suffocate you underground?
[2:02:06] slimjimforevigt: do you have a light shader on or is just the mod thats make the lighting?
[2:02:14] Larklen: pepeSmoke

[2:02:20] Lightchurl: waflle i luv you bud

[2:02:40] chaoskub: @mobfarmer STAY away from salary if you can. Trust me
[2:02:53] RisibleFlow: Just keep minig
[2:03:02] DX_Plates: @mobfarmer I love my salary gig, but we aren't expected to work 60 hours a week either.
[2:03:10] officialhunterx: exchanging gadget will help
[2:03:11] chaoskub: Salary has it's perks, but I could honestly make 30-50% more if I were hourly.
[2:03:18] glazetrain: @giantwaffle 2x2 elevator when?
[2:03:32] TheGreatLemon: TheGreatLemon subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 46 months! Since moobot doesn't like my typo: I've seen people use the exchanging gadget with flowers to work as a mining gadget
[2:03:34] Vovosunt: why would it be?
[2:03:40] Vovosunt: you literally set it to plane LUL
[2:03:53] h00k__: using the building mod (clicking ALT) you can make a floor that replaces blocks
[2:03:58] thebubbajones1: Might as well make the elevator bigger while we’re doing the floor
[2:04:00] illussiat: Waffle, this is the exact reason the exchanging gadget exists
[2:04:00] ShroomsBro: why u on peacefull?
[2:04:02] mobfarmer: been dodging salary for the last 5 years....  boss keep offers a promotion, but I say match my current annual pay and I will think about it.  I almost feel bad for people that get hired on as salary, because they don't relize what the are missing
[2:04:04] Noblez_: I think we should kill Pati
[2:04:09] thebubbajones1: @shroomsbro it’s a peaceful modpack
[2:04:38] Vovosunt: @mobfarmer what kind of work do you do? IT I assume?

[2:05:04] Twin5un: PeepoClap
[2:05:07] DX_Plates: @mobfarmer LuL No one expect contractors get hourly in my industry, and contractors give half their pay to their agency...

[2:07:16] Trollsamaa: i like the way they do vains. most mods i see with them just have it as a solid mass of ore.
[2:07:19] chaoskub: @mobfarmer Funny enough, I use your cloud offering for part of my company. But mostly AW
[2:07:31] jmm548: not if its automated
[2:07:37] stormblaz: why you afraid of work
[2:07:46] Vovosunt: god this makes me wanna play MC but I know gregtech will burn me out nearly instantly
[2:07:46] stormblaz: we reaching space today
[2:07:51] DX_Plates: chaoskub Yea, I did contracting to build my resume, mostly self-taught no degree, but had a couple good firms I worked for (full benefits and decent rate), but got out of it as soon as I could. I was cool to experience all the different teams and environments though.

[2:08:10] stormblaz: Thats copium
[2:08:10] DX_Plates: *It was cool
[2:08:12] mobfarmer: i'm in the legacy division.. so 90% of what I do is SAAS.   not the cool new stuff.
[2:08:16] halleluhja: you should watch threefol!
[2:08:18] stormblaz: hopium time
[2:08:19] Twin5un: you mean high copium ? COPIUM
[2:08:19] chaoskub: @DX_Plates That's the way to do it. You're clearly smart. I am self taught as well.
[2:08:30] thebubbajones1: I just carry boxes for a living, y’all in year 3000

[2:09:38] kenshin2666: wouldnt it be easiest to start at the top height of the vein for the ore you want and mine down 3 entire layers at a time?
[2:09:41] piiixxx: how do you automate resources in this modpack? like auto miners?
[2:09:44] stormblaz: jeez thar red stone ore is massive
[2:09:52] Larklen: KEKW

[2:10:25] The_Flembo: I enjoy, with how many years you have in MC, you still panick over revealing lava
[2:10:27] Apparentthreat: odd how redstone is always glowing but guess it helps differentiate it
[2:10:39] TheSparkVG: probably eating pizza LULW
[2:10:41] Pticrix: Autogeneration is stealing works for thousands of hard working Americans you know.
[2:10:41] DX_Plates: chaoskub I started in QA, went Dev a couple years ago cause I ran out of new things in QA, went from Jr to SE II in about 2 years. Finding a niche helps, I learned all our API systems which only 1 other guy really knows.
[2:10:49] XxPyrooxX: so are there dimond vains then?

[2:11:55] chaoskub: @DX_Plates Very nice. That's a good progression path and gives you a great position in the company. I hope you understand your value. Niche is always a good route, especially if it is underserved in your org.
[2:11:59] blaksmil: though it had higher range mb
[2:12:00] stormblaz: Is High Voltage = 120v?
[2:12:02] PureSpider: i love GT veins so much, i wish there was a mod that had ONLY GT oregen and nothing else
[2:12:10] TallBro97: is there a craftable veinminer?
[2:12:13] stormblaz: or 240v
[2:12:24] Redlessx: no rtx?
[2:12:46] DX_Plates: chaoskub Oh I know my worth, and I'm not getting it, but they have a much better work life balance than another else in the area. I'll take that over money any day of the week.
[2:12:50] officialhunterx: it did all by hand
[2:12:53] Xenotics: something just reminded me of BaconDonut, miss that guy
[2:12:55] random_german_name: why is there so murch redstone there
[2:13:00] MonteKuchen: but you can already use dml to produce normal ressources like redstone
[2:13:03] b0ltz12: getting Deep mob learning going is going to be great for resource generation
[2:13:04] bobolpwnz: Once I fully automated DML i stopped mining for basic resources
[2:13:07] syrkaz: @DX_Plates I can relate! :3
[2:13:08] mobfarmer: my team handles US GOV,  we are constantly under audit, I'm not kidding we had 6 audits this year.. I like dealing with the auditors, I found my niche...
[2:13:10] FlammAlpha: monkaHmm how far are the mining drones?
[2:13:11] XxPyrooxX: could you like chunk mine something

[2:13:53] Raffataff: time for automation?
[2:13:56] Trollsamaa: chemestrycraft
[2:14:04] chaoskub: @DX_Plates Work life balance is hella important. I recommend people consider it as strongly as pay. Money is no fun if you have no time to spend it. I've got a decent W/L balance, but I give up a bit of it to try and make my employees lives a little easier.

[2:14:15] thebubbajones1: @dx_plates lemme get on that list of people willing to learn and work
[2:14:20] PureSpider: DX_Plates i feel like the "finding a niche (within your company)" is soooo valuable, and never taught in any of those typical seminars
[2:14:21] mobfarmer: yeap...  and automate everything, puppet is your friend.. and taking lots of screen shots, auditors love screenshots

[2:15:44] mobfarmer: no cloud certs so far.. just haven;t taken the time.. 8 years dealing with  thousands of. hosts...
[2:15:49] phoss2k: is it worth it to extend the smelting area? like double up the smelters in order to get the resources processed faster?
[2:15:53] chaoskub: @mobfarmer Puppet/Ansible/Chef and Terraform/Cloudformation/etc are pretty much a must when you get into a decent size infrastructure. But it can cut your work massively if done right .
[2:15:55] kenshin2666: @chaoskub i shall look into such after I finish the CS50x harvard online course :D

[2:16:28] DX_Plates: @mobfarmer Can confirm, major metro paper, and we use most of those systems.
[2:16:28] PureSpider: chaoskub just use docker compose 4Head MiniK
[2:16:34] kenshin2666: @XxPyrooxX indeed is an absolute nightmare to find anything, and when you do, oups it was a scam
[2:16:51] chaoskub: @mobfarmer Cloud certs can be a nice gateway into the industry. But experience is a fine sub for

[2:17:39] XxPyrooxX: @kenshin2666 yeah just graduated college and didn't really know anyone college job fairs and hiring managers were the only way to get any kind of interview
[2:17:43] chaoskub: @PureSpider Docker is nice, but there are better methods once you reach a certain size. Docker gives you a solid understanding if you go to expand what you are doing.
[2:17:50] KnightofObv: it made 1 each

[2:18:27] phoss2k: how are the tiers in this modpack? like does the good circuit boards mean that they are tier two and hence medium voltage?
[2:18:31] chaoskub: @PureSpider crreamKek fair
[2:18:38] Venxuri: both are MV
[2:18:42] PureSpider: chaoskub the company i work for is heavily pivoting towards kubernetes right now, and i'm super excited about it :D
[2:18:42] DX_Plates: @XxPyrooxX Oh right, there is a stream going on too

[2:19:11] Gh3ttoboy: @kuba_91 and theres plenty of mod spotlights out there in youtube
[2:19:15] DonnieQuest: Is everyone working on the same goal here or doing their own thing?
[2:19:17] chaoskub: It still amazes me how many IT pros and software devs are in Waffles stream
[2:19:19] enciaveftw: oh right, the stream, were just reading chat for 10 min straight
[2:19:22] Venxuri: tap the right side with a wrench

[2:19:28] Amenophiz: wrench

[2:19:39] syrkaz: @kenshin2666 Get familiar with Kubernetes. Although learning it fully will take a lotta time and effort, you should be able to get familiar with it and its basic tools (e.g. kubectl, k9s, etc) just coming off of your Docker knowledge)
[2:19:45] chaoskub: @Larklen It's good background lol
[2:19:45] DX_Plates: peepoPat kenshin2666 GL in the hunt
[2:19:56] kenshin2666: @XxPyrooxX i wonder if i can get a job at indeed for checking over job postings for bullshit and lies >:{
[2:19:57] XxPyrooxX: @XxPyrooxX i have always wondered how he dosent just stop playing and interject into our conversations there are some wicked great people in waffles community
[2:20:06] chaoskub: @kenshin2666 100% good advice ^
[2:20:33] kenshin2666: @DX_Plates  haha thanks DX cohhBless
[2:20:34] PureSpider: @chaoskub it's so nice to have good, insightful conversations though, i love it
[2:20:35] mobfarmer: you can get kubernetes base install if you use truenas scale seems to be a good way to get started with it/
[2:21:04] Bwangoh: I hate that word. Kubernetes
[2:21:09] colinbobolin: I'm guessing 50% of chat is watching while working
[2:21:12] syrkaz: @mobfarmer you also have minikube
[2:21:13] Venxuri: you would either need a MV CEF or a Transformer on the back
[2:21:23] chaoskub: @chaoskub Funny enough, I actually hired one of my employees after meeting them in Waffles chat.

[2:21:52] MonteKuchen: if you have 4x wire you can maybe but it in the lv line, that worked in omnifactory but not sure if it does in this pack

[2:22:23] Venxuri: the thing taht you use to convert RF to EU
[2:22:34] b0ltz12: i think the CEF is the power converter from rf to gregtech power
[2:22:39] stormzwest: add an MV CEF to the dynamos next to the LV one, these need to be separate power grids, or the power lines will explodde
[2:22:54] kenshin2666: @chaoskub @Syrkaz with the CS50x course ive been getting to know C, python, SQL, html, ,css, JS, at a fairly basic level, but prior to that ive been self learning java as a first language
[2:23:36] ninopanda: Chat LEGO® Builder's Journey is free on Epic for today only
[2:23:45] PureSpider: ^ good game
[2:23:46] XxPyrooxX: @kenshin2666 i mean most courses are going to just get you that basic level you just google what you need and the rabbit hole for 3 weeks and then you know what ur doing
[2:23:50] bobolpwnz: 1 amp is fine
[2:23:52] stormzwest: 1A MV
[2:23:57] MonteKuchen: depends on which wire you want to use
[2:24:10] Abyssal_Hawk: you were looking at HV
[2:24:13] syrkaz: @kenshin2666 Any language that gets you excited about building stuff is a good starting language! :) You can translate most knowledge from one language to another… It's mostly changing syntax, but the fundamental principles translate well. It's more important to go "deep" first, and then start going wide (to to deep elsewhere whenever you get excited about something)
[2:24:13] MonteKuchen: 1 amp means you need one converter per machine
[2:24:23] 4OH4SkillNotFound: Thicc wire?
[2:24:24] b0ltz12: IIRC determines the number of machines that can be run at the same time.
[2:24:32] fishypooos: @ninopanda and a platinum proton db rating... pog might check it out
[2:24:40] Yakobro: pepeLaugh
[2:24:50] PureSpider: @kenshin2666 💯
[2:25:02] MonteKuchen: but if you use a 16amp converter you need 16x wire on the whole line
[2:25:14] Venxuri: each machine uses 1A by default, bad cables also lose Amps, 16A is best but v expensive, 4A should be good enough
[2:25:15] kenshin2666: @XxPyrooxX  so much googling haha. every time its like "okay so i want to do X, how do i do that, and fit it in to what i already got"
[2:25:19] stormblaz: nice walmart wir3
[2:25:26] MonteKuchen: it can run 4 amps of lv at once
[2:25:29] bobolpwnz: 4 amps = 4 machines working at the same time max
[2:25:37] MonteKuchen: depends on recipe
[2:25:41] ZnabbLars: they prolly not all running at the same time?
[2:25:41] Moobot: You can sub to Waffle by clicking this neat link -> twitch.tv/giantwaffle/subscribe SUBprise
[2:25:42] Larklen: turn all the machines on and find out pepeLaugh
[2:25:42] RevengeLetsPlay: Most of the basic machines takes 1 Amp

[2:26:02] stormblaz: @larklen we got a jokester
[2:26:04] aoroza: 1a mv = 128 eu/t
[2:26:05] Venxuri: nearly all machines take 1A, not sure about multiblocks
[2:26:05] stormzwest: if its not specified in JEI, is 1 a
[2:26:11] RevengeLetsPlay: @Giantwaffle normaly machines take 1 AMp
[2:26:12] Venxuri: I think multiblocks 1A per hatch
[2:26:25] PureSpider: only medium voltage
[2:26:27] MetalBBA: most things take 1 amp. so a 4 amp wire would power 4 machines at the same time
[2:26:29] Tro95: eu/t = power
[2:26:31] itzSimondr98: Ressources? YEP
[2:26:32] bobolpwnz: cost of wires
[2:26:35] MonteKuchen: 16x wire is like 8 ingots
[2:26:37] kenshin2666: @Syrkaz java's OOP nature certainly works best with how my brain likes to function and think of things. and i would love to get it down better and more comfort before branching out to other languages more. but definitely a lot of it is transferable knowledge and just learning new syntax and formats
[2:26:39] Venxuri: just more ingots
[2:26:39] tandazo03: Only resources
[2:26:56] Venxuri: But honestly, you only want to use superconductors
[2:26:59] XxPyrooxX: @kenshin2666 the amount of times that im like " i just need it to do this.. how hard could that be" then google is like word bomb of things i dont understand then im googling for the next 3 hours on just vocab XD
[2:27:00] Vickens: but more amp is a way less energy right?
[2:27:04] jayrickson87: I always made 16a so more machines can run all at once
[2:27:06] Trollsamaa: with the setup you have, not really. but if you have to run wires long distance, using the smallest wire you need saves a fair bit
[2:27:10] officialhunterx: it will say loss  less
[2:27:17] bobolpwnz: energetic alloy is for MV
[2:27:17] nesse007: ask ppati when is back on it?
[2:27:19] Venxuri: The JEI tab you were looking at, "Loss: 0"

[2:27:41] jayrickson87: ending io alloys are the superconductors
[2:27:48] 0x4273: It’s energetic for mv vibrant for hv
[2:27:51] MonteKuchen: that needs hv also
[2:27:56] stormzwest: vaccum freezer requires MV grid setup

[5:34:10] llRaizall: Does Bahroo having 2 channels somehow dodge the over 6 figure cut
[5:34:12] mahoraz: then 1% Kappa
[5:34:16] tandazo03: And they are already 70/30
[5:34:17] pinhead_larynx: tax the rich im all for it
[5:34:19] Nexhunter: no
[5:34:19] Tidalllwave: they want that money
[5:34:20] mahoraz: got to tax the ultra rich LUL
[5:34:21] Crossed_legion: go to youtube
[5:34:23] GuardMoony: Waffle Code NFT from AOC
[5:34:24] ImNotDonut_: maybe they have special contracts?
[5:34:26] F1r3punch: Cause they dont wanna deal with keeping them on platform
[5:34:27] CommanderUrsus: stockBezos gib more
[5:34:29] Doomwyte: no, cause they lump it for all channels
[5:34:30] HyperKitty_: they don't care as much perhaps
[5:34:31] LaroStar007: @Giantwaffle imagine valuating in Giantwaffle T1 Subs... Like... the GDP of the US is X GWT1S
[5:34:32] lvyEartman: more than 6 figures, you mean more than 100k, or 1 mill?
[5:34:38] Intohimos: isn't that against TOS?
[5:34:44] b0rtjedb: Not Even thinking about Lirik Sadge
[5:34:45] GarlicJelly: KEKW
[5:34:47] Dagmoo: yeah he definitely does on main channel
[5:34:51] tandazo03: But xQc and others get spacial treatment and still get 70/30s
[5:34:56] TheWonderLlama: RIP everything
[5:34:57] deathfroma6ove9: y not 4?
[5:35:08] Doomwyte: @Intohimos no, parttners can ask for another channel with subs, bunch of streamers do it
[5:35:21] Dagmoo: @intohimos plenty of streamers have 2 channels so its definitely ok
[5:35:24] Nexhunter: also it $100k @lvyEartman
[5:35:37] tandazo03: Oh wow I didn’t know that
[5:35:40] Doomwyte: @Giantwaffle Jonbams has 2 channels and he said twitch lumps them together, so I don't think 2 channels bypasses it
[5:35:42] Nexhunter: more of costs
[5:35:52] SeaOfMadness_: Bahroo gets 50K for the amount of ads he runs. Don't know the timeframe
[5:35:58] Nexhunter: Amazon itself can't keep eating infinite companies that don't make any money to sustain KEKW
[5:36:01] nothenewmemeguy: And here I thought it way the other way around where small streamers made like 50/50 on subs and bigger streamers made 70/30
[5:36:09] ImNotDonut_: @SeaOfMadness_ 1 month is the usual time frame for ad incentives
[5:36:10] Intohimos: @Dagmoo I remember couple years ago it was against TOS maybe something changed 🤷
[5:36:21] 8R00KS: I assume its only sub revenue and not ad revenue?
[5:36:23] Cpt_Ruby: that's crazy
[5:36:27] Nexhunter: if they run ads
[5:36:31] Nexhunter: then they will make more
[5:36:32] DrHax_: speaking about a lot of money, @Giantwaffle did you see the new PoE Core Support Packs already? WAYTOODANK
[5:36:33] Grumpage: yeah but moving to YT would lose them more
[5:36:37] ohbi78: theres nowhere else to go to do this tho sadly
[5:36:41] Driitzz: they get it back from ads lmao
[5:36:41] pi70n: more sponsored streams than
[5:36:43] praxiz: Why don't they pool their money and make a new streaming platform? How much could that cost, really?
[5:36:44] Nexhunter: they upped ad split
[5:36:50] 8R00KS: turbo gang run all the ads
[5:36:50] Doomwyte: they want people to play more ads so they can make more money from sponsers
[5:36:56] HyperKitty_: what proportion of their income even comes from subs anyway
[5:36:57] Tenkaichi500: isnt like the lowest ad is like 7 ads per hour
[5:36:58] Spirevipp: @praxiz KEKW
[5:36:58] Driitzz: they go HAM with their ads
[5:37:03] Nexhunter: january is garbage for advertising
[5:37:04] LaroStar007: @praxiz make an Open Sourced Platform
[5:37:05] Raffataff: Incentivise or force...
[5:37:09] i_am_davis: turbo gang rise up
[5:37:10] Nexhunter: and also you would be late for any actual Q1 bookings
[5:37:11] IHaveShirts: but the bounties seem to be pretty good
[5:37:13] InternetPlumber: it will just drive them to also take in more money off platform like personal sponsorships
[5:37:15] tandazo03: That’s so limiting to the company tho. Cause less motivation for growth for  smaller streamers
[5:37:15] Grav1s: Guessing this is why I’ve been seeing more larger streamers doing more #sponsored streams.
[5:37:19] Frag_Magnet_: I heard its 10 min of ads per hour for some
[5:37:19] bugsplatter23: ads are bad in recessions too, so there's that to look forward to
[5:37:23] Umoeder1: I really dont likt the 5 ad strike
[5:37:34] Nexhunter: @bugsplatter23 nope KEKW
[5:37:38] tandazo03: Twitch can’t get nothing right FailFish
[5:37:45] Troptics: i miss when ad blocker worked on twitch xD
[5:37:47] 8R00KS: I wouldnt blame you its such good money
[5:37:51] Driitzz: prerolls are so bad for small streamer
[5:37:56] CoolReal: 1 an hour is good
[5:37:59] HyperKitty_: @tandazo03 small streamers will take whatever growth they can get, I don't think they're in much of a place to be picky
[5:38:01] Nexhunter: @bugsplatter23 for streamers they are late to Q1 bookings for companies, most ad spending for Q1 would have been already laid out by beginning of Q4
[5:38:02] GarlicJelly: 5? Try 12 KEKW
[5:38:02] Stragmol: just need to invent some consumer holidays for January
[5:38:02] praxiz: I've seen the same suicide prevention ad about 200 times by now, and now I'm suicidal.
[5:38:03] Rongoel: @Troptics There is a way to do that LUL
[5:38:03] TigerLuv: I just get up and make coffee :D
[5:38:04] Rocknsugar: but I dont want to BabyRage
[5:38:06] SeaOfMadness_: I got 7 ads one where 5 were the same one, back to back
[5:38:07] tandazo03: I’ve gotten 8 ads before
[5:38:08] Driitzz: i go to a channel , see prerolls , im like nah ill go somewhere else
[5:38:08] b0rtjedb: @giantwaffle the Banner ads Are fine
[5:38:10] TheResinger: yeah I will never not use ad blocking
[5:38:11] lilgangstagoth1: i get the odd 8hr add on youtube now
[5:38:13] CrystalSmack: dont make 8 ads like lirik pls
[5:38:16] venom366: So waffle OF with the cat Kappa
[5:38:17] Dagmoo: twitch downhill since amazon MBAs took over
[5:38:20] MiedzeKLatdsche: i had an ad opening your stream oO
[5:38:32] MrMoneybagMan: YEP
[5:38:33] nvrmissashot: @Giantwaffle do you still have your "never played ads badge"? I know you did a year or 2 ago
[5:38:39] Al_Kappaccino: yeah checking out diff streams is terrible with preroll
[5:38:39] lateknighthero: ads would be fine if they were like banner or minimized the stream but didnt block it entirely, losing many minutes of content without any way to see it cause amazon is greedy and likes Wendy's money is just horrible
[5:38:40] Rongoel: Also i hate that the ads break the interaction. Like i loose what i am tryign to watch
[5:38:42] Shantrix: trying to find a new stream is pain i stop doing it and just watch the same 3 streamers
[5:38:43] Grumpage: I get ads here as well
[5:38:44] Tro95: Andy Jassy is making Amazon become revenue-focused rather than customer-focused
[5:38:46] Al_Kappaccino: turbo ftw
[5:38:47] ohbi78: turbo has sorta saved twitch for me - no prerolls
[5:38:48] tomey36: Adds on twitch are out of control
[5:38:48] Spirevipp: YEP thats why i never look for any new channels
[5:38:48] Umoeder1: YEP
[5:38:48] Thr0h: just get Turbo
[5:38:49] Driitzz: ads u see from waffle are twitch prerolls ads nothing he can do about that PepeHands
[5:38:50] AlphaSchnauzer: I stopped searching tbh
[5:38:51] orneryman: for how much i watch twitch turbo was the best investment
[5:38:52] 8R00KS: But who gets the money is the thing
[5:38:59] Kaines: you watch add longer than the stream if you look for someone to watch
[5:38:59] InternetPlumber: i'm dreading when twitch fucks turbo
[5:38:59] Al_Kappaccino: yeah
[5:39:00] praxiz: if you pause a stream, for whatever reason, and then unpause it, you get ads
[5:39:02] Dagmoo: prerolls and no ads like waffle does is 100% the best way imo
[5:39:02] Crossed_legion: even adblock sucks
[5:39:08] bugsplatter23: imagine if you had to watch an ad every time you flipped channel on TV
[5:39:09] kypudo: ublock ftw
[5:39:10] Galline: i also have the problem where when i join a stream and get a preroll the audio is messed up so i have to refresh and then i get another preroll -.-
[5:39:11] Driitzz: fuck turbo ill never pay for that
[5:39:19] coolcake2: twitch prime doesnt even block ads anymore
[5:39:21] lateknighthero: i like prerolls CiGrip CiGrip
[5:39:24] MyFutureBoyfriend: 4
[5:39:25] Stragmol: the 1 is a figure

[5:39:27] Troptics: so i have auto refresh on over night for a small streamer, they get paid for every ad? LUL LUL LUL
[5:39:27] magyx__: 10000
[5:39:28] Kaines: four figures is 1000
[5:39:29] Muricanplayer: 3 figure is 100s 4 is 1000s
[5:39:33] AlphaSchnauzer: 1000+
[5:39:34] praxiz: "because of the zeros" he says ... so how did that engineering degree go? :D
[5:39:34] lordsandwish: Yoy mean monthly?
[5:39:37] Linkitch: I know some streamers can get $35k for running 3-5 ads an hour for like a month.
[5:39:42] 8R00KS: but if there is a buffer on prerolls only first person gets paid
[5:39:42] Muricanplayer: 1000-9999 is 4
[5:39:43] nellydocs: is there something different with the pistons in this modpack ? mine wont move :/
[5:39:44] sentient_pancakes: meanwhile every 30-60 minutes streams tend to bug out for me and i have to refresh and get another preroll
[5:39:45] Grumpage: so you make $99.99 max?
[5:39:46] Sloppy_D: He means 4 figs daily Kappa

[5:40:44] ohbi78: national teams generally dont have bonusses

[5:40:52] GuardMoony: Also a lot of countries have limited adds so getting to see the same add over and over is like ...
[5:40:52] AlphaSchnauzer: national is unpaid
[5:40:52] Fufcia: national teams dont get shit
[5:40:54] InternetPlumber: measured in a percentage of the GDP of Argentina
