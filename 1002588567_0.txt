[0:22:31] Z0eff: Poor Ravs yogHands
[0:22:36] bleualtair: @Z0eff bees require automation, something they never ever do.. this is gonna be a long one

[0:30:43] connor123123123: @pintpullinggeek The modern way of harvesting maple sap, tubes! More specifically, the system of interconnected clear rubber tubes that are connected to all of the maple trees, so all of the sap is consolidated and collected at the collection tank. You should look up maple sap tubes if you want to know what they look like.
[0:30:55] 8Bit__Shadow: pictures of spiderman?

[0:31:31] hgfhdhss: LUL
[0:31:33] Areleos: @yogscast that structure is only needed once you have an apiary. you need a nether star for it. also it needs to be the exact dimensions it says in the book for it to work.
[0:31:34] GoatCore: I think that is you put a flower next to a oak sapling there is a chance that a beehive wil be created when you grow the sapling.
[0:31:38] TheNightTaken: at least 1
[0:31:52] Jarl_Alrekr: bees need their personal space. They're very shy

[1:55:27] Ziul090: @BurnoodTakedown exactly what I was tinking
[1:55:31] Batman9889: and the dispenser has to bee full for the honey to pop out into the hopper below

[1:55:45] hgfhdhss: LUL
[1:55:51] zack44087: when you use a dispenser its basically right clicking with the tool, the shear makes the honeycomb shoot out. the bottle just gets filled

[1:56:20] mechanicalnimrod: @BurnoodTakedown But that's only the two of them. Her camera is too chunky

[1:57:33] ghostmander: just use bedrock ravs
[1:57:36] idemerzel: The beehive updates every time the honey level changes so you'll be losing glass bottles when extracting honey. You'll want to use a comparator to avoid that issue
[1:57:36] Ziul090: @mechanicalnimrod so its not because she is not in the office, lol, anyway just curious, carry on :)

[1:59:25] Redstonemonster: comparitor checks the honey level
[1:59:44] CrankyNessie123: when it reverts back to being empty it updates again
[1:59:47] QueenWooloo: Beehives update 3 times before they are ready to harvest
[1:59:50] bleualtair: it wont delete the bottle if tere isnt enough honey
[1:59:51] Batman9889: there can be 3
[1:59:52] georgepopsy: it doesnt use them if it doesnt have honey i think
[1:59:52] Redstonemonster: 4 stages
[1:59:56] SecondBreakfastPip: I think there's like 3 honey levels
[2:00:10] Blaarghl: honey level 5 will start producing honey everytime a bee enters the hive
[2:00:10] ThyXPer: but the bottle wont just get smashed right?
[2:00:11] BurnoodTakedown: I think I prefer the burps to the knuckle cracks
[2:00:27] Redstonemonster: that is why the preview uses a comparitor with a 4 long redstone line.
