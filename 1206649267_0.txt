[3:50:27] Captain__Kush187: Banned from what?
[3:50:49] VenomSpawn: Yeah, early on I thought people were messing with them, but then the lore got too detailed
[3:51:03] Fire_Breathing_Fish: banned from being played on the jukebox block in the game. there was a sign above it.
[3:51:11] VenomSpawn: Then I figured they knew about it, but were going in blind
