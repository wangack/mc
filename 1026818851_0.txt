[0:21:51] MiniMikeV1: @Z0eff actually matters i believe, also speeds things up if each bee can simultaneously pollinate. another thing is im pretty sure only two of the same type of bee can be in the apiary t once so no point having more that two bees of each type per hive

[2:01:10] starlitesparkl3: @ATGSilva the problem is the bee AI doesn't seem smart enough to use the sides of the blocks
[2:01:36] Mehby: on top of the forge lit?
[2:01:50] hgfhdhss: was that a loose chicken? LUL
[2:02:09] ATGSilva: it is, but they can access the top from the edges of the blocks if they have access to the sides, if they don't then they try to be directly on top

[2:02:43] Doomsailor1: @hgfhdhss they didn't want to be a pie
[2:02:51] starlitesparkl3: @ATGSilva from footage, it seems as if the bees get stuck on the edges trying to reach the center of the block and never end up pollinating the blocks, but not sure if the mods have changed that behaviour
