[0:44:50] Stillglade: are patterns or crafting cards automated?
[0:45:35] PureSpider: can't you look at the tree for manganese?
[0:45:43] snotneuss: is it a hard modpack?
[0:46:28] Yakobro: @snotneuss it's complicated, there's not really huge grinds or deadly enemies, but the logistics is the challenge
[0:46:35] PureSpider: yea seems like you're missing something
[0:46:46] Orin_The_Sly: Most people find this pack very complicated
[0:46:52] jayrickson87: microminer misson
[0:46:58] PureSpider: let pati figure it out YEP
[0:47:06] stormzwest: just follow the quest book

[0:47:20] Aeliel_: tier 2 gets you tantalite with manganese
[0:47:25] thebubbajones1: How far are we from ore generation?
[0:47:52] PureSpider: tantalite huh
[0:48:12] Yakobro: @Giantwaffle you can buy the ore and it gives a LOAD if you crush it, t2/3 microminers give it as byproducts
[0:48:15] drsnaki96: i think you could get it easily as tiny dust by-product from ore-washing something
[0:48:21] The_robstah: this modpack has my interest but i also feel like it would drive insane
[0:48:28] Aeliel_: maybe it's only HM sorry
[0:48:38] Yakobro: @Giantwaffle scheelite in t2 gives it afaik
[0:49:16] PureSpider: ah that's probably how
[0:49:21] PureSpider: seems a lot more feasible
[0:49:34] PureSpider: Yakobro Clap

[0:50:10] LuhHertz: "we just talked about it"
[0:50:11] thebubbajones1: Need a whiteboard behind you to keep track
[0:50:13] lukasalbert: crushing washing and centrifuge ?
[0:50:14] jayrickson87: you can make microminer tier 2 with what you have. you just have to manually craft the rocket
[0:50:24] Yakobro: @Giantwaffle to start off hv buy the pyrolusite ore with coins and macerate it I think
[0:50:24] MisterRabbitHead: bring back the whiteboard Pog

[3:42:55] calebhub514: Prism Launcher is basically the only other launcher that's needed. It downloads from pretty much all modpack sources as far as I know.
[3:42:59] KLemvig: i will try it and ftbapp, thanks alot guys :)
[3:43:00] Tymelord14: multiMC kinda ancient
[3:43:00] thepolaroidbear: Prism launcher is pretty good

[3:43:34] TheSparkVG: can i use without curseforge *
[3:43:38] calebhub514: FTB actually separated from Cursforge no? so they have their own app now
[3:43:46] Arimil: Stoneblock 3 can only be played on FTB
[3:43:47] BakaPixel: @Giantwaffle Stoneblock 3 isn't on Curseforge
[3:43:49] Koeckie: stoneblock 3 is not on cursed forge
[3:43:49] palagrim_: think FTB Inferno is FTB launcher only
[3:43:50] cmmeth: exculsive packs
[3:43:57] officialhunterx: they split
[3:43:57] Dizz1227: all the new FTB packs such as stoneblock 3, FTB inferno etc
[3:43:59] fishypooos: if you are on linux and can't use the curseforge app, ftbapp allows you to import from curseforge. Thats what i do
[3:43:59] kennycraig: yeah, ftb inferno
[3:44:00] jmm548: mad packs are only ftb right
[3:44:01] stormblaz: Weather in Texas atm?>
[3:44:13] ICATBUGI: with the ftb launcher you can the search option either between the ftb stuff or the curse forge stuff
[3:44:15] IlsaGold: f?

[3:45:32] calebhub514: AE2 channels get real old after the first couple of times you play with them
[3:45:41] LurkerNr5: automate the other steel rods for level emitters?
[3:45:52] Koeckie: @JacobSolo well it would fit the mod pack. just crazy annoying
[3:45:57] LurkerNr5: is that useful or overkill
[3:46:07] LurkerNr5: ah ok, makes sense

[4:06:23] Shame625: you also typed something in JEI search box
[4:06:26] Kinteshi: @gdawg99 yeah but to make/upgrade the models you would have to kill mobs in the normal version of the mod and thats what im asking
[4:06:26] razborsek: You need to wrench it then screwdriver it @Giantwaffle
[4:06:31] Pticrix: The game autofixed the big in the future with CodeGPT
[4:06:38] jayrickson87: right now he is capped at 32,000

[4:09:52] LethalBro: To then progress onwards from
[4:09:53] jayrickson87: speed up to slow back down when you get into the next tier of items takes longer and longer to process
[4:09:58] Skorpio1: like coated copper cables :)
[4:09:58] officialhunterx: im playing se right now
[4:10:00] officialhunterx: Kappa
[4:10:54] Sui_Ume: do you think you enjoy this kind of modpack more then something like PO3?

[4:11:56] TelRehiad: @BrickDickJr no. no channels
[4:12:12] Kinteshi: @Giantwaffle how do you upgrade the dml modules in this pack? since in the normal version of the mod you need to kill mobs to upgrade them atleast basic tier
[4:12:16] Jack_Snack_: why do you need the p2p then?
[4:12:21] KnightofObv: ender conduits are not set yet
[4:12:28] TelRehiad: @Jack_Snack_ to send power over the AE network

[4:13:41] Kinteshi: @ohbi78 ah okay thanks, im not actually playing it so no acces to a quest book sorry :)
[4:13:42] TelRehiad: @Kinteshi they level up automatically in the simulation chamber
[4:13:45] lukasalbert: ohhhh ok makes sense
[4:13:47] Salico: Bedge
[4:13:48] CyberParzival: technically a right spot for it but can go in either one huh
[4:14:11] babyaddalyn: set the enderio cqble
[4:14:13] GGoodGGuy: it is ze dead
[4:14:29] ohbi78: @TelRehiad in the normal version of DML you have to take the card out and kill X real mobs, in this you dont have to do that step
[4:14:46] Kinteshi: @TelRehiad yes they do but to use them in there you need to get the first lv, by selecting the mob and kill it a few times in the normal version of the mod thats why im asking but i got an answer
[4:14:57] kenshin2666: flying in a plane, are you listening to my gaming laptop? KEKW
[4:15:03] TelRehiad: makes sense

[4:18:22] Bernd135: To Autocraft these use a second level emitor and make it so that when redstone on it produces as then it can do both autocraft and stock crafting
[4:18:24] razborsek: You need aluminum wires for EV I think
[4:18:27] TelRehiad: @Glennox2009 if they are gregtech machines use wrench usually. the WAILA in the corner will tell you what tool to use

[5:45:22] GrumpyEngineer0: How enjoyable is Tarkov solo? I've been interested but I don't think any of my friends would play it.
[5:45:23] TrevorVictrus: I'm pretty sure its because they overlayed steam audio on a lot of their old stuff which was terrible
[5:45:32] MoshiMoshi0: @Giantwaffle steam audio is good, they removed it because it was heavy on performance
[5:45:36] GuardMoony: The audio was really bad on stairs
