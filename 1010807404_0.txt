[0:21:13] EZTEQ: Java 8
[0:21:16] kilian544: yes, 11 is so much more stable
[0:21:21] calebhub514: i only use Java 8 for minecraft lol, had problems with anything else
[0:22:06] Pain_cuit: You must create one to get older java
[0:22:06] kilian544: You need to, or use openjdk
[0:22:07] Askjong: nope :)
[0:22:09] GTLugo: you gotta make one
[0:22:10] sogerr: @Giantwaffle look for amazon version of java
[0:22:14] EZTEQ: Go to AdoptOpenJDK, that the real open source thing
[0:22:15] LordDynom: Don't worry, everyone hates Oracle
[0:22:15] devyndamonster: here's to hoping java 17 will be next LTS, and minecraft can use it
[0:22:26] gamerdog: use chocolatey
[0:22:28] GTLugo: For java 11, you need an account. Luckily they got rid of that in later versions
[0:22:28] calebhub514: I use Amazon Corretto, and then tell MultiMC to use whatever version I wanna use at the time
[0:22:33] EZTEQ: JDK requires an account, JRE not
[0:22:46] Joshuapetch: YEP
[0:22:47] Nickonil: is there mods for the win 10 version?
[0:22:50] kilian544: yes, or use some opensource thing
[0:22:51] Soul_Synergy: Yup dumbest thing ever for JDK
[0:22:52] sogerr: @Giantwaffle amazon has an open java version
[0:22:53] Jabald_: Jerry? Pog
[0:22:53] OneLickAway: poggers my fellow non-subs
[0:23:07] Tr0xi: Why not use openjdk?
[0:23:09] Jabald_: YEP Jerry
[0:23:14] mechoriet: Clap just use adoptopenjdk
[0:23:16] CantTouchDisNow: ETH monkaS
[0:23:17] n8level: yes, openjdk?
[0:23:25] winnerab: java is backwards compatible
[0:23:25] mechoriet: no you don't LUL
[0:23:28] QuesoBad0nga: check if you have 1.8 installed already @Giantwaffle
[0:23:28] kilian544: I use openjdk too
[0:23:34] GTLugo: JDK is the JRE now
[0:23:38] QuesoBad0nga: you can swap the enviroment variables if that is the case
[0:23:41] Apparentthreat: i've never made an oracle account for java
[0:23:45] lalashkin_G: @Giantwaffle maybe try openJDK?
[0:23:45] Apparentthreat: you're doing it wrong
[0:23:53] masztufa: "gonna take like 10 seconds" he says
[0:23:53] 0v3rfl0w: download open jdk 11
[0:23:57] Tabakhase: ofc
[0:24:06] GTLugo: JDK has the JRE. They're bundled in one
[0:24:07] kilian544: get the jdk
[0:24:12] kilian544: they are one now
[0:24:21] lalashkin_G: Oracle Java and Open JDK are different instances of Java

[0:24:35] EZTEQ: go to AdoptOpenJDK
[0:24:40] EZTEQ: there is everything wihtout an account
[0:24:46] Pine_Noir: Will only take 10 seconds PepLaugh
[0:24:52] sogerr: @Giantwaffle amazon corretto is what i use for java 11
[0:24:53] MrMoneybagMan: HACKERMANS im in
[0:24:57] QuesoBad0nga: @Giantwaffle go to program files and chekc if java 1.8 is installed. When you update generally it installs in a new folder and the older version remains
[0:24:59] OnoMario: HACKERMANS
[0:25:01] Nickonil: yeah i hate when random "accounts" asks for name and adress + potal code.. freaks me out
[0:25:02] Rubinix: JRE = Joe Rogan experiance?
[0:25:03] EZTEQ: It's the open source build of Java
[0:25:03] bind_mix: It's like when socials demand your phone number... I mean, kind of get it... but...
[0:25:08] lalashkin_G: @Giantwaffle because it's opensource Java realisation
[0:25:08] mechoriet: its not LUL its a opensource java build
[0:25:09] CtrlShiftR: openjdk ftw
[0:25:09] kilian544: just the opensource implementation for java
[0:25:10] Joshuapetch: Foggy
[0:25:12] Ladon_Dragon: Openjdk yeah
[0:25:17] 0v3rfl0w: https://jdk.java.net/archive/

[0:25:20] 0v3rfl0w: there you go
[0:25:21] Tr0xi: yes
[0:25:21] lalashkin_G: Yep

[0:25:24] calebhub514: Yep
[0:25:27] Tabakhase: use it almost everywhere these days
[0:25:28] Soul_Synergy: Yeah
[0:25:29] GreenyZA: Rubinix sound about right HAHAHA
[0:25:30] CtrlShiftR: that's the point
[0:25:31] Nicolas2701: OpenJDK is basically identical
[0:25:33] ZyianDev: Ye here's a performance report https://www.reddit.com/r/feedthebeast/comments/as6p87/java_vms_and_you_how_to_reduce_your_ram_and_cpu/
[0:25:35] noxiiiouse: Openjdk
[0:25:37] kilian544: not EXACTLY but you should never notice the differences
[0:25:37] htky_s: yeah it's just an implementation
[0:25:38] 0v3rfl0w: yes
[0:25:39] M1ke_RL: waffle, what's up my dude
[0:25:41] n8level: Free now means giving something of value, like your personal details.
[0:25:46] Flobu_: you only need the OpenJRE or not?
[0:25:46] 0v3rfl0w: it's identical

[0:27:15] BannedKidd: It is located in Austin Texas!
[0:27:18] bind_mix: A friend of mine works for Oracle, I'll have him sit up the CEO and get that fixed, lul.

[0:27:42] kilian544: You doe, but realisticly noone does lol
[0:28:02] aledantee: thats why amazon and microsoft have their own free java version lol
[0:28:04] kilian544: nope

[0:28:30] QuesoBad0nga: @Giantwaffle check java folder under porgram files
[0:28:30] usernameNull: you are not doing anything big enough to have to worry about it
[0:28:31] Joshuapetch: ^^
[0:28:36] 0v3rfl0w: yeah as long as not open jdk it's oracles
[0:28:44] 0v3rfl0w: Amazon got its own Java as well
[0:28:45] K4shira: do you really trust chat with a legal question?
[0:28:48] Soul_Synergy: You want an open source java version
[0:28:54] Joshuapetch: @usernameNull he sold many copies of his games
[0:28:56] Idez: their was a recent Supreme Court lawsuit between oracle and Java on this
[0:29:08] MartinSMihov: MartinSMihov subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 12 months! 
[0:29:08] MrMoneybagMan: chat 5Head
[0:29:08] sogerr: @Giantwaffle just get amazon version, that is free
[0:29:14] Spirevipp: https://openjdk.java.net/ for free java
[0:29:24] Joshuapetch: waffle run
[0:29:25] Joshuapetch: MONKERS
[0:29:29] 0v3rfl0w: and yes the open jdk website is shit as well
[0:29:31] Idez: oracle and Google sorry
[0:29:33] calebhub514: Yeah I use Amazon's compiled version of OpenJDK. And i'm pretty sure Google just went through a massive court case to make sure OpenJDK was good to go for everyone.
[0:29:35] MrPooter: what you working on?
[0:29:41] LokiRulez: its 100% the same things
[0:29:46] Soul_Synergy: Yes it will
[0:29:48] lalashkin_G: Same way
[0:29:51] LokiRulez: thats what linux uses
[0:29:56] 0v3rfl0w: it's identical
[0:29:59] n8level: years of making it work exactly the same
[0:29:59] 0v3rfl0w: same
[0:30:01] Soul_Synergy: You just need to link the path to it
[0:30:06] 0v3rfl0w: 10/10 identical
[0:30:09] Larklen: Okay who tf sold their Crypto, why are things going down
[0:30:10] aledantee: it does, you probably had an older gradle version set in the gradle wrapper
[0:30:20] Spirevipp: isnt microsoft working on their own version of openJDK?
[0:30:25] MJKalas: @Giantwaffle did u see doge today Pog
[0:30:30] Larklen: ( Kappa )

[0:30:45] 3DExtended: FUU
[0:30:48] GreenyZA: our government is busy with a court case against oracle ... Oracle says the government increased the licenses and therefor owes them like USD40mil
[0:30:53] Fronku: oof

[0:31:40] bind_mix: I made $30 on my DOGE selling at like, $0.05... but hey, it was a gain! :D
[0:31:45] Spirevipp: isnt java 8 the most stable for MC?
[0:31:46] Larklen: So who's ready for DSP? pepeLaugh
[0:31:52] Nickonil: what i saw was that the pack was finished.. i dont know why you wanna go back Keepo
[0:31:56] TarMonA: dont you have to tell Minecraft what java to use??
[0:32:02] RodriCraft93: hello good morning ma dude
[0:32:14] noxiiiouse: Im still using 8 for minecrafg
[0:32:30] Larklen: It's simple

[0:32:33] Larklen: You KILL the Batman
[0:32:38] Spirevipp: i also think most mc launchers have their own bundled java version
[0:32:43] cobalt_gaming_: Neither :)
[0:32:45] Larklen: NODDERS
[0:32:45] TarMonA: ya i am still using the built in java for minecraft
[0:32:58] TarMonA: should be 8
[0:33:00] aledantee: mojang bundles java 8
[0:33:00] LokiRulez: i havent even looked at dodge, i have 250k coin and if i look at it im afraid im gonna sell and get screwed later haha
[0:33:05] MakerOfThingys: JAVA downloads are confusing
[0:33:06] calebhub514: Minecraft laucher forces Java 8 update 25 I believe
[0:33:22] 0v3rfl0w: you are not dumb the site is shit as well
[0:33:26] Soul_Synergy: That should be fine
[0:33:50] toclosebutfar2: Java 8 is recommened alot in modpack discords i am in
[0:34:05] Automatizer: for some reason when I swap the java version in curseforge the game launches with the bundled version regardless which is dumb af
[0:34:07] dogma802: Is there no github link around?
[0:34:14] potetopotato: what happends when supercomputers can predict when to buy and sell bitcoins
[0:34:16] calebhub514: Most people use AdoptOpenJDK for the package download
[0:34:20] Wazix11: Pretty sure the site is adoptopenjdk
[0:34:22] mechoriet: YEP
[0:34:25] Soul_Synergy: 11 might not be on OpenJdk you'd want AmazonCorreto for opensource for 11 I think
[0:34:32] chochi314: AdoptOpenJDK is easiest option
[0:34:32] Spirevipp: ohh right, openJDK is only source or linux binaries
[0:34:32] aCookienot: go to adoptopenjdk
[0:34:40] EZTEQ: adoptopenjdk
[0:34:50] Egrassa22: adopt is better, yep
[0:34:52] mechoriet: nope other website
[0:34:53] aCookienot: different website
[0:34:54] Tabakhase: google Pepega
[0:35:01] kilian544: F My link  gets sniped lol

[0:35:08] ZyianDev: Clap
[0:35:09] EZTEQ: That's it
[0:35:09] chochi314: Yes, correct
[0:35:10] OnoMario: HACKERMANS
[0:35:15] Larklen: wrong.com
[0:35:16] Larklen: Kappa
[0:35:17] kilian544: That should be fine too yes
[0:35:18] Wazix11: you can also get it from ninite
[0:35:19] aCookienot: that's the one
[0:35:26] mechoriet: just blep that download button and done
[0:35:38] 0v3rfl0w: it's fine
[0:35:41] potetopotato: isnt java dead LUL
[0:35:44] DOOMinion: java makes me sick
[0:35:58] Larklen: Java far from dead OMEGALUL
[0:36:00] taurenite: java isn't dead lulw, only the hipsters hate it
[0:36:04] Larklen: Its awful but its far from it peepoSad
[0:36:09] 222lore: !followage
[0:36:12] bind_mix: Took Java classes years back, it was the worst learning to code in that. XD
[0:36:20] dogma802: Is it because Java isn't open source?
[0:36:21] potetopotato: online banking sites have quit using java long time ago
[0:36:22] aCookienot: you might want to get the adoptopenjdk update watcher too at some point
[0:36:24] Soul_Synergy: I don't really get why people hate java. It seems fine to me
[0:36:26] Foooks: Oracle's licensing is INSANE
[0:36:28] MrPooter: I was thinking about learning python,m then C. But from a cybersecurity/administration perpective
[0:36:29] devyndamonster: I thought java was cool, and then I found C# :)
[0:36:32] calebhub514: Google's preferred language for Java programming is Kotlin, it's all still Java Bytecode in the end though.
[0:36:48] potetopotato: security i think
[0:36:50] bind_mix: Nah, Java isn't bad, lol. Just confused me personally.
[0:37:00] kilian544: It's because oracle knows java is dying so they wanted money
[0:37:04] twiQsP: java sucks, like it's name already sucks
[0:37:05] Allmostdone: security mostly
[0:37:21] MisterMOONDog: Oracle owns Sun, which owned Java
[0:37:31] Allmostdone: java should burn in lava
[0:37:38] potetopotato: lol
[0:37:39] Soul_Synergy: They own their own JDK, JRE, and JVM but not the open source versions. They don't necessary own the language @Giantwaffle
[0:37:39] winnerab: java is good making stuff that just works, but it doesn't run great
[0:37:41] Foooks: Java is not bad... but Oracle changed the licensing model and wants PAID
[0:38:21] taurenite: openjdk is pretty much the same, just without the support
[0:38:30] Allmostdone: well after losing all that money in the andriod fight of course they want money
[0:38:44] Dukrah: Java compiles to intermediate .class files that are interpreted by the JVM. Other languges compile to that too. That makes it platform/language independent
[0:38:45] EZTEQ: binaries are licensed not java itself
[0:38:48] aledantee: you can use non-oracle versions for commercial purposes
[0:38:51] potetopotato: gta :)
[0:39:00] masztufa: i think making money from mods is also aginst minecraft TOS, but IDK
[0:39:06] Ranctifier: you'd need to know the APIs involved to do something like that and probably how to do REST properly
[0:39:07] obtoe_: sn15 scrub
[0:39:09] sogerr: @Giantwaffle there is no problem, google just won a law suit against oracle to prove its ok to use java

[0:39:15] Egrassa22: That's why they need your adress, to quickly find you :)

[0:44:02] DemonicHell3: they should have gone a bit deeper with the movie imo
[0:44:04] Slowkill333: it knew what it was....it was garbage...

[1:51:33] complexprotein: @calebhub514 I think adoption counteracts the volatility, since the more adoption the higher the market cap, the more money that'll take to "move" it. But that's a long way in the future
[1:51:51] CardboardBoaner: cant you just auto take out the green dye but it keeps the xp so after a while you just take one out and it gives you like 50 lvls

[1:59:37] Nilau: Looking at nyquist plots, adjusting controlers properly, finding the right controler for real world problems like circuits or mechanic problems @grimmn2
[1:59:39] FatRat_: The FTB app is so bad :(
[1:59:42] BeardSyndicate: multimc ftw!!
[1:59:45] FatRat_: Thankfully curseforge exists
[1:59:47] Hakusa: Multimc is way nicer
[1:59:53] FatRat_: but I wish multiMC could update modpacks easier
[1:59:53] mechoriet: YEP also free overwolf crap
[1:59:54] masztufa: nilau, linear control?
[1:59:56] NonSix: multimc is pog
[1:59:59] jachred: thats a 1.16 feature I think
[2:00:01] Nilau: making the transfer functions, building their block diagrams... that stuff
[2:00:08] Frozen_Shadow1: try hopper out, that how it works in vanilla
[2:00:08] masztufa: ye, linear control
[2:00:10] grimmn: @Nilau mmmm good stuff, I miss controls classes
[2:00:15] jachred: in 1.12 the XP doesn't stay in the furnace
[2:00:24] FatRat_: having to download a second copy of a modpack shouldnt be the way to update, its just not convenient
[2:00:45] Dawcio239: waffleNS
[2:00:48] NonSix: yeah idk for sure
[2:00:54] Bobo_1057: that's from 1.13
[2:01:25] moshemaz: One more question, does CurseForge is updating modpacks?, or do I have to download on each update?
[2:01:41] Aurielli: you got 2 nuggets while watching it lol
[2:01:42] Moobot: You can sub to Waffle by clicking this neat link -> twitch.tv/giantwaffle/subscribe
[2:01:47] Dawcio239: waffleT1
[2:01:55] WGG25: btw, if you want to be more efficient with levels, only keep as much on you as you need @Giantwaffle
[2:01:58] QuesoBad0nga: F?
[2:02:00] babyaddalyn: @moshemaz it updates
[2:02:10] moshemaz: @Milexna Thanks
[2:02:18] WGG25: "only" 1 level when you are at lvl 5-7+ is a lot
[2:02:50] Larklen: pepeSmoke
[2:02:56] CardboardBoaner: why are most modpacks 1.12
[2:03:03] yellowspy: You could make a redstone furnace and pulverizer
[2:03:04] BennyF_Jr: @Larklen NOPERS
[2:03:14] Nilau: pepeSmoke NODDERS
[2:03:23] Larklen: NODDERS 👉 pepeSmoke
[2:03:25] yellowspy: Smelt>pulverize >smelt...
[2:03:31] Doomwyte: 1.16 has tons of mods
[2:03:34] masztufa: 1.12 is a version that has a lot of mods, and now it has many players, so more mods are coming out to 1.12, etc
[2:03:36] babyaddalyn: 1.16 is the new 1.12
[2:03:51] masztufa: 1.7.10 was the previous "big" version
[2:03:59] jachred: maybe make a cow farm?
[2:04:05] kennycraig: 1.7.10 Kreygasm
[2:04:12] masztufa: 1.17 is a tech mod though Kappa
[2:04:28] FatRat_: Id like Fabric to take over as the main API
[2:04:31] n8level: I don't expect caves & cliffs to be fully in until 1.18
[2:04:32] FatRat_: but we'll see
[2:04:57] FatRat_: Id also like AMD to fix their terrible OpenGL driver buuuut thats a pipe dream sadKEK
[2:05:14] CardboardBoaner: green > red
[2:05:17] CoolReal: How does Forge make money? Patreon?
[2:05:19] Aurielli: unbreaking on iron pick?
[2:05:26] Aurielli: or did i see that wrong
[2:05:34] Azafure: ^
[2:05:41] calebhub514: MinecraftForge is it's own thing
[2:05:48] FatRat_: Forge never got bought
[2:05:49] daemonaedryn: Advertisements maybe?
[2:05:52] FatRat_: no?
[2:06:03] masztufa: FTB was bought
[2:06:05] CardboardBoaner: amazon bought it then overwolf did
[2:06:06] FatRat_: ^
[2:06:17] calebhub514: MinecraftForge has a patreon and ads on downloads. that's how they get supported. Curseforge/Overwolf is it's own thing
[2:06:19] Allmostdone: Forge was owned by blacksmith
[2:06:20] babyaddalyn: yes
[2:06:25] Helo_KiX: Is Curseforge the same as Mincraft Forge?
[2:06:26] Star579: Minecraft Forge gets all it's own money from the devs , donations and ads.
[2:06:27] masztufa: FTB is a team of modpack devs, they didn't make forge
[2:06:40] masztufa: ok, maaaybe there's overlap, but they are not forge
[2:06:42] Helo_KiX: I thought they were 2 different things
[2:06:43] Aurielli: i think you put unbreaking on an iron pick btw
[2:06:46] Klorell: if you want faster update cycle wont it kill small dev because it becomes too time consuming and need to be paid
[2:06:46] FatRat_: Seems like we need to smash all these into one entitiy, but exclude overwolf forever
[2:07:10] Azafure: @Aurielli It was soulbound I believe
[2:07:19] CardboardBoaner: they probably got a lot of money from the amazon and overwolf deals
[2:07:30] allthegold__: @Giantwaffle Do you own a wafflemaker?
[2:07:31] Aurielli: ah, maybe i'm just too tired KEKW
[2:07:34] masztufa: just use multiMC instead?
[2:07:39] Dagmoo: KomodoHype
[2:07:42] daemonaedryn: wafflePog
[2:08:01] Evoti: why do you not repair them??
[2:08:06] Allmostdone: Why would he own something that would kill him?
[2:08:10] CardboardBoaner: if you have to go through the pick why enchant with unbreaking
[2:08:26] DaFez_: @Allmostdone what do you mean? It makes him
[2:08:41] ecnerw4l: how much power is your reactor now
[2:08:52] Allmostdone: but he's already done. What do people do with burnt waffles?
[2:09:00] Aurielli: @theboan13 Unbreaking means you have a chance on use to not use durability.
[2:09:01] QuesoBad0nga: @theboan13 more durability more diamond nuggets
[2:09:30] her0zer0: why was the output so low?
[2:09:37] CardboardBoaner: yeah but if his main goal rn is for bedrock it would just be faster to not use unbreaking
[2:09:56] Sn00zr: Doesnt that already exist on console?
[2:09:57] Moobot: You can find Waffle's Youtube channel here - https://youtube.com/giantwaffle
[2:09:58] kennycraig: consoles KEKW
[2:09:59] Jamswhat2: Console or mobile ??
[2:09:59] Kaldhax: Is there a way in this mode to have wireless power? Or do you have to remake new power sources for your machines?
[2:10:02] QuesoBad0nga: yes and no, because diamond nuggets are a pain in the ass to get
[2:10:12] masztufa: this sounds like a terrible idea
[2:10:12] Nilau: Imagine buying mods
[2:10:25] Allmostdone: yep. that's right
[2:10:31] swiftreaper4: there are things like that on console
[2:10:33] Aurielli: @theboan13 What do you mean? :D He has a chance on each use to get a bedrock chunk, not "when the pick is used you get one"
[2:10:40] MegaCosa: imagine developing for atari for the money now
[2:10:42] funkymunkie_: pretty sure that's kind of a thing already
[2:10:51] masztufa: we need an API for minecraft like what factorio has
[2:10:51] Varnstuf21: will there ever be mods on console?
[2:10:52] Star579: PaidMods = Far more trouble then you think.
[2:10:52] CardboardBoaner: @Aurielli thats what he said that you get one when the pick breaks
[2:10:52] Allmostdone: and all the people buying fortnite or POE?
[2:10:53] aman36000: Honestly, I'd pay for a mod if i know it will be around a while and is high quality
[2:10:55] Skidz__: Way more than 1k for a mod, Maps that get made can sell between 3k-7k USD
[2:11:00] FatRat_: Mod devs will be spread too thin if they have to also deal with console
[2:11:01] swiftreaper4: you can buy like furniture stuff
[2:11:02] HoytZephyr: Or it will and they will just dual develop for Bedrock edition and Java
[2:11:04] Nilau: I will just stay with 1.7.10 pepeLaugh
[2:11:07] Winner5001: is bedrock edition modded?
[2:11:11] Azafure: @theboan13 Yeah because the chance is so low it's like 0.00069 or something
[2:11:19] CardboardBoaner: @Giantwaffle do you get bedrock when the pick breaks or a chance on each hit
[2:11:40] masztufa: whatever, i know i'll keep playing GTNH until the end of time LUL
[2:11:49] JerryLubrano: most people See people playing java, but most people actually play bedrock
[2:11:52] masztufa: and still won't have finished it
[2:11:52] CardboardBoaner: now it makes sense
[2:11:52] kennycraig: imagine playing modpack on a controller with all the different binds
[2:12:24] FatRat_: Idk what I would even do with a vanilla game
[2:12:28] CardboardBoaner: what do you think about discord and psn working together
[2:12:36] Hippopothomas: its amazing
[2:12:50] masztufa: @FatRat_ i see 1.16, i can't even tell it's vanilla at this point
[2:13:00] Hippopothomas: imagine discord on a console and not to mention playstations messaging system is AWFUL
[2:13:14] Archelonde: I think im gonna replay subnautica to get prepped for below zero soon
[2:13:15] masztufa: plus we get ore doubling in 1.17...
[2:13:17] venbob2123: Didn't they try to move to monetized mods and the modding community essentially shouted down anyone who did it?
[2:13:45] Azafure: YEP ores drop chunks now which u can fortune
[2:13:47] MetalBBA: yeah isn't bedrock "modding" garbage
[2:14:02] grimmn: what's so hard about C++? Kappa
[2:14:09] masztufa: metal ores drop "ore chunks" that are affected by fortune. So it's basically ore doubling
[2:14:14] CardboardBoaner: i remeber they had a skin store
[2:14:15] babyaddalyn: ever checked out RTX on mc?
[2:14:19] Feartjeh: Bedrock also really buggy
[2:14:19] Diavolio: It's an inevitability
[2:14:23] WGG25: @grimmn2 remove the kappa and it's true
[2:14:26] DigitalVortex92: !f
[2:14:26] Moobot: Failure to complete a proper multi-line emote in chat gets a timeout BOP KEKW Attempt at your own risk!
[2:14:27] Winner5001: f
[2:14:28] Azafure: f
[2:14:29] Jamswhat2: KEKW
[2:14:30] Allmostdone: and no gaunetee that MS will allow modded for bedrock
[2:14:31] swiftreaper4: F
[2:14:33] KnickKen: invest now in modpacks and sell the news later KEKW
[2:14:38] CardboardBoaner: f
[2:14:38] complexprotein: monkaGun GOT EM
[2:14:41] n8level: the future of console mods ... the MC devs incorporate mod ideas in baseline MC
[2:14:42] MrCheesySausage: They could go the route that bethesda did
[2:14:44] Archelonde: get BOP 'd
[2:14:47] subfin: but that wasn't even a real 2x2 D:
[2:14:56] grimmn: @WGG25 LUL I agree but I use it for my job
[2:14:58] Jamswhat2: so are they supposed to use C#? :)
[2:15:03] peacekeper24: bonkbonk
[2:15:09] CardboardBoaner: @MrCheesySausage what over hype a shit game and go broke
[2:15:10] masztufa: i can't see them allowing native C++ code though. Not even factorio allows native C++ mods
[2:15:14] GTLugo: bedrock uses c#, no?
[2:15:16] Winner5001: is the bop a timeout or a ban?
[2:15:18] masztufa: they're lua scripts (i think)
[2:15:21] Allmostdone: MS current fetish is cloud gaming
[2:15:25] HoytZephyr: @GTLugo soarynWave
[2:15:30] MegaCosa: !nextlaunch
[2:15:32] GTLugo: Heya Zephyr
[2:15:40] Archelonde: Terraria's mod browser is a seperate download that just integrates into the main menu right?
[2:15:43] MrCheesySausage: @theboan13 I meant Skyrim and Fallout 4 not the one we dont speak about
[2:15:45] zebadrabbit: c# would be amazing
[2:15:59] DandyPanda: Waffle do you still 3D print stuff
[2:16:01] Hippopothomas: @Archelonde no its a different executable entirely
[2:16:02] TheIrishGuy: C++ is bedrock
[2:16:16] GTLugo: Ah, yes, it uses C++
[2:16:20] Hippopothomas: Your normal chars wont even load there .
[2:16:27] CardboardBoaner: i fr fr dont want to study more for this calc final i got in 2 hours
[2:16:29] n8level: devie devie!
[2:16:32] Archelonde: @Archelonde Ah ok, thanks!
[2:16:32] Star579: You can use C++, C# and VB with native UWP application
[2:16:33] GTLugo: I figured they'd use C# since it's owned by Microsoft
[2:16:33] WGG25: that's everyone who hates on C++, they are just shit at it KEKW
[2:16:39] Allmostdone: or C--
[2:17:03] StOrMy1100: Why was SN15 scrubbed?
[2:17:04] Igneous3: plug it in
[2:17:08] Aurielli: already sleeping
[2:17:11] Brianmose12: peepoBlonket
[2:17:11] masztufa: isn't managed code less useful for games?
[2:17:12] Apparentthreat: anyone type cpp instead of c++
[2:17:19] CardboardBoaner: @StOrMy1100 it was dirty LUL
[2:17:21] masztufa: C=C+1 > c++
[2:17:27] DigitalVortex92: Only when talking about bloodshed cpp
[2:17:32] htky_s: isn't bedrock's scripting language javascript?
[2:17:33] DigitalVortex92: otherwise no
[2:17:34] zebadrabbit: @Apparentthreat only when compiling
[2:17:56] WGG25: @masztufa ++C 🙂
[2:17:56] TheIrishGuy: I stayed up all last night to finish my App in Kotlin Assignment  , I really does want to make me sleep
[2:17:57] winchesterboys: there is diamond in there

[2:18:14] TheIrishGuy: the Song ****
[2:18:24] masztufa: can i link something?
[2:18:31] DigitalVortex92: @Giantwaffle My covid shot is making me tired. But i can't sleep cause its also keeping me awake haHAA
[2:18:32] masztufa: (yes, the uncyclopedia page for C++)
[2:18:33] Apparentthreat: the minecraft makes you want to sleep?
[2:18:44] Frozen_Shadow1: you doing all quests or just the bed rock breaker? @Giantwaffle
[2:18:50] Drazer_: @digitalvortex92 I'm in the exact same boat
[2:19:04] DigitalVortex92: I just got my 2nd dose yesterday cobaltHands
[2:19:08] TheIrishGuy: Im 1 more month away to be able to get my First Shot
[2:19:14] CardboardBoaner: litterally just stay extremely hydrated and take tylenol and you good
[2:19:19] Bbluess: which modpack will waffle play next?
[2:19:20] OhTick: I get my second one thursday Pog
[2:19:21] Surge43: it wasn't that bad.
[2:19:22] Aurielli: i'm getting my 2nd dose on the 25th Pog
[2:19:28] aman36000: I got my 2nd last week, It hit me like a truck
[2:19:30] Jamswhat2: why get the 1st dose if theyre not gonna go all the way FeelsBadMan ????
[2:19:35] Allmostdone: to stupid or to chicken

[2:19:39] phold0: I've done my part
[2:19:39] dabeda1: but MUH FREEDOM
[2:19:39] Mikael_x: Why, you will get more waves of Covid
[2:19:45] Larklen: Just follow New Jersey's steps and offer a free beer with your shot KEKW
[2:19:46] Jester_5240: thankfully I'll get my second dose next week
[2:19:46] Stormflare: eventually enough unvaccinated people will catch it that it becomes de facto herd immunity
[2:19:47] shinigami312: People can still get sick and become immune
[2:19:51] Opusdeity: I got the J&J shot Saturday and have been knocked out since.  One and done is ROUGH
[2:19:59] Archelonde: My gov just started over 50 year old groups first shot, its gonna be like next year until I can even try to get mine :)
[2:20:04] KnickKen: is it the first time those ppl get vaccinated?
[2:20:05] zebadrabbit: i got both of mine done, 1st made me feel a little bad for a day but thats it
[2:20:06] masztufa: i didn't even feel anything, except for when i tried to raise my arm
[2:20:07] Diavolio: @Stormflare Not with how quickly it's mutating
[2:20:07] Allmostdone: That's the Americans I know. Really stupid to the point of death
[2:20:10] DigitalVortex92: @Opusdeity but you've got booster shots ahead of you much sooner than any of the 2 parters
[2:20:12] Frozen_Shadow1: already both shots, no side effects for me
[2:20:16] DigitalVortex92: so you're not really done
[2:20:16] dogma802: @shinigami312 Isn't the immunity from getting it really short lived. I know it's common for people to get covid twice in a row
[2:20:17] Stormflare: i had no problems with the 1st shot but the 2nd one knocked me on my ass. ive heard that the first one is bad if you already had covid
[2:20:21] n8level: not everyone can take a sick day for the day after getting 2nd shot if it hits them hard, seems about 50% based on my friends experiences
[2:20:26] CardboardBoaner: @Opusdeity when i got it i was fucked for 2 days but i had to drive 5 hours the next day
[2:20:26] StOrMy1100: It won't go away anyway. Even if Texas or the US get heard immunity, other countries won't and it will keep spreading around the world
[2:20:27] Vosy1984: FUCK! did I miss the launch? what happen?
[2:20:32] Larklen: @Vosy1984 scrubbed
[2:20:34] Tompop23: @giantwaffle at least in the uk it seems one brand you get side effects after the first dose and a different you get it after the second lol
[2:20:37] TheIrishGuy: Ireland 1Mil Vaxed with population of 5Mil, America 200Mil with 400mil population
[2:20:39] BeastboySAW: Define “a lot”. It was .0007%
[2:20:45] Evoti: @Giantwaffle take a look on denmark
[2:20:47] bugsplatter23: Or theyve heard the second dose is worse
[2:20:48] Vosy1984: Larklen F
[2:20:48] n8level: the vaccination promo from NZ is pretty legit
[2:20:49] Allmostdone: My country is America.. lol
[2:20:53] Malkariss1: oh yeah america is by far the furthest ahead for vacanations
[2:20:53] ThanatosXRagnarok: Covid was never going to go away.  The whole purpose of the vaccine is not to eradicate the virus, but lessen the severity of the symptoms when you do get it.
[2:20:57] Brianmose12: to be fair that is because the US has been hoarding vaccines
[2:20:57] Daanaas: Denmark is Already Done Waffle
[2:20:58] calebhub514: To be fair, it's because they literally can't get vaccines.
[2:20:59] DigitalVortex92: @n8level In NA, companies literally HAVE to give you time for the covid shot im pretty sure LUL
[2:21:01] calebhub514: usually
[2:21:01] Balafore: Canada is way behind on vaccines.
[2:21:13] poggiewooggie: Lmao
[2:21:14] SvenQoala: Doubt X, Israel is already at 70%
[2:21:20] WoofWoofDude: its slow af here in canda
[2:21:22] poggiewooggie: DOUBT
[2:21:26] SnoLys: that's because the US is hoarding vaccines and ingredients to make vaccines
[2:21:33] Allmostdone: It's we (American) re to damn dumb
[2:21:35] Gerthil: @Giantwaffle Are you in the states?
[2:21:36] Star579: Israele is the one with the most vaccinated
[2:21:38] grimmn: canada is starting to catch up though, has definitely been slow so far
[2:21:41] CardboardBoaner: @Daanaas thats just factually not true, only 12% are vaccinated
[2:21:43] Aurielli: germany is picking up the pace with vaccinations PogChamp
[2:21:49] Sn00zr: Just booked my first shot for June.
[2:21:50] DigitalVortex92: @Star579 That's not surprising. It's Israel LUL
[2:21:57] Nilau: @Aurielli we are still so slow tho :(
[2:22:02] DigitalVortex92: Israel has their own SUEZ canal plans LUL
[2:22:04] ecnerw4l: @giantwaffle by mid may everyone aboce 18 or something can be vacc in canada
[2:22:08] WoofWoofDude: next week 25+ we can take an apointement in quebec.. not sure when the date is ganna be
[2:22:12] CapnCrunch301: And increase chance of mutation
[2:22:24] freddonia: it also has something to do with america beeing able to purchase more vaccines than most european countries :)
[2:22:29] Aurielli: @Nilau I mean 5mil doses last week was pretty nice. We should hit 50mil this month
[2:22:30] toprateluckie: that is where natural selection comes in
[2:22:36] poggiewooggie: It’s better to take more time to vaccinate than just getting the first dose 0Head
[2:22:39] Daanaas: theboan13 i Read on Nl news that denmark Was close to Be Done WHAT
[2:22:40] Daanaas: WEl F
[2:22:41] Archelonde: Can we get our 2 weeks covid specific sick leave KEKW
[2:22:41] dogma802: Isn't there an upper limit to how deadly a virus can be and still spread
[2:22:41] SnoLys: it survived the spanish flu
[2:22:45] Jamswhat2: dump airliness monkaS
[2:22:50] jachred: We will get therapeutics to make you feel better faster and less deadly...  But yeah the economy is forever changed
[2:22:51] DigitalVortex92: I mean, no one thoughtit would for the depression either. It'll find a awy
[2:22:53] grimmn: @ecnerw4l that's the recommended timeline, actual dates vary by province
[2:22:58] CardboardBoaner: @Daanaas bruh you should know to never listen to the news
[2:23:01] isfil: You can't eliminate Covid, i saw a video telling that was pretty much impossiblem to erraticate the virus
[2:23:02] SinfulOnline: But vaccination rate for the US is only shot#1, right? So it's a bit of a moot point if people are refusing shot#2?  In Sweden, literally haven't heard of a single case where someone refused or didn't want shot#2.
[2:23:02] Igneous3: first shots were free, economy built on pharmaceuticals
[2:23:08] Gerthil: @Giantwaffle Are you invested in Ethereum?
[2:23:10] Daanaas: Butt
[2:23:11] Nilau: @Aurielli I really hope so! I'm optimistic that we might have a decent summer this year again. Not back to pre covid, but atleast hanging around with friends again etc
[2:23:12] Frozen_Shadow1: @SnoLys spanish flu also burnt it's self out
[2:23:14] Daanaas: butt
[2:23:15] Asuppa180: yes @marqueezus , generally more deadly means it spreads less... generally
[2:23:23] CapnCrunch301: Did you hear that the launch got scrubbed?
[2:23:27] calebhub514: People also actually masked up for the spanish flu KEKW
[2:23:29] CapnCrunch301: Kappa
[2:23:32] poggiewooggie: @sinfulonline true
[2:23:37] hendyius: Name one RNA "vaccine" that has been FDA approved after their 2 year trial
[2:23:37] Biskit427: My hq for work holds over 10,000 people.
[2:23:37] DigitalVortex92: @SinfulOnline im sure there are cases, but US media is blow WELL out of proportion across the globe so it's hard to properly judge it
[2:23:41] SnoLys: @Frozen_Shadow1 because "everyone" got contaminated... specially with ww1 sending and returning people all over
[2:23:42] Aurielli: @Nilau Same man - same. I just want to go to the office again KEKW
[2:23:48] Allmostdone: It shows that push to shove people (us-US) were to chicken to finish getting two shots. We don't finish meds that or doctor prescribe
[2:23:53] CardboardBoaner: its going to be the same as many viruses where it is still around a long time in the future but its in the background just with some people getting it every now and again but not really a problem
[2:23:53] Mikael_x: Environmental crisis is more urgent than Covid,
[2:23:56] CapnCrunch301: But Alex Jones said.......
[2:23:58] Bbluess: !modpack
[2:23:58] Moobot: Waffle is playing the Compact Claustrophobia modpack (on v1.12.2) via CurseForge! The modlist: modpackindex.com/modpack/5547/compact-claustrophobia
[2:23:58] poggiewooggie: Ppl refusing the second shot lmao 0Head natural selection
[2:24:02] DigitalVortex92: @Otebe301 FailFish
[2:24:11] Arimil: I haven't got vaccinated yet, I'll just wait I'm not in a hurry to go places.
[2:24:13] jachred: We are back to normal here in Oklahoma, and Texas
[2:24:16] CapnCrunch301: @DigitalVortex92 ;)
[2:24:22] Daanaas: aaaa
[2:24:22] ThanatosXRagnarok: @Giantwaffle The vaccine is not designed to eradicate covid.  It is designed to lessen the severity of the symptoms.
[2:24:27] nick43087: 2nd one was today.  So it's wasn't me.  @poggiewooggie
[2:24:30] n8level: the dose IS the reward, gah NotLikeThis
[2:24:32] zebadrabbit: im going to continue to wear my facemask in places like the bank cuz you could never do that before- trying to get my fill
[2:24:33] Aurielli: that would piss antivaccers off KEKW
[2:24:35] dogma802: That'd probably depend on your income bracket
[2:24:35] aman36000: @Giantwaffle I read the study, its not so much that we arnt vaccinating enough...which is true, but moreso that the virus mutates too quickly for the speed we are vaccinating
[2:24:36] Xicer_TV: Weed for shots here in DC
[2:24:38] Sn00zr: Krispy Kreme giving donuts. KEKW
[2:24:38] Daanaas: theboan13  my bad yea i read Wrong LUL
[2:24:40] im_just_sean: Why do you think the swine flu didn’t cause so much panic as COVID did?
[2:24:49] CardboardBoaner: i find it funny asf that florida texas and other places that have been open forever have decreased in rona cases
[2:24:53] Allmostdone: getting to close to finish then backing out
[2:24:55] ThanatosXRagnarok: @Giantwaffle Because of that fact, there won't be herd immunity
[2:25:01] hendyius: your probably not going to die from Covid anyway
[2:25:04] Stormflare: its 100% effective at protecting against a severe case and 95% immunity against any covid
[2:25:05] saltyspitoon73: just had Covid, flu is worse
[2:25:24] BeastboySAW: It will never completely go away. It will be like the flu. You will get your shot once a year. It will become a normal thing. Those who don’t get the shot will get COVID and die. Eventually we get herd immunity that way.
[2:25:27] Opsidill: 60% resistance and transmission after first dose
[2:25:27] CardboardBoaner: @saltyspitoon73 really dependent on the person
[2:25:27] Asuppa180: My generally introvert lifestyle means I haven't even had the flu in like 10 years hah
[2:25:31] KabuLKurt: there was a world before AIDS and there was a world before Covid, make ur peace with it, that it will never be the same as before.
[2:25:38] poggiewooggie: @nick43087 gg
[2:25:41] Allmostdone: yep. keep think that just because you states are open means the cases are lower
[2:25:41] CardboardBoaner: i find it funny asf that florida texas and other places that have been open forever have decreased in rona cases
[2:25:43] Jamswhat2: @BeastboySAW true monkaX
[2:25:45] Mikael_x: The covid crises is solved with vaccine, just can be some 5 shots to get it under controll
[2:25:47] b0tmau: If you add an incentive antivaxxers will just continue spewing their conspiracy theories and not want to get it
[2:25:48] freddonia: @saltyspitoon73 for you it might be worse with the flu but not for all
[2:25:49] ItsHandyManny: At amazon they are giving $40 per and 10 unpaid time per dose
[2:26:10] IceBlueFire: Oh no, who set Waffle off on talking about Covid again...
[2:26:11] Moobot: Support Waffle by using his Epic creator code: Giantwaffle
[2:26:11] poggiewooggie: NA vs EU OMEGALUL
[2:26:15] n8level: @KabuLKurt Correct. Change never cares what you want.
[2:26:29] Stormflare: if you make travelling and shit locked behind a vaccine a lot of people that would not otherwise get it would get it
[2:26:35] grimmn: people who genuinely believe that's there are 5G chips or whatever in the vaccine will never be convinced of anything different
[2:26:36] Sarktastik: Moderna pt 2 kicked my ass.
[2:26:36] Dagmoo: people have the BIG dumb if thats their "logic" though
[2:26:36] KnickKen: i got hit moderatly, but hell of course i will get my second shot...
[2:26:45] Apparentthreat: saw something about the flu on reddit where it's kind of gone since people weren't traveling to warmer climates where the flu mutates and then bringing it back, etc. Not sure how accurate it was
[2:26:47] Mikael_x: what is hit hard by the vaccine, 2-3 days under the weather
[2:26:48] grimmn: so there's no point caring what they think
[2:26:49] Allmostdone: and I'm sure that actually getting Covid is worse than the vacine
[2:26:52] Daanaas: He Na start To ramp Up the vacsine and now its getting F
[2:26:53] hendyius: funny that people that just want to wait for the "vaccine" to be FDA approved before getting it are called anti-vaxxers
[2:26:55] poggiewooggie: So you’ve chosen death..
[2:27:02] SnoLys: they are already, they will just add covid
[2:27:06] BeastboySAW: There already is a incentive program. Take your shot card to Krispy Kreme for a free donut everyday.
[2:27:06] CardboardBoaner: @Stormflare more people would protest because youre actually limiting their freedom
[2:27:15] Daanaas: U need In eu Only 1 dose
[2:27:25] ThanatosXRagnarok: There are conspiracy websites out there telling people to just forge the vaccine cards.
[2:27:27] CardboardBoaner: "funny that people that just want to wait for the "vaccine" to be FDA approved before getting it are called anti-vaxxers" <-THIS
[2:27:27] Warkless: People are "appalled" about the "need" for it to travel, but they forget that it already exist KEKW
[2:27:28] Daanaas: to travek
[2:27:31] Stormflare: within 6 months iirc
[2:27:32] Daanaas: travel
[2:27:34] pupupuputter: Budweiser is giving out a free beer if you get vaccinated
[2:27:34] simoncs: In Denmark we give the second dose 4 weeks after the first one
[2:27:41] indicaSalad: -burns my Nike- "nut uh"
[2:27:47] dogma802: @Daanaas For any vaccine or just specific ones? I think JnJ was supposed to be a single dose
[2:27:51] aman36000: @Giantwaffle Second dose can be  anytime within 6 months as loing as at least 2 weeks
[2:27:51] SnoLys: you already need certain vaccines to go to certain countries, like yellow fever vaccine
[2:27:51] wannewanwanban: wannewanwanban subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 17 months! Pog
[2:27:54] masztufa: how many chunks?
[2:27:57] CardboardBoaner: JnJ is a single dose
[2:28:08] ninopanda: is it bad that i dont want to meet my CEO even thought we both have been fully vaxed?
[2:28:10] Daanaas: Most needs 2 dose
[2:28:24] BeardSyndicate: whats the TLDR/end-goal of this pack @Giantwaffle
[2:28:24] StoppingRocket: yeah why are some needing 2 shot s while others need just 1?
[2:28:24] masztufa: nah, that's just normal
[2:28:26] Daanaas: But to travel U need 1 dose
[2:28:27] Apparentthreat: need resistance built from the first one before getting second one, I guess. Wouldn't be as effective if got 2nd one sooner
[2:28:28] poggiewooggie: @aman36000 WRONG
[2:28:31] CardboardBoaner: wasnt JnJ cancelled or something cause there was a problem
[2:28:31] Stormflare: J&J is also not as effective as pfizer or moderna
[2:28:38] ROB3RTDOWN3YJR: If we don’t require kids to be vaccinated to go to school then how are we going to restrict travel bc of COVID vaccine, just not likely at least domestically
[2:28:38] OhTick: @BeardSyndicate get out of the cubes lol
[2:28:41] hendyius: JnJ is not the same as the pfizer and maderna etc.. It's more like a traditional antigen vaccine.. not the cocktail RNA therapy
[2:28:44] calebhub514: correct
[2:28:47] Stormflare: yes
[2:28:48] Jamswhat2: JnJ is 1 shot
[2:28:50] SnoLys: its not, its adenovirus like AZ
[2:28:51] dogma802: @ninopanda Just wear a mask if you're that hesitant
[2:28:55] K4shira: is't an Adenovirus vaccine
[2:28:58] grimmn: @Stormflare the trial results cannot be directly compared to each other, there's context that affected the numbers
[2:29:00] pupupuputter: they have said pfizer it may even require a 3rd shot later
[2:29:05] Apparentthreat: That "not as effective" is not true
[2:29:08] K4shira: it's like AZ and Sputnik V
[2:29:13] TelRehiad: JJ is the same as they used to make vaccines
[2:29:13] Allmostdone: I think J&J was process making process not he meds themselves
[2:29:14] zebadrabbit: we're going to hear a lot about mrna treatments in the next chapter of our lives
[2:29:16] Apparentthreat: J&J tested when COVID was more prevalent
[2:29:17] ninopanda: @marqueezus masks are required in my office. but he isnt from my state.....
[2:29:22] calebhub514: JnJ is a modified adenovirus that presents the spike protein for covid-19.
[2:29:23] CardboardBoaner: My college gave us all J&J
[2:29:24] Gerthil: @Giantwaffle Have you been vaccinated?
[2:29:27] dogma802: @pupupuputter I think it's supposed to be a booster possibly in a year
[2:29:38] grimmn: those number cannot be directly compared
[2:29:41] Aurielli: @Giantwaffle store your xp in the book with only the levels u need for a certain enchant.
[2:29:43] McCheeto46: I hope my J&J vaccine will count for a passport
[2:29:50] pupupuputter: @marqueezus i know its its something like that
[2:29:51] Rayisbeast: the trials were done at different times, cant compare the numbers
[2:29:51] grimmn: different strains existed during their trials, not comparable
[2:29:52] CardboardBoaner: "funny that people that just want to wait for the "vaccine" to be FDA approved before getting it are called anti-vaxxers"
[2:29:56] Tes2K: If u live 7 hr away why do you need the vaccine anyway
[2:30:11] CardboardBoaner: "The J&J/Janssen vaccine was 66.3% effective in clinical trials"
[2:30:12] masztufa: 1 dose pfizer is also pretty decent protection
[2:30:15] Apparentthreat: NotLikeThis You're quoting misinterpreted info
[2:30:22] masztufa: also makes asymptomatic cases VERY rare
[2:30:26] Apparentthreat: that's not what that means. that was during trials.
[2:30:32] Stormflare: @theboan13 ???? the vaccine is FDA approved thats why its being given out
[2:30:33] Allmostdone: the FDA has already fast track the current meds why do you think they re gonna do anything more?
[2:30:34] Murfles: @Apparentthreat is right, can't compare them since they were tested in very different conditions
[2:30:38] calebhub514: All of the vaccines are 100% effective at preventing death and serious hospitalization which is important to note
[2:30:56] Aurielli: rip xp
[2:31:07] Apparentthreat: quoting %s will just give covidiots reason to not get one or the other
[2:31:12] pupupuputter: isnt like it matters covid 21 is already a thing now
[2:31:15] Daanaas: LUL
[2:31:16] dogma802: Nothing is ever 100%
[2:31:28] phantompenguin135: The j and j vaccine also doesn’t need to be cold stored so it’s easier to get out to the boonies.
[2:31:28] Aurielli: a level from lvl 9 is more than 1 level at level 1
[2:31:32] CardboardBoaner: "66 percent globally, 72 percent in the U.S."
[2:31:36] Larklen: moon2HUH
[2:31:39] Daanaas: i think 50%50
[2:31:40] Tiggaboo: your immune system can still shit th ebed
[2:31:50] poggiewooggie: @calebhub514 WRONG
[2:32:02] Fronku: I think the only real info we have is for the biontech vaccine because of the extensive usage in Israel and them selling the entire population medical info to pfizer...
[2:32:03] SnoLys: people should use masks even during just normal flu season...
[2:32:12] Daanaas: u need To kill chickens
[2:32:12] Surge43: Once your vaccinated you dont have to wear a mask outside.
[2:32:16] wrangler02: @larklen moon2GUNCH
[2:32:22] Daanaas: and Free Food To cook
[2:32:23] Larklen: @wrangler02 moon2GUNCH
[2:32:24] Aurielli: i think masks during flu season will be much more normal in the future.
[2:32:28] im_just_sean: Sadly I can’t get the vaccine yet which really sucks atm
[2:32:37] poggiewooggie: @surge43 WRONG
[2:32:41] Tes2K: The drive is almost full
[2:32:48] hendyius: what's the mortality rate of Covid for people under the age of 83? 99+%?
[2:33:01] TheDancu: no one is wearing masks in tennessee, crazy shit
[2:33:03] dogma802: @Aurielli Probably if you're sick but not normally
[2:33:03] CardboardBoaner: the places around me say they require it but no one says anything if you dont
[2:33:03] Allmostdone: exactly. You can still transmit without being sick
[2:33:09] pupupuputter: ted ted nugent was vaccinated and he still came down with a diff strain of covid 19
[2:33:10] Mikael_x: I think the thing is that you get a vaccine, and can get sick, but much more mild sickness, then you more or less fully protected that seson
[2:33:17] Gerthil: So when do you think you will not be able to wear a mask? When everyone is vaccinated?
[2:33:17] megasuperbu: !charm
[2:33:19] Daanaas: KEW
[2:33:20] poggiewooggie: Yep you can still transmit
[2:33:20] masztufa: we require masks (technically) everywhere outside, but we host fottball matches with live audience
[2:33:21] Daanaas: KEKW
[2:33:24] masztufa: guess the place
[2:33:27] NGTFAN: i got the 2nd shot last Friday and both put me on my ass for the day
[2:33:32] n8level: I try not to handle my mask a lot -- cross contamination -- just leave it on, whats the big deal?
[2:33:43] Alsabatini: chat is riled up today
[2:33:56] Brianmose12: monkaS
[2:34:00] Allmostdone: getting everyone to get the vaccine is more like a dream not reality
[2:34:06] poggiewooggie: @ngtfan better to be on your ass for a day than the icu for a month or dead forever
[2:34:08] StoppingRocket: tbh the only thing you can do if you dont want to wear a mask is move south
[2:34:10] mjuksomstencs: Hello Waffle

[2:34:24] NGTFAN: @poggiewooggie yep i agree with that
[2:34:24] Aurielli: But waffle, you're really wasting xp by using a level at higher levels. YOu should only have that req level on you
[2:34:29] Lephrim: you are lvl 5
[2:34:41] masztufa: yes
[2:34:42] omar_i_: yes, use tome to store levels in
[2:34:44] srgp2015: yes
[2:34:45] RodriCraft93: LUL IOTA for sure
[2:34:47] TelRehiad: it matters
[2:34:53] Mikael_x: If you get on your ass for some days, it means that the vaccine is working, activated in your body
[2:34:53] Aurielli: Yea. It uses a base 1 level, but a level on level 5 is already like level 1,5
[2:34:54] Surge43: it matters
[2:34:55] CardboardBoaner: yes because the as the lvl increases its harder to increase lvl
[2:34:57] 3MNiko: Anyone know what crypto app he uses
[2:35:00] masztufa: level 7 to 8 takes MUCH more than level 2 to 3 for example
[2:35:03] Winner5001: it matters
[2:35:04] tripwires: yeah, slow dayin the cryptoverse... except for the one that shall not be named
[2:35:07] omar_i_: try how much stone gives u exp at lvl1 and level 5
[2:35:11] Warkless: the need ofXP for each level is getting higher with more levels
[2:35:13] winchesterboys: it is true
[2:35:14] Surge43: 1 level at 8 is like total levels 1 to 3
[2:35:22] Brianmose12: the xp required to go from say 1 to 2 is not the same as say 10 to 11
[2:35:25] calebhub514: Alright I shouldn't have said 100% but i found the number from the cdc. it's 0.0017% reports of death after receiving the vaccine vs according to John Hopkins the US has a covid mortality rate of around 2%
[2:35:45] Larklen: KEKW

[3:14:12] Frozen_Shadow1: just throw in unenchanted picks at this point
[3:14:19] Geegum: are you about to beat the pack or just a section of it? @Giantwaffle
[3:14:21] Geegum: ahh ok

[3:14:39] madseed15: i stoped after getting out the bed rock
[3:14:59] Frozen_Shadow1: the challenges are just a crap ton of each block @Giantwaffle
[3:15:00] madseed15: no point just start new pack after the pickaxe
[3:15:17] OhTick: DSP Time Pog
[3:15:24] OhTick: soon*
[3:15:25] Frozen_Shadow1: the smores one is 100 qudruple smores i think
[3:15:29] Oleros_: DYSON TIME POG
[3:15:32] madseed15: agree
[3:15:42] DakotaFoxes: do you have another mod pack after you complete this one @Giantwaffle ??
[3:15:44] Jugohuber: Do just 1 challenge?
[3:15:44] yuhikyaku: dimension
[3:15:46] hendyius: is this the modpack with glitched overworlds?
[3:15:57] Charlion2: thats gonna be so weird, to see air again
[3:16:02] Chyrion: I think it's written s'more
[3:16:12] madseed15: @hendyius dont think so
[3:16:34] LinearLayer: DSPog
[3:16:39] Opsidill: All CoinBase allows me to do in my country is convert Cryptos not buy or sell :(
[3:16:45] Trilex: my favorite modpack is only over world i cant get enough of it i cant stand modpack in sky or stock in a dimension but thats my opinion lol
[3:16:52] MiraPacku: pepeLaugh
[3:17:11] masztufa: gregorious technicum brended chocolate
[3:17:25] RussianRainbowTV: yeah its all nuclearcraft too, and you have to automate milk too KEKW
[3:17:38] Tabakhase: skyblock lets them use 4gb ram too KEKW
[3:17:38] UECNSNemesis: Starlink mission later today, btw
[3:17:54] Frozen_Shadow1: but once your in the overworld the resources are a lot easier
[3:17:57] Brianmose12: monkaS
[3:17:59] masztufa: agrarian skies and FTB insanity (1.2.5) were great IMO
[3:18:10] masztufa: but like overworld is more aesthetic
[3:18:14] Geegum: sky factory 4 is the only pack ive ever 100%, was also my first modded playthrough
[3:18:26] TheBiggestBread: Seaopolis is pretty cool.
[3:18:30] MiraPacku: NODDERS
[3:18:34] Frozen_Shadow1: seaopolis^^
[3:18:36] Tompop23: @giantwaffle I like sky block. I don’t like sieving though lol. Bonsai trees are best
[3:18:37] MiraPacku: stoneblock is also pretty neat
[3:18:39] jachred: Yeah I am waiting for Seaopolis...
[3:18:42] MiraPacku: that exists I think monkaHmm
[3:18:42] Warkless: And there are "Alien" monsters monkaS
[3:18:46] MiraPacku: Sev played that I think
[3:18:52] alotron_: I really enjoyed the early phase of compact claustrophobia. The restriction to 3x3 / 5x5 made it really interesting to stuff as much as possible into a single cube. But the larger the cubes become the more mehh the pack becomes as well.
[3:18:54] Surge43: check out material energy
[3:18:59] drissical: Agrarian skies was made by Jaded cat right?
[3:19:04] R1Rider01: sounds like the new GW mod pack coming soon
[3:19:38] johnny_dan: Waffle i remember you saying that you would like to make a mod for that modpack you work on, will you make it open source so people could contribute after the initial version ?
[3:19:42] Torgi: there is a Pack called "Breakout" that does that.

[3:19:44] Arimil: There's an modpack under the ocean like that where you can push out the glass walls.
[3:19:45] Tabakhase: "only one of each size" would be a neat midway..
[3:19:54] FearlessBeanz: Like a satisfactory interface where you need to collect the materials then it upgrades the space station?? Could be cool
[3:20:01] drissical: This could have done less with making cubes and more with cubes from reward only.
[3:20:44] MiraPacku: WutFace
[3:20:49] MiraPacku: NotLikeThis
[3:20:50] grimmn: 27 per pick
[3:20:56] n8level: @drissical exactly, imagine each quest was a cube with some minimum supplies and a goal for the next quest that required being creative with what you were given
[3:21:09] alotron_: Maybe. This pack needs some kind of restriction for the amount of cubes you can make / the total space you have.
[3:21:12] sogerr: reddit is down :(
[3:21:16] TheBiggestBread: @Giantwaffle You might like Seaopolis, its a variation of the normal ex-nihilo system
[3:21:18] KABBL: me watching modded mc: I Like Your Funny Words Magic Man
[3:21:46] MiraPacku: NODDERS sounds great

[3:22:55] Doomwyte: @Giantwaffle FTB pyramid reborn hs a similar system where you unlock things by turning stuff in
[3:23:02] johnny_dan: kind of reminds me of satisfactory
[3:23:11] Evoti: y
[3:23:23] BeardSyndicate: sounds like satisfactory tiers
[3:23:29] sogerr: so... satisfactory?
[3:23:37] MiraPacku: droppod NODDERS
[3:23:45] n8level: ME Satisfactory

[3:24:10] StOrMy1100: 0 and 0 to 2 monkaHmm
[3:24:24] sogerr: ooh, waffle will LOVE dyson sphere if he wants this concept
[3:24:29] Archelonde: I've been playing NGU industries a bit as an idler and its like that.
[3:24:43] Trilex: is darkosto making it for you waffle ? or your going to make it your self ?
[3:25:35] Brianmose12: monkaX
[3:25:40] Arimil: I found it: https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/seablock-rustic-waters this is the pack that has the small box you start in and can expand it.
[3:26:03] Hedera_tH: What's the space event of today?
[3:26:03] WGG25: fridge guy talking monkaS
[3:26:26] Torickma: @Giantwaffle can you "speed" show your base? Startet playing this modpack 2 Weeks ago when I saw your stream for the first time.
[3:26:32] MiraPacku: what about that testing software you showed us?
[3:26:34] BeardSyndicate: just yolo build an idle game before the mod :D
[3:26:36] mythologay: that is ngu industries
[3:26:47] delnith17: @Giantwaffle idle game, call it waffle maker, upgrade the waffle maker for more speed and efficiency
[3:26:49] MiraPacku: fair enough
[3:27:13] Jamswhat2: Yeah :)
[3:27:15] AlexMBas: VoteYea VoteYea VoteYea
[3:27:19] Jamswhat2: just do numbers
[3:27:26] LinearLayer: Random event simulation to model trends
[3:27:30] masztufa: monte carlo is basically doing things randomly with "enough" trials
[3:27:41] alotron_: Since it seems like the focus is the progression itself you really something interesting for each stage or some special mechanic. Satisfactory does that pretty well imo by giving you a zip line here, a jet pack there. Otherwise such a concept can become boring pretty quickly.
[3:27:47] OnoMario: hardcore mode so stuff breaks over time lol
[3:27:53] Rangetuur: @Giantwaffle are you going to make the minecraft mod on stream?
[3:28:05] Archelonde: make the ratio's really messy
[3:28:15] Warkless: Modpack YEP
[3:28:20] Archelonde: like 11.2 and 19.6 to 121
[3:28:23] masztufa: what if you scale difficulty with by-products?
[3:28:31] KekMannetje: just tuned in, what kind of model is this LUL
[3:28:58] BeardSyndicate: did you not enjoy po3 kappa?
[3:29:00] Trilex: has waffle ever played GregTech? real GT in 1.7.10?
[3:29:36] Star579: GT6 is interesting
[3:29:39] KekMannetje: enigmatica
[3:29:40] BeardSyndicate: enigmatica
[3:29:47] Helo_KiX: Enigmatica
[3:29:48] imthatjeremyguy: 2 and not 3 4 5 or 6/
[3:29:48] robotunicr0n: Eni 2 Expert?
[3:29:50] masztufa: blightfall?
[3:29:52] Zalobomb: Enigmatica 2 Expert, or E2E as they also call it
[3:29:53] exo_pho3nix: enig matica
[3:29:53] robotunicr0n: E6 is fun as well
[3:30:03] calebhub514: I love Enigmatica 2 Expert
[3:30:06] Helo_KiX: Enigmatica 2 Expert is pretty poggers
[3:30:06] KekMannetje: E2E was really fun imo
[3:30:06] ninopanda: skyopolis 4!!!
[3:30:09] alotron_: But does it really become more complex or just grindier @Giantwaffle ? Many modpacks confuse complexity and grind imo.
[3:30:12] Rangetuur: dungeons and dragons is also a good modpack
[3:30:15] mountainmomma_63: there's enigmatica 6
[3:30:24] brenner1265: Skybees KEKW
[3:30:32] babyaddalyn: isent it seaopolis
[3:30:32] ninopanda: shhh
[3:30:33] Frozen_Shadow1: seaopolis just came out @Giantwaffle
[3:30:34] Moobot: Support Waffle by using his Epic creator code: Giantwaffle
[3:30:37] Apparentthreat: ninopanda you gonna play sea-opolis next? Kappa
[3:30:37] Riot221: did you hear they are splitting 1.17 into two updates
[3:30:38] Trilex: dont play new GT its not made by Gregorous play GT5u or GT6 by the real author in 1.7.10 you can try GregTech New Horizon
[3:30:39] exo_pho3nix: Dungeons Dragons & Space Shuttles is really good but its a microcrafting hell
[3:30:39] ninopanda: @Milexna no
[3:30:54] ninopanda: @Apparentthreat i want to once i am done with skyopolis
[3:31:00] KekMannetje: multiple layers of recipe is also complexity which often requires more machinery
[3:31:26] Aarimous: The pack should provided different levels of automation.
[3:31:39] masztufa: problem with difficulty like that is it's more like "length", not difficulty. Difficulty comes from recipes being more "intertwined". Not more steps of crafting, but juggling byproducts and trace inputs
[3:31:44] Frozen_Shadow1: is what your doing now a bad or good grind?
[3:32:02] 420HazeBlazer420: paulvoWaschbeckenpuller
[3:32:21] Trilex: i would recommend GTNH just for that in 1.7.10 if you dont mind playing older version of MC

[3:32:30] Brianmose12: PeepoClap

[3:32:57] WGG25: it would be a shame if you lost them all monkaCough
[3:33:02] calebhub514: GTNH is the real long grind lmao. could literally turn into a year long modpack.
[3:33:02] masztufa: after a certain point more rescources becomes grindy again. Look at late-game gregtech. Setting up a couple of assembly lines is kinda fun because it's hard. Repeating your setups 4 times because it was not fast enough is not
[3:33:53] alotron_: @Giantwaffle That makes sense. But with that recipes and crafting "techniques" should differ enough to make the automation interesting. Just smelting yet another ore is not ideal I think.
[3:33:54] masztufa: i'm only in HV GTNH (i heared about lategame being bad), and TBH it's an amazing pack so far
[3:34:17] ninopanda: @Apparentthreat I am thinking about setting up my 24 port switch and server for a seaopolis for us mods that want to try it
[3:34:28] Apparentthreat: ninopanda PauseChamp
[3:34:31] Andee2: Which modpack is GTNH?
[3:34:38] masztufa: gregtech new horizons
[3:34:43] Andee2: cool ty

[3:34:50] minegryf9: lets try this again
[3:34:58] masztufa: but seriously, try it. The scaling so far is amazing.
[3:34:59] Apparentthreat: ninopanda i put my skyopolis on a server on my old laptop. cheaper than paying $45/mo for something in the cloud w/ the same specs LUL
[3:35:00] KekMannetje: tbh manufactio did a pretty good job at balancing power IMO

[4:04:24] CorSPACE: its called a stiffener ring
[4:04:26] mechoriet: also gives it a bit of extra strength
[4:04:35] skokpo: @Giantwaffle is the landing completely automated ?
[4:04:43] Rippan: improved cooling maybe
[4:04:44] Tealiish: fins out
[4:04:46] minegryf9: it looks like the grid finn on the left is missing a segment??
[4:04:49] masztufa: yes, no way a human can land that
[4:04:50] obtoe_: damn im late
[4:04:53] OhTick: @mechoriet defiantly before lift off the computers take over and they can scrub the launch and everything. there is a manual override though
[4:05:00] Joshuapetch: @nextt_eg it's all automated after takeoff
[4:05:04] Shadow_of_Pain: @nextt_eg everything is automated

[4:05:25] JadedOnyx19: watching land pass so fast like that is wild
[4:05:36] R1Rider01: how are we getting these live images?  are they using starlink?  Kappa
[4:05:44] masztufa: there's no human that could land a booster from the control center. The input lag would surely make it impossible
[4:05:45] Balafore: the drone ship needs drones to film landing instead of just a deck camera
[4:05:50] ninopanda: @R1Rider01 could be
[4:05:54] mechoriet: @OhTick oh i read your text wrong KEKW i thought it said T 0:30

[4:06:23] xDIGIT84: Steel, would make it so much cheaper too
[4:06:23] minegryf9: PogChamp
[4:06:38] Rob_Kebab: Waffle Pog
[4:06:39] masztufa: steel is best metal
[4:06:44] Baysyxx: why didnt they use steel to begin with?
[4:06:50] Rippan: the grid fins they just shipped to Boca chica is crazy big
[4:06:58] SpyKnife: what's the difference between titanium and steel in grids?
[4:07:00] KekMannetje: I love the micro adjustments it makes
[4:07:03] mechoriet: @xDIGIT84 but way more weight any maybe not capable of the heat KEKW
[4:07:05] grimmn: @Baysyxx too much stress on them for steel IIRC
[4:07:09] LtCol_Carter: Alloy of iron
[4:07:09] OhTick: @Baysyxx probably wanted to be safe with titanium and its lighter
[4:07:14] Skarpis: 1.4404 Kreygasm
[4:07:16] Baysyxx: ahhhh ok gotcha
[4:07:17] Rippan: hold on monkaSTEER
[4:07:17] masztufa: yep, iron-carbon even the simplest ones. There's also 11 herbs and spices to make it better
[4:07:19] Baysyxx: thjanks guys
[4:07:22] CorSPACE: before these grid fins they used aluminum fins covers in cork
[4:07:23] exo_pho3nix: alloy of iron and some percentage of iron
[4:07:26] Tealiish: Stable element 115
[4:07:29] exo_pho3nix: of carbon*
[4:07:32] IncrediBuljo: Buckle up chat monkaS
[4:07:33] LtCol_Carter: Steel is superrrr versatile, like stainless steel and just a load of shit
[4:07:36] CorSPACE: YEP
[4:07:39] The_Holas: Do we know when will that Chinese rocket "Long March 5B" fall?
[4:07:40] Tabakhase: steel doesnt count as alloy in itself pretty sure...
[4:07:42] QuesoBad0nga: right burn looks so smokey
[4:07:42] LtCol_Carter: PogChamp
[4:07:43] OhTick: @SpyKnife the weight and the other material properties
[4:07:59] Tabakhase: it surely is
[4:08:03] Tabakhase: but youll never hear/use it
[4:08:15] Valentin_PV: probably more stable that way
[4:08:16] Ving3fyr: SN15 ? from today ?
[4:08:24] mechoriet: @The_Holas they predict in the next few days but depends on how much it slows down
[4:08:27] Rippan: jinx LUL
[4:08:27] ItsME_Harvey: and drone ship camera always cuts out :(
[4:08:29] Joshuapetch: welp
[4:08:29] masztufa: fun fact: steel is under 2.06% weight carbon content. Above that it's cast iron
[4:08:30] mechoriet: Sadge camera
[4:08:38] nxusr: @Tabakhase yeah, the dictionary will call it an alloy; but not super common irl
[4:08:39] Winner5001: dammit waffle, you jinxed it
[4:08:39] DimensionalShadow: Gotta jet
[4:08:39] mechoriet: gimme my downlink
[4:08:41] xBufferFace: Does stage just burn up afterwards ?
[4:08:41] JadedOnyx19: doest it fail cause of vibrations ?
[4:08:42] xBufferFace: 2
[4:08:45] R1Rider01: who ordered starlink already?
[4:08:47] obtoe_: i hope they dont switch to the droneship, it never works
[4:08:47] bugfish0815: the main difference for the grid fins is cost, the titanium grid fins are super! expensive
[4:08:59] Wynja: I always thought that was more about the cameras dropping out, and less about their choices
[4:09:00] merten0083: monkaS
[4:09:03] Joshuapetch: erm
[4:09:05] Joshuapetch: MONKERS
[4:09:07] macdrai: I think it's because the videolink is laser guided, the first stage comes reaaaly hot and they cant track it easily

[4:11:54] gartoks: @xlouiissss Probably thursday now
[4:12:02] CorSPACE: @Nexhunter Watch Everyday Astronauts video on the flip

[4:12:11] e_X_plode: @Chyrion See on app(
[4:12:15] masztufa: transfer limits are per side, right?
[4:12:15] kilian544: can your powercable sustain this much power at once?
[4:12:17] Tamerlain: @corspace lul
[4:12:20] GMGAlpha: Is that box loaded?
[4:12:23] minegryf9: is it cause of the pipe trough to compact machine?

[4:12:27] Chyrion: @e_X_plode oct 31 2013
[4:12:27] Nexhunter: @Tamerlain you fucking what mate you just literally posted the same shit as the person above well after danRude
[4:12:28] Blibop: @Giantwaffle power input of the machine maybe?
[4:12:39] e_X_plode: @Chyrion Thx
[4:12:40] masztufa: tunnels should aloow that much in
[4:12:45] Alsabatini: put the batteries in the same room?
[4:12:51] masztufa: otherwise you'd need to rebuild the entire thing
[4:12:51] Tamerlain: @nexhunter typing from phone sorry
[4:13:05] babyaddalyn: instead of doing 27 at time try with only 9?
[4:13:07] SchroTN: I've had draconic reactors and storage through those before.  I don't think those have a limit
[4:13:16] kingdigun: you got the 100k/t power for bedrock?
[4:13:20] Nexhunter: check what batteries it pulls from
[4:13:22] masztufa: what if you disable cell -->cell transfer before the big crafting?
[4:13:29] ZOZE55: doees it think it a has to have all the power needed to make all 3 blocks at once ?
[4:13:41] Clarkdiggity: THE SIDE
[4:13:42] masztufa: maybe energy cells are not a "per face" limit?
[4:13:54] Clarkdiggity: Power is going into the bottom but it is drawing from the back
[4:13:59] WGG25: it's set to input
[4:14:00] masztufa: they're inputs
[4:14:06] mechoriet: the other side is set to input
[4:14:08] Winner5001: they are inputs
[4:14:20] Clarkdiggity: Does the side of the compact cube itself matter?
[4:14:25] Key_CZ: maybe put only 9 bedrock chunks in the input, not 27
[4:14:45] masztufa: what the f yo
[4:14:50] Zoocha: relog?
[4:14:54] mechoriet: maybe unloading of the chunks ?
[4:15:01] RussianRainbowTV: big think
[4:15:03] Nexhunter: oh yea tiny machine issue from last pack
[4:15:04] masztufa: always at 67% tho
[4:15:08] Clarkdiggity: Power inside of the compact cube is drawing from the back?
[4:15:31] masztufa: wait
[4:15:43] Nexhunter: more cells PogChamp
[4:15:46] masztufa: what if the magnets need to fill internal buffer?
[4:15:48] dmackey7254: how about you remake it
[4:15:49] Igneous3: more glowstone
[4:15:51] drsnaki96: what was the machine energy input size again?
[4:15:55] Blibop: @Giantwaffle power input of the machine maybe?
[4:15:57] babyaddalyn: conect the generaters to the main line to for extra power
[4:16:00] dennixfailalot: are your power inputs optimal?
[4:16:01] masztufa: so just wait a minute after hooking it up, THEN put the chinks in
[4:16:03] Rozz161: theres nuclear craft cells that store crazy amounts of energy
[4:16:07] Surge43: I need moar powoar
[4:16:10] KekMannetje: is compact machine input on bottom?
[4:16:11] kilian544: Do your cables have a high enought throughput?
[4:16:27] Frozen_Shadow1: you can try more tunnels into reactor, put the cube in the corner and connect to 3 tunnels?
[4:16:28] Little_Lady_Lauren: its all chunk loaded right?
[4:16:32] babyaddalyn: conect the generaters to the main line to for extra power
[4:16:34] Memi02: Correct energy input block in the reactor?
[4:16:35] im_just_sean: Upgrade power to signalum might work but idk
[4:16:40] Clarkdiggity: Is the power cable connected to the back of the compact cube?
[4:16:45] ZOZE55: do you NEED to have the power outside ? cant you put it inside with it ?
[4:16:59] grimmn: the machine only takes power in at one point, and power has to come in through a tunnel due to the machine structure
[4:17:10] DemonicHell3: time to get that glowstone
[4:17:11] Blibop: @ZOZE55 yea you do
[4:17:32] grimmn: I was trying to clarify to chat, I know you already understood that @Giantwaffle
[4:17:34] minegryf9: turn it off then on again
[4:18:05] longuste: you sure put it in on the right side? Kappa
[4:18:25] Clarkdiggity: Is the yellow power cable behind it connected to it?
[4:18:30] KekMannetje: are both inputs on the bottom tunnel of the compact machine?
[4:18:34] robocahp: Did you reset the router?
[4:18:35] W4ffl3H0us3: what about the energy tap, like where the cells are exporting to
[4:18:54] StereoClex: can the energy input on the modular machine handle 100k RF?
[4:19:02] IceBlueFire: Time to pump them all up to enderium
[4:19:03] Blibop: what kind of energy input do you have in the multiblock? maybe thats the problem
[4:19:10] N3rvrackD: relog and break and replace controller
[4:19:15] N3rvrackD: ?
[4:19:31] minegryf9: turn  minecraft off then on agin
[4:19:31] Moobot: You can find Waffle's Youtube channel here - https://youtube.com/giantwaffle
[4:19:43] W4ffl3H0us3: ohhhh ok
[4:19:44] Helo_KiX: I think they meant the actual energy input block on the machine, not the cable
[4:19:47] Alsabatini: waffle and power are mortal enemies
[4:19:52] Blibop: no i mean the block that puts the energy into the machine, not the cables
[4:19:53] winchesterboys: tunnel is inf ?
[4:19:57] Helo_KiX: not sure if there are different levels of that hough

[4:20:00] BobPatience: I disagree SeriousSloth
[4:20:03] grimmn: I'm assuming this is correct, but the power input tunnel is connected to the bottom of the block right?
[4:20:24] Stoods_: You didnt set outputs on the new cells
[4:20:30] Frozen_Shadow1: on the compactor what size is the energy input? @Giantwaffle
[4:20:32] ray_nar: will you retire soon if ETH hits 4k?
[4:20:35] drsnaki96: can the magnets be pulling to much power and the machine not enouph?
[4:20:42] Blibop: no i mean the block that puts the energy into the machine, not the cables
[4:20:53] N3rvrackD: @winchesterboys the tunnel HAS to be infinite its the only way it can get power
[4:21:11] masztufa: they take 56k, but what if they have an internal buffer?
[4:21:22] Apparentthreat: mmmm
[4:21:23] babyaddalyn: it works
[4:21:23] UECNSNemesis: Kappa
[4:21:26] Frozen_Shadow1: it workd
[4:21:27] Apparentthreat: it's very possible
[4:21:30] grimmn: have you tried power the machine up, then putting the input chunks in afterwards?
[4:21:31] TarMonA: 1k per block
[4:21:35] Helo_KiX: are there different levels of the energy input block on the machine itself?
[4:21:36] DemonicHell3: @Giantwaffle does the multiblock structure have a power buffer? might be worth building that up before putting the bedrock in.
[4:21:37] FlyingVillage: Blue is in? and orange out?
[4:21:41] Clarkdiggity: monkaHmm
[4:21:44] babyaddalyn: you can connect the generators to the cryoducs to for even more power
[4:21:45] wickedbowie: i had a heck of a time fooling with mine before it worked, worst part is I have no idea what i did to fix it
[4:21:48] The_Holas: can you connect another tunnel with power? maybe tunnel has max through-put
[4:22:03] grimmn: @The_Holas the machine structure does not allow that
[4:22:06] Frozen_Shadow1: on the compactor what size is the energy input? @Giantwaffle
[4:22:10] Dracos555: What is the best power gen in this mod pack(that is consistent/no down time)?
[4:22:17] WGG25: enderio cells have 1000th of the capacity / block as in/out limit
[4:22:23] masztufa: is that the absolute biggest room?
[4:22:32] masztufa: or absolute max-1?
[4:22:51] wickedbowie: Dracos555 - including automated fuel generation?
[4:22:51] Nexhunter: well time to relog and push it
[4:22:55] TarMonA: relog
[4:22:56] Stoods_: Are there wireless energy things like tesseracts in this modpack
[4:23:06] longuste: inside the multi block you have the cryo cable from the side an not from the bottom, maybe thr throughput was high enough with the the old stuff but not anymore
[4:23:06] masztufa: wrong side on the top ones
[4:23:16] Dracos555: @wickedbowie yes
[4:23:19] Opusdeity: Any idea why it always fails around the 63% complete mark?
[4:23:27] grimmn: @longuste it's attached to the side but routed to the bottom
[4:23:30] Igneous3: log
[4:23:30] mugging_monkey: did i miss the launch?
[4:23:43] minegryf9: yep
[4:23:52] babyaddalyn: You can connect the generatorsq to the cryducs to for more power
[4:24:07] wickedbowie: Dracos555 I have a Fission reactor with a linked tiny machine using Tough Alloy picks for Uranium  - makes 65k RF/t completely hands off
[4:24:18] Jabald_: PauseChamp
[4:24:18] Geegum: why doesnt he just make a reactor capable of the rf/t? is that too much work or does that not work?

[4:24:27] minegryf9: Pog
[4:24:27] El_Riopel: how does the cryo cable work? maybe it transfers 1 block to the other per tick? meaning it gets max 75k/t with your three best batteries
[4:24:30] Jester_5240: jsut failed my math final lets fucking go dude
[4:24:37] FatRat_: Yahoooo
[4:24:43] Jabald_: EZ Clap

[4:42:16] ninopanda: AtM6 @nostalgic_am is poorly made.

[4:42:45] n8level: not sure why but its not as enjoyable, to me, following DSP builds as compared to a MC pack
[4:42:47] xavier2119: I'm so sad caves got pushed back :(
[4:42:55] Opsidill: I've never heard of the game. Will you be starting today?
[4:42:57] rykk3r1: when you have no distractions, you beat games faster Kappa
[4:42:58] CurlySC: Ok lets go

[4:45:12] Twin5un: lets get sidetracked a bit ? @Giantwaffle
[4:45:15] mephisto__ttv: go for DSP
[4:45:16] n8level: @Chronoes pretty much, twitch on a second monitor has been the wfh equivalent of the background conversations at "the office"
[4:45:17] StOrMy1100: @Giantwaffle Do some random TA for crypto Kappa
[4:45:18] Joshuapetch: It's not finished Kappa
[4:45:21] Apparentthreat: pepeLaugh we don't do polls here KEKW

[4:45:38] Kuroiorb: polls pepeLaugh
[4:45:39] ninopanda: what's a poll
[4:45:42] ninopanda: KEKW
[4:45:42] CareBear_1643: Maybe just prep DSP and relearn it today. Then start a new World Tomorrow? @Giantwaffle
[4:45:47] IceBlueFire: Transport Tycoon or something similar?
[4:45:53] teleslynga: DSP lets go
[4:45:54] sankhazo: Getting high on success

[4:46:00] bwofreedom2: DSP?!
[4:46:07] al3xm15: yes
[4:46:08] isfil: Yep!
[4:46:11] MrCoolBlueKid: did you finish this mod ?
[4:46:11] Charlion2: yes

[4:46:27] omar_i_: Modding DSP PogChamp
[4:46:27] ghettok: sounds right
[4:46:37] Chronoes: @n8level it's late evening for me but I can see it
[4:46:45] Orin_The_Sly: Counter Intuitive
[4:46:46] The_Holas: Or try DSP without mod now? to see what you need
[4:46:48] Frozen_Shadow1: the copy paste for inserters is pretty important at least
[4:46:49] Bbluess: @Giantwaffle yeah I played 10ish hours per day I think. It was rough when it fist came out but I think with mods and stuff it is amazing now. Just an FYI gameplay loop gets quite boring after a while. Do not wear yourself out with complication early. Just go with the flow
[4:46:50] mitsuki_11: @n8level 15 minutes before deployment
[4:46:51] WGG25: first time playthrough and already adding mods? who's this guy? DansGame
[4:46:56] Joshuapetch: PeepoClap well done
[4:47:24] kerpenverpen_: poor steve

[4:47:52] BennyF_Jr: 69
[4:47:54] MasterBrico: how is it going with starlink?
[4:48:00] Omeyn: I'm glad I don't know my overall playtime LUL
[4:48:03] SilverFoX93: go
[4:48:04] DemonicHell3: Waffle I missed it can you start the mod pack over please. Thanks in advanced.
[4:48:08] XhipGamer: I was a casual watcher.. but CClaustrophobia made me a daily watcher
[4:48:10] n8level: "SpaceX confirms a one-second restart of the Falcon 9’s second stage engine has placed the 60 Starlink satellites in the proper orbit for deployment at 4:04pm EDT (2004 GMT)."
[4:48:23] Larklen: KEKW
[4:48:41] n8level: a 1sec relight is amazing engineering in its own right imo
[4:48:48] mitsuki_11: channel said they'd be back for an update just after the 1 hour mark
[4:48:54] Orin_The_Sly: Chill HYPE
[4:48:55] Sagrotth: hot tub stream
[4:48:59] Frozen_Shadow1: thats 25 min
[4:49:05] n8level: 10min, plenty of time to inflate the hot tub Kappa
[4:49:09] ray_nar: hot tubbbbbb
[4:49:18] MrAppl3: pee time
[4:49:30] Gbusrt: will the Chinese booster for their space-station hit any of the starlink sats
[4:49:40] Ghosstk: What's up with the Chinese spacecraft? They cannot get the control back?
[4:49:41] DemonicHell3: you could also do something starwars related instead of DSP
[4:49:42] Frozen_Shadow1: checked it's only 12 more min
[4:49:45] SilverFoX93: Just hot tub
[4:49:46] Omeyn: I like how DSP looks
[4:49:57] mechoriet: yeah but not that fast KEKW
[4:50:06] joe864864: 15 min, T+ 01:03:30
[4:50:10] TarMonA: grab a sandwich  and or a drink and look up mod till next stage
[4:50:34] dennixfailalot: don't you need to change your game category?
[4:50:36] Mapleton: Why don't we just take a half hour nap on stream?
[4:50:39] mechoriet: pepeJAM spacex music tho
[4:51:01] NordESA: Can't wait to play DSP once it is out of EA
[4:51:14] Wetware: So it's like a human nature simulator? LUL
[4:51:22] produkteriswf: make a factory, and what will the factory produce? XD
[4:51:27] Chronoes: galaxies is a little too much, more like a collection of stars
[4:51:36] haradok: all for green energy xD
[4:51:38] Mapleton: @produkteriswf more factories
[4:51:40] Moobot: You can find Waffle's Youtube channel here - https://youtube.com/giantwaffle
[4:51:42] DirtyMarshMallo: DirtyMarshMallo subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 22 months! Pog
[4:51:43] isfil: Thats not a Dyson Shpere, it's a Dyson Swarm!
[4:51:48] Surge43: how hard is glowstone?
[4:51:49] daemonaedryn: And then suddenly you have 20 factories producing one thing KEKW
[4:51:51] Ghosstk: U can check Nilaus on youtube also. He made some good DSP videos.
[4:51:53] sogerr: @Wetware the lore is that an AI runs a simulation for humans and needs more power for it, and you are trying to get that power
[4:51:57] Frozen_Shadow1: you can make both
[4:52:00] Larklen: At some point, you stop looking for a Coal patch and start looking for a Coal Planet YEP
[4:52:01] Dugrim_: yeah that was just a swarm, the sphere comes later
[4:52:04] LambMcKee: both
[4:52:05] Quasky: The Swarm turns into a Sphere in the endgame
[4:52:08] Nilau: you can
[4:52:09] omar_i_: yes, it comes after this u are looking at now
[4:52:12] Brianmose12: swarm is early, sphere is the endgame
[4:52:14] Evoti: you can
[4:52:19] Yizzles: But does it have a Dyson vaccuum?
[4:52:23] Wetware: @sogerr Ha, cool
[4:52:29] bugsplatter23: DSP does “epic” very very well
[4:52:48] Hazeeed_: hopefully we get sn15 tomorrow poggy
[4:52:53] bugsplatter23: Ya swarm is intermediary
[4:52:55] Evoti: @Giantwaffle why do you not use darkmode youtube
[4:52:56] TarMonA: sphere over the brightest star and the black hole KEKW
[4:53:16] Frozen_Shadow1: nilaus has a timelapse of make size dyson sphere like 12k solar sails a min LUL
[4:53:20] wargig42: So do you get to enslave the wookies and so on then?
[4:53:21] Frozen_Shadow1: max*
[4:53:25] BennyF_Jr: FeelsWeirdMan
[4:53:35] StOrMy1100: You got Link?
[4:53:35] Zevek05: what crypto broker does he use?
[4:53:49] CareBear_1643: My god, i remeber when ETH was trying to break 2k @Giantwaffle
[4:53:49] aundros: Its all a preference
[4:53:49] mechoriet: i use darkmode everywhere
[4:53:49] produkteriswf: excatly, i love my default white mode
[4:53:52] wargig42: Empire lvl gameplay
[4:53:54] Hazeeed_: Been trying to buy some crypto for like 5 days, my bank keeps blocking it even when i ask them not too NotLikeThis
[4:53:54] Gbusrt: for me darkmode helps with my dry eye
[4:53:56] Yizzles: My eyes are weird, I can handle dark mode but it hurts my eyes.
[4:53:58] bugsplatter23: Actually DSP does have a Dyson Vacuum.  Its a thing, wait and see!
[4:54:03] Larklen: Waffle can you put your house in dark mode and turn off the lights please
[4:54:04] Larklen: thanks
[4:54:10] Omeyn: I only like dark mode if my room is actually dark
[4:54:13] koppag: thoughts on safemoon?
[4:54:19] Wetware: @Giantwaffle What was that web page that showed all the orbits of the Starlink satellites?
[4:54:26] WGG25: what crypto site does waffle use to trade coins?
[4:54:27] NahtanToIt: Have you tried Hades?
[4:54:38] Tabakhase: @Wetware stuffin.space ?
[4:54:39] Larklen: stuffin.space ?
[4:54:48] Yizzles: I also have "visual noise" and have problems seeing natural black (like seeing stars/galaxies)

[4:55:24] Wetware: @Tabakhase Thanks
[4:55:31] Tabakhase: fairly surte its the right one...
[4:55:42] Gbusrt: wonder if there a human on the planet with no medical problems 20/20 vision perfet health etc
[4:55:45] mechoriet: KEKW ssl cert broken
[4:56:04] Tabakhase: http://stuffin.space/ works
[4:56:06] Wetware: Yeah, that's it
[4:56:06] Tabakhase: http://stuffin.space/
[4:56:13] Tabakhase: forget about it @Giantwaffle
[4:56:16] Tabakhase: muchos €
[4:56:17] haradok: you pay :/
[4:56:21] Chronoes: money
[4:56:23] mechoriet: you pay :)
[4:56:23] dennixfailalot: time to make some hot chocolate
[4:56:23] hallis21: monies
[4:56:25] Larklen: You date Bill Gates :)
[4:56:26] ZyianDev: that's expensive, that's a couple hundred dollars, don't worry about it
[4:56:44] BennyStarfighter: You sign the game with a certificate that is accepted with a certificate Authority
[4:56:49] mechoriet: KEKW
[4:56:53] haradok: companies buy one public and use   internal ones only
[4:57:00] MiraPacku: KEKW
[4:57:06] Helo_KiX: @larklen well he is about to be single
[4:57:11] Colonel_Panic_: @Giantwaffle It is basically the same thing websites do to certify their website is theirs. That little padlock thingy. It's a crypto certificate thing.
[4:57:15] Tabakhase: 200-500€ yar range - codesigning is a bitch...
[4:57:50] Colonel_Panic_: There should be a super cheap/free code signing thing for hobby use or personal things.
[4:57:57] Colonel_Panic_: would be nice
[4:58:12] zebadrabbit: letsencrypt for games
[4:58:18] LtCol_Carter: I think there are some self-cert tools, but they're not fully trusted for like general distribution I thinkk
[4:58:26] haradok: and then there will be lot copy/paste bank sites :/
[4:58:28] dotLAN: I mean you can always sign your own certs and give the matching files to your friends
[4:58:30] The_Holas: hobby hacker? Kappa
[4:58:31] memothegreat: if it s cheap it s not secure
[4:58:36] WGG25: i thought you can generate certs for websites with certbot or whatever, not sure how legal/valid it is
[4:58:37] pengeg: hello chat, did waffle beat pack?
[4:58:38] Larklen: ratJAM
[4:58:40] EZTEQ: its not about security
[4:58:43] EZTEQ: its about identity
[4:58:48] M1k3D3l7a: pengeg YEP
[4:58:53] germanmikrowave: some small amount of security
[4:58:54] Larklen: Why not just do a certificate blockchain catJAM
[4:58:56] Tabakhase: you actually HAVE to verify "soemthing" - and if just "its you" --- the whole point of "why LetsEncrypt can be free" is that the domain-validation is fully automatable
[4:58:57] pengeg: neat thx @m1k3d3l7a
[4:58:57] mechoriet: KEKW md5
[4:58:58] Colonel_Panic_: I mean, It is basically using a 3rd party to "verify" you are you.
