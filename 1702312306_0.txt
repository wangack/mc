[2:07:42] Probni4ek: @Giantwaffle  GTNH its very hard)
[2:07:45] ns0z: Be prepared for GTNH to take like 10-15 times more hours than this pack though :D

[2:09:29] DX_Plates: @LokiRulez Depends on what you mean by worse... I think NH has many more gates, and includes magic mods, whereas this one is just a tech pack (although a highly complex one)
[2:09:40] kitty_cat20: it's a tape
[2:09:45] kaasrondje: Will the boules be automatically processed?

[2:38:33] headtr1ck: why not simply use a 2x2 drawer?
[2:38:46] Manacaym: has he gotten to automate drones yet
[2:38:59] xDeadBringerx: Calcium dust not used for anything?
[2:39:25] Zapper_777: calcium -> bonemeal?
[2:39:30] tomey36: There has to be another way besides apatite
[2:39:30] matori666: can you combine the small piles for a jumpstart?
[2:39:38] n00rman_: calcium for epoxy
[2:39:38] SmokyMtnRed: I mean, instead of building a new machine. Crafting a LV to MV upgrade like the older Iron CHest mod
[2:39:41] matori666: of phosphate
[2:39:42] 1axt1: what about the chlorine?
[2:39:47] raironzera: is calcium drawer limited, right?
[2:39:49] Ras2709: @Giantwaffle fluid interface needs a cable or it will fill up
[2:40:23] 1axt1: wont chlorine fill up the drives?
[2:40:29] raironzera: oh yeah, voided
[2:40:43] mechoriet: pepeLaugh manual

[2:42:09] maimvice13: the DLC togheter cost les then the base game so is a nice way to get it ceapers
[2:42:16] PureSpider: kopium space program
[2:42:19] 0x4273: ksp 2 is real COPIUM
[2:42:22] aeadon: 2023 is still COPIUM
[2:42:24] Soulif: what broke today?
[2:42:30] cosmicblip: didn't KSP just launch on epic that's why they are giving it out for free  it wasn't in their store before
[2:42:40] synz_qc: is that the one where I start with a single tree ?
[2:42:41] matori666: KEKW
[2:42:43] ninopanda: @Soulif its waffle.... everything broke
[2:42:43] daedmissica0: is you
[2:42:44] daemonaedryn: The better question is what has Not broken today
[2:42:48] Wetware: Well, CI was on the server
[2:42:48] Soulif: exactly
[2:42:50] Flobu_: CI broke partciles
[2:42:57] 0omkins: YET
[2:42:58] xDeadBringerx: @cosmicblip Building hype for KSP2 release on both Steam and Epic
[2:42:59] ninopanda: its a side quest of a side quest of a side quest KEKW
[2:43:02] TigerLuv: well if you ignore Ci LUL
[2:43:13] TPells67: Did pati do anything yesterday?
[2:43:14] 0omkins: @ninopanda "Future Waffle Problems....FWP's"
[2:43:25] ninopanda: @0omkins TRUE
[2:43:26] 0omkins: The FWP list is getting pretty fucking long
[2:43:34] xDeadBringerx: Use the Config Terminal LUL
[2:43:40] Wetware: Sidequest ⁶
[2:44:53] TuxLafitte: Break all the things! danHype
[2:44:53] Moobot: You can find Waffle's Youtube channel here - https://youtube.com/giantwaffle
[2:45:12] Ras2709: inbefore whole system breaks KEKW
[2:45:52] LurkerNr5: can you just have a stack buffer in the interface?
[2:45:52] deadgolfer: priority
[2:45:53] lukasalbert: up the priority
[2:45:53] Cyberwire69: you bumped the priority tho
[2:46:07] itsIffy: level emitter
[2:46:11] Littleme02: computers
[2:46:17] LurkerNr5: this seems better :)
[2:46:24] itsIffy: if you have x manganese, you can make stainless
[2:46:27] ns0z: Stop producing stainless when hitting 10k maybe?
[2:46:37] sorefingers: higher priority but add a level emitter so it only crafts if there is enough stainless?
[2:46:40] matori666: 900 small piles of phosphorus
[2:46:45] deadgolfer: once you get the drones automated then you will be fine, maybe turn the stainless off until that happens
[2:46:49] Dagmoo: time to automate the drones NODDERS
[2:48:12] burrrst: You could level emit the ebfs for stainless so the stainless dust backs up
[2:48:47] daemonaedryn: KEKW
[2:48:51] daemonaedryn: I think you may be alright
[2:48:51] xDeadBringerx: LUL
[2:48:54] DemonicHell3: you need more
[2:48:54] Manacaym: was that 11k stainless ingots?
[2:48:57] GoodOldXijan: now you can be a dentist with all those manganese
[2:48:58] Cyberwire69: and theyre not in the drices too
[2:49:02] Cyberwire69: drives
[2:49:07] Littleme02: time to make your factory out of aluminium
[2:49:12] ns0z: But your EBF keeps producing stainless, so you will never be backing up the dust no?
[2:49:18] matori666: @giantwaffle combine the phosphorus small piles into dust
[2:49:34] Psytei: is void upgrades not a thing anymore for the drawers?
[2:49:37] burrrst: If you back up stainless dust then the manganese dust won’t be used right?
[2:49:43] Purecrew: DO you have 11k stainless steel ingots?
[2:49:43] ns0z: If you level emit to fx 12k stainless you should have enough till you get micro miners
[2:50:10] Littleme02: you are gaining small phosphorus dust overtime
[2:50:23] matori666: you are getting those small piles as a by-product, so maybe worth to automate the conversion
[2:51:33] xDeadBringerx: Crafter or Assembler?
[2:51:41] Littleme02: crafting upgrade on the interface to the mixer
[2:51:46] PureSpider: interface with crafting card
[2:51:54] matori666: KEKW
[2:52:01] BadMystic: @Giantwaffle there is a new Tom Scott video
[2:52:24] Cyberwire69: you did upgrade to a supercomputer last time
[2:52:31] tomey36: That’s worth because you can’t automate appetite
[2:52:32] lukasalbert: you need to set the type of curser you want in the interface
[2:52:39] Cyberwire69: you did all the upgrades
[2:52:43] lukasalbert: "JEI synchronized and stuff"
[2:52:49] ns0z: There is a simple NBT filter. I think its called "Type Filter". Use that for small dust into a compactor and it should do the job
[2:53:18] matori666: one more question, where are the grains of infinity stored?

[2:58:42] Attic_03: what are u building?
[2:59:00] matori666: check what you need for that interface KEKW
[2:59:05] n3wtpond: What’s the button to go up and down on an elevator?
[2:59:11] Littleme02: can you make templates for 5x5 things?
[2:59:13] kitty_cat20: the'rs a terminal com can make more than 9x9 recipes
[2:59:14] LurkerNr5: imagine just auto inserting those with a crafting card :D
[2:59:17] TheGreatLemon: does ME have a way to do larger than 3x3 crafting?
[2:59:24] maimvice13: you can get away with a normal craftingterminal until tier 4 or 5
[2:59:25] n00rman_: also eventually you want that to be passively made and sent off
[2:59:41] Littleme02: microverse room room
[3:00:09] kitty_cat20: @TheGreatLemon yes the extended processing pattern terminal
[3:00:09] piiixxx: i thought this modpack was crazy, then i watched a video on gregtechs stargate KEKW
[3:00:27] Manacaym: also once you get t2/3 done alot of your stainless issues should stop
[3:00:28] Apparentthreat: didn't you have a "let's break it down" alert?
[3:00:57] kane1941: they are like 10 seconds at HV
[3:01:00] matori666: EMPTY THOSE TANKS Madge
[3:01:10] maimvice13: @piiixxx especially when they made it harder along the way
[3:01:22] PureSpider: two stacks of elmo

[3:01:26] Foobaah: in the storage

[3:01:34] Moobot: The December modpack, Nomifactory (GTCEu Port) is in full swing !!! | https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/nomi-ceu | The bois were unable to complete the pack in 2022. Will they be able to beat it by NYE 2023? Tune in to every stream to find out! pepeLaugh
[3:01:35] matori666: you have like a million of them in the ME
[3:01:41] Qbertman: this would be flawless if you made it passive
[3:02:13] piiixxx: @maimvice13  yea xD no one has ever build the hardone or? seen a guy whos been working on it for 4k hours
[3:02:23] brenner1265: Is this something that you can automate using a crafting card?
[3:02:29] Markus11982: you can automate the miner on demand
[3:02:36] tomey36: Just limit it
[3:02:38] deadgolfer: time for ore washing side quest
[3:03:13] kane1941: better if there is 0 of some ore than send a new one
[3:03:15] brenner1265: Or can you use it like the drawers, once a resource is needed, it then sends the miner?
[3:03:16] n00rman_: me level emitter for low ilmenite = send micro miner
[3:03:21] Alyad: my ocd...
[3:03:24] sorefingers: i think autocrafting the microminers with ae will gum up your crafting cpus
[3:03:27] Littleme02: you might need to put a void on all of them, since you might need one ore much more than the others
[3:03:34] maimvice13: @piiixxx i think at the moment the is still nobody that have achieved to this day at the new difficulty
[3:03:34] tomey36: Did one of the drones get appite?
[3:03:44] piiixxx: @maimvice13 crazy
[3:04:05] piiixxx: waffle should try it KEKW
[3:04:35] TheWonderLlama: cohhBoom
[3:04:38] JasonDM_: better to overdo it than underdo it
[3:04:43] maimvice13: @piiixxx problem is there is a great magic integration
[3:05:04] Soulif: waffle i love ur shirt today
[3:05:21] CoolReal: So much spaghette
[3:05:23] WARHERO322: The big one is on P2P
[3:05:31] daemonaedryn: Somewhat
[3:05:34] TheWonderLlama: PogChamp Adulting
[3:05:38] xDeadBringerx: @CoolReal Invisible spaghet tho Kappa
[3:05:38] mechoriet: POGGIES so you avoided the redshit KEKW
[3:05:44] SailorWS: chat when youre eating curry do you eat it seperately, eat it with the curry on the rice or mix that shit all up
[3:05:47] meller127: Do you void all the matter from the simulations chambers?
[3:06:09] itsIffy: past waffle is pepeLaugh now
[3:06:12] Dibbsu: @SailorWS All the above
[3:06:14] daedmissica0: why is p2p bad
[3:06:17] jmm548: well u void soem byproducts u dont need like ash
[3:06:19] silv: @SailorWS mixed NODDERS
[3:06:24] daedmissica0: and need chests
[3:06:24] matori666: @sailorws Mix usually
[3:06:29] kane1941: better to do like "if there is 0 of one of the ores then send a new drone"
[3:06:40] her0zer0: @meller127 yes he is voiding he byproducts. not the pristine matter
[3:06:41] WARHERO322: The drone requires chest too
[3:06:44] sorefingers: i think it autooutputs
[3:06:55] maimvice13: @piiixxx and it would take him a half a year to get to the waiting statge
[3:06:58] xDeadBringerx: @daedmissica0 You run into power supply issues with P2P. It can only do so much power per tick
[3:07:01] Intohimos: You should only be inserting when requesting ore
[3:07:04] mechoriet: @SailorWS seperate KEKW cause my autism can't handle mixed shit
[3:07:23] kane1941: make a patter to make ores from miner
[3:07:24] jmm548: void what ?
[3:07:25] daemonaedryn: void what?
[3:07:26] xDeadBringerx: What is that ticking noise? almost like a geiger teller
[3:07:28] Littleme02: you probably will
[3:07:32] PureSpider: SailorWS mix that shit all together peepoFat
[3:07:32] deadgolfer: yes, you will. Just do big stacks and then void
[3:07:34] SailorWS: mechoriet are you the type of person where different types of food cant touch? I have a buddy that does that
[3:07:38] Littleme02: but also put huge upgrades on it
[3:07:38] ns0z: max upgrade drawers. You should be good
[3:07:40] stiplick: process + compact
[3:07:40] Stillglade: yeah, drawers for each with voids
[3:07:48] jmm548: sounds good
[3:07:59] JimTheShark: Isn't there a way that you can process things through a specific set of systems based on the name of the item?
[3:08:02] CoolReal: What if you need a byproduct
[3:08:08] IlsaGold: Sounds smart
[3:08:09] weightmaker: you can do both
[3:08:18] JimTheShark: You could set up an auto ore system and have it processed into useful things
[3:08:20] Ghandus: hey @Giantwaffle are you hyped for ksp2?
[3:08:24] sorefingers: you could make a minerroom with the drawers attached to each tier of miner
[3:08:27] daemonaedryn: Galena is very useful
[3:08:29] daemonaedryn: for indium
[3:08:37] n00rman_: galena is crucial
[3:08:42] n00rman_: save it
[3:08:47] bobolpwnz: you need galena
[3:08:52] n00rman_: purified
[3:08:56] xDeadBringerx: Yeah, Galena -> Indium
[3:09:01] SailorWS: monkaS
[3:09:01] brenner1265: Might as well process it out of the raw ore once you get it
[3:09:04] mechoriet: @SailorWS touch is fine for me but I generally do eat then in a order like finish the meats then the potaters then greens
[3:09:04] daemonaedryn: Galena plus Sphalerite = Indium
[3:09:04] Intohimos: Cretes with emerald upgrades cost you nothing so you should store as much as possible
[3:09:06] SailorWS: theres someone behind you
[3:09:08] daemonaedryn: yes
[3:09:09] weightmaker: zinc is also a byproduct i believe
[3:09:15] kane1941: you need billions of every ingot
[3:09:17] drsnaki96: washed galena i think
[3:09:18] daemonaedryn: Its a main dust in EV+
[3:09:22] CoolReal: billions OMEGALUL
[3:09:30] matori666: @sailorws relax, it's just my cat
[3:09:31] daemonaedryn: Purified Galena and Purified Sphalerite make Indium concentrate
[3:09:31] Moobot: You can find Waffle's Youtube channel here - https://youtube.com/giantwaffle
[3:09:32] jayrickson87: purified galena ore mixes with another ore to make Platinum group sludge
[3:09:32] phatallen: i wanna see something blow up
[3:09:41] Littleme02: is there an easy way to check if the drawers all a half full or less and then send the drone if one of them are. Then just put void upgrades on them all. That way you never run out of a thing and also don't get full
[3:09:56] daedmissica0: hows the wood going?
[3:09:57] PureSpider: Littleme02 yea, comparators :D
[3:10:07] Littleme02: that sound like a lot of work
[3:10:09] SailorWS: how has he not automated controllers?
[3:10:12] kane1941: there are redstone conduits
[3:10:24] mechoriet: @SailorWS pepeLaugh manual crafting god
[3:10:33] Littleme02: also he needs to check like 8 different resources

[3:14:18] xDeadBringerx: @Giantwaffle Does that Geiger Teller sound come from the Microverse?
[3:14:25] orangecreamsicle3: I made 3 basic and 3 advanced to prevent bottlenecks
[3:14:34] xDeadBringerx: Ahh okay
[3:14:49] orangecreamsicle3: so each micro miner gets its own microverse
[3:14:53] xDeadBringerx: Overlooked the reactor LUL

[3:16:07] LuciferSpirt: @orangecreamsicle3 pepeLaugh he wont do it
[3:16:10] xDeadBringerx: @orangecreamsicle3 Those IC2 Nuclear Reactors were scary LUL
[3:16:30] orangecreamsicle3: @xDeadBringerx now we have draconic reactor thats 1000x worse
[3:16:43] deadgolfer: interface instead of barrel
[3:16:45] Opsidill: You may not have selected to insert always
[3:16:56] orangecreamsicle3: no
[3:17:00] PureSpider: why not extract out of the interface directly?
[3:17:09] orangecreamsicle3: being cleaver pepeLaugh never will be
[3:17:12] Code4Coffee: @xdeadbringerx they were fun! until a unloaded chunk messed up your auto-shutoff system and the whole thing blew
[3:17:39] orangecreamsicle3: just place the interface infront of the output bus waffle

[3:19:04] Wetware: Ding fries are done
[3:19:08] thomasausen: just use a level emitter for one of the ores you need so you only send one if you need the ore
[3:19:13] PureSpider: block under it changes sound
[3:19:13] TheWonderLlama: Just use the anvil sound Kappa

[3:21:49] JBrown: you need the redstone conduit
[3:21:54] GameDadel: repeter?
[3:21:58] Saishu_: i think the pulse needs to last at least 4 ticks
[3:22:01] PureSpider: if it didnt apply a signal, you wouldnt hear a ding

[3:22:59] MrArrig: probably some ticks that has to line up or something
[3:22:59] PureSpider: wtf
[3:23:00] JimTheShark: every 4 ticks it does 4

[3:24:15] WARHERO322: Check the restone wire?
[3:24:17] MightyOWB: every four pings?
[3:24:17] deadgolfer: max length the repeater?
[3:24:18] maimvice13: @Giantwaffle use the timer filter
[3:24:18] Zapper_777: its shy :D
[3:24:19] bJoHEi: every 4 pings it pushes 4?
[3:24:21] kane1941: it puts in interface?
[3:24:21] LaroStar007: some are going into the Interface @Giantwaffle
[3:24:21] profwonderful: repeater delays pulse
[3:24:22] xDeadBringerx: Make the pulse 4 ticks long
[3:24:22] daemonaedryn: KEKW
[3:24:25] imeasytokill: it tries the other inventory
[3:24:25] Trilex: because its a shit mod Kappa lol
[3:24:25] daemonaedryn: Ci is a caveman
[3:24:26] BakaPixel: @Giantwaffle Repeater is just a delay not a pulse length manipulator.
[3:24:26] orangecreamsicle3: KEKW
[3:24:28] mechoriet: KEKW Tier 1
[3:24:34] Sander20011: hopper?
[3:24:35] weightmaker: the extract requires redstone but its not triggered by it
[3:24:40] Voltrah7: speed upgrade in the ender wire
[3:24:41] Viviids: fk it 2 repeaters
[3:24:42] ns0z: Check signal strength on redstone conduit
[3:24:45] Voltrah7: maybe?
[3:24:45] deadgolfer: repeater is delay, pulse is same length
[3:24:48] MrArrig: speed downgrade?
[3:24:53] lacr3: All the repeaters!
[3:24:54] kane1941: half goes to interface?
[3:25:02] ryanmgeek: Add some speed upgrades to the enderio conduit
[3:25:06] LaroStar007: some pulses are going into the Interface @Giantwaffle
[3:25:09] Dirtyharryce: 2-2-3-3-2
[3:25:10] xDeadBringerx: Ci just removed the gold block LUL
[3:25:11] BakaPixel: @Giantwaffle No, it's delaying by 4
[3:25:11] woodlaphroaig: no, it just delayes it with 4 ticks
[3:25:14] PureSpider: no, repeater does not increate pulse length
[3:25:18] WARHERO322: Ci just changed the block Kekw
[3:25:18] PureSpider: increase*
[3:25:18] leeroy_47: sounds like a skill issue :/
[3:25:28] lacr3: It’s inconsistent
[3:25:32] Purecrew: Shouldnt you just level emit based on your most used ore
[3:25:35] dylan0806: It’s delayed it said
[3:25:58] dylan0806: Or strong signal
[3:25:59] Moobot: You can sub to Waffle by clicking this neat link -> twitch.tv/giantwaffle/subscribe SUBprise
[3:26:00] orangecreamsicle3: @Purecrew no that would do too much
[3:26:03] L0rd0fHeaven: at least it is not putting it in faster than the clock
[3:26:16] maimvice13: is your conduit setup correctly on the crate side
[3:26:17] xDeadBringerx: Pati just went live 👀
[3:26:18] Viviids: conduit
[3:26:36] Trilex: what is pati twitch ?
[3:26:41] Rtonne: is there a pulse extender block?
[3:26:41] mechoriet: YEAHBUT7TV ?
[3:26:42] Purecrew: I dont understand why that would be to much, You are doing micro miners for certain things.
[3:26:46] xDeadBringerx: https://www.twitch.tv/piratepati
[3:26:48] Alamose: the extract takes longer than the pulse legth
[3:26:50] jayerbuu: i commend you for actually committing to this modpack... at least until the next game you play pepeLaugh
[3:26:55] SupaIkemen: is there a “on pulse” setting for enderio?
[3:26:55] Littleme02: get a extraction upgrade
[3:26:56] deadgolfer: Skip the timer setup?
[3:26:59] Saishu_: needs to be longer still
[3:27:01] Sander20011: power a hopper
[3:27:02] Intohimos: production ready
[3:27:06] Alamose: put in speed upgrades and it should work fine
[3:27:07] CantTouchDisNow: can you just use a toggle switch an pull in on a rising signal?
[3:27:07] ryanmgeek: Pulse extend the input signal or add speed upgrades to the conduit
[3:27:08] snick3rs_: speed upgrade maybe?
[3:27:08] CoolReal: Add speed upgrades and you'll be good probably
[3:27:09] maimvice13: ore use the redston timer filter
[3:27:11] tempmine: is it going to other places
[3:27:14] pinhead_larynx: make the tick faster?
[3:27:17] pufflefump: Sticky piston and redstone block
[3:27:18] weightmaker: ME Toggle bus and toggle the interface instead?
[3:27:19] R1Rider01: can't you just put timer ontop of the crate?
[3:27:22] TigerLuv: what is that static tick?
[3:27:28] Slash_Ignore: use a dispencer?
[3:27:34] Mazzelfassel: You could use an impulse hopper which always outputs the predefined items.
[3:27:40] stormzwest: would a toggle bus work?
[3:27:40] Littleme02: i'm guessing the ender io thing is only sometimes checking, not every tick
[3:27:42] Slash_Ignore: *dispenser
[3:27:50] dylan0806: Can’t you control the machine?
[3:28:14] maimvice13: output on notblock
[3:28:34] Gotizie: does the fact that you're using red on the item inputs as well as the redstone make a difference?
[3:28:34] Stillglade: input puts it into the conduit, output comes out of conduit
[3:28:38] DecibelBlast: Timer filter is the input
[3:28:42] CapnCrunch301: 21 is limit
[3:28:45] deadgolfer: stack limit
[3:28:47] WARHERO322: limited
[3:28:47] GuardMoony: max filled now
[3:28:47] Synnoc: catJAM
[3:28:59] PureSpider: does the conduit have something like "extract on pulse" or whatever?
[3:29:01] CoolReal: Add speed upgrades and you'll be good probably
[3:29:05] maimvice13: set timer on the chest
[3:29:11] Littleme02: get an upgrade for the extractor
[3:29:13] pinhead_larynx: you put it to every 30 ticks
[3:29:20] Littleme02: thinking async
[3:29:21] PureSpider: but does it have pulse instead of sustained signal?
[3:29:25] maimvice13: timer on crate
[3:29:38] Mazzelfassel: @Giantwaffle try an impulse hopper
[3:29:38] pinhead_larynx: no it puts them in every 30 pings i think
[3:29:43] usernameNull: is there a on redstone pulse instead of redstone on?>
[3:29:45] Soulif: i think the signal is going through the cable not hitting the input cable
[3:29:45] CantTouchDisNow: can you set the restone activation to pulse on rising edge?
[3:29:59] ryanmgeek: You output signal is not going to the conduit it's going into a transparent block (crate)
[3:30:04] GuardMoony: try a normal chest?
[3:30:07] GameDadel: speed up extracter?
[3:30:15] Soulif: put the signal to the cable
[3:30:16] kane1941: invert a redstone torch
[3:30:26] Sevgeni: whats the insert color ?
[3:30:26] Soulif: have Ci press a button every 200 ticks
[3:30:28] CantTouchDisNow: latch!
[3:30:31] deadgolfer: skip it?
[3:30:39] Einar88: Is it 2 blocks away? When you did the snad farm, it only pulsed the one next to the timer filter
[3:30:49] kane1941: disable microverse controller?
[3:30:50] dylan0806: Control the machine?~
[3:30:50] usernameNull: I think the other redstone timer lets you do an on amount of time
[3:30:50] Smithii: @Giantwaffle You can use a cover to control the machine with redstone.
[3:30:51] lacr3: @soulif  yes I like that idea!!!!
[3:30:55] Intohimos: oh boy timer based system that's always a good idea LUL
[3:30:56] PureSpider: yea, comparators on the drawers
[3:31:14] 1StClassAlcoholic: I must’ve zoned out, why are we doing this?
[3:31:14] Saishu_: redstone controll the microverse?
[3:31:15] deadgolfer: yes
[3:31:26] PureSpider: comparator on the drawers, join them all together, active without signal - if there's too much in any drawer, it turns it off
[3:31:28] deadgolfer: perfect
[3:31:30] kane1941: titanium?

[3:34:26] Qbertman: yeah now wont it just run forever now with a crafting card?

[3:34:39] knowledge_within: and that sends a new drone

[5:22:03] ThatOnneGuy: @Makaheehee yeh. Last time was a couple weeks ago I think. Something like 70+ highlights in a row. 70 x 300k points widePepeLaugh
[5:22:07] 0x4273: just make micro miners in bulk for iridium

[5:22:56] nachobears: So whats the problem?
[5:22:58] Qbertman: dont u just need one automation crafter? why not just send like one micro miner
[5:22:59] GoodOldXijan: what its getting way more complicated? crazy
[5:23:04] deadgolfer: handcraft miners
[5:23:06] silv: sounds good :)
[5:23:07] IAmJester: the miners are absolutely going to be faster
[5:23:08] bobolpwnz: you can gen platinum grp sludge from tetrahedrite ore which comes from T3 drone
[5:23:11] daemonaedryn: Both are valid solutions, just depends on what resources you got
[5:23:19] rofl1436: just send one miner
[5:23:30] kafenaisu: @giantwaffle this is the time to team up
[5:23:34] deadgolfer: miners definitely faster
[5:23:43] rofl1436: do the miner YEP
[5:23:44] IAmJester: you're trying to make a loaf of bread by piling up bread crumbs when you could just bake a loaf in the first place.
[5:23:48] Qbertman: just send a miner to make the automation crafter
[5:23:51] DarkbuilderX: The chem reactor route is totally bait, unless you want literally all of the byproducts
[5:24:02] daemonaedryn: Miner is faster, chemistry is more of a long-term gain of iridium
[5:24:04] WARHERO322: Dont you have 2 stacks of this stuff already the 8020
[5:24:06] CommanderUrsus: do both stockAgain
