[0:31:17] ItsOnMax: They say that the 20s are definitive for your career. But you can always switch it up
[0:31:19] Stoods_: Building a career is fun tho

[0:32:19] JohneySniper: With all things in life there are ups and downs.
[0:32:32] 0omkins: I think the point is some life decisions are hard, but spending 5 years thinking about it isn't healthy/productive. @Giantwaffle
[0:32:33] Wuzley: Im 48, quit my job in IT working at a London City bank in January. Going camping for 4 months in July. No idea what im going to do after that but savings help :)

[0:34:44] Tabakhase: diversify - but also "dont buy to little" - you dont want trx-fees to eat all the profits on buy&sell LUL
[0:34:59] foenix48: that's life
[0:35:01] daemonaedryn: Yup for me I went into engineering purely because its what I was pushed into waffleD

[0:35:55] Kohta_Sama: restart yo shit peepoBlonket
[0:35:56] Kompreni: java taking memory ? impossible Kappa
[0:35:56] sogerr: its a sign for snowrunner switch
[0:36:03] DarkSpooon: Game tried to pick what direction his life was going too early. Drown in a pool at age 7 like in the video.
[0:36:04] xfrozev2: just restart
[0:36:11] YOhodges: does it not clear the memory or whatever its called
[0:36:17] Dylo321: just restart 4Head
[0:36:19] Gelil: Heap allocation.
[0:36:21] YOhodges: memory dumps?
[0:36:25] G_Saiderman: idk dude
[0:36:26] FlammAlpha: can split it up, the space is managed by the OS
[0:36:28] DarkSpooon: Have you tried turning it off and back on again Kappa
[0:36:29] kennycraig: just get it working 4Head
[0:36:34] Stoods_: It's called virtual memory, it doesn't have to be continuous
[0:36:35] Dylo321: yh it can split it up
[0:36:38] JustGlennBE: Just buy new PC
[0:36:39] podwe: how much ram assigned to MC, also Java was updated rcently
[0:36:39] kingLordsy: java autoallocates, you just create/stop using variables and java does the allocation itself
[0:36:50] chochi314: No, it is covered by operating system, and it can map "sparse" physical memory to "continuus" logical memory
[0:36:52] CoolReal: Memory crash?
[0:36:54] minedmatrix: I've gone from pest control to industrial maintenance to an engineer. I did it the long way but there is no way I knew what I wanted for the rest if my life at 18. half the fun was getting here
[0:37:04] Gelil: No, the jvm has three sections in the heap. But the heap is whole when allocated
[0:37:09] Tabakhase: na
[0:37:12] DaGMC: I'd suspects that the garbage collector had an out of memory issue
[0:37:19] Tabakhase: got nothing todo with another
[0:37:24] podwe: u cleared temp ms cache recently?
[0:37:33] HostileLogOut: its prob not a memory issue. its most likely a mod that causes the problem. its common
[0:37:41] dogma802: Memory allocated on the heap is pretty granular. There's multiple ways to allocate memory. IN Ca you can use malloc which is really granular or use mmap which gives you pages
[0:37:52] FlammAlpha: manual space allocation in C can be dangerous since the OS is using some ordering magic, and defining specific addresses can interfere. allocation nowadays is "I want X GB" and the OS gives you a virtual space
[0:37:55] Tabakhase: memtest68 for 24 hours or stfu rly...
[0:37:58] HostileLogOut: also dont put to much memory. it doesn't like that for some reason
[0:38:02] DaGMC: because windows hasnt sufficient memory to fulfill any memory request
[0:38:10] Gelil: Minecraft does a lot of static allocation, these are allocated first when the heap is initialized
[0:38:11] Hyduss_: PC needs to sleep to some times
[0:38:14] Tabakhase: KEKW hell no
[0:38:16] HostileLogOut: do 6-8 for that pack seems okay
[0:38:23] Chronoes: that's standard Java KEKW
[0:38:24] Tabakhase: i have java threads sitting at 120gb
[0:38:24] Apparentthreat: @Giantwaffle could it be a memory page file thing?
[0:38:26] merscever: 8000 is optimal, 10 gb gives you memory garbage dumps
[0:38:29] MSPaintEnthusiast: are you going to do the python course on stream?
[0:38:31] chochi314: More probably some bug in concurrent part of Minecraft mod, which depends on precise timing
[0:38:38] FlammAlpha: the program I used to develop at my last workplace used up 60+GB with Java
[0:38:41] sliderspy: what @merscever says
[0:38:41] ba_nanananananana: 640K ought to be enough, really
[0:38:46] Gelil: And are not subject to the same GC rules as the new and swap sections of the heap
[0:38:47] podwe: u have 16Gb ram or less?
[0:39:04] jess_laney: i just changed my degree to network management... sooner or later i'll be able to help
[0:39:06] merscever: even if you have 64 gb ram, 8000 for minecraft is the best
[0:39:17] mechoriet: sublime?
[0:39:22] Kohta_Sama: polka widepeepoHappy
[0:39:22] DaGMC: u have to distinguish between physical and virtual memory
[0:39:24] BONBONNIE13: AYAYA
[0:39:24] FlammAlpha: some versions of our java program used up more than 100GB KEKW
[0:39:49] Mike190Twitch: 64GB KEKW
[0:40:15] MSPaintEnthusiast: maybe shared wit nvme
[0:40:20] produkteriswf: isnt the shard one the integrate one?
[0:40:23] produkteriswf: shared-
[0:40:26] OverclockedPC: shared RAM is like just system ram + vram
[0:40:37] Mike190Twitch: 3090 should be 24GB
[0:40:59] OverclockedPC: well ofc it cant be all otherwise thats an allocation issue
[0:41:12] MSPaintEnthusiast: I though the gpu shares the memory with nvme on the pci
[0:41:14] FlammAlpha: its a small portion for an equivalent to the paging file like system memory is getting offloaded to the harddrive when full
[0:41:25] sliderspy: when ingame you can press F3 to see if your garbage collecter keeps up
[0:41:33] Chronoes: Our Elasticsearch is currently using about 8GB of memory
[0:41:47] sankhazo: Do you trim your beard or just let it grow?
[0:41:47] Moobot: You can find Waffle's Youtube channel here - https://youtube.com/giantwaffle
[0:41:59] Stoods_: The way RAM works is the operating system segments it into chunks, and then there are system calls which java will use to ask for more chunks of memory
[0:42:02] kypudo: It was crashing because u didn't reboot, it should work now the arguments
[0:42:06] CoolReal: What do you think when youtubers do youtube as their job but don't bother investing in the setup even with huge audiences?
[0:42:17] ItsOnMax: grooming KEKW

[0:42:48] Stoods_: @Gelil agree 100%
[0:42:50] DarkSpooon: Lirik Kappa
[0:42:53] Tabakhase: I got a paid winrar YEP
[0:42:58] DaGMC: @Gelil +1
[0:42:58] twiQsP: notepad++ > everything
[0:43:00] Kohta_Sama: paying for winrar monkaS
[0:43:00] CoolReal: Like having a shit computer that can't even handle their main content
[0:43:01] DarkSpooon: Register it!
[0:43:02] Allmostdone: To support the developers
[0:43:11] JBourden: as a bit
[0:43:12] Tabakhase: it was discord... and the night was long KEKW
[0:43:15] sankhazo: LGR did, bought a CD ROM
[0:43:19] Tabakhase: they sold like 20 copies that day KEKW
[0:43:20] jess_laney: after my web dev class i learned brackets is just as good as sublime
[0:43:22] FlammAlpha: 7zip or gtfo FeelsWeirdMan
[0:43:24] ItsOnMax: Why use winRAR when Windows can ZIP stuff for you
[0:43:28] QuesoBad0nga: who buys winrar having 7zip
[0:43:33] airforce9000: @Tabakhase KEKW
[0:43:37] BONBONNIE13: people who pay for WinRAR > people who donate to Wikipedia > everyone else who ever has, currently does, or ever will exist
[0:43:48] JBourden: always be gliding
[0:43:50] Allmostdone: The windows zip sucks
[0:43:59] jarrettjarecke: How you been waffle
[0:44:00] d0peinc: we love cakes
[0:44:02] podwe: 7zip deffo, never paid for any expander, zips free on mac too
[0:44:02] Kohta_Sama: Paying for Winrar is weak, how about paying for mIRC LULW
[0:44:06] MSPaintEnthusiast: I was watching Spirited Away movie two days ago and the soundtracks just like the one in Minecraft woooo
[0:44:08] CoolReal: Memory leaks due to cake count Kappa
[0:44:10] davethulhu: can you not eat the last piece or are you just saving them
[0:44:13] aCookienot: buying sublime might be a good way to support the developer, i don't know, maybe it's dumb
[0:44:13] philipkatis: @Allmostdone It really is terrible KEKW
[0:44:14] podwe: stuffit whaat?
[0:44:15] zynithtv: what are we looking for?
[0:44:26] Stoods_: tar.gz is better than zip 100%
[0:44:39] BONBONNIE13: gachiBASS
[0:44:41] M1k3D3l7a: I think buying a Winrar license is probably one of the biggest flex you can do

[0:44:58] Surge43: F
[0:45:02] Allmostdone: @philipkatis It’s just confusing much like MS whole UI/UX
[0:45:06] GenerlKat: probably has to do with loading chunks in the other realm while in this one
[0:45:09] Skipper_1024: rolled a nat 1
[0:45:23] JBourden: sheep are food too
[0:45:27] OverclockedPC: speaking of videos, u see that they took down and sold "charlie bit my finger" as an NFT?
[0:45:32] Chronoes: WinRAR's icon is baller, nice and colourful, 3D. None of that bland flat icons that are popular now
[0:45:35] Invalidm_: hi chat PETTHECUTIE
[0:45:36] GenerlKat: you have your base being loaded constantly and then loading into this world probably does it
[0:45:41] Tauruntino: Why would you use winrar when 7zip is available?
[0:45:47] Tabakhase: is sublime just a evaluation copy waffleThink
[0:45:50] Mike190Twitch: Imagine saving the video locally LUL
[0:45:54] Stoods_: Windows is just bad, the only good thing it has is DirectX
[0:45:57] OverclockedPC: its been removed from yt lol
[0:45:58] CoolReal: They are doing the same to Rick Roll
[0:46:01] Mike190Twitch: Buying a video is the stupidest shit ever imo
[0:46:02] OverclockedPC: the original at least
[0:46:12] Gelil: NOP
[0:46:12] M1k3D3l7a: absolutely not
[0:46:19] philipkatis: @Allmostdone Not only that; I've had problems where the extracted files were corrupted. Spent a whole day trying to figure out why.
[0:46:23] Kohta_Sama: why would you spend your entire life savings on a jpg?
[0:46:24] Kohta_Sama: widePepeLaugh
[0:46:26] QuesoBad0nga: the charlie bit me!!!
[0:46:33] JBourden: wonder how much a billion views brings in

[1:03:07] Renny_S: insane torque

[1:03:46] DaGMC: are there EVs in Snowrunner?
[1:03:47] Nexhunter: the range is for your actual work crews not your fifth wheel free roaming folks
[1:03:57] OverclockedPC: the whole electric semi thing is gonna be interesting
[1:04:09] IOIBURGERIOI: they need to switch because of their limits or small engines, its looking like it will only be the mustang for cars in ford dealerships from now on
[1:04:26] dax573: feral lantern good light
[1:04:31] CoolReal: Redstone + Quartz + Certus Quartz in the chamber makes the Fluix
[1:04:38] Allmostdone: Just buy a long electrical cord. Problem solved
[1:05:11] Okkelsskov: @OverclockedPC is electric semis the focus in the US, and not hydrogen based ones?
[1:05:26] WGG25: 3k redstone? how monkaHmm
[1:06:17] Venxuri: didn't cause any in my base
[1:06:17] Moobot: You can sub to Waffle by clicking this neat link -> twitch.tv/giantwaffle/subscribe
[1:06:22] Mike190Twitch: Feral Flares arent that bad
[1:06:22] RussianRainbowTV: no
[1:06:23] ItsOnMax: @Okkelsskov Hydrogen is just electric with extra steps. Going full EV saves 80% of the energy needed for Hydrogen.
[1:06:26] WGG25: redstone takes the longest time in a centrifuge, did you make a ton of those, or what's the trick?
[1:06:42] Mike190Twitch: There is a setting the lantern GUI you'd change, that may cause issues, just dont tweak it
[1:06:47] pengeg: @okkelsskov the hydrogen car tech in the US is far behind because of lobbyists from both gas abd EV
[1:06:50] RussianRainbowTV: I've used a lot of them on servers and they dont cause any noticeable tick lag
[1:07:36] NevaDaha: good evening chatty chat and waffle pokiC

[1:08:20] NevaDaha: poki1 poki2
[1:08:21] NevaDaha: poki3 poki4 Clap
[1:08:28] ItsOnMax: Hydrogen is dead. Sure you can make big tanks in vehicles. You will still lose a lot of energy. Because the production of Hydrogen takes energy. And for propulsion, hydrogen needs to be reconverted to electricity inside the vehicle.
[1:08:34] OverclockedPC: satisfactory is soooo nice
[1:08:36] zynithtv: Clap
[1:08:42] Deepcast: they are adding the blueprint mod to base game which is cool

[1:09:21] zynithtv: sucks to honor a simp but flawless execution nonetheless
[1:09:25] CoolReal: If you put all fo that in the chamber it makes Fluix too
[1:09:26] Allmostdone: Why don’t why just use Energon cubes from the Transformers?
[1:09:59] Patchmax04: Are you going to download the quality of life mods for satisfactory?

[1:16:08] CoolReal: Apparently the modding community is very happy so I suppose it is good
[1:16:13] OverclockedPC: this song Kreygasm Kreygasm
[1:16:16] Tabakhase: just recompiled - but you have todo that in 99% of the cases anyhow on big mc updates...
[1:16:21] Stoods_: Normally programming languages try to be back compatible, but idk for this java update

[1:18:58] Mooretec: I never used Fractal cases, but this Devine 7 is GREAT, I highly recomend it
[1:19:03] JBourden: with ME conduits you could hide that wire thru the wall
[1:19:03] JadedOnyx19: mt front panel is off for air flow lol
[1:19:04] Tabakhase: open case can be worse if its well designed 5Head
[1:19:05] johnonamission: the three fans in the upper part do they push out air or insert air to push it out the back
[1:19:08] DuctTapeNinja_: I choose my case because it has handles on top.. (:
[1:19:10] OverclockedPC: cases are overrated
[1:19:31] DrHax_: I really hate those cases that are closed at the front, but have those slits to let air in... because fuck keeping dust out of the case catonREE
[1:19:32] CoolReal: Mineral Oil tank case KEKW
[1:19:32] N4RCO5: Problem is the design of the Ryzen, to many corse to dense, also the normal temp for them is 90c (source AMD)
[1:19:40] ItsOnMax: How is the external-water cooling going? @Giantwaffle
[1:19:44] OverclockedPC: i have a mining rig case

[1:20:02] CommanderUrsus: test workbench
[1:20:17] QuesoBad0nga: frame
[1:20:19] Vernash_: @omaplay typically you have intake on front and output on back/bottom, having 1 more intake fan that out decreases dust/maintenance
[1:20:19] CheesusTheCrust: does mobs spawn in your base without light?
[1:20:40] Kilowatt31: shoe rack!
[1:20:44] johnonamission: @omaplay ok thx
[1:21:08] OverclockedPC: @Giantwaffle u think gpu mining is still gonna be a decent thing to invest in in the future?
[1:21:52] CoolReal: That's good that mining goes obsolete
[1:22:00] OverclockedPC: eth2.0 gonna wreck everything lol
[1:22:06] N4RCO5: There is the possibility of a ssd shortage, cause there is a coin which is mined with harddrives (?)
[1:22:21] CantTouchDisNow: what about other Proof concepts like proof of storage and so on that is mining as well

[1:24:19] Renny_S: yea
[1:24:27] HostileLogOut: its based on plots. every plot is 109 Gb or so
[1:24:30] Renny_S: it can kill ur ssd in like 4 months or something

[1:24:45] Tabakhase: chai doesnt store anything
[1:24:55] Apparentthreat: how can the internet become more decentralized more than it already is? Lots of ad hoc networks? Don't use ISPs? Don't use regulated data centers?
[1:24:56] Tabakhase: and ipfs doesnt need a coing KEKW
[1:25:06] DaGMC: i think ssds are just used for plotting
[1:25:09] Tabakhase: chai stores just "lottery tckets" - nothing else KEKW

[1:26:19] QuesoBad0nga: it is a way of trying to be ahead of future problems
[1:26:29] Garzilla: Is that what inventors do in life as well? Create solutions for problems that don't exist and then create the problems needed for their solution
[1:26:46] Tasar_: Y2K

[1:27:11] DaGMC: 2037
[1:27:13] RoyalHares: then why do i always hear this is a future waffle problem?
[1:27:18] Garzilla: There's progression because you need it and progression because you just want to progress. One benefits people and the other doesn't.
[1:27:18] DaGMC: unix timestamp
[1:27:20] ruccoa: 2038 problem

[1:27:44] Tabakhase: imagine using 32bit ints in 2021 KEKW
[1:27:47] chuckg0tstuck: A lot of problems are known and actively worked on. Thats why there are standards updates for languages frequently
[1:27:56] Mike190Twitch: 2286?

[2:09:32] Sir_Medis: after that more popped up ofc
[2:09:36] Traupick: karamja locked UIM 5Head
[2:09:40] Traupick: KEKW

[2:11:53] Moobot: You can sub to Waffle by clicking this neat link -> twitch.tv/giantwaffle/subscribe
[2:12:05] Tompop23: The fact he’s doing the end game PvM grind on his main makes me think it’s not just going to be a PvM thing
[2:12:34] ruccoa: he's never done a non iron-man main. maybe that? just focus on making moneyt
[2:12:35] Kohta_Sama: elysian sigil, which is worth like 700m
[2:12:40] Traupick: i dont think settled is a PVPer
[2:12:43] count3rnova: @Sir_Medis  yea but its content he can cut the pure grind down to like a 20min youtube clip will be a first for anyone to do it
[2:12:48] kefyrasFTW: who is he?
[2:12:51] Tompop23: He’s getting max PvM gear yeah
[2:13:00] Blazedude99: @kefyrasFTW settled
[2:13:06] Kohta_Sama: Something similar to gridlocked would be cool yeah

[2:13:32] kefyrasFTW: @Blazedude99 ty
[2:13:37] Crack9860: cheer1000
[2:13:39] Traupick: i think hes gonna try to finish collection log without pets
[2:13:42] count3rnova: thats easy just do thieving for gold blackjack style

[2:13:45] Kohta_Sama: gridlocked except vertically, you're not allowed to go up or down ladders LULW
[2:13:52] Timiderxbox: That doesnt sound too bad, can sell stuff to general stores

[2:14:14] HostileLogOut: no
[2:14:19] Blazedude99: "beat"
[2:14:22] BobPatience: define "beat"
[2:14:24] Opsidill: What is "beating runescape"?
[2:14:29] Traupick: beat?
[2:14:30] Chyrion: max?
[2:14:33] count3rnova: to get max all 99s i doubt it
[2:14:33] kyanpeppaa: you need some gold for questing too so, might limit some stuff
[2:14:39] iSveeen: you need coins for some quests
[2:14:43] noxiiiouse: quest need gold
[2:14:52] Kohta_Sama: you can't do runecrafting without the quest for it
[2:14:52] Traupick: you can get most gear without gp
[2:14:53] BobPatience: but why would you want to not use any gold LUL
[2:14:55] Kohta_Sama: and the quest requires gold iirc
[2:14:58] Slymph: If you can skip the quests that require gold, sure u can do it
[2:15:21] daedmissica0: to make planks
[2:15:23] iSveeen: but do you complete the game with skipping those quests lol
[2:15:26] Kohta_Sama: herblore and rc require quests though, so can't train those without iirc
[2:15:27] Blazedude99: construction requires gold
[2:15:27] daedmissica0: you need gp
[2:15:36] ruccoa: repairing armor, construction
[2:15:38] Tompop23: PvP locked UIM
[2:15:40] Traupick: no
[2:15:44] BobPatience: you can train construction without gold, just slowly
[2:15:46] count3rnova: well no you can pick up planks
[2:15:46] Chyrion: you can get planks from other sources without gp
[2:15:49] Aldiron: not necessarily, there's plank drops next to barb agility
[2:16:03] Aldiron: just regular planks
[2:16:05] Kohta_Sama: regular ass planks ye
[2:16:11] Traupick: the main methods for getting planks are all out
[2:16:11] ruccoa: "that sounds so tedious" so does getting 85 slayer from temple trekking
[2:16:12] count3rnova: would be slow as f
[2:16:14] Aldiron: 4 spawn points
[2:16:14] Blazedude99: don't you have to spend gp to buy a house?
[2:16:14] Slymph: Pretty sure u can also get con exp without having to use planks, its just extremely slow
[2:16:16] Aldiron: so slow as f
[2:16:29] Traupick: oh you cant get a house
[2:16:31] Traupick: LUL
[2:16:37] Kohta_Sama: monkaHmm
[2:16:45] Slymph: Base house is free no? so its just rooms u cant buy
[2:16:46] BobPatience: not restrictive enough
[2:16:58] iSveeen: hardcore region locked ultimate ironman
[2:17:01] Tompop23: Nah, house is from the quest now right?
[2:17:07] TheMathisfaction: He doesnt like banks, so probably not
[2:17:10] Aldiron: that's the thing, with this series we've seen that settled can pretty much do anything, so the "surprise" of "oh wow settled did this" is getting harder and harder to find.
[2:17:12] Kohta_Sama: HC UIM region locked and time-period locked Kappa
[2:17:29] count3rnova: he can only move diagonally LUL
[2:17:30] kyanpeppaa: bronzeman mode from framed is where if you dont pick up / bank the item, you cant use it or buy it
[2:17:36] Aldiron: j1mmy's by release series has been fantastic too
[2:17:44] count3rnova: osrs bishop style
[2:17:44] mrdoctorcheese: Direction locked? Can only move in the same direction until X happens
[2:17:46] Kohta_Sama: by release is wafflePog as fuck
[2:18:04] Thorin5: @Kohta_Sama i know someone who is already doing that, goal to do every quest
[2:18:22] Traupick: by release as an ironman is annoying

[2:22:48] GenerlKat: who are you guys talking about?

[2:23:14] FairePlaie: does in the pack it have / homeset ?
[2:23:22] zynithtv: you should just keep the glider in your inventory for all overworld missions
[2:23:32] zynithtv: oh you had it nvm
[2:23:35] count3rnova: runescape is a good game to go back to when you run out
[2:23:36] Aldiron: everything is just a break, never quit.

[2:23:56] Kohta_Sama: every time I've said I'm quitting, I come back literally a month later LULW
[2:24:19] ItsOnMax: You never stop clapping. The time between claps just increases Kappa

[2:25:12] Kohta_Sama: seeing as how single jpgs sell for millions, an entire stream could go for trillions per LULW
[2:25:20] ruccoa: that kurtzgesat video was a suckerpunch to the soul
[2:25:36] NodBabe: @Giantwaffle Are you going to play Biomutant?
[2:25:40] inorganic: I read selling streams as selling nfts for specific videos
[2:25:40] BobPatience: Twitch probably won't like it
[2:25:44] FatRat_: Could you "give" it to someone for free? KEWK
[2:25:49] MechaDom: Can you?  Sure... Is it allowed?  Most likely not
[2:25:53] GenerlKat: @Blazedude99 Thanks
[2:25:56] Mandorake: it looks ok
[2:25:57] The_Holas: do you need to sign it as Physical person or can you do it as legal entity?
[2:25:58] BaTu016: 5Head
[2:26:02] ymelus: its trashy lmao
[2:26:08] Mandorake: its a single player open world RPG
[2:26:08] dabeda1: biomutant look so..... rough
[2:26:12] count3rnova: its a dungeon crawler
[2:26:13] bEC69_: you "can not" but you for sure can, buyer is not necessary save from ban pepeLaugh
[2:26:14] davethulhu: it's an adventure game
[2:26:18] BobPatience: It's like RPG-ish openworld-ish indie game for AAA price
[2:26:23] Askjong: Would you play Erica?
[2:26:26] HostileLogOut: its not a good game. its really really badly reviewed even. and people are saying its highly overpriced at 60.
[2:26:30] K3ll06s: Its a "indie" game sold to full price and yeah, some reviews are reeaaaly bad
[2:26:31] dav30h: apprently its not worth it
[2:26:32] SpookyClips: looks like Sly
[2:26:35] Wulfenst: Wulfenst subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 9 months! Wait for a sale, not worth the 60$ price tag from what I have seen...
[2:26:43] Mandorake: I know it was a small team working on it so feel bad talking trash but its got issues
[2:26:44] MrCrobe: You know what game got updated and not abandoned? Osiris: New Dawn... caught me by surprise LUL
[2:26:45] count3rnova: wow nice vtuber tabs xD
[2:26:46] Kohta_Sama: even cohh mentioned it's kinda eh for him
[2:26:47] Bentongfu: really bsd reviews
[2:26:49] Consaa: you got like 6 streams open at all times? D:
[2:26:59] BobPatience: I would say Days Gone is much better of an experience, if you can gt through the start.
[2:27:03] nicedec: tuto is 3h and not very complet
[2:27:04] ItsOnMax: @Consaa don't you? Kappa
[2:27:14] Troupster: I just wrote an OCR for my website that will grab text out of any image you copy paste or put a url, its great cuz you can just use windows key + shift + s and paste it into the browser..
[2:27:16] BobPatience: not it's not EA
[2:27:17] Consaa: @ItsOnMax mah computah widepeepoSad
[2:27:29] ItsOnMax: widepeepoSad
[2:27:34] Wulfenst: No its a full release
[2:27:39] HostileLogOut: the game took years to complete and was overhyped. and it failed badly.
[2:27:39] The_Holas: isnt that like normal LUL pay for beta test a game LUL
[2:28:01] BobPatience: i don't think it failed, it just isnt AAA quality by a stretch

[2:28:09] Wulfenst: @HostileLogOut wouldnt say it failed badly, just not worth a 60$ price tag. 30-45$ makes more sense.
[2:28:14] count3rnova: cyberpunk over hype situation getting forced into release
[2:28:16] Kohta_Sama: imagine anthem, working on that shit for SIX years cirSlain
[2:28:17] ItsOnMax: Thats how it goes, hit or miss
[2:28:18] HostileLogOut: @BobPatience everyone who plays it says otherwise lol
[2:28:19] MrCrobe: As I mentioned Osiris new dawn... its crazy
[2:28:30] BoomShaqaLaqa: after it got fixed, id sya its def worth 60
[2:28:35] BoomShaqaLaqa: but at launch, it def wasnt
[2:28:36] killerpaul: controlling hype is just as important as generating it
[2:28:47] HostileLogOut: ontop of that Biomutant has a annoying Narrator saying something all the time.
[2:28:48] Allmostdone: people are complaining because its $60 but 60 is the new 30
[2:28:48] BoomShaqaLaqa: but once they fixed the bs in it, i just felel more and more in love with the game
[2:29:03] BoomShaqaLaqa: Days gone is underrated imo
[2:29:04] FatRat_: I doubt developers at large companies get paid more if the game does well, they already delivered on the product right?
[2:29:05] 4729_zex: i love games just dropping without any hint
[2:29:18] Wulfenst: @BoomShaqaLaqa once you get through the first several hours that are terrible.
[2:29:24] Allmostdone: very true on the pay
[2:29:25] ipyro0: any way to test if you have power before committing?
[2:29:29] BoomShaqaLaqa: yeah the start is def slow @Wulfenst
[2:29:34] Fhuey: 99% of EA games turn out to be shit tough
[2:29:35] CantTouchDisNow: factorio was amazing with the friday facts with technical insights
[2:29:38] JBourden: i like memeing with snut and jace
[2:29:39] count3rnova: @FatRat_  the normal devs dont but like heads of team and head devs get bonuses depending on sales
[2:29:44] BobPatience: Cubeworld PepeHands
[2:29:46] TheIrishGuy: Dyson Sphere
[2:29:47] Aldiron: most of the games that you're mentioning feel like full games even in EA state.
[2:29:56] HostileLogOut: @Giantwaffle i would say Path of exile did a wonderful job as a EA title for some time
[2:29:59] KotsBeu: Does someone know how to resolve a Discord account that got disabled by Discord?
[2:30:00] ItsOnMax: Like KSP did
[2:30:05] complexprotein: Rimworld was awesome for that
[2:30:06] dav30h: rust did it

[2:30:33] BobPatience: Just do it like Factorio. Go in EA with a full, working game and have a proper weekly dev blog.
[2:30:35] bonafidebadger: I think grounded is going to be great once finished

[2:46:10] coolcake2: baccarat is exactly 50-50
[2:46:19] zynithtv: only house edge is taking percentage of bank hands
[2:46:19] Aldiron: blackjack is like 50.5% house, 49.5% if you're playing with good strategy.
[2:46:22] The_kid_as_a_teen: @Giantwaffle what is baccarat ?
[2:46:25] ColfaxMingo: The best odds are poker, because you aren't always playing the house.
[2:46:25] Oinkylicious: baccarat has a house edge
[2:46:26] punkgeek: Nothing in Vega is 50-50 and nothing ever will be
[2:46:30] Allmostdone: or just cheat
[2:46:40] bansheErin: im a roulette person with someone spinning the wheel and me betting on the screens lol
[2:46:49] Archelonde: baccarat has house edge on banker winning on 6, pays 50%
[2:47:10] zynithtv: baccarat bank edge depends on the casino
[2:47:43] zynithtv: the casino i worked at took 5% of bank hand payouts
[2:47:43] FinnYellowbelly: Roulette colors are near even (depending on EU or US) 48.65%

[2:54:12] aundros: Just gotten here. I'm so confused right now lol
[2:54:14] Surge43: So if you looked at 5, would you want TTTTH?
[2:54:21] DigitalVortex92: Someone watched the VSauce2 video
[2:54:22] Tech: It's because the game is non-transitive

[2:55:11] Allmostdone: I choose side, side, side

[2:57:41] Tech: It's how every strategy game should be made KEKW
[2:57:41] TxMaverick88: the second person isnt picking a "pattern". you're just copying the first 2 guesses so they then dont matter for you
[2:57:48] Crazyfox55: Whats the closest then?
[2:58:04] The_Holas: if they chose at same time thats just Rock paper sci..
[2:58:16] The_Holas: with extra steps
[2:58:17] RodriCraft93: well people are most likely to chose paper or rock, thats why you should start with scissor buts thats a personality trait
[2:58:30] ColfaxMingo: Good old Rock, nothing beats Rock.
[2:58:40] Tech: It's 7:1 for some of them
[2:58:50] Drmaxishere: it's still 50/50 in the long run

[3:00:54] Tech: Yeah
[3:00:56] Tech: It's nuts
[3:00:58] DigitalVortex92: for 3 in a row, yea
[3:01:02] RodriCraft93: thats why they always nerf mid lane? @Tech  KEKW
[3:01:03] Vovosunt: hhh is very unlikely so
[3:01:07] Drmaxishere: we did this in school and it didnt work though
[3:01:09] DigitalVortex92: its less probably when you start mixing faces
[3:01:12] n00rman_: makes sense, for HHH to win he has to win in the first 3
[3:01:13] ruccoa: as soon as a tails comes up you win
[3:01:20] Gnuborg: no it's not
[3:01:20] DigitalVortex92: HHH and TTT are the same probability
[3:01:25] Drmaxishere: still ended up being 50 50
[3:01:30] DigitalVortex92: @Drmaxishere No
[3:01:33] Helo_KiX: not only is HHH unlikely they have to get it on the first 3 flips or they lose

[3:02:17] dstryko: pepeLaugh enemies
[3:02:20] coolcake2: THT is kinda best choice
[3:02:24] AsHackDM: monkaHmm
[3:02:27] n00rman_: what if the coins had 3 sides?
[3:02:28] TxMaverick88: @Vovosunt notice your guess includes the first guess. This heavily skews the odds since it makes 2 of your guesses not matter
[3:02:29] Tradios: THT pepeSmoke
[3:02:38] DadGamer_81: THC always wins.
[3:02:39] Drmaxishere: @DigitalVortex92 i guess if u weigh each side of the coin, one side is slightly heavier than the other
[3:02:39] Helo_KiX: @vovosunt essentially by copying their 1st 2 selections you're making it so that when they get their first 2 you've already finished your pattern
[3:02:45] Doritobob269: @giantwaffle The new Archimedes numberphile video is so neat, you'd like it
[3:02:46] DigitalVortex92: @Drmaxishere FailFish
[3:02:49] MiraPacku: tsk tsk tsk pepeSmoke
[3:03:08] mitsuki_11: wait that made it make so much sense
[3:03:11] DigitalVortex92: This isn't about the probability of flipping a single side. It's the probability of flipping a sequence of faces
[3:03:11] dasmako: interestng
[3:03:19] MiraPacku: NODDERS you get it now chat
[3:03:21] airforce9000: quite simple actually 5Head
[3:03:21] Drmaxishere: oh mb
[3:03:23] StOrMy1100: @Drmaxishere This is not about tails or head = 50/50. It's about the sequence of hitting tails or head in a row
[3:03:26] TxMaverick88: @mitsuki_11 yeah, basically your guess only has to hit the first number. his has to hit all 3
[3:03:31] CMCh4se: so @Giantwaffle you had 2/3 chance and me 1/3?
[3:03:32] Allmostdone: unless you have a loaded coin
[3:03:38] Tech: It's also tough because it's ingrained in our mind that a coin toss is 50/50 and fair
[3:03:42] DigitalVortex92: Yup
[3:03:53] Chronoes: I mean it stops being 50/50 if you're going to pick a sequence, rather than a single chance
[3:03:58] DigitalVortex92: ^ yes
[3:04:01] Gnuborg: it's a game of picking the superior sequence
[3:04:02] Miestro: it's really about who picks first. if both picked at the same time it'd be more fair right?
[3:04:02] ColfaxMingo: It's not 50/50 because it's a chain not an independent event
[3:04:07] Drmaxishere: yeah so why make it a coin flip, wow
[3:04:17] n00rman_: @Miestro 50/50
[3:04:26] TxMaverick88: @Miestro correct
[3:04:37] Tech: Chronoes not even that too. It's also the fact that you are picking before someone else who can use your pick as information
[3:04:38] DigitalVortex92: @Drmaxishere You can similarly apply this logic to a 3 sided object, or 4 sided object
[3:04:41] Helo_KiX: Matt Parker did a video on the coin flip landing on the side
[3:04:44] AtchTwoOh: have you seen the video where they calculate how thick a coin should be with a fair coin?
[3:04:45] DigitalVortex92: It just gets infinitely more complex the more sides you ahve
[3:04:45] Gnuborg: it'd be fair if you if you only throw 3 coins as well
[3:04:46] Gelil: It’s also based on the confidence of what you trying to prove
[3:04:46] Crazyfox55: Probability 0 can still happen.
[3:04:47] coolcake2: not if you catch it HahaThink
[3:04:53] Allmostdone: of course we thought that coin toss was fair... just like an American
[3:05:10] Drmaxishere: @DigitalVortex92 ik i just don't like how they use a coin toss as an example
[3:05:12] TxMaverick88: @Gnuborg also true.
[3:05:17] Helo_KiX: @giantwaffle Standup Maths has a video on the coin landing on its side I think
[3:05:30] DigitalVortex92: @Drmaxishere A coin toss is the best example to show how engrained our minds are into thinking 1 thing when in reality its different
[3:05:41] JBourden: oh man look at those cOnDUiTs Clap Clap Clap
[3:05:43] Myekos: I had a nickel land on the edge when I was a kid.  Never since.
[3:05:54] DigitalVortex92: 50/50 sequences should be 50/50 according to our train of though, but non-transitive thinking is now how we are programmed
[3:05:55] bEC69_: and then there is invis
[3:05:57] sogerr: RTS type of games are all like that
[3:06:01] Chronoes: @Tech true but what I meant that even if you fight against yourself, it's not a 50/50 chance that the sequence you picked appears in the first 3-6 throws
[3:06:07] benjamin_berry: Rock Paper Scissors
[3:06:09] Tech: The strategy is circular rather than a pyramid
[3:06:10] MiraPacku: it's like advanced rock paper scissors NODDERS
[3:06:11] Gelil: Until you play wow. Then everyone can do all the things.
[3:06:11] DigitalVortex92: So its pretty part to get over that hurdle and accept its different
[3:06:44] Helo_KiX: @chronoes yeah that's why the best odds you can get if you pick first is 33%
[3:06:44] Tech: @Chronoes yeah! :d

[3:07:03] Myekos: Waffle, I also found a mirror my first week of playing POE during the open beta.  7k hours later, it remains the only one I've seen.

[3:18:59] CMCh4se: @StOrMy1100 yeah, i think with crypto just getting the FOMO these days, it makes way less sense to me how crypto evaluation formulates
[3:19:07] kyoo_mibu: hey everyone
[3:19:23] TxMaverick88: @Giantwaffle whats your guess on the amount of people who have made enough with crypto to have to put in on their taxes that havent done so?

[3:22:00] JBourden: not federally legal?
[3:22:03] punkgeek: Correct, it would need to be allowed first
[3:22:16] Miestro: Someone should lobby, if they want to tax crypto to use the tax money to modernize power generation, electric/hydrogen or something
[3:22:18] punkgeek: Can't tax stuff you don't permit sales on
[3:22:23] FingerGames: biden may do it KEKW

[3:22:41] ThatVanGuy: GME up 12% to 202
[3:22:42] CMCh4se: i guess in US the tax rates depend on the earning brackets and location? Curious how much they are though.
[3:22:44] TxMaverick88: Like that hypothetical case of a kidnapper getting hit harder by not paying taxes on the ransom than the actual kidnapping.
[3:23:01] Allmostdone: They would have to go back thru prisons and release a bunch of people
[3:23:11] KRAM941: Is there a federal tax on alcohol? I thought all that stuff was just states sales taxes
[3:23:16] Miestro: it depends a lot @CMCh4se and income is different from capital gains (stock/crypto sales)
[3:23:33] FlaminJurr: base starting to look nice now! :D
[3:23:36] punkgeek: @CMCh4se Yes, we pay federal tax on income, which varies by income bracket. Most states also collect income tax, with their own brackets
[3:23:44] Jamswhat2: yes
