[0:09:59] Turbologic: PauseChamp
[0:10:00] Mitchellmay: Morning waffle
[0:10:00] C0ldPlasma: Crossaint
[0:10:07] Turbologic: it was crazy
[0:10:07] Taizun: SponsorBlock also skips non-music stuff in music videos, skips endcards, skips intros, etc
[0:10:16] Tabakhase: ya yeeeeeet waffleBoi
[0:10:17] ChoOyu: Ariane is solid no worries Kappa
[0:10:19] Turbologic: also day 7 on the trip is pretty important

[0:11:13] 0x000000: just don't make mistakes 4Head
[0:11:23] Vargh: that's why they under-performed the launch, so they can adjust that with the 3 mid course corrections
[0:11:24] mahajimbo: peepoHmm trust in the math
[0:11:35] CorSPACE: might be able to get an mev to it
[0:11:43] Voidray_: they have a docking ring on it, so they could refuel in the future
[0:11:45] duyy018: hubble 20years right?
[0:11:46] streyder: The issue with webb is, that thruster fuel cannot be refueled
[0:11:47] afd33_: they hope to be able to refuel it one day

[0:11:59] ChoOyu: Elons working on that already
[0:12:02] gawlfer: the cost overrun does not make sense given the short lifespan
[0:12:03] Robohornet: They said they are already working on designing an autonomous refueling mission for it @Giantwaffle
[0:12:05] sam8825: they've got 10 years to figure that out
[0:12:05] ManosV1: merry Christmas all!!! happy holidays!!!

[0:12:53] Blazedasthesun: waffleSip
[0:12:54] TurtleSwisss: NODERS
[0:13:02] dennixfailalot: 5 to 10 years is so poor,,
[0:13:08] audy: Yes
[0:13:14] audy: I agree
[0:13:15] yuroxjust: It would be nice if it costs less, but indeed it is necessary
[0:13:15] JoxerTheM1ghty: For every answer we will get we will find 100 new mysteries
[0:13:16] Tabakhase: just think about actual material costs - exclude all the money spend that remains on earth
[0:13:21] MJ711: but can you use this telescope as a weapon? if yea than 10bil is worth
[0:13:23] ManosV1: if we spent on space what we spend on military we would have been to mars by now
[0:13:25] mahajimbo: PepeFlushed
[0:13:27] Turbologic: it's crazy i was watching RealEnginner video
[0:13:28] EzMoNeY_13: When will we see the first pictures from this telscope? @Giantwaffle
[0:13:34] CorSPACE: 6 months
[0:13:37] Puudding: its time travel time, sorta

[0:13:43] ChoOyu: Summer ish @Ezmoney_13
[0:13:47] ShionSinX: DSL, Deep Space Lobjects
[0:13:48] streyder: @dennixfailalot Well, worlds best engineers couldnt figure a better way to do it so.. tough luck
[0:14:07] Robohornet: Military funding and research is the only reason we are as advanced in space as we are right now. It has all built on military technology
[0:14:16] Turbologic: me most sketchy thing is opening the sun shield because of the folding
[0:14:24] Turbologic: the*
[0:14:25] syntaxow: Development began in 1996 KEKW
[0:14:28] its__fil: Once it's in orbit it's cooling down to operating temps for 4-5 weeks and aligning/setting up optics for another 5 months
[0:14:30] mechoriet: 300 steps right?
[0:14:35] Secondrate_King: 300
[0:14:35] JoxerTheM1ghty: @Giantwaffle have you watched Dont look up on netflix?
[0:14:36] mechoriet: or something close it it
[0:14:38] Etah620: 340 single point steps
[0:14:41] spookey165: mmmm 10 bil telescope and they used sandwitch alum foil
[0:14:53] ManosV1: only 340 steps...
[0:14:58] Tabakhase: 50 distinct systems, with over 300 steps YEP
[0:14:59] Turbologic: they open it in day 7
[0:15:04] MJ711: @Robohornet true. Almost every space project was based on a military needs
[0:15:05] Vargh: read all about it https://jwst.nasa.gov/content/webbLaunch/whereIsWebb.html
[0:15:16] skokpo: When is the unfolding gonna start ?
[0:15:17] ChoOyu: iam sure the QA Team is on its edge :D
[0:15:23] Blazedasthesun: There’s a really good YouTube video about it
[0:15:37] Banana_Pizza_Enjoyer: it must be overengineered... it has to work 10000%
[0:15:40] BobTaco21: I get goosebumps when I see us launching stuff that blows the previous version out of the water. To see us take these strides is incredible
[0:15:49] mechoriet: also maybe to have time to make sure everything ikaj
[0:15:49] Silic0nJ3sus: This broadcast just makes me think of how spoiled we are with SpaceX's launch coverage.
[0:15:59] Sirgevz: widepeepoHappy happy holidays
[0:15:59] kester88: @Robohornet only fraction is actually used for space devs

[0:16:40] saeed_bow: is this kerbal 2 ? :D
[0:16:42] ChoOyu: That shit was epic
[0:16:54] Robohornet: @kester88 I'm aware, but all of our advancements in space are built on military tech that military funding was spent on. Without that we would have to spend a load more on space to make up for that
[0:16:55] ShionSinX: @saeed_bow boycott it!
[0:16:57] Mitchellmay: Merry Christmas waffle
[0:17:01] kester88: i mean who doesnt like space penetration Kappa
[0:17:02] Silic0nJ3sus: I cried when the first double booster landed succeeded. No shame.
[0:17:04] Banana_Pizza_Enjoyer: well their markenting sparks interests in young people which are future engineers and astronauts

[0:18:08] snor6: SLS is a launcher though, starship is a prototype
[0:18:09] Mitchellmay: Can someone catch me up on what’s going on?
[0:18:10] WDForty: don't Starship and SLS serve different purposes?

[0:18:52] MDSZilla: Starship has done lots of testing
[0:18:55] Lazermage23: $146 Million per SLS rocket
[0:19:05] WDForty: i thought Starship is for ppl transport, while SLS is for heavy lifting cargo? or am i wrong?
[0:19:15] CorSPACE: thats just how traditional aerospace works
[0:19:15] Lazermage23: and there are 4 of them per rocket

[0:21:37] audy: Nice
[0:21:39] WDForty: that's the advantage of reusable, don't need to save $ with mass manufacturing when you can keep reusing the same smaller number over and over
[0:21:40] MarquesCoding: @Turbologic No problem, have a nice christmas!
[0:21:44] BlueberryKing: Less than a mil? You're saying I could cash in my retirement fund for a raptor engine? going to the bank right now peepoLeave

[0:22:41] Lazermage23: Think about it this way, it cost Starlink $15 million to launch 60 satellites
[0:22:42] Tabakhase: you can radio, you can see, and vac does not "increase" - soooo much simpler indeed
[0:22:50] Tabakhase: water is insane hard
[0:23:04] Kuzel99: water is also wet
[0:23:09] BobTaco21: @Giantwaffle If I am not mistaken in Scuba we were taught that every 10 meters is another 1 atmosphere of pressure
[0:23:12] reasonz0rd: @Kuzel99 Kappa
[0:23:17] Orin_The_Sly: We need to get Elon on it!

[0:23:41] CorSPACE: F9 raw cost is 62million
[0:23:43] syntaxow: @Lazermage23 so it would've been cheaper to hire SpaceX to build the telescope
[0:23:46] MarquesCoding: Space just blows my mind, space is huge and a LOT is unexplored and it just fascinates me
[0:23:54] Voidray_: 11 now
[0:23:58] C0ldPlasma: 11 is the record now
[0:24:02] Tabakhase: @syntaxow just that spaceX was not a thing in 1996 KEKW

[0:24:26] WoWCoreT: what show
[0:24:26] BobTaco21: The ocean too though. The amount of the ocean that hasnt been explored or looked into is insane.
[0:24:27] Tabakhase: @syntaxow and dont mix instrument cost with rocket, the rocket is a wet poop here..
[0:24:28] daemonaedryn: wdym you didnt realise, the trailer clearly showed itd be scary KEKW

[0:31:53] kester88: anyone remember Riddick
[0:32:06] Variosit: ad astra was really good
[0:32:08] WDForty: speaking of actor tropes, Matt Damon always gets stranded alone and needs a big rescue
[0:32:13] caedrel_is_my_mid: "In the end, the son suffers the sins of the father."
[0:32:19] Atomic5_: I didn't like ad astrada the first time but I watched it a second time and I understood it more and liked it

[0:44:51] CaptainAlkohol: the manifacturing of those mirrors is ridiculous. like how smooth they are
[0:44:52] n8level: always thought working in space tech would be awesome, but then stuff like this launches and I cant imagine the stress the devs must feel for like the next month+ -- epic

[0:45:26] spqr_ubernator: @Forcy24 They didnt
[0:45:26] bonedead: AFT FLAP
[0:45:29] Portain: @Giantwaffle Isn't a lot based on "theory" as they couldn't test it on earth?
[0:45:41] potf: n8level month? it will take a month to get into orbit, then another waitng to calibrate it that might take even longer
[0:45:41] streyder: Aluminium coated kaption, not mylar
[0:45:42] Cannonboot: @Forcy24 if you thought of it, they tested it
[0:45:45] Myekos: solar winds, baby
[0:45:55] spqr_ubernator: kapton
[0:45:59] spqr_ubernator: silicone coated
[0:45:59] chue_on_this: kapton

[0:46:07] MangoL0rd: @xLas neat, thanks
[0:46:08] Lazermage23: If this thing gets fucked out there, they are super screwed cause we cant go out there to fix it.......yet
[0:46:09] streyder: Aluminum coated Kapton
[0:46:14] Kasa21: it's so beautiful that honeycomb look
[0:46:23] Robohornet: The lower layer with the pink hue has a silicon coating
[0:46:26] LarryCordner: How many failure points have they passed already?
[0:46:28] Echonnaissance: o heck
[0:46:29] TrollMeMore: gachiBASS
[0:46:39] BlueberryKing: Holy shit the amount of time everything takes
[0:46:39] MetricImperialist: the shields are transparent without the coated aluminum
[0:46:44] streyder: The outermost layer is additionally doped with silicon for reflectiveness
[0:46:45] spqr_ubernator: JWST is exactly what I thought satellite looked like when I was a child
[0:46:46] g1tsch: and how big is a tennis court?

[0:47:00] Jay_Bajaj: thinner than human hair monkaS
[0:47:04] ITAFily84: Just wow
[0:47:06] potf: there is a video of it actually happening in a massive vacuum chamber, not an animation Giantwaffle
[0:47:09] Griddlez: and then space trash comes by and wrecks it
[0:47:15] caedrel_is_my_mid: Why cant I even properly cool my cpu then bruh
[0:47:16] CorSPACE: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxIJ4dJ31gg JWST when they were doing vibration testin
[0:47:19] sum_summ: real engineering has a really good video on james webb technical stand point
[0:47:23] MediocreStream: Will the russians take it out? monkaGun
[0:47:24] Jay_Bajaj: dude m nervous about d damage they will get due to space dust
[0:47:25] TammoNL: the motors can move with the speed the same as gras growning.. for the mirrors that is.. Insane imo
[0:47:25] GrantHaloost: the new star wars looks great
[0:47:26] Squatting_Duck: I hope its not like Hubble monkaS
[0:47:48] Ulikefishsticks: So many things have to work perfectly.
[0:47:48] 5mOkEwOw: @Griddlez I don't think there is any space trash near the orbit it is going to stay
[0:47:53] Echonnaissance: and this is all assuming their trajectory isnt in line with space debris
[0:48:00] GRAPHlC: Hey waffle merry xmas, how's your MC build getting along?
[0:48:02] LarryCordner: @감자타인 Thank you!
[0:48:05] MangoL0rd: Thats crazy
[0:48:06] potf: squatting_duck they designed it with that in mind, each section of the mirror can move
[0:48:18] MediocreStream: Plot twist, it's a laser gun
[0:48:19] aimACTUALLY: what can possibly go wrong Kappa
[0:48:21] xLas: Did you know that the motors controlling those mirrors are so accurate that they can work at the speed grass grow
[0:48:28] duyy018: each tiles can move ?
[0:48:32] potf: yes
[0:48:35] CutlasFury: why are they showing reflections?... isnt it going to be in pure darkness?
[0:48:44] 감자타인: @duyy018 yes
[0:48:51] spqr_ubernator: @CutlasFury So people can understand what they are looking at
[0:48:52] MetricImperialist: what's crazy is that the engineers anticipate multiple micro meteor strikes
[0:48:54] chue_on_this: I think one of the pieces of imaging equipment is cooled to 6-7 Kelvin
[0:49:03] Squatting_Duck: @potf I'm saying getting it right the first time, not necessarily the same issue

[1:22:12] yaardi: netherrite gets better enchants no?
[1:22:15] 1StClassAlcoholic: enchant diamond because netherite is expensive
[1:22:20] 5mOkEwOw: you can smith diamonds together, but you can't smith diamonds and netherite from what i know
[1:22:31] torey0: Only matters if you're gonna slam two pieces of gear together
[1:22:35] DX_Plates: @SpacedOut715 You should keep bad enchants on gear, thats what grind stones are for.
[1:22:43] dennixfailalot: it's weird to see waffle being a noob at mc
[1:23:05] DX_Plates: @5mOkEwOw Us smithing netherite onto diamonds is how netherite is made...

[2:28:12] CiVR: Yuh
[2:28:12] Beamer_Dreamer: @xfroze0 its a series of teleports that places u on spots so all chunks generate so u dont have lag later
[2:28:19] WDForty: oh, if you made a backup of those end map files, you could have done resets, also you can use a calculator to figure out which areas in the end belong to which map file chunk and only reset other files
[2:28:22] TheFernweh: Merry Christmas!
[2:28:25] xFroze0: @Beam_Machine_ ty
[2:28:30] AleXanDreMau: @Giantwaffle if you delete the file to regen the end maybe hil be so heavy the save file

[2:30:44] MarquesCoding: @CiVR but this time, I'm betting 30 of waffle's diamonds
[2:30:49] WDForty: i guess if you modded the dragon to drop elytras it solves the problem with limited elytras that resetting the end solves
[2:30:59] Sirgevz: KEKW
[2:31:06] Scabbers: you can just elytra to get new end for plugin yes

[2:32:29] WDForty: @Dizz1227 idk if they made changes to the latest version but in 1.16 end cities would get VERY rare after some distance cause there's a min distance between them to spawn

[5:41:31] the_portuguez: @qoob thats why on the last years several countries went to the moon. the goal is to see if that is enough to make it profitable.
[5:41:32] Jay_Bajaj: decomposition ?
[5:41:33] stormblaz: all of walmart plastic bags combines
[5:41:35] TheKnopex: bring it close to earth and mine there
[5:41:36] Sosa__ttv: Shoot it
[5:41:41] stormblaz: yea
[5:41:45] TitfAKka: colloidal gold
[5:41:45] Vestitude: @Kaomie do we become human? PepoThink
[5:41:45] Yaspa1: @Sosa__tv this is the way
[5:41:49] orillion: MONKERS bore a hole inside set up inside and spin it
[5:41:51] DrWolframm: liquefaction?
[5:41:56] Armathur: you can grind it down
[5:41:58] iivu1canii: we talking mined gold IRL ?
[5:42:08] BBQ1: bruce willis says otherwise
[5:42:08] Kaomie: Leaching it's called
[5:42:09] MDSZilla: Melt it using redirected Sun Light, suck it up with a tube
[5:42:12] Crossed_legion: or crash the meteor into a planet
[5:42:21] Ourdaddysaid: why not strap alot of rockets on a astroid and have it crash land in a safe place
[5:42:24] Reloadinko: you can blast it and use electromagnet to collect
[5:42:24] BiJay0: slow it down?
[5:42:25] Kaomie: You dissolve it with Aqua Regia then precipiate it
[5:42:27] iivu1canii: asteroid mining sounds pretty poggers
[5:42:34] Yaspa1: just fly it home and mine it here Kappa
[5:42:35] DX_Plates: Snake Bots with Lasors on their heads

[5:42:48] Sosa__ttv: With enough explosives blow it and vacuum it
[5:42:51] Phatmos: Build a big enough spaceship which can process it as a whole.
[5:42:52] Kaomie: Imagine the acid rocket explodes though
[5:42:58] pastafarian2: I read that transporting it to earth (in orbit?) so we can slowly harvest it would be feasible
[5:43:09] Slasher0915: vacuum in space?
[5:43:20] DX_Plates: @Sosa__tv Its space... it you blow it up it'll fly away forever.
[5:43:25] iceaganctor: if that got released on earth....

[5:43:44] NarwhalArgy: Just invent mining lasers like EVE, easy
[5:43:45] TheWonderLlama: Space magic
[5:43:45] Ourdaddysaid: wait would it be possible to surround an asteroid with like gas rockets to control its trajectory & velocity?
[5:43:45] stormblaz: like a giant net
[5:43:50] Slasher0915: 3D print it
[5:43:50] CaptainAlkohol: you dont

[5:44:06] itsIffy: a giant straw from earth to the rock to let it slurp
[5:44:07] iivu1canii: this is like project ozone 3 all over again talking about asteroid mining LUL
[5:44:09] CookieSnooper: guess ISS will get new module soon LUL
[5:44:12] thenotoriouswest: Cobblestone duuh
[5:44:15] Reloadinko: you can have like chamical solution that melts it
[5:44:16] stormblaz: can u make fire in space though?
[5:44:17] hydrogor: i know someone who can do it
[5:44:32] F6MaxDamage: how about a big capsul that capture it and close it air tight itrodusing atmosphere slowely to it before we start mining in
[5:44:32] MDSZilla: WAIT IDEA, use nikola itesla earthquake generator, convert the asterod into dust, use magnets to attract dust
[5:44:33] tj2121: it's really complicated it seems
[5:44:33] Sosa__ttv: Yo domino's is open, I might order I'm sp drunk and  hungry lol
[5:44:41] danchappers: Merry Christmas all
[5:44:42] WWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWAX: Sounds like a problem for the space force to solve xD
[5:44:46] CaptainAlkohol: the issue with dissolving it is that you have to transport millions of tons of solvent into space too @Giantwaffle
[5:44:52] kylekersh: give a good tip
[5:44:52] iivu1canii: I wonder if there would be a way to slow down the velocity like attach a rocket to the astroid but the rocket would be to heavy to get it to 0 right ?
[5:44:54] F6MaxDamage: what can be reusable then a plastick bag
[5:44:59] Kaomie: Kinda too late here
[5:45:00] MDSZilla: Use nikola itesla earthquake generator, convert the asterod into dust, use magnets to attract dust
[5:45:04] mahajimbo: those workers hate working on holiday you gonna get a hook up
[5:45:04] stormblaz: how to transport liquid easily?

[5:45:15] Aldiron: I dropped an entire 28oz can of tomato sauce on my floor earlier. I contemplated just giving up on the day and ordering food.
[5:45:15] bugsplatter23: unless you can harvest the solvent from the atmosphere of venus or something
[5:45:17] NarwhalArgy: @Giantwaffle You just use a like a mining barage
[5:45:18] Seldricc: I just DID order from DOMINO'S one minute ago :D
[5:45:19] Ourdaddysaid: crash the asteroid
[5:45:22] script_terror: isn't this what elon is banking on
[5:45:27] Armathur: @MDSZilla  what about non magnetic metals ?
[5:45:27] Ayah29: Wouldn't you kinda need to fix wars and terrorism? I imagine they would be pretty susceptible to attack.
[5:45:28] Slasher0915: you build a base on top of the asteroid
[5:45:34] Reloadinko: make the asteroid fall on earth, and elon musk will catch it with his hands
[5:45:34] CookieSnooper: no it's not
[5:45:35] 619srt: its not
[5:45:36] thenotoriouswest: Christmas fucked me raw financially this year

[5:45:49] JoshuaACasey: i'm sure the jewish people probably work on Christmas since they don't celebrate this holiday
[5:45:53] Kaomie: Here they get a CHrismast bonus too
[5:45:54] EpicJune: not everyone celebrates Christmas
[5:45:56] Naxorian: lol Noppers
[5:45:57] MDSZilla: @Armathur Air Pressure Suction?
[5:45:57] svulpture: @Giantwaffle  what do you think about how The expanse explores asteroid mininig ?
[5:45:58] daemonaedryn: If you dont celebrate christmas, why not?
[5:45:59] KadMan04: @Giantwaffle my work is open 7 days a week its never closed it cant be due to what we do
[5:46:05] stormblaz: @giantwaffle you working so...
[5:46:07] MDSZilla: Waffle use nikola itesla earthquake generator, convert the asterod into dust, use magnets to attract dust what do you think?
[5:46:12] wait_what_why: 1.5x on chrismas? not even 2x?
[5:46:13] WillowTom: In my country u dont get extra pay if you work holidays

[5:46:39] wait_what_why: i mean ya
[5:46:40] Armathur: @MDSZilla  we are talking kilometers large asteroids u cant surround them also the dust will start going everywhere
[5:46:42] Ceaoz: I WANT PRESENTS!
[5:46:43] Nikon662: if i'd worked christmas it would have been 3x as well

[5:47:00] Driitzz: i caught a trout and salmon , trout tastes so good YEP
[5:47:01] Zamzag: You would need a hell of a lot of space stations to help with resource distribution which will probably help with distribution and reach to mine asteroids but also increase speed at which resources can be delivered and returned to and from an asteroid
[5:47:03] stormblaz: ive had shark before
[5:47:06] stitics: @stormblaz Waffle makes his own schedule
[5:47:06] pQylling: salmon trout
[5:47:07] R3b3l_jme: Boxing Day my company pay 2.5x in uk I’m a bus driver
[5:47:08] stormblaz: baby shark
[5:47:10] prrratt_: i get triple time for all holidays and 12hr when i don’t work them
[5:47:15] MDSZilla: @Armathur Concentrated Earthquakes wont make them go everywhere, having a magnet nearby should stop that.
[5:47:26] wait_what_why: i worked on Canada Day and it was 2x + 8hr pay so 3x
[5:47:32] stormblaz: @giantwaffle moon can serve as a prototype model
[5:47:37] Armathur: @MDSZilla again there are many non magnetic materials we want :)
[5:47:41] prrratt_: @zamzag calm down
[5:47:45] Rottastic: @afrabuck Comp day is actually a good solution to the working on Christmas problem
[5:47:47] jessahh: @Giantwaffle I was escorting my sun to the moon in noita and it disappeared :(
[5:47:57] Zamzag: @prrratt_ XD

[5:49:01] BBQ1: its static-y small shards
[5:49:05] stormblaz: oh yes like volcano rock
[5:49:08] Armathur: @MDSZilla how do u do suction in space u got nothing to create the suction with its vacuum
[5:49:18] ronindreamer: It's not cheese ?

[5:49:35] MDSZilla: @Armathur What happens to the air inside a spaceship when you open the pressure chamber?
[5:49:36] svulpture: @Giantwaffle  do you think we will have a permanent moon base in your lifetime ?
[5:49:36] Valhuun: its like sand blasting
[5:49:37] Ayah29: We  need to get a vacuum up there
[5:49:39] stormblaz: oh dam... dust proofing?
[5:49:43] orillion: land in holes MONKERS
[5:49:44] edenr4: what level you strip mining at?
[5:49:52] Crossed_legion: glue?
[5:50:00] MDSZilla: @Armathur You just point a pipe in the opposite direction of where you want to suction to and let the dust come in xD
[5:50:02] Armathur: @MDSZilla they depresurize the exit chamber and suck it in the shit first
[5:50:08] WillowTom: Just land on a platform
[5:50:08] Kaomie: AH! Called it
[5:50:10] kenshin2666: sproomba

[5:51:46] mechoriet: PeepoMas we need reinforcements on the right side chat
[5:51:48] Mikto1000: @homeboy_walrus No, the moon weighs 7*10^22 and all man made structures weigh 1.1*10^12 according to google. So even if we mined 10x all human made structures then moon would not even lose 0.0001% of its mass
[5:51:50] 1lookey: is the subserver up while waffle is offline?

[5:55:04] Deathu: to be fair it only had like 1 massive mod and everyone did everything in it in a week @Giantwaffle
[5:55:06] aker_svk: but where isnt frozen water ? even comets are literally flozen water :D
[5:55:11] Acoucci: is there still a lot of people that play on this
[5:55:11] BigGuyCole: Hypothetically you quit streaming tomorrow, would the server stay up?
[5:55:13] Hoggormen: what about a skyblock server with a central hub
[5:55:15] PoloChubb: the last 20s were eventful, the 30s a buildup to absolute chaos in the 40s to rebuilding and restructuring in the 50s and beyond, lets hipe we get a better timeline this century
[5:55:17] NarwhalArgy: @Giantwaffle It's fine though because most of the metal on the Moon can be broken down to provide o2
