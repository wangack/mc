[0:26:55] Greninja: the chill thing probs not
[0:26:57] anactualrobot: did they tell Shane to chill
[0:27:01] inara___: assuming theyre young and dumb is the easy thing
[0:27:15] KageSilver: Sometimes people are just insecure or immature and feel better to shoot others down
[0:27:20] Desparoto: well i have been told to chill by people who start shit. and im a guy. they say it because they didn't expect you to actually defend yourself imo
[0:27:21] KageSilver: Which is in no way excusable
[0:27:39] MadokVaur: Misogyny is rampant in Twitch gaming streaming.

[0:28:33] NeveeSnow: i think they could say it either way but telling something like that to a women is probably more common
[0:28:38] Greninja: some communities just have younger audiences tho
[0:28:43] Greninja: and also not used to any arguments / toxicity
[0:28:47] Greninja: so its hard to tell
[0:28:47] pickle_spears: i’m just chilling in cedar rapids
[0:28:53] KageSilver: It just feels so wrong or icky to even think that people think it's ok to treat another human like that
[0:28:54] anactualrobot: it is multipe-times more likely to be said to someone female identifying
[0:28:55] inara___: pickle wtf
[0:28:56] ben999989999: how are we all doing today chat
