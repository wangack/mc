[0:44:21] Macka39: I think we just need to stop trying to compare games to WOW.  Then we m ight be happy with other mmos haha
[0:44:36] Hirukai: Will you be playing the Granblue Fantasy?
[0:44:50] thebloodx94: @Macka39 yeah issue is if wow introduced you to MMos it's always the yardstick lol
[0:44:58] aarseths: Got really annoyed when a friend of mine had much better gear but we had attempted crafing equal times almost
[0:45:00] Macka39: New World is pretty cool.  Just not a massive amount of end content after a bit
[0:45:04] Hirukai: @Macka39 Yeah! Wow was great beacause it was its own thing, theres so many cool games we can enjoy if we do not compare
[0:45:07] aarseths: waay too rng
[0:45:27] aarseths: Lost ark
[0:45:40] Macka39: you can craft BIS 700 gear in NW now.
[0:46:08] Macka39: ahhh lost ark is P2W too lol
[0:46:30] aarseths: failing with a weeks worth of farming then the shop lights up where i pay 10€ to skip a week is so bs. Ya new world was fun, i was too late to the hype though
[0:47:37] aarseths: Ya at the time i was struggling to find dungeons etc.
[0:47:50] OloCdn: hard to want to sit in an 8 hour queue for an mmo tho kinda like when New World released.
[0:48:40] aarseths: Didnt like that we couldnt lvl or get better farming gear without lvling up from cb.
[0:48:44] frankflint: They obviously  don't  know who you are  with such  a feeble  fence

[0:51:36] Therabitier: loving this game so far on our play through, only thing I’ve found to make it a tiny bit better is the Skyrim soundtrack playing low in the background
