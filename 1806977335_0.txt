[0:20:29] Dsungaripterus: Could be considered weird and wonderful
[0:20:30] RufusTheHairyCatWrangler: Headlander is alright. It's a bit mechanically simple and the story is pretty bland. The theming is good though

[0:22:49] nukesniper: Like, if I say "I'll order some pizza" and the pizza has pineapple on it (an no other options are ordered), then I am a criminal.
[0:22:56] RufusTheHairyCatWrangler: Pineapple on pizza is a crime against pizza
[0:22:58] TemperedPalico: heyy coffee
[0:23:01] rhys_uwu_: my mom had cordon Bleu pizza once when I was young
[0:23:02] aaaayyylmaoo: even though tomato is also a fruit pineapple is just not natural for me
[0:23:13] rhys_uwu_: seemed to enjoy it

[0:23:26] nukesniper: @rhys_uwu_ I'm sold. I'd go on that adventure
[0:23:53] rhys_uwu_: it was from a tiny mom and pop pizza place in Connecticut too
[0:23:59] nukesniper: I personally make a garlic sauce, chicken, onion and Lingonberry Jam pizza and it is so good. But it is a weird pizza.

[0:25:44] aaaayyylmaoo: Peas on pizza?

[0:27:06] RufusTheHairyCatWrangler: best place for peas is fried rice
[0:27:33] BlueKnight866: hmm... i guess someone did, but has anyone tried lemon juice on pizza for the same acidic/fat reason as pineapple?
