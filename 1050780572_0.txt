[0:28:07] NightPaws1: monkaS El Salvador
[0:28:09] hoffs: Yeah, but for a shitty country its much easier to do such things because its easy way to attract people and money. It's purely a selfish move
[0:28:09] Asthrun: a new Malta :O
[0:28:12] tigercall: First tax haven for cryptos then
[0:28:13] Nexhunter: fuck the caymans and fuck the evaders sykREE

[0:28:45] NordESA: @Kuroiorb @mechoriet peepoHug
[0:28:53] tigercall: In retrospective to the rest of the world though
[0:28:59] Nexhunter: yes and Delaware can fuck off

[0:29:26] drock223: Grand Cayman as well
[0:29:27] merscever: republicans KEKW
[0:29:27] M1k3D3l7a: YEP Malta as well
[0:29:27] dasmako: theres even that 1 state where everyone registers their expensive cars but dont live there cause like no title tax
[0:29:29] MadkingMatt: our whole country was built off tax evasion
[0:29:30] JacobSolo: Yeah its a Delware, there's 1 address with like 1000s of companies registered there
[0:29:37] Romppaine: malta has all the online casinos in eu KEKW
[0:29:38] bloopsterr: all f1 drivers live in monaco for no income tax

[0:29:44] ForgottenTime: The isle of man
[0:29:45] Nexhunter: mehdiREE yes and fuck that ish
[0:29:46] bread_child: Yeah but it shouldn’t be that way anywhere lol
[0:29:49] hoffs: @Giantwaffle Yeah, but then if youre using that argument, then theres no precedent in that. Few shitty countries will have such laws for crypto and no other countries will adopt them.
[0:29:54] jojardo: companies will always minmax
[0:29:56] MadkingMatt: thats how the us got started
[0:29:57] ZyianDev: good morning?

[0:30:34] hoffs: Countries already ignore a lot of wealth tax options
[0:30:36] Fooker: But crypto is a sham Kappa
[0:30:40] sogerr: people shitting on el salvador forget that tax heavens used to be shitty countries before becoming heavens because of all the money flooding in
[0:30:56] MadkingMatt: old money and blood money people i think hate crypto because it is newish money but i dont see crypto going anywhere
[0:30:59] ForgottenTime: @fooker They just buy a office and BOOM they never use it
[0:31:06] rpo_Mave: @Fooker Yea, Trump knows it. KEKW
[0:31:11] tomperino: On another note, what phone do you have waffle?
[0:31:13] zoth_: At least we kinda try to hide it, right?
[0:31:20] tigercall: They’ll push the ‘negative environmental impact’ agenda on Bitcoin adoption
[0:31:20] mechoriet: netherlands seems also like a good tax place for some reason
[0:31:21] TubbyWubbles: It's pretty standard, principle of path of least resistance. Companies want to make money, investors want to make money. fewer taxes / regulations = less resistance. At an individual level, why wouldn't you try to maximize profit potential.
[0:31:24] Myekos: got to love how Panama as a tax haven turned out
[0:31:28] nick43087: Wonder what we do in Puerto Rico.  Kappa
[0:31:30] Grumbagz: too be fair with the new 15% minimum corporate tax, tax havens are going to be way less effective
[0:31:31] Nexhunter: they are still shitty countries @sogerr tax havens only look nice cause of the rich using that shit but the people still suffer ltraveWeird
[0:31:50] Kuroiorb: people register their cars in Montana for that reason too
[0:31:52] Asthrun: it's funny to have a legal address at a law firm :D
[0:31:55] MadkingMatt: LUL only 42 mins

[0:34:37] Darkwolf9089: @jadedonyx19 eh battfield 1 killed at launched died because they didn't have a good dlc release plan and basically took 6 months for anything new. BF5 was a disaster from the reveal and just changed things in game that didn't need to be changed
[0:34:40] Nexhunter: I just need BF2
[0:34:41] Daanaas: 25 oktober 2011 bf 3

[0:34:56] zoth_: You could put frag rounds in the siaga and it was awesome
[0:35:01] Nexhunter: BF1 flight mechanics sucked

[0:35:33] Biceus: shitty guns and no attachments
[0:35:33] bread_child: I thought the game did really well no?
[0:35:34] JacobSolo: agreed 100%
[0:35:35] dasmako: i didnt like the way you had to unlock stuff and how they changed the classes
[0:35:36] sum_summ: i hate that the guns didnt have recoil patterns
[0:35:36] SmoothBlizzard: i want to fly
[0:35:36] Warpedclown: I dont think so. BF1 was really fun, they just insanely botched the DLC launches...I believe the first DLC was like 6 months after launch
[0:35:37] LtCol_Carter: Futuristic stuff is boring
[0:35:39] Nexhunter: @philipkatis the team balancing was crap
[0:35:39] Freezeeyyy: i need a another BF4, that was the best one for me
[0:35:40] BobPatience: I wouldnt mind a cowboy-era shoter
[0:35:40] JadedOnyx19: @Darkwolf9089 BF1 was ight BFv was better for me but it was more old and i was done with it

[0:36:01] Darkwolf9089: @warpedclown it was insane.
[0:36:01] Zwazi: I was listening to some guys conversation at Ihop the other day, and they were saying the same thing
[0:36:02] decent_courage: so WW3 now?
[0:36:02] Nexhunter: BF1 had the "titan" in the air ships and trains and the balancing was problematic for it
[0:36:04] Freezeeyyy: BF4 was the best in my opinon
[0:36:04] bread_child: This new game is the sweet spot imo
[0:36:05] CorSPACE: battlefield 1 is still really popular

[2:45:54] Damage35381: im to young KEKW

[2:47:07] iGodEmperor: not going to school to play BF2 and farm ranks KEKW
[2:47:08] Jenscicle: @OhWhale Only because the games haven't been good.
[2:47:09] kiffar: @OhWhale BFV destroyed the player base. If 2042 doesn't launch well, the franchise is dead
[2:47:10] hoffs: content drip
[2:47:12] red13devil: EFT game mode?
[2:47:12] MrPooter: Nah, they'll def add it later on

[2:47:57] N4RCO5: Please no F2P, only hackers with it
[2:48:02] Asthrun: ewok hunt was so dead because it was hidden in 3 extra menu's  :(
[2:48:06] kiffar: @hoffs BFV was terrible at launch. They did a lot to improve it but they couldn't save it in the end and ditched development. 2042 has to save the franchise

[2:48:25] MrMoneybagMan: @TimTheEnchanter15 no
[2:48:27] Jenscicle: My struggle with BF games is I don't like using vehicles and it's really rough dying to tanks and planes 6/8 deaths in a match you know?
[2:48:31] Flobu_: br in vr?
[2:48:33] hoffs: @kiffar I played BF5 at launch a lot. I dont remember anything about it being terrible, actually opposite. It was very fun
[2:48:34] MoffFrosty: Only reason BRs are popular is because all the major streamers go so hard on them.
[2:48:45] bubble_d: idk Scav raids are pretty close to BRs sometimes
[2:48:45] TakeMe2Kamenka: the pacing was so much better in BFBC2 days, not the twitch shooting/quick scoping meat grinder nonsense the later ones turned into
[2:48:45] OverclockedPC: tarkov is also almost like a survival
[2:48:53] JadedOnyx19: @FrostyLionEh thats not true at all lol
[2:48:53] Mandorake: I am still waiting for a Tarkov clone from a bigger studio

[3:01:18] SnackableGames: 16+10
[3:01:20] The_Outis: well unless you won & went back but go up 1 & lose
[3:01:22] Mandorake: @giantwaffle are you counting a push as a win?
[3:01:26] Stragmol: yes losses are a factorial, in your logic, winning is not
[3:01:28] Mungosin: Pass a bankroll as variable and just do bankroll = bankroll - bet_value + win_in_round
[3:01:59] Chronoes: @Mungosin changing function args will not change the value outside of the function
[3:01:59] The_Outis: ya bankroll would be nice to see
[3:02:06] Oinkylicious: 1000
[3:02:07] DaGMC: bank_roll
[3:02:11] Slowkill333: Don't you need to decrease your total when you lose?
[3:02:30] Chronoes: no, you always use snake_case besides classes
[3:02:37] ruccoa: snake_case camelCase
[3:02:39] The_Outis: lowerCamel :)
[3:02:47] stinkhat: i use camel_Snake_Case
[3:03:00] Stillglade: kebab-case makes me hungry
[3:03:01] DaGMC: KamelKäse Kappa
[3:03:05] ruccoa: @stinkhat sorry
[3:03:16] akaCube: you use whatever you project requires or is set up to do :)
[3:03:24] MrLorenthal: @Giantwaffle how long from now is the battlefield reveal?
[3:03:26] Mandorake: @giantwaffle don't forget to tip your dealer
[3:03:31] booth8604: Bankroll needs to be equal to or over
[3:03:38] Ghost0447: MrLorenthal its already done
[3:03:45] Chronoes: changing function argument isn't going to change the global value
[3:04:26] The_Outis: he isn't trying to change the global
[3:04:54] Superguy2876: @Chronoes he doesn't want to change global value, thats just initial params
[3:05:00] Bloodstein: it's + round win not total win
[3:05:04] DaGMC: you should stick to one form of casing
[3:05:09] Chronoes: nah, this isn't going to work
[3:05:12] DaGMC: e.g. bankRoll and bank_roll
[3:05:16] Allmostdone: what about the table limit?
[3:05:24] Nerudeus: you need to adjust bet in the loop
[3:05:28] usernameNull: you need a round win
[3:05:31] Mungosin: That logic is not correct by using bankRoll you will reset it at start  do bank_roll = bank_roll - bet + total_win
[3:05:35] Slowkill333: you need a win amount for each round that is added/subtracted to the total
[3:05:54] Superguy2876: yes you need that
[3:06:16] AtchTwoOh: and not +=, just = for the total_win
[3:06:19] Tabakhase: technically your first total_win = 0 just need to be lower in the code YEP
[3:06:34] Mungosin: That logic is not correct by using bankRoll you will reset it every loop do bank_roll = bank_roll - bet + total_win
[3:06:49] The_Outis: ^
[3:06:49] sogerr: ^
[3:06:53] Nerudeus: you have to adjust bet in the loop
[3:06:54] Tabakhase: bet also lags now
[3:06:54] dystav: Should you use the global bankRoll inside the definitions?
[3:06:57] Chronoes: you will only get the result of the last iteration for bank_roll
[3:07:10] Superguy2876: ^
[3:07:18] rabazi91: your global variable has a different name bankRoll and bank_roll
[3:07:21] Mungosin: That logic is not correct by using bankRoll you will reset it every loop do bank_roll = bank_roll - bet + total_win
[3:07:24] luminousAJ: Hi waffler
[3:07:35] optimalpotato: wait but why arent you going negative with total win?
[3:07:45] Mungosin: bottom one as well
[3:07:50] The_Outis: same in algo2
[3:07:53] Nerudeus: you did not ajust bet as well
[3:08:14] maca134: line 39
[3:08:17] Nerudeus: bet is alwaysway 10
[3:08:20] petaloudoskatoulaki: i need a waffle chat for when im trying to write code
[3:08:30] AtchTwoOh: @Giantwaffle you don't need to add your winnings to total win, reset your win each round
[3:08:30] Moobot: You can find Waffle's Youtube channel here - https://youtube.com/giantwaffle
[3:08:38] The_Outis: bet needs to be set at the start of the loop
[3:08:52] SnackableGames: Its spitting out bank roll not winnings
[3:08:57] Nerudeus: bet is qrong
[3:09:08] Mungosin: what @The_Outis  said, you are not adjusting bet in the loop
[3:09:24] CantTouchDisNow: you add totalwinn in the loop every time
[3:09:24] koalalava: and 50
[3:09:37] The_Outis: so many things haha
[3:09:41] Uther_The_Lightbringer: isnt argument bankRoll in results wrong
[3:09:43] Mungosin: just do bet=unit*mod at start
[3:09:50] Mungosin: in loop
[3:09:51] Larklen: KEKW
[3:09:56] vihmi: LUL
[3:09:57] Invalidm_: oh god
[3:10:01] The_Outis: lmao
[3:10:06] Joshuapetch: M monkaGun
[3:10:08] Joshuapetch: talk to me
[3:10:11] SnackableGames: 10x flat bet
[3:10:21] usernameNull: you cracked the code, go get super rich in vegas
[3:10:26] ZackaWeeee: what time is the reveal
[3:10:34] complexprotein: All I do is win win win
[3:10:38] Allmostdone: so there are no bet limits on Blackjack?
[3:10:39] SnackableGames: @ZackaWeeee already happened
[3:10:41] chochi314: You are adding "total_win" in each iteration - this seems not correct
[3:10:49] Chronoes: can do it, but PEP 8 will scream
[3:10:52] RN49: What is waffle doing?
[3:10:54] Nerudeus: totalwin is to high
[3:11:08] Tabakhase: += widePepeLaugh
[3:11:08] Mungosin: @chochi314  means you need to adjust total_win += part to be just =
[3:11:11] BleedKappa: A good while ago, @ZackaWeeee
[3:11:17] Bloodstein: it's the += on the win that is compounding
[3:11:22] Nerudeus: lien 16 += should be =
[3:11:23] ChilledNightmare: could just go through one iteration with some print statements and see what it's doing
[3:11:23] The_Outis: why the +=
[3:11:26] Mungosin: win = bet * 2 not win+= bet * 2
[3:11:26] winnerab: win = bet*2, not += @Giantwaffle
[3:11:46] Ghost0447: KEKW
[3:11:52] bedbuggies: hmmm seems right
[3:11:53] The_Outis: yay
[3:11:59] Nerudeus: tha lokks right ;)
[3:12:00] snorrow92: losing = more realistic yes
[3:12:22] SnackableGames: see the results with progressively increasing bankrolls
[3:12:34] Tabakhase: now fix all those bugs in algo2 too KEKW
[3:12:42] petaloudoskatoulaki: depends on unit/bankroll ratio
[3:12:52] Allmostdone: make it so you can input the amount of the bankroll
[3:13:04] SnackableGames: run each bank roll value 100 times and plot the mean winnings for a range of bankroll values
[3:13:05] rabazi91: you still have += in flat bet
[3:13:08] sogerr: algo2 still has the wrong code though
[3:13:23] The_Outis: yes
[3:13:23] Tabakhase: bet adjust also missing
[3:13:27] Chronoes: the bank_roll is not in loop
[3:13:44] commonsweat: Bro I’m literally $22 bucks away from getting my first pc 😩
[3:13:44] chochi314: In second alog, you are not updating in loop - you are updating only once after lop
[3:13:46] Jag_racer: waffleSmart
[3:13:50] SnackableGames: Why aren't you using a jupyter notebook?
[3:13:54] Mungosin: it needs to be in the loop
[3:13:57] DaGMC: bet is calculated outside of the loop in algo2 , is that correct?
[3:14:04] The_Outis: oh god that's a thing I don't miss about python. Tab based scopes
[3:14:10] Tabakhase: its not inside the loop, see 1 tab vs 2
[3:14:12] AtchTwoOh: give it a tab my dude
[3:14:12] Mungosin: you need to tab it once more
[3:14:13] Nerudeus: looks good
[3:14:16] Jag_racer: python looks so much better than js
[3:14:18] FingerGames: i play perfect blackjack only after three drinks tho KEKW
[3:14:19] sogerr: missing identation for bank_roll
[3:14:26] SnackableGames: tab
[3:14:27] winnerab: indentation, it's not in the loop
[3:14:29] Mungosin: you are missing an indentation it is only evaluated once
[3:14:32] dylan0806: it needs to be in the forloop
[3:14:41] SnackableGames: @Jag_racer thats becausxe it is
[3:14:41] Nerudeus: you do bankroll only one in algo2
[3:14:41] Mungosin: hit it with a tab
[3:14:42] BitterPL: its not idented so it isn't
[3:14:49] Mungosin: line 40 just tab it once
[3:14:51] Chronoes: it's outside of loop, indendation is important
[3:14:55] Larklen: KEKW
[3:15:01] Tabakhase: and bet adjust is missing
[3:15:01] Nerudeus: line 40!
[3:15:03] dylan0806: bank_roll is only triggered once
[3:15:24] Mungosin: that is not in the loop as well
[3:15:35] AtchTwoOh: will you return the number of roll's you had before you are bankrupt?
[3:15:39] dylan0806: needs to be in the for loop as well
[3:15:39] Nerudeus: thats better :)
[3:16:16] Tabakhase: ignore that... or "pregenerate a game" as extra step...
[3:16:18] MasterKraft: the "rounds" could be  a list of outcomes you process
[3:16:20] SnackableGames: create a random list and then read from list
[3:16:21] Chronoes: you'll need to pre-generate the rolls
[3:16:23] ba_nanananananana: just use async Kappa
[3:16:28] DaGMC: you should use random.seed for repetition
[3:16:30] Cronos_100: roll x amount of times then loop through the algos with that list
[3:16:30] Moobot: Come join the Waffle House discord https://discord.gg/G5FeeveP3c and chat with the community! Remember to link your Twitch account in the Settings (gear) > Connections for subscriber channels.
[3:16:34] dylan0806: make an array with random numbers and use that
[3:16:40] FingerGames: yup
[3:16:55] Mungosin: @Giantwaffle  do random.seed(seed) at start of each algorithm and add a variable to the function called seed  That way they will have same distributions
[3:17:15] The_Outis: or just pre-generate the rolls & pass that as an input to both
[3:17:22] rentable_smile: are you sure nagetive is spelled that way waffle in your negative progression? :p @Giantwaffle
[3:17:38] winnerab: use sysargs to give a bankroll or hands variable, with a default of 300 and 90
[3:17:40] SnackableGames: can you run it a bunch and plot the averages
[3:17:45] Mungosin: do   SEED = random.randint() print(SEED)  first value in functions do this to set the distributions random.seed(SEED)
[3:17:49] Appz: Pit boss kicks you out in that case
[3:18:07] bedbuggies: KEKW its Negative
[3:18:14] CoolReal: Found a diamond vein after 2 hours of digging PogChamp
[3:18:30] LokiRulez: what are we making?
[3:18:33] akaCube: const is a js thing i believe
[3:18:47] MrEgregious: Also in C#
[3:18:52] GenerlKat: ^
[3:19:04] Mungosin: nono, keep that
[3:19:04] Larklen: Also a Keanu Reeves thing :)
[3:19:12] GenerlKat: I think const is a C thing
[3:19:13] Mungosin: do below win do random.seed(seed)
[3:19:21] Superguy2876: you need to set the seed before the loop
[3:19:24] Mungosin: just at start of the function not in the loop
[3:19:26] akaCube: you only need to seed once
[3:19:27] decent_courage: coding looks like organized gibberish to me
[3:19:30] Nerudeus: you don't have to pass those globals ;)
[3:19:35] DaGMC: just call random.seed(seed) before the for loop
[3:19:43] Mungosin: set seed at beginning of function where your mod is don't set it every loop iteration
[3:19:48] CantTouchDisNow: dont set a seed inside of the loop
[3:19:49] MasterKraft: seeing in the loop?  i thnk produces same value every iteration
[3:19:54] winnerab: if you realy want a const, you can make a var with only a getter and no setter, but that's overkill
[3:20:03] Mungosin: random.seed(seed) that needs to be outside of loop
[3:20:05] Superguy2876: you are, the random.seed is setting it
[3:20:11] Feist_: what you making?
[3:20:24] natsu130: big seed?
[3:20:25] Mungosin: No, seed needs to be set in line 13 and line 34 inside functions
[3:20:27] Superguy2876: no in the funciton, above the loop
[3:20:27] Cronos_100: inside the function tho
[3:20:28] AtchTwoOh: but re-seed it inbetween the two algo's
[3:20:31] SnackableGames: Just print as a test
[3:20:32] kakiewakie_: SeemsGood
[3:20:44] CantTouchDisNow: no inside of the function but not in the loop
[3:20:56] SnackableGames: 0,1
[3:20:57] akaCube: re-seed before every function call to reproduce the same values @Giantwaffle
[3:20:58] Chronoes: it's a random int between 2 numbers
[3:21:01] Mungosin: just do random.randint(1,100000)
[3:21:05] Nerudeus: inside the fnution outside the loop for seed
[3:21:15] Superguy2876: yes
[3:21:19] Superguy2876: before teh loop
[3:21:24] Mungosin: 1 do random.randint(1,100000)   2. do random.seed(seed) inside function outside of loop
[3:21:25] SnackableGames: print rolls to see if it correct
[3:21:31] Superguy2876: you want a bigger seed
[3:21:37] winnerab: @Giantwaffle there aren't many int's between 0 and 1 PepoThink
[3:21:47] MasterKraft: nice 2 outcomes
[3:21:51] Superguy2876: you'll only get 2 possible lists of outcomes
[3:21:55] Chronoes: it sure does
[3:21:58] overserer: what is being calculated?
[3:22:00] Superguy2876: thats the problem, its the same
[3:22:21] MasterKraft: does python have a int.maxValue?
[3:22:22] Nerudeus: there are only two ints between 1 and 0
[3:22:34] akaCube: could also print the seed for reproduceability
[3:22:37] ShellingFord55: @Giantwaffle create 90 randoms as list and then iterate over them in your algos
[3:22:51] Mungosin: are you familiar with pandas and matplotlib libraries to do quick visualisations?
[3:23:11] Tabakhase: ya also printing bankroll as "win" - but those are ALL losses uh?
[3:23:32] chaosophy_: wouldn't it be better doing player1, player2 and then loop each hand?
[3:23:45] Superguy2876: for the maximum int in one word, you can do sys.maxsize * 2 + 1
[3:23:46] zPanda: hey can you check DMs real fast
[3:23:50] symaski62: battlefirld  2042   7 maps  confirmed
[3:23:51] Chronoes: you'll need to adjust the "mod" though. so either a global variable or a class for it
[3:23:52] Psytei: SPEED
[3:23:56] MasterKraft: thats another way, having 2 bankrolls based on algorithym
[3:24:08] Mandorake: get both definitions working and then write some tests and then refactor
[3:24:18] Nerudeus: so as a class/object for each of algos
[3:24:23] Renny_S: when are u making a day trading algo for us Kappa
[3:24:27] Allmostdone: So when will this be on Steam?
[3:24:57] zPanda: Pan
[3:24:57] Moobot: Support Waffle by using his Epic creator code: Giantwaffle
[3:25:12] SnackableGames: Also consider how long you can play before they kick you out for using a progressibve strat.
[3:25:33] Docgalaad: martingale and other methods dont work well nowadays with limits on each table
[3:26:01] Sander20011: now run is like 1000 times and calculate your chances of not zeroing out
[3:26:26] SnackableGames: matplotlib is Pog
[3:26:28] Mungosin: you should take a look at pandas as well to handle dataframes
[3:26:28] TheMixu: ive seen it :)
[3:26:33] hignz: yeah I used it in college
[3:26:35] Cyberwire69: should output how many hands before zeroing out too for extra info
[3:26:35] Ghost0447: can we get full coding stream? widepeepoHappy
[3:26:37] SnackableGames: its the standard for data visualizations
[3:26:47] Ralph504: they wont kick you for martingale because with limits, you will zero out often enough to make it a losing system
[3:26:51] Renny_S: used it in university for showing results in my machine learning class
[3:26:54] Hi2Chaco: before you  do that, learn to use a jupyter notebook
[3:26:55] cloudyfate: ewwww matlab
[3:27:04] cyberhalo: no minecraft today?
[3:27:07] Ycrems: has the bf6 reveal happened already
[3:27:08] Mungosin: I am working as a data scientist in python so take a look at pandas and jupyter notebooks as well for exploration and experimentation
[3:27:09] Roreo_: I jus started matlab in college this year. seems so messy
[3:27:20] ba_nanananananana: kinda, depends. There's lots of software and packages. Python is very very common, but Prism etc...
[3:27:31] Sander20011: multidimensional arrays
[3:27:33] sogerr: why not a dict to make it more readable?
[3:27:36] Roreo_: Wait I mean labview nvm
[3:27:41] Nerudeus: octave the free matlab :)
[3:27:42] SnackableGames: Python and R are basically the main 2 languages for Data Science
[3:27:43] Superguy2876: python is free, easy to pickup, and has huge support and community, it's not a mystery python is the choice
[3:28:07] sogerr: dict just to be more readable, key is the name of the algo
[3:28:21] zieiz: why Python over R? just curious
[3:28:26] subfin: it depends on how you use them
[3:28:33] Miestro: what's O(n)?
[3:28:34] ZyianDev: looking up a specifc value is O(1), iterating is O(n)
[3:28:36] HydraulicTater: O of n
[3:28:43] TheMixu: @ZyianAzen this
[3:28:43] Renny_S: i like python because I think its easier to transition to a different language like java later on
[3:28:47] ba_nanananananana: who uses R outside of research, zieiz
[3:28:50] Miestro: retrieval from a map or set is O(1)
[3:28:53] ZyianDev: Yes
[3:29:01] fridenmf: you should have a O(log n) if you can perform a binary search for the key
[3:29:06] Cyberwire69: output how many hands processed before zeroing out too for an idea of performance
[3:29:23] Mungosin: Take a look at pandas and jupyter notebooks for experimentation and quick plays with python  You can store it in dict in a format of { 'algoname' : [algo_results], 'algoname2' : [algo2_results] }  That way you can expand on the number of algorithms you test on by just appending to their dict[algo_name].append(round_result)
[3:29:49] ba_nanananananana: Mungosin jupyter is terrible for learning how to program DansGame
[3:29:56] tommyfod: what is the tldr for flat bet?
[3:30:05] SnackableGames: What about a regressive system
[3:30:07] tommyfod: gotcha
[3:30:16] PureAmbiguity: Jupyter is life
[3:30:16] tommyfod: yeah double on loss
[3:30:17] masztufa: expected return (or rather loss) is only proportional to your bet
[3:30:24] tommyfod: but bet limits stop that
[3:30:28] Cronos_100: table limits Sadge
[3:30:39] jteas: That only works if you have a unlimited amount of money
[3:30:51] Mungosin: @ba_nanananananana he is prototyping not productionising the code  If he is happy with the idea he can refactor code in a .py file and import in jupyter then continue working on functions in jupyter quicker and after they're stable refactor -> export in .py
[3:30:58] Miestro: what if you bet an increase based on the percent likelyhood of your previous hands loss?
[3:31:02] TheHotChili: Dont double, just add 10 to each bet
[3:31:05] tommyfod: surely tables have bet limits that prevent martingale
[3:31:20] ba_nanananananana: Mungosin he's writing a small script, what you suggest is just more work... so why LUL
[3:31:27] masztufa: not even table limits, you have 1/1024 to lose 1023 dollars, but 1023/1024 to win 1 with martingale
[3:31:33] Cyberwire69: this all assumes u have a table to urself too
[3:31:35] SnackableGames: What about a regressive bet system
[3:31:38] Miestro: if you lost a hand that was 67% chance of losing, you increase by 33%, etc
[3:31:43] whaaatuppp: Counting Cards is illegal tho
[3:31:46] tommyfod: @masztufa true that
[3:32:01] hignz: agree with the jupyter suggestion, especially if he starts using matplotlib
[3:32:18] jteas: @whaaatuppp its not illegal, just not allowed at casinos, if they catch you they just ask you to leave
[3:32:20] Allmostdone: don't they use like four decks at a time?
[3:32:23] xavier2119: @whaaatuppp sure isn't. using others to help you win is
[3:32:31] Mungosin: @ba_nanananananana he wants to refactor it by using template method and strategy patterns it would be easier to play around with that as a first timer in an interactive manner rather than clicking on command line
[3:32:41] xavier2119: at least in vegas anyways
[3:33:01] masztufa: you can't change the expected loss by using a "strategy", but you can change the distribution function of it (so you have no chance of losing a little bit, you either win a little or lose a lot, etc.)
[3:33:01] Moobot: You can sub to Waffle by clicking this neat link -> twitch.tv/giantwaffle/subscribe
[3:33:13] jteas: turn on dark mode
[3:33:20] whaaatuppp: @jteas @xavier2119  i get yall too but it does involve some sort of risk
[3:33:25] FalleNM3rC: thats soo bright holy
[3:33:36] Uther_The_Lightbringer: dark mode asap
[3:33:46] FalleNM3rC: Whaty????
[3:33:47] Renny_S: minepog
[3:33:50] FalleNM3rC: no way KEKW

[4:26:01] C0ldf1re: susHmm waffle leaks
[4:26:02] Denel55: is there a physical pc copy available?
[4:26:12] the_one_wasabi: waffle sus
[4:26:18] zoth_: @Denel55 You have a disc drive still?
[4:26:20] skech3rs: so there are no super mega caves yet?
[4:26:27] Allmostdone: or even if an event occurred at all

[4:27:21] aCookienot: my group of friends is imaginary...
[4:27:30] Kuroiorb: oh did you go through your drives over the weekend?
[4:27:38] CorSPACE: forge has to update first
[4:27:39] natsu130: new ore PogChamp
[4:27:43] ninopanda: @Giantwaffle you know how to get me when you are ready to build and run the server :)
[4:27:43] Bracaster: i have more confidence in some optical drives. i have a couple ssd that are like ticking time bombs.  made to die
[4:27:45] Deadfox74: We play on console sooo
[4:27:51] zoth_: @aCookienot I'll be your friend. Just pay me in monthly payments of $4.99
[4:27:55] Larklen: speaking of which, I had 3 drives randomly fail when i plugged them in, so need to figure out what caused it monkaHmm
[4:28:09] mechoriet: yeah cause fabric uses the mojang mapping
[4:28:15] Gberqz: fabric updates from the first snapshot up to release
[4:28:16] mechoriet: compared to forge mapping
[4:28:20] aCookienot: @zoth_ but i'm already paying my imaginary friends..
[4:28:40] C0ldf1re: COPIUM
[4:28:45] Sander20011: isn't forge basically a rewrite?
[4:28:56] C0ldf1re: COPIUM forge will come out soon guys
[4:28:58] zoth_: @aCookienot I'll bully the imaginary crap out of them and take their imaginary lunch money then.
[4:29:03] shyguy2624: what datapack(s) are you using?
[4:29:05] Allmostdone: Waffle are telling us that you don't use tape drives?
[4:29:10] aCookienot: @zoth_ lol
[4:29:12] Kuroiorb: !datapack
[4:29:12] Moobot: Waffle is using this 1.17 datapack for the caves and cliffs | https://bit.ly/3g3heux
[4:29:31] ChromaCym: Hey tape drives still have their place in the world
[4:29:32] Moobot: Support Waffle by using his Epic creator code: Giantwaffle
[4:29:35] Klorell: is the mojang mapping bad?
[4:29:36] zoth_: Crap I still have 8 tacks that need to be ported to digital
[4:29:46] Alem_Sinner_pt: wait are you telling me you don't use punch cards to program ?
[4:29:46] ChromaCym: Tape is still one of the best things for high-capacity DR backups
[4:29:50] mechoriet: there used for super cold backups
[4:29:57] Waitforitbro: wait you don't store all your porn on tape drives kinda weird bro
[4:29:58] firepher: omega high capacity
[4:30:01] ChromaCym: You can put a ton of data onto a tape and then easily take it off site
[4:30:10] Allmostdone: and capacity
[4:30:11] pixfix2k2: We used to send out tapes to third party vendor daily for DR backups
[4:30:17] 1lamkaz: tape drives are used for backups
[4:30:19] Freezeeyyy: have you ever thought about doing a pokemon nuzlocke?
[4:30:23] brsmith2358: I just ordered a $10k tape solution for a customer I have 😂
[4:30:26] zoth_: Get a tape drive and download all of Wikipedia onto it
[4:30:27] ShionSinX: you can also do that with an external drive KEKW @CJS7070
[4:30:34] natsu130: i alerady missing tmi BibleThump
[4:30:35] Deadfox74: Are both the create server and 1.18 server going to be java?
[4:30:35] ChromaCym: Yeah you can fit like 25+ TB on a tape and automate it all with a robot
[4:30:42] ChromaCym: @ShionSinX not quite to the same extent
[4:30:50] Sander20011: I hope its ductape XD
[4:30:52] CorSPACE: LTT did a video on tape storage
[4:30:53] DatoPotatoDato: rooDuck tape!
[4:30:59] brsmith2358: That’s the cheap ones
[4:30:59] skynetcloud: @Giantwaffle I have to rewrite my whole forge mod so it works on fabric as I like having my mod up to date big rip for me
[4:31:02] JAHrda: why does the floor need to be like that? cosmetic only?
[4:31:03] imShnaz: thats alot of sap
[4:31:03] zoth_: its magnetic so no
[4:31:03] Bracaster: porn on vhs.  good ole days
[4:31:10] Larklen: NOPERS
[4:31:16] Tauruntino: 10k is probably just an auto loader and some tapes, that tech is expensive
[4:31:26] zoth_: faraday cage can help tho
[4:31:28] Arisonius: So is Fabric the new forge or what?
[4:31:28] ChromaCym: oh yeah
[4:31:32] ChromaCym: Tape robots are not cheap
[4:31:33] Jedidude77: If a magnent can change it imagine if a cosmic wave hits it
[4:31:42] The1_TS: For some tap is the only solution. For example guarantee the geographic area the data is held in.
[4:31:43] RyanKile: using stone pick to mine up the floor and buries iron in the floor COPIUM
[4:31:46] ChromaCym: But when you need to have regular DR backups of huge amounts of data you really can't match tape
[4:31:55] PossibleScam: Rads kills most things.
[4:32:05] JAHrda: COPIUM
[4:32:05] zoth_: Cast lead caing for a tape drive kappa
[4:32:06] PossibleScam: Especially manmade electronics.
[4:32:13] JustPepeDontBeMad: Lead box, heavy as tits tho
[4:32:24] IchaTV: what Y level are u at
[4:32:34] Tauruntino: @cjs7070 yeah I’ve managed numerous systems
[4:32:34] Myekos: need 3x3 mining, those single blocks feel so sluggish
[4:32:34] Nexhunter: COPIUM EVGA expects their cargo to be unloaded this week for more 3080tis to process the queue COPIUM
[4:32:42] skech3rs: has the cave generation not changed?
[4:32:43] C0ldf1re: COPIUM
[4:32:53] mechoriet: @Nexhunter COPIUM
[4:32:54] ChromaCym: it's pretty impressive at least
[4:32:57] Deadfox74: Good old strip mining. Do you have a cobble chest setup? LUL
[4:32:59] Nexhunter: fucking cargo ship unloads are too slow sadKEK
[4:33:06] Nexhunter: I wasn't buying a 3080 anyways KEKW
[4:33:14] Nexhunter: so it better for me not paying for a full 3090 KEKW
[4:33:15] Arisonius: Why 4 high vs 3 high?
[4:33:18] 1lamkaz: Tape is very reliable, since it isn't easily wiped out by cosmic rays or charged particles. The main disadvantage is it requires moving parts which is hard in vacuum
[4:33:25] skech3rs: ill take what i can get
[4:33:33] Waitforitbro: 3080ti is not worth at all
[4:33:33] Myekos: if you can get a TI for retail, it's the street price of a 3080 anyway
[4:33:34] IchaTV: were those diamonds
[4:33:45] StarkTheShark: waffle you going to continue to grow out the beard?
[4:33:48] DatoPotatoDato: I feel like the 3070 has good value at "MSRP"
[4:33:51] Gberqz: upgrading from 3080 to 3080ti Kappa
[4:33:53] daemonaedryn: Its so crazy how much we did in space with such old technology
[4:33:56] shyguy2624: I scored a 3080Ti and bought it :( but im upgrading from a 760 lol
[4:33:58] Nexhunter: @Myekos some folks that spun the wheel and got 40% are paying 3080 MSRP for 3080tis anyways KEKW
[4:34:10] 1lamkaz: they used tape drives on satelites too, for data storage
[4:34:19] Nexhunter: I only get 8% off my 3080ti order though sadKEK
[4:34:27] Myekos: Nexhunter really?
[4:34:32] Arisonius: @DatoPotatoGames But is that value based on 10x vs 20x or is it based on 20x vs 30x?
[4:34:34] Nexhunter: yea EVGA elite program ftw @Myekos
[4:34:36] Vangelis716: I got 6900XT for  €1000. I'm happy with it
[4:34:37] Sceda: waffle and his damn stone picks
[4:34:45] Venamah: is the write speed to tape as fast as a hardrive ?
[4:34:46] Myekos: Nexhunter how you get elite?
[4:34:57] Waitforitbro: crypto PepeLaugh
[4:35:02] Nexhunter: @Myekos own EVGA products or 100 forum posts or so
[4:35:03] ZephMW: Soooo if I wanted to get into mining with my strix 3080 oc... worth?
[4:35:06] DatoPotatoDato: @Arisonius 10x to 30x in my eyes i completely disregarded the 20 series
[4:35:07] mechoriet: arent the new ones locked ?
[4:35:09] complexprotein: Got my 3070 FE for MSRP, Yay for BestBuy Drops!
[4:35:13] erer566: getting 100mh on my 3080
[4:35:14] rpo_Mave: Aren't tape drives still being used for archiving? I think I saw an LTT video about it a few years ago
[4:35:20] zoth_: Thought about selling my 2080 for 1000 but I'm scared I wouldnt be able to replace it
[4:35:20] Blazedasthesun: at this point im hoping my last 980ti survives until 4000 series
[4:35:22] AlenN: doing like 94 at 220W
[4:35:23] Myekos: Nexhunter damn, guess I should have registered all my previous evga's :)
[4:35:29] 1lamkaz: at this points the memory chips are surprisingly more vulnerable to cosmic radiation than the storage methods used
[4:35:31] shyguy2624: I paid $1284 for my 3080 Ti, insane price
[4:35:41] Nexhunter: @Myekos always should cause extended warranties are involved with the registrations KEKW
[4:35:59] Styxberry: @Blazedasthesun420 I'm running a 1070 in a laptop atm, I am very much hoping to do the same xD
[4:36:02] 13hunteo: Intel says 2 years until its sorted
[4:36:04] Nexhunter: unless they use a samsung node process not in use then probably are fucked
[4:36:07] subfin: congress passed a $250b package today to help solve this chip shortage
[4:36:25] Nexhunter: time still required
[4:36:37] Nexhunter: oh yea also Artemis money was in that 250b KEKW
[4:36:40] zoth_: Factories take time to build and R&D takes time to design
[4:36:46] Allmostdone: you cant just slap one up
[4:36:52] complexprotein: Nah I make mine in a bathtub in my basement
[4:36:53] Hyduss_: There is no short time solution to it
[4:36:55] Chronoes: that money will just be eaten up by bureaucracy
[4:36:59] C0ldf1re: who makes the chips to make the chip factory susHmm
[4:37:05] ShionSinX: @Allmostdone hold my beer AppaK
[4:37:10] DatoPotatoDato: @C0ldf1re duuuuude
[4:37:13] TarMonA: 2 years to build another 5 to get up and going
[4:37:19] mechoriet: ASML :)
[4:37:25] zoth_: Pay Tostitos to make better chips
[4:37:25] MSik84: ASML
[4:37:30] Nexhunter: ASML uses chips that are produced on older tech

[4:38:33] mrtraxx: first time subbing, been on twitch for 8years
[4:38:38] Ralph504: 2 years assuming the demand for crypo miners dont go up significantly
[4:38:55] lifesmusic_: A big part of the hold up will be govt restrictions on building and permits and the best thing that can be done is to lessen the restrictions in putting the buildings up, taxes, etc to get the places going quicker.
[4:39:24] 13hunteo: how long until most crypto move away from gpu mining

[4:41:21] TheGeekPeek: @Giantwaffle do you still mine eth with your gpu setup?
[4:41:23] Sceda: @ChillyFierce not really. the materials are cheap and we have enough. just the production machines and factories are missing
[4:41:28] Freezeeyyy: how do you feel about strip mining becoming obsolete when the full update comes out?

[4:43:14] Bouv_: what are you using to mine?
[4:43:21] TheGeekPeek: I run my gpu to mine when I have class, im usually away 12 hours per day. Not worth much, but it could be worth if prices go up. Plus my rig stays very cool
[4:43:25] Prixa1: how do u mine it if i may ask
[4:43:27] ChetSteadman_: so this datapack gives you the entire caves and cliffs update even though only part 1 has officially released?
[4:43:33] CountRubbish: @giantwaffle I'm just terrible at know when rooms or structures are even in Minecraft so it takes me a long time to count. I guess you probably have 10k more hours in this game than me though.
[4:43:35] JAHrda: @JAHrda why?
[4:43:35] firepher: how much upfront cost?
[4:43:48] BobMcFigglehorn: what do you think about the update and will you be using ghe new items, or not?

[5:07:28] dasmako: wait 3 months before payin
[5:07:34] dasmako: or longer or less whatever
[5:07:44] CanadianLuke: that's how business is done, net 30, net 90, etc, its just old school business
[5:07:44] n8level: sounds like a bank
[5:07:47] mechoriet: its also with payment providers
[5:07:58] ecnerw4l: kinda weirdddddd
[5:08:03] ChetSteadman_: lot of it will probably have to do with just timing cash flows for these companies
[5:08:05] MrHashbrowns: Lowes does that with employee direct stock investment. its why i dont contribute.
[5:08:10] CanadianLuke: it's a free loan
[5:08:15] CanadianLuke: for 90 days
[5:08:19] dasmako: its like giving the gvt over tax payment u give them an interest free loan
[5:08:21] mechoriet: also chargebacks

[5:08:36] ChetSteadman_: accounts receivable, essentially
[5:09:05] Winner5001: where do they invest in order to get profit in just 90 days?
[5:09:10] DevLegion: Yeah. No more grace period to quickly take that money back
[5:09:21] babyaddalyn: Milexna subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months! 
[5:09:23] Nexhunter: any interests is good interest KEKW
[5:09:28] MrHashbrowns: @Nexhunter yeah they purchase 2 time a year but you contribute from every paycheck. they hold the money and just give you the stock of what you contributed its shit
[5:09:36] フリクリ: フリクリ subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 21 months! Hope you're well, What was that logistics game dev software called? It had a purple interface and assisted in balancing.
[5:09:36] ChetSteadman_: gaming company needs to actualize the revenues  from the streaming event,  which they then pay to the ad firm who then will  pay out to the streamer. so depends on the terms of the accounts receivable/payable between the studio and advertiser
[5:09:39] Nexhunter: @MrHashbrowns KEKW truly a scam
[5:10:02] Nexhunter: at least for companies that do stock options for bonuses like there are schedules determined for that KEKW @MrHashbrowns
