[0:23:59] DUSTNlNJA: if you google bf6 leaked teaser, there is a picture of 3 ospreys in formation, im not sure if that is a confirmed source though
[0:24:04] KABBL: Battlefield Heroes 2 Kappa
[0:24:06] Chronoes: maybe it's just a garbled version of the trailer they're going to show on 9th?
[0:24:08] 2Shadyz: looked like radar on top of it
[0:24:10] ray_nar: see I thought those were people on the left....

[2:38:06] richie385: t
[2:38:16] Kuroiorb: !latency @Lucky1XG
[2:38:17] Moobot: If you find that Waffle's stream is glitching, lagging, or rubber-banding, try turning off "low latency" in the stream settings and/or switch the stream resolution off of Auto. This issue is on Twitch's end.
[2:38:35] fishflip: fishflip subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 13 months, currently on a 1 month streak! 
[2:38:44] Deadfox74: @lucky1xg there is a plug-in for players like YouTube and twitch that you can fast forward with
