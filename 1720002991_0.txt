[0:59:11] kane1941: now fix blue boards?
[0:59:16] RationalLies: miss?
[0:59:20] Bernd135: * 2x button
[0:59:20] SwiftAffliction: 256 parallel processing upgrade lets you do 256 recipes at once, not 256 items outputted
[0:59:40] SwiftAffliction: this means recipes that produces more than 1 can go higher than 256
[0:59:52] Goldps1: nice
[0:59:53] Arkypoo909: I have tried to start KSP so many times but just suck at it and quit

[1:02:08] Tiggaboo: just point at the thing and blast your rockets
[1:02:08] Wetware: Orbital mechanics is kind of counter-intuitive

[1:03:00] NevaDaha: DoritosChip ?
[1:03:01] CyberrPickle: DoritosChip
[1:03:04] mrleonehart: @Giantwaffle Fix Quartz...Pati spent a lot of time last night trying to but realized you were using quartz faster than you were making it
[1:03:06] LinearLayer: Pro tip: Fire rockets in the opposite direction to go that direction
[1:03:06] Macari_: yummers
[1:03:07] Wetware: Have they announced a date for Kerbal 2 yet?
[1:03:11] Bernd135: Waffle you make the recipes wrong you need to click the 2x button for every recipe 8 times for the recipe to become a 256 recipe! otherwise you only make a recipe that make 256 items that are not 256 recipes per craft
[1:03:13] mrleonehart: @Giantwaffle Nether Quartz

[2:02:52] Thalmize: @Apparentthreat what is his range for timeout?
[2:03:02] Apparentthreat: @Thalmize it depends. one sec lemme get a pic
[2:03:06] Purecrew: would upgrading the power of all those machines making plates rods and ect make them much faster?
[2:03:08] Gh3ttoboy: it could end up being 7 days
[2:03:12] sdman12o: pepeSmoke one more
[2:03:18] Apparentthreat: @Thalmize https://imgur.com/TgtWARC
[2:03:19] Ponzotron: monkaS
[2:03:32] sdman12o: @Giantwaffle who is that behind you Kappa
[2:03:36] Allmostdone: You guys should get tecj to show off that script. I think other streamers and mods would just love it
[2:03:38] Thalmize: @Apparentthreat KEKW oh geez
[2:03:51] Morlega: Don't worry, you'll be missing some ingredients to actually do the craft YEP
[2:03:55] Thalmize: good ole RNG role
[2:04:00] DaddyDiddy: waffle t8 chaos shard recipe in microverse projector is 5 seconds at UIV, its very very pog @Giantwaffle
[2:04:06] tomey36: Are the CPU’s fixed?
[2:04:32] Ponzotron: holy fuck
[2:04:40] Allmostdone: quantum CPU. CHECK
[2:04:43] Morlega: That's only like 33 64k CPUs YEP
[2:04:57] DareDeFlug: Means you'll have to auto every single stuff
[2:05:13] Ponzotron: tf
[2:05:13] Moobot: New here? Welcome! You can usually catch Waffle Mon-Sat at ~1400 UTC. Feel free to hang out in chat before the stream and/or join the !discord. waffleEgg | Use !thisweek for any changes.
[2:05:28] DaddyDiddy: no that's the grid power
[2:05:29] iQuantumFlux: Pat I did quite a bit of components for auto rafting that last night
[2:05:40] iQuantumFlux: Pati**
[2:05:40] Moobot: You can sub to Waffle by clicking this neat link -> twitch.tv/giantwaffle/subscribe SUBprise
[2:05:53] DareDeFlug: Dude the amount of Bytes
[2:05:55] DareDeFlug: IT's insane
[2:06:09] Gh3ttoboy: there arent the extra cells CPUs
[2:06:10] Unbreakablemedic: You said you needed 3 at the start
[2:06:17] CrZy__: look on the roof of the hub
[2:06:22] Aragnir: if passive sub components you can cut down memory usage
[2:06:24] Morlega: It's big enough but it's often in use
[2:06:26] iQuantumFlux: No, he didn’t “craft” anything, he put in a lot of the recipes into the CPUs
[2:06:28] coopsy_: 8 bits = 1 byte
[2:06:31] DaddyDiddy: in this pack i've learned that you should have at least the same amount of crafting co processors for the amount of crafting 64K so it goes faster
[2:06:34] A_Gold_Rolex: on top
[2:06:37] CrZy__: on top there is a large one
[2:06:40] sneakyHoovy: PepLaugh
[2:06:47] iQuantumFlux: Above the roof
[2:06:53] Morlega: @Giantwaffle the CPU can't be in use, but pretty sure it's big enough
[2:07:06] Apparentthreat: if you do the math, it's kinda like 2^20 / 2^15 which is 32. you said 31
[2:07:07] snurre: go big. very big
[2:07:09] Apparentthreat: 64Ks
[2:07:14] Gh3ttoboy: isnt there the 256k CPUs mod 8n this pack
[2:07:26] DaddyDiddy: i have 2 that say 6M
[2:07:31] DaddyDiddy: that's enough for now
[2:07:34] Purecrew: Isnt that the smiley face one?
[2:07:57] Morlega: This time it doesn't complain about no CPU, you just don't have the ingredients @Giantwaffle
[2:07:59] MisterRabbitHead: CPUs are not the issue
[2:07:59] Firstnecron: 2 GB monkaS
[2:08:06] Larklen: missing mats yeah
[2:08:09] CareBear_1643: you cant start it cuz materials
[2:08:12] DaddyDiddy: yeah you're missing the mats
[2:08:12] Morlega: Correct
[2:08:29] Morlega: The CPU is only an "issue" if it happens to be in use when you try queue it
[2:08:41] DaddyDiddy: simulation super computer
[2:08:46] DaddyDiddy: then you'll definitely have enough
[2:08:57] Larklen: KEKW
[2:08:58] lvyEartman: thats quite a list for a craft
[2:09:05] Larklen: Waiting TakingNotes
[2:09:05] officialhunterx: red coal will be a problem
[2:09:17] iQuantumFlux: Should also check the dilithium progress. Gonna need a lot.

[2:09:42] DaddyDiddy: yeah waffle you need around 1.8 million dilithium to finish the pack, pati put it on passive last night, hopefully its getting up there @Giantwaffle
[2:09:56] Gh3ttoboy: 350 drones of another type
[2:10:03] banshay3: let's gamba on it

[2:10:33] coopsy_: I find it funny when people thing this pack is as hard as a degree lol
[2:10:34] daedmissica0: you need to make a bet with chat
[2:10:36] Apparentthreat: there's accepting a challenge and then accepting it while being salty
[2:10:38] Morlega: @Giantwaffle that all is just for one crea source. How many does the crea chest need again? pepeLaugh TakingNotes
[2:10:41] R1Rider01: VOD to prove it  LUL
[2:10:51] stickman_02: Waffle wouldn’t give us the satisfaction of a 24 hour stream
[2:10:52] Spirevipp: imagine thinking waffle could do a 24 hr stream OMEGALUL
[2:11:03] DaddyDiddy: nah you have to be a gregger
[2:11:09] DaddyDiddy: if you're not a gregtech gamer you can't finish the pack
[2:11:13] cmmeth: hate yourself?
[2:11:16] calebhub514: greg enjoyers rise up
[2:11:20] Dioxinn: You should probably figure out why T1 drones are not making dilithium anymore, you need soooo much
[2:11:21] deadgolfer: needs someone that lives off despair
[2:11:25] boltzmanC: need a jira board to finish this pack
[2:11:29] R1Rider01: i like this modpack, but only to watch.  I couldn't play this
[2:12:06] boltzmanC: if there was a way to start this pack at the me system stage i would play it
[2:12:07] ImposterArchitect: NIIICE
[2:12:11] DaddyDiddy: i personally believe there's two types of modded players, there is regular modded players, and then there is gregtech players, and gregtech players are just a different breed @Giantwaffle
[2:12:17] Algias: The quest book kinda fills that niche imo
[2:12:19] RogueLightning_: I live through waffle gaming
[2:12:21] TheMatchyman: Hello gamer
[2:12:29] cmmeth: at that point you aren't playing, you are having a job
[2:12:34] Apparentthreat: inb4 you get Jira and you have 7 different Projects and 8 Portfolio Features for just this pack KEKW
[2:12:39] Variandra: @Giantwaffle is this how u get a gf?
[2:12:41] arkun_: The next pack will def require one
[2:12:45] DaddyDiddy: @boltzmanC you could always just give yourself a ME system to start and then play from there
[2:12:55] lampman87: !mc_pack

[2:13:02] CapnCrunch301: IE has been mine for a long time
[2:13:02] Zapper_777: I believe, not sucking up or being a smarty... its a head on swivel kind of mod, with a one step forward two step back, and sometimes its three step back, but there always progression :D
[2:13:04] Amenophiz: That brag will have an asterisk though because of the power ;P
[2:13:08] Greedyro: and what is that? (the mod pack)
[2:13:11] pinhead_larynx: Is this the longest youve played a game consecutively?

[2:14:15] SolarisFall: so doesn't include weekends
[2:14:23] ItsSABER_: @Giantwaffle the stargate is 724 million bytes to auto craft
[2:14:23] Sir_Darkstar: Waffle is too weak to play New Horizons... prove me wrong. Kappa
[2:14:23] MisterRabbitHead: you can do it in 2000 waffle KEKW

[2:14:54] DaddyDiddy: i mean the team that beat in 2 years had like 6 people playing it consistently and like actually grinding, just you and pati might take a little longer
[2:14:57] ItsSABER_: @Giantwaffle the stargate is 724 million bytes to auto craft
[2:14:57] iQuantumFlux: Full time job is 2080
[2:14:58] TheMatchyman: 1hr side quest a day

[2:41:43] stickman_02: you could make a big multiblock solidifier
[2:41:57] Tro95: Have you managed to automate stone yet?
[2:42:01] Cirina_Felis: The simpsons said it was your soul was escaping when you sneeze and saying god bless you pushes it back in

[2:42:05] kane1941: just put the craft
[2:42:11] ImposterArchitect: Ehh, just let it run
[2:42:12] stickman_02: multiblock and just put the 3 of them into the one block
[2:42:13] PureSpider: people used to think your soul left your body when you sneezed, so they said bless you to get it back in or something dumb like that
[2:42:23] RogueLightning_: Thought of your “spirit” escaping your body
[2:42:24] ih_shevtsov: are there liquid sunarium?
[2:42:31] MisterRabbitHead: Jokes on you I have no soul Despairge
[2:42:34] The_Stone_One: It was the best science of the time

[2:43:02] SeaOfMadness_: how s the work on the rotary hearth furnace?
[2:43:07] Gh3ttoboy: you will probably have to make the multiblock for another material
[2:43:07] Purecrew: upgrade drawer
[2:43:11] teddiii_: you say believing the soul left the body when sneezing is dumb, but those people also believed in balancing the humors
[2:43:11] Venamah: it's even slower in the multi block version KEKW
[2:43:11] DemonsDawn: once you build 1, you can just copy paste the rest :)

[2:44:22] tomey36: That is sooo slow
[2:44:23] Morlega: Works exactly like the Drawer Controller, but you can only have one normal Drawer Controller per "drawer network"
[2:44:29] Bolt_Vanderhuge_: future waffle's problem
[2:44:33] DaddyDiddy: not a rotary hearth that's a blast smelter, not an alloy smelter, you need to do a processing array
[2:44:34] teddiii_: @cheddarrrbob it's what waffle is playing

[2:55:23] geeeegeeeeeeee: @Giantwaffle the wierdest thing i ever see. IS quantum particle changes its behaviour in a double-slit experiment when it is being observed.
[2:55:24] Glacial_Indifference: Fission is splitting
[2:55:25] BloodBlight: yes
[2:55:26] kane1941: you built both types of the reactors here
[2:55:26] xxLatte: no ur right
[2:55:29] Danishwiz: You're right
[2:55:30] ExumeTV: fis·sion. (fĭsh′ən) 1. The splitting of the nucleus of an atom into two or more nuclei. The splitting occurs either spontaneously, because the nucleus has many neutrons
[2:55:30] snurre: fusion = fuse; fission = fiss
[2:55:30] RoyalTL: fission
[2:55:30] Shame625: You are correct, fission is splitting
[2:55:30] LinearLayer: You add neutrons and then it makes it unstable and then it splits into smaller elements
[2:55:30] Glacial_Indifference: Fusion is fusing things together
[2:55:31] dukeseven: fusion is what happens on the sun
[2:55:32] Prefer2Lurk: you are correct
[2:55:33] CyberrPickle: fusion is combining. fission is splitting.
[2:55:34] Mister_Nova: One Guy'ed

[2:55:48] DX_Plates: joe don't know
[2:55:48] kane1941: You have a fusion reactor running, just look at it
[2:55:50] PureSpider: fusion is putting together, fission is splitting
[2:55:54] Littleme02: He shot stuff into a thing and it became unstable and splitt
[2:55:57] Marguti: Paul P. Fission
[2:55:57] geraldtgnome: @Giantwaffle go and have a look at the radioactive boy scout, made nuclear stuff in his potting shed from clocks and stuff
[2:56:00] Opusdeity: Asian fission cuisine is the bomb
[2:56:06] cmmeth: @seaofmadness_, no, thats Vegeto
[2:56:07] ikkarus01: Attempted One Guy failed.
[2:56:11] Killerman1997: fusion is a union, fission is a fissure

[2:58:02] C_nrad: that's why dropping them on accident is mostly fine
[2:58:14] brightcandle: Getting the timing right is the science behind nuclear weapons, signal propagation is a big part of the issue
[2:58:18] maccabeus: the older models would fire a nuclear cannonball into more nuclear material to achieve a similar result
[2:58:36] DemonsDawn: for fun see how many broken arrow incidents there have been in america alone
[2:58:39] TheRackster: Thats why it was insane that both bombs worked on Japan. Even the scientists thought one would atleast be a dud pepeLaugh
[2:58:43] LinearLayer: whats crazy is how they did the testing to make sure it works, scott manley has a video about it
[2:58:50] lampman87: So same length wires?
[2:58:51] Littleme02: Fission was discovered in 1938 by Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann, who found that the nucleus of a heavy element such as uranium could be split into two smaller nuclei when bombarded with neutrons. -chatgpt
[2:58:52] brightcandle: The balance between chargers has to be ridiculous accurate too
[2:59:01] SebastiaanO: @tyler7907 daddy chill
[2:59:03] kane1941: you need 5 of them for each gear type
[2:59:15] Littleme02: its accurate thou soo /shurg
[2:59:26] brightcandle: The initial bombs were just 2 partial spheres but to go bigger you need more pieces.
[2:59:38] Experiment_B: you know what this chat is missing? good copy pasta
[3:00:12] Docgalaad: it's scary to think they discovered fission in 38 and made a bomb from that just 7 years later

[3:45:24] kinglouisxvii: COPIUM
[3:45:26] Bernd135: Waffle you do know you only do 128x recipes and not 256x as you only look that it outputs 256 items and are not just pressing the 2x button 8 times

[3:52:30] emnitthy: @scojan  very very short sighted opinion

[3:52:33] GameDadel: phantomlord? %?
[3:52:40] BakaPixel: @Giantwaffle But at least stocks equate to somethign tangible and real. Crypto isn't, your ability to make money on crypto is tied to someone deciding to give you money for it.
[3:52:42] jdimango: Gambling is a highly addictive and easily impressionable

[4:28:12] Morlega: Them not being on isn't ME's fault KEKW
[4:28:14] Apparentthreat: you have multiple machines for the same thing?
[4:28:16] thePier: something missing like round robin on picking the assembly line from the AE system?
[4:28:20] Bernd135: How many co processors do you use?
[4:28:24] oohoo3: maybe you just need more power in the machine ItIsWhatItIs
[4:28:35] TippletonJohn: Might need to just split motors, arms, conveyers, etc.

[6:43:01] Moobot: You can find Waffle's Youtube channel here - https://youtube.com/giantwaffle
[6:43:07] Morlega: AE2 estimates it based on how long it already took. It doesn't know how long a recipe actually takes

[6:43:38] PureSpider: @byalkou Pepega
[6:43:42] Jerod5_: a % completed would be better
[6:43:46] Igmatic: would be better to keep track about how long it has been crafting
[6:43:53] lintensteel21: the math is accurate for molecular assemblers
[6:43:53] Morlega: Well they could record recipes and take the average of the last 10 runs or so
[6:44:11] bWGi: operations_completed/total operations
[6:44:18] Jerod5_: but if you notice it stuck on a % you could go debug
[6:44:21] Morlega: So technically they can make a semi-accurate estimate, although it'll never be correct for brand new recipes
[6:44:28] TheRackster: Think refined storage has % and it as u say it stops at 99% when one thing is left but maybe a few millions of said thing lmao
[6:44:32] InternetPlumber: not enough co-processors probably
[6:44:37] daedmissica0: @Giantwaffle did you show pati the last craft of his next pack?
[6:44:39] GuardMoony: lack of coprocessors?

[6:44:45] StraightErro: Make redundant recipes for all the assemblers, so all of them are able to be used for everything?
[6:44:48] Danishwiz: Maybe the machine that it is to be crafted in is being used
[6:44:48] Morlega: Are you sure it's using the right CPU though?
[6:44:51] MrArrig: In cpu 19 though?
[6:44:54] Morlega: @Giantwaffle name your big CPUs

[6:54:41] spyrayias: ae says 1 min so you're fine lol
[6:54:45] Morlega: Don't worry. If the power runs out, AE2 will stop autocrafting so power will restore soon YEP
[6:54:57] Csninja: maybe the prios are different?

[7:00:02] PureSpider: yea you put in the recipe where it's not supposed to be
[7:00:11] Danishwiz: Wait Waffle didn't you wreck the stuff in the clean room at some point?
[7:00:12] Morlega: @Giantwaffle don't re-queue the craft while the miner is getting the heart, or ME will think it needs another tier 10 YEP
[7:00:24] Blackdeath911: @giantwaffle can you theoretically que up another one (enough materials?)
[7:00:28] tomey36: Just make the asoc and they won’t be broken
[7:00:55] her0zer0: if it says scheduled no crafting it's waiting for the machine to be available

[7:01:50] mechoriet: KEKW Caprisun
[7:01:52] Morlega: Missing a unique liquid?
[7:02:04] Wilson2566: check power?

[7:03:01] Jerod5_: 2 mins btw COPIUM
[7:03:10] Champton2664: How long has this been crafting?
[7:03:11] Morlega: @Giantwaffle figure out which recipe needs the ingredients in that clean room machine, and check if it has the correct liquid
[7:03:17] frainsbreeze: final stretch is another hour
[7:03:24] PureSpider: true voice reveal
[7:03:26] MonteKuchen: maybe the other circuits are stuck in the same machine
[7:03:35] Thegrinch6: 24 hour stream?
[7:03:47] frainsbreeze: nope....happy to see the base in all its glory
[7:03:54] sdman12o: waffle squeaker confirmed

[7:07:12] DaddyDiddy: check the input bus of the circuit assembler, sometimes it bugs out
[7:07:15] Snah__: need a clean hatch on one of the big machines maybe
[7:07:17] TelRehiad: you are probably missing a liquid in the machine
[7:07:20] DaddyDiddy: at least it does for me in some crafts
[7:07:25] Jimanjim: just stop using it and move the machines downstairs
[7:07:28] Cadoceus: Check the clean room recipes
[7:07:36] Orogii: clean room clogged ?
[7:07:37] MAX_EVIL: the clean room assembler is in 2 chunks I think
[7:07:52] MetalBBA: the pig holding open the door, lmao

[7:12:01] Bernd135: As long you do not destroy the core it keeps the power
[7:12:01] Cadoceus: Can you just build the better one now?
[7:12:01] Scerion_TX: just don't break the middle or it'll lose the power

[7:12:12] SirNickGaming: Deactivate button in the ring. You can add to it without breaking the core and losing power @Giantwaffle
[7:12:13] biolet8: put the infinite thing the output side and break it
[7:12:13] primo_qwe: yes

[7:12:19] Morlega: Don't break the VERY middle, but one of the drac blocks yeah
[7:12:20] thePier: @Morlega he means he will lose power to the base while the core is deactivated
[7:12:22] primo_qwe: nah its wrong you need awakened
