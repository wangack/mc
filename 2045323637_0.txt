[0:39:15] Shinizter: Hey Bajheera! I have a casual fitness question, since the end of '22 I've been on a long fitness journey, as I'm getting deeper into it I feel like I'm not feeling the strain of bigger compound movements in the main muscle groups, an example doing pushups I tend to feel it more in the arms/shoulders than chest. Any tips to improve that muscle to mind connection? Is it likely a form thing?
