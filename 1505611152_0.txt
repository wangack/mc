[1:17:18] TheGhostofTime: the fact that the broadcasters don't try to interact with chat is so un-twitch like

[1:17:28] isit: everyone's in full screen i guess Kappa

[1:19:02] TheGhostofTime: hi broadcaster! what are the average number of player kills per team in this gamemode?
[1:19:03] Maaack3: bruh i predicted 22 golds by hannah and they got 23 right?

[1:20:15] Moobot: https://twitch.typeform.com/to/ensh59of#show=1507_061622
[1:20:18] OfficialNexus6: @TheGhostofTime Occasionally they do, they should have staff/game analysts in the chat or they should add match statistics and fun facts/records on screen
[1:20:20] Teeh7: Zzzz
[1:21:13] gregor34: wow lolo
[1:21:15] TheGhostofTime: @TheGhostofTime that's one of the things that makes MCC so engaging for the audience, the player stats breakdowns and predictions
[1:21:22] OfficialNexus6: Similar to rocket league, speaking of that, WavePunk is a iconic caster and really known in the RLCS side of things
[1:21:49] firemido: xd
[1:22:56] TheGhostofTime: it's very similar to bed wars. It's very, very standard bridge egg into base strats
[1:23:03] OfficialNexus6: But I cant say much right now cause I haven't watched a full game of MCC on Twitch Rivals
[1:23:13] TheGhostofTime: like if you've played bed wars the bridge making is pretty basic
[1:24:27] TheGhostofTime: @OfficialNexus6 yeah, MCC is its own separate competition, but the engagement on the host stream is really different because of how much the community analyzes the player stats. So fun!
[1:24:58] zayden_g2010: can you pls show the othere people
[1:25:23] Vertefex: I doubt they will
[1:25:29] The8thWard: bro ion even know half the people here ngl

[1:26:03] TheGhostofTime: there was no saving that when he took so much dmg to gapple
[1:26:10] TheGhostofTime: he should have pre gapped for the regen
[1:26:19] TheGhostofTime: the regen lasts a while
