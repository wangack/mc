[2:06:31] POJOGA3: Real
[2:06:46] isabelcoolaf: using up too many inodes Tssk
[2:06:56] the_mmx: at least have to save the seed?

[2:07:14] critical_pancake: black cats everywhere
[2:07:15] chopchunk: @POJOGA3 are any of the 12 eye seeds viable for a speedrunner, in that they wouldn't be instantly reset?
[2:07:21] autum_mist_101: pearlieNugget pearlieNugget pearlieNugget
[2:07:33] Switchpalacecorner: NTFS breaks if you have over 4.2 billion separate files on one drive
[2:07:37] Switchpalacecorner: so watch out for that even if theyre tiny
[2:07:47] Scottimus432: it's one in a trillion for 12 eyes
[2:07:54] Bloonskiller: aint nobody gettin 4 billion resets
[2:07:55] POJOGA3: @chopchunk no clue peepoShrug
[2:08:20] penguinsandstuff: with the one million runs and a 1/trillion chance it is a .000018% chance fein has rolled a 12 eye
[2:08:20] BurperFish: and how many digits are the seeds ?
[2:08:24] isabelcoolaf: @Switchpalacecorner this is why justlog broke the first time justlog actually like broke broke. except ext4 not NTFS
[2:08:26] Bloonskiller: i dont think record file saves seed
[2:08:26] penguinsandstuff: 1.8 million*
[2:08:32] isabelcoolaf: too many one-line files
[2:08:35] chaitea04: i wonder how many instances a crazy supercomputer could run
[2:08:38] the_mmx: 2^48 rollable seeds
[2:08:46] penguinsandstuff: yeouch
[2:08:49] shig_tv: YEOWCH
[2:08:50] critical_pancake: its like the birthday problem though, you get 30 people in a room and chances are good there is a pair that shares a birthday
[2:08:51] gambsgambs: eventually someone will recognize they got the ssg seed in rsg and get an unbeatable record
[2:08:51] Fossabot: There are 2^64 possible seeds, but only 2^48 can generate when creating a new world. Seeds can be found using fancy scripts https://youtu.be/8CKh4x4iK38 , that's how the current ssg seed was found. It would be impossible to randomly generate, not just statistically
[2:08:56] penguinsandstuff: WAYTOOFAR so rude
[2:08:59] POJOGA3: @penguinsandstuff is that taking in to account the like 120 portals per seed?
[2:09:02] Scottimus432: don't you have to get to the portal range for it to load to be able to see the eyes

[2:09:19] weilowz: @the_mmx only 2 seeds, basicaly :(

[2:09:26] chopchunk: @POJOGA3 with what you were saying about someone most likely rolling a 12 eye and skipping it, they could still run the seed and miss it anyway because the 12 eye is somewhere out in the 6th ring or something stupid
[2:09:27] Rubektillium: I think it's pretty much guaranteed the same seed has been rolled twice

[2:09:54] Drgnslyr123: Birthday problem helps
[2:09:56] grifferthrydwy: its the birthday paradox but bigger
[2:09:59] penguinsandstuff: it is a .2 % chance that fein rolled a 12 eye in one of the 120 portals
[2:10:08] CurtisDN_: gotta have the bi-monthly discussion in chat about people rolling duplicate seeds

[2:12:15] CurtisDN_: @matikss321 for skulls, usually
[2:12:16] POJOGA3: TrollDespair VOID
[2:12:17] SilentHarper: SilentHarper subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 6 months! Here's to 6 more months of your motivational speaking!
[2:12:21] McFlyOMGWTFBBQ: why is speedrun.com leaderboards so outdated? both any% and AA
[2:12:21] PacManMVC: @Kaelan_F what do you mean by that
[2:12:22] the_mmx: #lowertreasure
[2:12:24] PacManMVC: like in your inv?
[2:12:28] ItzzMatt84: @Kaelan_F his iventory
[2:12:29] Kaelan_F: @PacManMVC the skulls answer
[2:12:31] ramipradierr: pog
[2:12:33] penguinsandstuff: YIPPEE
[2:12:40] CurtisDN_: if you have a 2nd notch, you use it on skulls, but its just to save the fireres inventory space
[2:12:42] Switchpalacecorner: for MCSR to have rolled more seeds than everyone else, there would have to be 200 runners that have rolled as many seeds as fein, and everyone else who bought the game would need to roll just one random seed each
[2:12:46] Switchpalacecorner: so its definitely just not the case
[2:12:50] PacManMVC: idk what the skulls answer is
[2:12:54] Scottimus432: When repetition is allowed, the number of possible permutations of 10 digits is 1010, or 10,000,000,000. so if the seed has 10 numbers than yes, probably the same seed has been seen
[2:12:56] PacManMVC: but ok
[2:12:59] penguinsandstuff: @CurtisDN_ he has a 2nd notch (you probably noiced)
[2:13:02] penguinsandstuff: noticed
[2:13:03] Christinekc: Nerdge
[2:13:10] Kaelan_F: the one he said vocally 😧
[2:13:13] CurtisDN_: ik but penguin literally go read kaelin's question
[2:13:14] penguinsandstuff: NOWAY
[2:13:17] PacManMVC: well i have stream muted
[2:13:20] PacManMVC: peepoM
[2:13:30] penguinsandstuff: @CurtisDN_ oki
[2:13:31] RubixBeaver1: i mean how many seeds does the average person roll
[2:13:33] RubixBeaver1: like 100?
[2:13:41] Kaelan_F: @PacManMVC it was just if there was an ideal point on when to eat the notch peepoBlush
[2:13:42] POJOGA3: 2
[2:13:46] shig_tv: i have been running for like a year and i have 250k
[2:13:47] penguinsandstuff: at least 2
[2:13:49] Switchpalacecorner: theres 300 million sales though
[2:13:51] PacManMVC: nod
[2:13:52] Switchpalacecorner: so its just not possible
[2:13:56] Tabspacecrafting: @Switchpalacecorner I think 90% of normies have played less than 3 seeds
[2:14:01] critical_pancake: i have rolled hundreds easily
[2:14:02] BlookyCookie_: idk 2^64 is an incomprehensibly large number
[2:14:04] penguinsandstuff: every seed has to have been played at least once right
[2:14:07] Switchpalacecorner: if they each roll just 2, youd need like 500 runners as active as fein
[2:14:07] BlookyCookie_: not to mention different versions
[2:14:14] PacManMVC: @penguinsandstuff not even close
[2:14:24] Switchpalacecorner: even if they each roll just 2 seeds they still probably win
[2:14:29] Switchpalacecorner: 300 million sales is a fuckton
[2:14:29] penguinsandstuff: @PacManMVC I forgot to add the Clueless to make it sarcastic
[2:14:31] penguinsandstuff: WOAH
[2:14:31] grifferthrydwy: bro does NOT know how it works

[2:14:54] kot7k: crossbow  in chests can have piercing?
[2:14:58] PacManMVC: yes kot7k
[2:15:04] BurgerReviewerr: if a seed gets rolled twice we probably will never know because its likely a seed that you would just simply reset as soon as you see the preview
[2:15:09] sh4dle: i beleive you penguins :)
[2:15:10] Rubektillium: bro confused it with the pigeonhole principle
[2:15:11] Tabspacecrafting: @Switchpalacecorner are we counting bedrock?
[2:15:14] penguinsandstuff: @sh4dle thank you
[2:15:19] PacManMVC: enchanted crossbow in bastion just picks an enchantment at random

[2:15:26] kot7k: @pacmanmvc thanks xmayaLove
