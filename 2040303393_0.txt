[0:40:06] DeePick: The phrase 'girl dad' was popularised after the tragic passing away of NBA star Kobe Bryant in a 2020 helicopter crash. The athlete died alongside his 13-year-old daughter Gianna. It is used to refer to dads who have daughters and is often used to capture the love between fathers and their daughters.

There are nuances to raising boys in 2024 as well, but you don't hear people walking around saying "i'm a boy dad".  A dad is a dad, shouldn't have to classify sex of the child you raise.  Also in 2024, don't you think it's pretty presumptuous to assume the gender of your kid?

[1:54:59] Blake8369: I wanted to see Bills vs 49ers. But the NFL thinks we just wanna see Taylor Swift every week
[1:55:03] Saulted: I still haven't moved on from tomlin tripping on the sideline and we won that game

[1:56:02] Blake8369: Just ask Tony Romo
[1:56:06] ktorn_: Jon, a perfectly valid stalling strategy for this farm would be to fill all the cauldrons with water, and do a test run of collecting the water in the minecart Cheer100 Cheer100
[1:56:07] DeePick: LOOKS JUST LIKE THE DRAWING
[1:56:08] SummitSummit: They don't think, they know.
[1:56:10] jerrythomas55: Did you get pegged by Amanda again last night? bamPEG
[1:56:17] JTSmith44: I believe the actual games are not rigged. but the stories they tell on TV is very manufactured
[1:56:19] nashythedude: If you can bet on it, its probably rigged.
[1:56:20] slackertron: thats going to be a lot of lava source blocks
[1:56:28] pinhad: apparently an nfl lawyer was shot dead shortly after saying the nfl is righed couple years back
[1:56:38] bu1dak: do you think Josh Allen panicked a bit with under 2 minutes left and 30 yards to go? seems like he threw for the end zone twice rather than just going for the 1st down
[1:56:46] skeptium: @NASHFREAK10 terrible logic

[1:57:42] VerbatimStudios: Guten Morgen
[1:57:52] Ch40ticEcl1ps3: couldnt you just make them only 8 long?
[1:57:54] Arkansaw69: @bu1dak funny thing about this is even Tom Brady talked to josh on a podcast before the season started as was letting him know to check the ball down more and everything opens up for u
[1:58:07] slackertron: just one dripstone in the middle call it a day
[1:58:09] goudacheeseburgers: BIG AND DUMB
[1:58:11] jerrythomas55: store the buckets in chests
[1:58:12] snicker201: wait guys whats he building down here?

[1:58:17] bu1dak: @Arkansaw69 and they crazy thing is he did it all game until 2 minutes left
[1:58:21] j0k3r23698: Don't tear down the hole thing, just a few rows
[1:58:24] bu1dak: the*
[1:58:26] zestytreats: can a bucket dispense when stacked? Or does it need to be unstacked
[1:59:00] slackertron: @zestytreats dispensers will spit one out at a time
[1:59:01] Lurker987: plus will the dispenser be able to give 16 buckets within a tick?
[1:59:01] SummitSummit: I thought you got new mouse?
[1:59:09] Arkansaw69: @bu1dak gotta do it when it matters most or does it matter at all
[1:59:20] SummitSummit: With 16 dispensers you can.
[1:59:30] kayccs: ^
[1:59:36] ktorn_: the only way this worked for me is to have 9 stacks of empty buckets on the hotbar and switch as I go down a 16 row
[1:59:44] bu1dak: isn't there a timer that will rapid fire a dispenser?

[2:00:15] slackertron: easy auto refil in modded
[2:00:16] bestem0r: play modded, there you can refill like a boss
[2:00:44] SummitSummit: Complete build redesign incoming.
[2:00:53] bu1dak: wait until 1.21 for auto crafting Kappa
[2:00:57] slackertron: just make a dropper, same mechanics
[2:01:03] ktorn_: you need droppers right?
[2:01:04] jaridw678: Bams you have another problem, if you do 16 when you have 1 bucket left you will fill it with lava and then not pick up empty buckets. You can get around it by doing layers of 15 though
[2:01:07] JTSmith44: !vanilla bamsRage

[2:01:50] Denbrew: imagine not just liking what bams is doing not matter what
[2:01:51] ktorn_: you need to have the inventory full, you'll be dropping buckets as you collect them
[2:01:51] jaridw678: Bams you gotta do 15 not 16
[2:01:55] chilidoge96: This build is going to be a lot of trial and error until you get it right
[2:02:00] Rodimus_Supreme: @goode_cheeseburgers F ur mom.
[2:02:05] Lurker987: and everything's gonna happen while on a minecart
[2:02:10] Alepouditsa: vanila minecract for me is like an early access game
[2:02:12] jaridw678: Bams you have another problem, if you do 16 when you have 1 bucket left you will fill it with lava and then not pick up empty buckets. You can get around it by doing layers of 15 though
[2:02:13] SirAntonic: @denbrew I'll pass LUL jk
[2:02:25] SummitSummit: In the toilet, hopefully.
[2:02:32] slackertron: piston tape, so you just stand in one location collecting lava then you can have an auto refill easy
[2:02:38] synkrynys: piston feed the cauldrons
[2:02:39] goudacheeseburgers: @Rodimus_Supreme shes all for breh. form an orderly que
[2:02:46] ktorn_: I think the best way is to stop at each row, and have a button to resume the next row
[2:02:54] McMozart1: select bed  to come back
[2:03:05] Lurker987: if you do rows of 15, you will have 1 bucket left in hand, and not worry about dropping a lava bucket
[2:03:18] jaridw678: Bams you have another problem, if you do 16 when you have 1 bucket left you will fill it with lava and then not pick up empty buckets. You can get around it by doing layers of 15 though
[2:03:28] flyingQtip: there's space between molocules
[2:03:29] ktorn_: @Lurker987 yes
[2:03:36] Rodimus_Supreme: @goode_cheeseburgers The que starts after me. everyone else gets my sloppy seconds.
[2:04:05] kayccs: 15 dispensers
[2:04:09] slackertron: well also the lava drip is random, all the cauldrens wont fill at the same rate right?
[2:04:17] ktorn_: they'll get picked up tho
[2:04:25] SummitSummit: 15 dispensers would be MUCH faster.
[2:04:25] flyingQtip: pales or buckets?
[2:04:43] bu1dak: NODDERS
[2:04:44] knockinpistols: if it can be stopped its not infinite
[2:04:45] goudacheeseburgers: @Rodimus_Supreme she calls you Rodimus Maximus, no idea why?
[2:04:53] flyingQtip: Ced looped our moms
[2:05:01] kayccs: bro turned into a caveman😭😭😭😭
[2:05:13] slackertron: lol all the breaktimes on the highway today

[2:16:43] SummitSummit: We TOLD you!
[2:16:53] bu1dak: I think LGB has a rapid fire redstone contraption for this right?
[2:16:58] imsilentdreamer: low on blinker fluid I think
[2:17:00] slackertron: dispenser would dispense lava or water tho
[2:17:01] Stragmol: put placable blocks in them and find out
[2:17:02] ktorn_: if the bucket has water or lava the dispenser will actually place it
[2:17:11] TheMulkeyway: one will drop the bucket if it has water/lava in it. one will dispense the liquid @JonBams
[2:17:31] Saulted: might be able to work in a hopper minecart yeet but that sounds overly complicated
[2:17:35] DBKynd: Can you do a vertical stack of droppers that trigger at the same time
[2:17:37] SummitSummit: Need 15.
[2:17:46] ktorn_: the dropper is the left one
[2:17:46] 4tw0ne: i really wish dispensers properly right clicked *anything* that has a 'use' function. otherwise, its just a copy of the dropper in most circumstances
[2:17:55] Stragmol: 16 minecarts
[2:17:58] TheMulkeyway: also if every slot was full, it would ALWAYS dispense, its just attempting to drop from the  8 empty slots
[2:18:14] slackertron: piston tape lava farm, you stand still the lava comes to you
[2:18:16] iamtehnub: use 16 allays for the build KEKW

[2:20:48] Exonerated_: Cheer200 Dad, I think you're doing this the hard way. Why not use a tapefeed system for the cauldrons, stand in one place, and have the buckets refilled as you use them.
[2:20:55] aspectsxv: Thats kinda smart
[2:21:02] ktorn_: you can have the rail go over a non hopper area

[2:22:10] somelucky_: yeah, you harvest from below with a cart and bucket
[2:22:17] Chonfelito: I think tape feed is the play
[2:22:24] ktorn_: you can drop the buckets on a strip of blocks outside the hopper area

[2:22:34] BlockBreaker2012: @JonBams  can you plade minecarts on top on droppers with activater rails to drop buckets are you go over it
[2:22:34] ktorn_: just have the rails go outside the hoppers
[2:22:38] klorkenixoriginal: just use pipes to transfer items. oh wait... fuck vanilla

[2:23:52] ktorn_: you can have a small bucket collection area outside of the hopper area

[2:24:13] FullofFaygo: bam1 juggal17COC bam3
[2:24:13] ktorn_: just keep spamming the buckets in that area
[2:24:24] Chelidda: You could tether the allays to their station maybe?
[2:24:37] bu1dak: you would need the dropper several blocks ahead right? otherwise it just drops it behind you
[2:24:58] Krazyhorse007: Jon How much did that GBusha sign cost?
[2:25:15] Nadari: put the allay in a minecart and have it travel along with you?

[2:26:19] Lurker987: also need to consider how to keep the lower hoppers from picking up dropped buckets
[2:26:29] ktorn_: and make the rows 15 long as suggested
[2:26:36] flyingQtip: holes in the pales

[2:27:32] bu1dak: KEKW
[2:27:41] Cybernetic_Overlord: $50 million boiler BTW
[2:27:41] ktorn_: no need to lock hoppers, just have a 2 or 3 block non hopper zone outside the hopper collecting zone
[2:27:44] flyingQtip: sorry
[2:27:48] jerrythomas55: 7.8 million dollar boiler
[2:27:59] malakie_the_old: Bams look up stack dispenser on yt it might be what you need.
[2:28:15] KinamKrindar: @JonBams there's another way of doing it, where you stay stationary ... you use a "feed tape" out of cauldrons that are filling up under drips. If the cauldron is full, you pick up the stuff, the hopper under you picks it up, then sends a signal to despense another empty bucket onto you
[2:28:27] Lurker987: by hand
[2:28:39] momma_TJ: why do you need so much lava?

[2:30:50] shaboyfaniel: Those cauldrons or hoppers??
[2:31:03] goudacheeseburgers: @Chelidda kinda ironic too being a water fountain of buckets
[2:31:11] Starman11EXE: Or rigged?
[2:31:13] synkrynys: How are you powering the cart?
[2:31:16] jgoold2: 2nd and 9 and threw twice in the endzone
[2:31:25] yakefromstatefarm: stef diggs really pooped the bed..
[2:31:27] shagor28: yeah the diggd not catch was crazy :(
[2:31:43] Chelidda: JonBams, remember the clip I sent a couple of weeks ago with my item fountain? Something like that for the buckets should work

[2:32:35] jgoold2: Did we talk about Ronnie Meatballs this AM?
[2:32:38] Lurker987: it's a big dumb build. any amount of redstone makes it a big smart build
[2:32:43] Ztephenn: clear out an entire nether ocean of lava and move it here.
[2:32:43] jerrythomas55: DING DING Kappa triggered
[2:32:46] Stragmol: or use the only solution you're given?
[2:32:49] WunUP: I'm not understanding how you are going from "Collect the Lava in a Bucket" to "Bucket of Lava into Storage" --- I do get how you are collecting the lava (minecart ride spam Use with Bucket in hand under the cauldrons)... but then what? The hoppers will not pull direct from your inventory
[2:32:52] goudacheeseburgers: @Chelidda it might also lower the storage / chest count to store all the buckets when the farm is not used/harvested
[2:32:55] shagor28: @JonBams i am pressing thumbs for the lions to win it all, that would be a great story
[2:33:00] CherriKushBearE: @JonBams are you not doing Pistons shifting Cauldrons under dripstone?

[2:33:11] jgoold2: Ron Desantis

[2:33:35] jerrythomas55: Ron depantsless

[2:34:04] flyingQtip: repuslicans put the bandtogether
[2:34:18] Chelidda: JonBams, remember the clip I sent a couple of weeks ago with my item fountain? Something like that for the buckets should work
[2:34:32] kayccs: sorry jon bams i had a giant fan on the left side :(
[2:34:32] goudacheeseburgers: @Chelidda i maight have to play with this idea later today
[2:34:35] earthlivingsky: and then running back to daddy
[2:34:37] DeePick: they only ran the worst campaign of all time

[2:36:10] ktorn_: will we have space to power the rails at the end of each row?
[2:36:15] Lurker987: redstone blocks (moved by pistons) under the hoppers?

[2:37:04] JTSmith44: For an asset-flip KKappa wild
[2:37:12] EmNHenDad: locked hoppers won’t pull any in or out

[2:37:21] infxmhc2: palword is dark. you can butcher the animals for meat LUL
[2:37:21] Zerofever: PC gamers want Pokemon
[2:37:24] thatwentBTE: Half of them are Nintendo's lawyers lol
[2:37:26] Chelidda: Palworld is fun! I have 4 hours in it, and my brain pretty much melted from all the new info
[2:37:26] Ztephenn: that game loks awesome tho
[2:37:37] Bhish: And used AI for a load of it apparently
[2:37:39] guy256_: Pokemon just needs to capitalize on the PC market.
[2:37:41] DeePick: @infxmhc2 i love that is pixelates it LUL
[2:37:43] CherriKushBearE: and Palworld has more to come ingamewise
[2:37:50] Face_32: People have wanted a survival style pokemon for years now
[2:37:56] Hamparty: its closer to ark than pokemon in terms of gameplay, but the monsters look way more like pokemon than ark
[2:37:58] DeePick: this game just feels like pokemon fans made their own game on unreal engine 5
[2:38:00] DeePick: it's so good
[2:38:06] Jenscicle: I've watched that game for like 3 minutes and have no idea what is happening or what the goal is.
[2:38:15] infxmhc2: @DeePick I was watching someone play it. they wouldn't do it KEKW
[2:38:19] shaboyfaniel: I feel like that’s kind of the point with pokemon
[2:38:22] DeePick: won't be pokemon tho until they add PVP
[2:38:32] ColourT02: anyone remember that old dog I’m on survival that came out in the early 2000’s?
[2:38:34] Face_32: Yeah I'm having a lot of fun in Palworld
[2:38:36] Chelidda: Palworld is on GamePass. I got 14 days of Gamepass for 1€, so....
[2:38:38] ColourT02: old digimon*
[2:38:40] slackertron: it has a ton of hype now, but i dont think it will have the staying power like some other games
[2:38:43] PedroMRP: torches
[2:38:44] Lurker987: torch under the solid block
[2:38:47] rubyhalo: 30 dollar game thats better than the last 44 pokemon games that cost 60 dollars
[2:38:50] mutsta: which one did you end up getting your daughter for Xmas?
[2:38:53] Puddle_Jam: Target blocks
[2:39:09] ordinarytwitchname: target block will not work
[2:39:09] itachi_kodachi: glass right behind it
[2:39:10] PedroMRP: repeater
[2:39:12] dtkSZN: backwards
[2:39:24] Wacncox: The problem is Nintendo knows we will buy any Pokemon game they release so until people stop buying it won't get fixed
[2:39:33] skeptium: LUL
[2:39:44] somelucky_: not afraid of your ghost Bridget!

[2:41:47] dtkSZN: you can have red stone blocks on sticky pistons
[2:41:59] goudacheeseburgers: deeper cedGasm
[2:42:18] slackertron: that does nothing
[2:42:23] skeptium: LUL
[2:42:30] PedroMRP: you need a powered block
[2:42:33] tyguy735: needs to be up 1 doesn't it..
[2:42:40] Lurker987: it locks the sucking, not the moving
[2:42:59] somelucky_: tarch
[2:43:23] somelucky_: to far
[2:43:28] somelucky_: one block up
[2:43:44] ordinarytwitchname: a locked hopper doesn’t do anything at all, no sucking so pushing
[2:43:49] MrSelenix: If you want to lock them either a torch below, or a block below being powered from the side
[2:43:51] PedroMRP: you need a powered block
[2:44:13] wheaties2k2: @JonBams torch under, repeater into the block the torch is on, line of red across all repeaters
[2:44:14] EmNHenDad: Feed tape is starting to look easier and easier

[2:44:34] skeptium: we locked a hopper, hype
[2:44:39] MrSelenix: that'll be $10.99 please Kappa
[2:44:44] WunUP: The end hopper in the chain has items
[2:44:55] meidoh: Does locking them make them more like pipes or something?
[2:45:01] WunUP: Just a reminder
[2:45:14] WunUP: Locking them turns the OFF
[2:45:21] goudacheeseburgers: claim to fame with a thought process that will dent the brain
[2:45:37] meidoh: I couldn't see the reason for a locked hopper
[2:45:41] OtonP: What is he doing? Is he acoustic?
[2:45:45] ordinarytwitchname: somebody said earlier that locking stops sucking not moving
[2:45:52] jebuscrebus: Doesn't it work with a slab instead of a full block?
[2:45:53] ordinarytwitchname: but it stops everything
[2:45:57] meidoh: What's the difference between a locked hopper and a normal block
[2:45:59] SirAntonic: Locking me turns me onLUL
[2:46:09] smittems: 60k totems in... long as way to go <_<
[2:46:09] ordinarytwitchname: slabs can’t be powered, no
[2:46:12] Brozova: what happened to the bills?
[2:46:15] skeptium: @ordinarytwitchname well, if someone said it, it must be true LUL
[2:46:15] slackertron: nope
[2:46:16] wesidentevil: Just joined a few minutes ago, why are we trying to lock them please ?
[2:46:17] CherriKushBearE: @OtonP Autistic I think you ment?
[2:46:18] MrSelenix: Insert drywall rant here
[2:46:19] WunUP: The hopper chain is a sort of conveyor belt... Locking a hopper in the chain stops the belt at that point.
[2:46:34] CherriKushBearE: @OtonP BUT still funny to read
[2:46:38] OtonP: @CherriKushBearE you just took the fun out of my comment
[2:46:39] TheMulkeyway: only the one block is powered lol
[2:46:41] Chelidda: MrSelenix , feeling better?

[2:47:52] CherriKushBearE: up His*
[2:48:02] OtonP: @CherriKushBearE LUL holy
[2:48:06] meidoh: @wunup so items still transfer from hopper to hopper? Sort of like a pipe as well?
[2:48:09] wheaties2k2: repeaaaaaaters
[2:48:12] slackertron: nope loads of repeaters
[2:48:17] Zerofever: a couple yeah
[2:48:20] meidoh: I feel dumb rn
[2:48:25] MrSelenix: Target blocks will probably be your saving grace here
[2:48:27] slackertron: nope
[2:48:45] bu1dak: time to harvest the wheat farm Kappa
[2:48:50] ordinarytwitchname: you can place those torches on target blocks and then run redstone alongside the target blocks
[2:48:50] EmNHenDad: Rube Goldberg he we go!!!
[2:48:56] SlothLivesMatter: better make a kajillion and three-quarters, just to be safe
[2:49:01] WunUP: @meidoh hoppers pull items in the top and push items out to whatever they are pointed to... UNLESS they are "locked". Locked hoppers do nothing.
[2:49:01] Saulted: target blocks will bend the dust in a 1 wide space
[2:49:05] iamtehnub: time to go rob the ultra smelter for repeaters?  Kappa
[2:49:11] meidoh: Imma just hit YouTube on this hopper thing lol

[2:49:34] RealWickedBrew: Yes, it can drop through glass

[2:49:43] Saulted: iron trapdoor maybe but I have no idea
[2:49:43] ordinarytwitchname: torches on target blocks, then run redstone alongside the target blocks, not right next but one block underneath
