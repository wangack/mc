[1:37:21] CanadianJumlin: Dance Dance Revolution
[1:37:22] Juggonath: Nerdge
[1:37:31] MacGilleoin: ram memory
[1:37:33] Lekerstein: RAM
[1:37:36] CanadianJumlin: DDR was on a different level
[1:37:50] atscovilllezzey: ManChicken SPEED linkzzeyHii linkzzeyHypee Hi Link. Hi chat linkzzeyHii
[1:37:51] Juggonath: no
[1:37:58] Amandroid: Clueless I looked up what it stands for... but I don't understand it linkzzeyGig
[1:38:00] imsusandmydadisrask: Dance dance revolution
[1:38:03] CanadianJumlin: It goes full dance
[1:38:08] Amandroid: @atscovillle linkzzeyHug ManChicken ellyyBearWave
[1:38:19] atscovilllezzey: I still got my ddr pad.. Its so much fun
[1:38:20] lovely_beez: @atscovillle linkzzeyHii 󠀀
[1:38:27] CanadianJumlin: DDR5 means 5 simultaneous dancers, compared to only 4 dancers for DDR4
[1:38:29] Lekerstein: It's the speed of your memory sticks. The CPU can only operate as fast as your memory can store things, basically
[1:38:34] atscovilllezzey: @amandroid linkzzeyHii
[1:38:38] imsusandmydadisrask: Same @atscovillle
[1:38:44] atscovilllezzey: @lovely_beez linkzzeyHii
[1:38:54] Juggonath: x 3D means more on-board cache memory in the CPU itself. DDR5 is your RAM sticks and how your system uses the memory. speed efficiency stuffs
[1:39:29] Melanie_Smellanie: hewwoooo
[1:39:30] FantasiaBuilds: Peepi
[1:39:34] CanadianJumlin: LUL i will stop, I am confusing Link linkzzeyGig

[1:39:49] Juggonath: DDR5 has been known to be finicky
[1:39:54] gus_elita04: I'm sorry, I don't know English well, so I'll use a translator.
[1:40:07] atscovilllezzey: Overclocking a little bit works
[1:40:34] sh4d0wk1tty: Can confirm DDR5 is amazing.
[1:40:39] atscovilllezzey: Im liquid cooled.. No worries here
[1:40:50] Juggonath: that's cause you're so short so everything goes over your head

[1:42:18] Daphness: But it was 2 feet almost 2 hours. Surely it is higher now!
[1:42:18] Juggonath: just think of it as the next upgrade. right now your RAM is DDR4 technology. Just like you're going from 3090 to 4090, DDR4 to DDR5, more is better, be happy Okayge

[1:47:03] ItzClutch9_: what you doin after you palce all the skulk down
[1:47:03] MacGilleoin: truers.... 1 to -5C is about perfect snowing conditions.
[1:47:10] coolkidchamp: I thought that was the case interesting
[1:47:15] Brixxii: PepeHands I will take some of your snow, we warmed up too much so it's raining

[1:47:53] xflixelx: hello
[1:47:53] Kaelinator17: Is it like hail rather than snow?
[1:48:06] Amandroid: @xflixelx linkzzeyHii welcome!
[1:48:18] xflixelx: thx
[1:48:18] starstrucked: @Kaelinator17 no its very light snow
[1:48:29] Amandroid: hail usually happens when it's warmer - you can get hail in the summer
[1:48:41] Aniiyta: better have good car insurance if there is hail
[1:48:47] Brixxii: Gladge basically once it hits -15c, it is just sunny and cold AF from that point on
[1:48:54] mcswizzle7: people make fun of my region for "not being able to drive in the snow" but it's rarely ever less than 15-20F (at the COLDEST). It's always icy rain that leaves a coat of wet ice on everything
[1:49:03] SlapHeadMatt: hey
[1:49:08] Amandroid: @SlapHeadMatt linkzzeyHii
[1:49:11] Kaelinator17: Huh. Had no idea more cold = less snow sometimes. Fascinating

[1:49:45] coolkidchamp: lol
[1:49:50] Amandroid: @mcswizzle7 linkzzeyNod it's also about infrastructure, too - if your city doesn't have all the snowplows and salt trucks, that's gonna make it harder to drive even with a small amount of snow
[1:49:52] coolkidchamp: your a gooberoligist
[1:49:56] SlapHeadMatt: we had our yearly bit of snow here now and the kids are loving life.
[1:49:56] Aniiyta: Link says he's not a meteorologist but I swear I saw him on the 5 o clock news

[5:07:57] lovely_beez: i agree NODDERS
[5:08:16] Des_troy_er: hazard pay
[5:08:18] Amandroid: well, because of the snow and the holiday on monday - too much for them to do
[5:08:31] nog_eagor: yeah thats not much
[5:08:35] Firefly6985: Throw postal workers in there too
[5:08:36] cybernitelite: Does that mean if the weather is ok they should make normal pay ?
[5:08:37] Amandroid: such a vital job linkzzeyNod
[5:08:41] Daphness: Our collectors don't collect when the weather is super bad. They just postpone it to another day.
[5:08:50] cybernitelite: you know that money comes from the customer
[5:08:53] craazymeli: People take those things for granted
[5:09:05] KawasakiMatt798: @craazymeli NODDERS
[5:09:33] lovely_beez: where i am, they dont even have people moving the trash to the truck, it has the handles that pick up the trashcans NODDERS
[5:09:35] craazymeli: Teachers
[5:09:36] cybernitelite: here in America the person pays for it not taxes (trash) but not postal
[5:09:40] Des_troy_er: used to work on turf fields that in the summer could get up to 145F
[5:09:57] Amandroid: @cybernitelite depends on where you live - where I am, trash and recycling is covered by taxes
[5:10:28] cybernitelite: @Amandroid I have lived in like 12 states and none of them include trash in our taxes
[5:10:34] nog_eagor: it would be hard for me to moralize paying that if i lived there, especially because you have lackluster public transit, bike paths, health care, etc. I just probably woudl'nt pay it
[5:10:37] Amandroid: @cybernitelite it's a city tax, not a state tax
[5:11:07] ryb01990: where are you from I’m from Scotland
[5:11:07] StreamElements: @ryb01990,  Link is from Canada :)
[5:11:10] cybernitelite: Ohio, (where i just moved away from) had city tax, and we still had to pay for our own trash
[5:11:20] StreamElements: @CoolAid48 was an idiot and needs to vanish quickly into the depths before they get made fun of KEKCAM
[5:11:24] billboein: pokekw we have to deliver the trash taneeshaElf and its a 1 year permit for like 20$ taneeshaElf

Had I had the confidence, I'd have done so years sooner.
[7:37:25] Snowmeo: OMEGALUL !vanish
[7:37:27] JemmaGrl: @MyMinyWorld You know that if it's in your handbook - it's required. Even if your state doesn't require breaks - if your employer puts iit in the handbook - it basically becomes law.
[7:37:32] Fyvem: have you ever done a 24 hour stream
[7:37:39] Pumats_Tea: Snowmeo that was a very quick backtrack
