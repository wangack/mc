[0:45:01] w0bbelb0b: move it just 1 block
[0:45:02] joshgetslost: for some people, it's hit record. for others it's open the Word document and start typing stuff, for others it's put on the tennis shoes and walk out the front door. all about that first step of action

[1:21:10] JKsAllAroundNZ: pull the ol',  I dunno *shrug*
[1:21:12] DaveSandstorm: You didn't build an iron farm, you built a villager breeder that eliminates lag by killing golems. You're not a villain, you're a hero!
[1:21:14] EtaThetaZeta: diplomatic immunity
[1:21:15] Tank_the_Frank_az: Iron Generator / Villager Breeder > iron farm‚Ä¶

[1:21:27] andydirk88: Makes skins matter more
[1:21:27] mcwheesus: that actually is cool
[1:21:31] LluagorED: one is just his base texture pack, the other adds all the Empires specific stuff, like the armors and stuff.
[1:21:32] Arudaur_: wouldn't invisible armor block the pumpkin heads?
[1:21:33] YndeV: That only effects what YOU see, though, not what others see
[1:21:33] mynameisJEFF8516: when you go back just give all your iron to false.

[1:22:32] mandalise: X was hesitant on the invisible armour, since you can't tell what others are wearing if any
[1:22:32] suldraa: @moomintrollette No, it only makes armour invisible (so items with the armour tag)
[1:22:39] UltimateWager: Impulse's non-redstone lag machine!
