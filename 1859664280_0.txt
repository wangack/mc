[2:51:25] AriaStess: if i recall, if you have a cark place they will spread
[2:51:35] HoboWith2Shotguns: Just either put them in a dark room, or bonemeal
[2:51:38] fluffygoat13: mushrooms grow diagonally, but only in the dark
[2:51:38] AriaStess: they don't need water or tilled earth
[2:51:41] HoboWith2Shotguns: no water

[2:53:23] HoboWith2Shotguns: 12 is the the max required to open a portal, plus a few spare in case they burst
[2:53:29] Limewood_: There is also the smoker, Briony, if you want to cook faster.
[2:53:33] Electromagneticpulses: You potentially only need a few as long as you keep up with them but that's hard
[2:54:05] Arnhawl: Briony can just mass look at the endermen, no flowers needed bobsLAUGH
[2:54:18] Arnhawl: PIERRE EARPERS
[2:54:27] kacs_ky: I mean have you ever seen endermen fight the dragon, it's not that impressive
