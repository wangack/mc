[1:30:12] Legolad2099: Mousey is the Queen of GTA üòÅ
[1:30:13] MashoneAK: @CDawgVA lag in Minecraft is normally caused when people do lots of building and too many chunks stay loaded making the server load every placed entity i.e. every placed block.
[1:30:15] Iron_Wolf_Sicario: Geega and mouse are great in the RP
[1:30:15] kintdm: That is the next level

[1:30:41] KayNetsua: RP is what is put into it, if no effort is put in, it'll be boring. so if you want it to be exciting, make it exciting, thats the whole point
[1:30:42] DivonLost: where can i find a mod list for this server ?
[1:30:42] coldhank: Hey Connor! Where's Mousey
[1:30:44] yephimj: do the command to get back
[1:30:44] ray_tracer_: need better server for that
[1:30:46] just_eeee: Minecraft is not very optimised

[1:30:51] Van_Cross: Did Monke raided an ancient city yet?
[1:30:51] FrostyFire1000: You should watch AICandii on Onx, she has a crazy stalker and drama whilst being a dispatch for the police
[1:30:52] peanutt72: have you heard what happened to Mattpat üíî
[1:30:55] hellodisco: MC server builds are poorly optimised to begin with
[1:30:56] Agatharn: i feel bad for moussie she was so excited to show u around and adventure
[1:30:56] vic_maquina: Maybe too many mobs spawning
[1:30:57] YuioEa: minecraft as a basegame, is extremely unoptimized
[1:30:57] ChrisKriegs: @coldhank barthrom
[1:30:57] therealscarxg: @coldhank bathroom

[1:31:01] pituy_: @coldhank she went bathroom she'll be back
[1:31:02] gamt11: both do, it's a single threaded server so this always happens
[1:31:03] BottledWaduh: They eradicated birds cause they were causing lags too
[1:31:03] kyrogaming: Reseting helps clear the memory of what is loaded loke monsters ect to help with lag
[1:31:04] AJSHELL1: Because Java
[1:31:05] Malarapvp: I blame java
[1:31:06] Legolad2099: Might be TONS of Mods causing the Lag?
[1:31:06] phantasy_cat: easy solution is to just increase ram/cpu usage
[1:31:09] AnnemicLiempo: Its written in fucking Java
[1:31:10] WallBroBart: D:
[1:31:11] NickBM96: that's not necessarily true unless people are where the buildings are since the server unloads the chunks; more probably it's a mod pack memory leak
[1:31:13] coldhank: Ok
[1:31:13] Maiizuru: Dude im so sad about it
[1:31:14] MCReign: Sadge

[1:31:19] maT_568: biggest game in the world and they cant add 3 mobs
[1:31:20] gosb1t: I assume it's a RAM problem, maybe the server has not enough or it has not enough of it allocated or something like that
[1:31:20] Kazumasa_L: Sadge
[1:31:20] Hammerstrike81: Small indie owner, right? Who has ever heard of MicroSoft, anyways?
