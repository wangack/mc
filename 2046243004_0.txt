[0:25:29] lucyinawardrobe: @janshrut47 Happy Sunday, may it last forever
[0:25:35] GingerTheLily: @lucyinawardrobe I just checked, last time you were here was December 2022!  Hope your life has been good busy!
[0:25:37] LitesLAB: hi @gingerthelily hope you are well.
[0:25:47] GingerTheLily: @LitesLAB I am good thanks! pixlriPride pixlriPride
[0:26:08] lucyinawardrobe: @GingerTheLily jeez, scary how quickly time passes - it doesn't feel like that long!
[0:26:19] GingerTheLily: @lucyinawardrobe It really doesn't!
[0:26:41] rouleau36: oh no, the ship ran aground
[0:26:55] janshrut47: @rouleau36 Happy Sunday
[0:27:06] GingerTheLily: @rouleau36 maybe the ground ran aship?
[0:27:17] lucyinawardrobe: @GingerTheLily Things have been okay - up and down recently so falling back on some old comforts. Hope things have been good with you
[0:27:24] ValoreOG: Have you ever used AI to help with building or expanding/ writing lore?
[0:27:31] rouleau36: @gingerthelily lol right
[0:27:31] GingerTheLily: @lucyinawardrobe pretty good, thanks :D
[0:27:37] GingerTheLily: appreciates the thanks
[0:27:43] HelloAnrose: ground ran aship chewsiNotes
[0:27:45] ligthningstorm: vault key system is a good in my opinion but it could be better by give players different types of keys going up in rerates.
[0:28:10] rouleau36: The ship's anti-gravity engines took a chunk of earth with it.

[0:28:32] ValoreOG: How do you feel about certain content creators using AI for their content?
[0:28:32] linaben27: Is there lore about this boat?
[0:28:34] GingerTheLily: @Casperiuss Hello and welcome in!
[0:28:49] ktorn_: hey pix, why shield and not totem?
[0:29:29] kgnerd1: Shield with mending and unbreaking 3?
[0:29:41] snappyriffs: wjhen did you start
[0:29:54] DOG_THE_DOG: can you get on the boat without elytra?
[0:29:56] linaben27: Cool cool
[0:30:05] littleshirleybeans: to be fair, regurgitating info that's been previously given is taken for intelligence in many cases (school exams being one example)
[0:30:07] ValoreOG: Head cannon: it's Noah's ark after all the water evaporated
[0:30:10] ElmoDFZ: I think AI is very useful if you're struggling with ideas or how to do something (like creating a language learning plan in my case), as what it generates could then spark further ideas of your own
[0:30:14] littleshirleybeans: helloooooo all

[0:44:10] PumbbaGames: how ferm are you to redstone?
[0:44:11] rollc_at: I mean flying ships are somewhat not uncommon in Minecraft (the end, sometimes very weird overworld generation)
[0:44:21] LitesLAB: the roots need to be growable, like vines
[0:44:26] theicelandicpolitician09: it feels kinda silly making a lighthouse inland says the man making a giant ship behind a mountarin range inland
[0:44:35] Mr_Badger_Seth: Flip the lighthouse on it head and have built out from the underside of another floating island

[0:52:59] godspuce620: What if you name the ship after the artist
[0:53:05] the_witherer: @headstandingpenguin if it helps, use a bow to pick the little rascal off from afar
[0:53:17] littleshirleybeans: @godspuce620 The Greg

[0:53:53] LitesLAB: GSG… sounds like a weapon
[0:53:55] LitesLAB: lol

[0:54:39] missie_massacre: fromenteau is a type of grape
[0:54:54] GingerTheLily: yes, I just looked it up and got the grape too !
[0:54:57] littleshirleybeans: fromenty is a traditional midlands-ish dish popular in the 19th century, might be related, might not

[0:56:18] GingerTheLily: @rathgar1843 we don't want insects in out Pinot!
[0:57:35] LitesLAB: I would love if dirt turned to mud in the rain, and be harvestable, but would revert back to dirt when the rain stops.
[0:58:33] grimlord_07: wasnt this to be suspended in the air??
[0:58:34] skycruiser00: @LitesLAB then turn into clay?
[0:58:52] GingerTheLily: @grimlord_07 the island is, but we are on top of the island
[0:58:56] LitesLAB: @gopsalem yes @skycruiser00 no
[0:59:18] grimlord_07: ohhh missed that part
[0:59:19] headstandingpenguin: what's the current best level for redstone? same as diamonds?
[0:59:41] LitesLAB: Just think it would be a neat real life mechanic to introduce, something to get creative with as it were
[0:59:43] GingerTheLily: @headstandingpenguin I have got LOADS of resstone at diamond level
[0:59:43] godspuce620: No clue

[1:03:57] i_stim2muchhh: i literally just followed the video about floating islands, so its pretty  cool to see it. my first time trying one as well
[1:03:58] GingerTheLily: @gopsalem I just find the noises a pain!
[1:04:29] deadastronomer: Rounding the edges of the island would help i think
[1:04:45] rathgar1843: phantoms neet mechanic, and they had a use fixing elytra, more annoying then anything currently
[1:04:48] GingerTheLily: make it lumpier?
[1:04:52] theobamagaming1: how many ancient cities did you have to raid to get the silence trim? i got unlucky and had to raid 10
[1:05:04] namikofficial: So amazing from the mountains in front of the build.
[1:05:20] GingerTheLily: @gopsalem Traders sell villagers?
[1:05:28] deadastronomer: Yeah exactly!
[1:05:30] GingerTheLily: Oh wait, I read that wrong!
[1:05:44] littleshirleybeans: that's how i read it! that wandering traders ought to sell cartographer villagers

[1:06:48] headstandingpenguin: what's diamond mining level again? -56? I'm randomly finding iron at -58, possibly a  vein....  Regarding the topic, I would lobe more functionality for Minecarts and a wodcutter
[1:06:49] GingerTheLily: maybe spider webs as foam on the wave?
[1:07:23] GingerTheLily: I was thinbking of Bdubs massive waterfall
[1:07:26] prettygoodiguess: wandering trader carrying spawn eggs  around like villager pokeballs

[1:07:55] paperbird76: Would white glass work?
[1:08:14] yk_king_28: where is the entry going to be
[1:08:15] littleshirleybeans: actually, leaving aside the creepy undertones, that could be useful, given villager limitations now on things like librarian trades. the wandering trader could have a librarian from a different biome on one of his llamas (highly skilled migrant labour kinda deal)
[1:08:18] GingerTheLily: someone pranked our shopping district at Halloween with spider webs as TP-ing the shops
[1:08:27] rathgar1843: and water effects are strance for a sky ship.

[1:09:43] GingerTheLily: have a slime cannon to shoot you up
[1:09:45] jasper_186: effected by gravity that is
[1:10:19] littleshirleybeans: logically, the boat could be so high up that clouds catch on the mast, condense and then trickle down to form a little spout of water off the side of the island…
[1:10:28] Veisterios: lore can be adjusted for Minecraft builder in survival not to go mental :D
[1:10:51] rollc_at: I mean the whole island is floating, why would water being there be a problem?
[1:11:09] skycruiser00: Is this enderman proof?
[1:11:23] jasper_186: it might be that, with flowing water, you run into the issue of Where does it come from, but for a lake, it might be ok?
[1:11:26] nadztheothercat: who needs physics anyways
[1:11:26] Veisterios: @rollc_at he needs to make water from underneath the island to go up to sky limit :D

[2:01:28] RubyKobayashi: I havent catch up the survival guide joshsekiDed joshsekiSadge but what sparked this idea?
[2:01:33] namikofficial: Pix doesn't understand how talat
[2:01:48] namikofficial: Talented he is
[2:01:54] the_lucy_goosy: i love building, but i dont like anything i make, even if my friends say it looks amazing.

[2:02:54] borealislaura: One gets sick ofbstaring at the same thing for so long
[2:02:56] MaraudingBacon: @the_lucy_goosy this is incredibly common. its called creative bias and every one suffers from it

[2:03:05] Valois_Fulcanelli: We see our mistakes, and the fact that we wanted it to look like X but it looks like Y. Whereas other people say, "Wow, I really love that Y!"
[2:03:05] missie_massacre: artists of any kind just see their mistakes
[2:03:25] parszan: dont think i ever "decided" to be a builder, I was just so bad at everything else
