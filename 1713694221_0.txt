[2:20:28] kDesta: ^ I think that works as well.
[2:20:46] MojoAI: idk if it'd help but i think you can use +/- to zoom your minimap

[2:28:41] Crona_Steingate: yup
[2:28:49] thenarratorzero: Now we have to find, a new end trader.
[2:28:50] ThePerplexedBard: The more you know
[2:29:00] azSyllus: lesson learned: always hold on to your wood
[2:29:11] Crona_Steingate: now you can bring him with you
[2:29:23] BethFreemanArtist: The pasta works eh?
[2:29:30] ThePerplexedBard: @crona_steingate have you seen Erased yet?
[2:29:34] GiantRedSquirrel: you can get a lot of emerald for cobble
[2:29:37] BethFreemanArtist: The shells are broken up though my bad lol
[2:29:43] Spagooglio: @Crona_Steingate you saying like push the boat home?
[2:30:12] Crona_Steingate: no Spagoo he can paddle the boat
[2:30:13] Bigdaddyjuggalo: That mod pack have carry on mod?
[2:30:16] SeamusMalarkey: @RoboBlake in your own time ofcourse, than we'll talk about Chapterhouse, lol
[2:30:17] kDesta: Mark him on the map so you don't forget. xD
[2:30:23] Spagooglio: @Crona_Steingate oh right boats can hold two people now
[2:30:27] SplatterDoll: if this works though you can do it next time
[2:30:31] TrystnS: Set the poor lad free
[2:30:34] ThePerplexedBard: @bethfreemanartist its good, now he cant choke on the shells
[2:30:47] BethFreemanArtist: If I had a laptop near I‚Äôd jump on and bring wood to you ll
[2:30:55] RoboBlake: LMAO
[2:30:57] iconicbear: randomly getting those enchants will be easier than 24 netherite in a lot of modpacks
[2:31:12] Crona_Steingate: I don't remember it Bard so it I did, i'd have to rewatch it
[2:31:16] RoboBlake: so many conversations going on
[2:31:17] Sekhcellent: damn
[2:31:25] whiskrzz: gassyMAD
[2:31:27] BethFreemanArtist: This pasta sauce with less viscosity would be great for a Mexican lasgne
[2:31:27] GiantRedSquirrel: he was an end goblin so you might see him again .... in the end
[2:31:29] kDesta: I think the only way to get those enchants in Medieval is from the Goblins.
[2:31:41] ThePerplexedBard: @crona_steingate its good and is about time travel stuff
[2:31:42] Crona_Steingate: right now i'm watching SEVEN KNIGHTS REVOLUTION
[2:31:50] MadsBray: @bethfreemanartist or chicken
[2:32:13] kDesta: But yeah, goblins spawn pretty easily so hopefully you get another good End Goblin Trader.
[2:32:47] MojoAI: can you zoom in on your minimap w/ + so you can see things near you better?
[2:33:00] Dopiestshark: fairly
[2:33:03] kDesta: It's a pain.
[2:33:05] WDForty: it's pretty rare in vanilla
[2:33:06] Mostly_Games: not easy
[2:33:06] Dopiestshark: it's pretty damn difficult
[2:33:06] CletusBueford: !mods
[2:33:07] Wudar: !evo
[2:33:07] SombrerBOT: https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/medieval-mc-fabric
[2:33:16] DirtyboyXL: on... through... the... never
[2:33:21] kDesta: But when you get to the End, it's much easier to get.
[2:33:21] iconicbear: the yield is also pretty low from ore to netherite bars
[2:33:24] Wudar: !eco
[2:33:24] ThePerplexedBard: I think its pretty had usually
[2:33:24] SombrerBOT: ECO IS BACK! On January 22nd Eco will return for another season! Have questions? Looking for more info on the server? Check out the announcements in the TLS discord! https://discord.gg/4mgX6Bdy9R
[2:33:27] XellosMetallum: hard
[2:33:39] MojoAI: it's easier if you mine using beds as they explode when you try sleeping in them in the nether
[2:33:45] azSyllus: @CletusBueford, what'll you be building in eco?
[2:33:49] Honeybadger3: how is the pasta?
[2:33:49] SplatterDoll: FeelsBadMan
[2:34:01] WDForty: netherite spawns in pretyt small groups
[2:34:09] Sekhcellent: gasp
[2:34:09] mopp789: U look for ancient debris in the nether to make netherrigt
[2:34:11] MadsBray: üî•üî•
[2:34:14] WDForty: and far apart
[2:34:14] Dopiestshark: like i had gotten enough ancient debris before having to give up the search because of being surrounded by a metric ton of lava
[2:34:24] Dopiestshark: for only like 3 netherite ingots
[2:34:28] Honeybadger3: gives it that depth NODDERS
[2:34:31] ThePerplexedBard: Dont focus on things you couldnt have and enjoy the things you have
[2:34:42] WDForty: no idea
[2:34:51] mopp789: Ya
[2:34:51] Sekhcellent: I love when food accidentally gets better
[2:34:52] Dopiestshark: because for netherite ingots, it require 4 gold ingots and 4 netherite pieces
[2:34:57] ThePerplexedBard: @bethfreemanartist do you have the recipe?
[2:35:03] Dopiestshark: blast furnace?
[2:35:07] MadsBray: day 2 pasta is the best
[2:35:26] Dopiestshark: i dont think so. but unless it's a specially modded blast furnace
[2:35:29] Honeybadger3: this stream sponsored by Pasta NODDERS
[2:35:36] MadsBray: lol
[2:35:38] itsLeels: NODDERS
[2:35:41] whiskrzz: gassyAD
[2:35:41] HorreC: is it true that burke took these days off so he could travel with willy to tuck him in two more times before he said goodbye?
[2:35:45] Dopiestshark: because in vanilla blast furnaces are only used for making regular gear into 1 single ingot
[2:35:47] MadsBray: everyone is having it tonight lol
[2:36:05] ThePerplexedBard: @horrec I could believe it
[2:36:25] Dopiestshark: so like 1 iron chest plate piece of armor
[2:36:32] Dopiestshark: that would only get you 1 iron ingot
[2:36:33] kDesta: Modded blast furnace. This modpack uses Mythic Metals.
[2:36:34] Dopiestshark: for some reason
[2:36:36] mopp789: The odds to find 1 peace of ancient debris is 1/15000
[2:36:48] Raphiezar: Will Beth enjoy Star Trek TNG, or has she already seen it?
[2:36:50] kDesta: It's a pretty nice mod that lets you make alloys.
[2:36:57] Dopiestshark: then. it should indeed get more
[2:37:16] Dopiestshark: just. i would bring a really good heavily enchanted pickaxe
[2:37:23] Honeybadger3: needs stairs lol
[2:37:23] RoboBlake: LMAO
[2:37:23] ThePerplexedBard: I think there is a way to do that but idk
[2:37:32] WDForty: you can make an enchanting table and gamba for enchants and put them into books
[2:37:33] RoboBlake: you said it max
[2:37:53] Dopiestshark: just it would require like level 30 to get the proper enchantments
[2:37:59] WDForty: this is a very convoluted path
[2:38:06] kDesta: Lapis and EXP
[2:38:11] WDForty: yup
[2:38:12] angryflash: book, bookshelves, xp and lapis
[2:38:14] Honeybadger3: ye
[2:38:14] ThePerplexedBard: I want to get an axolotl
[2:38:15] RedDogMT: lapis, XP, and a book
[2:38:16] Dopiestshark: just lapis and xp
[2:38:17] WDForty: and a book to put it into
[2:38:23] GiantRedSquirrel: a lot of levels and lapis
[2:38:23] Dopiestshark: if you put a book into it
[2:38:23] WDForty: or enchant directly to an item
[2:38:32] rehvolutionz: "Made for a goblin" reminds me of going to his house to help with the fire and not being able to fit. KEKW
[2:38:34] Dopiestshark: but you can also just directly put your equipment into it
[2:38:41] asadachi99: in some mod packs there is a printing press to copy enchants
[2:38:42] CorporalPibb: books are better
[2:39:06] WDForty: yea you have a bunch of books you're not doing anything with
[2:39:07] Dopiestshark: oh yeah
[2:39:08] MadsBray: the more you know üåà
[2:39:26] Dopiestshark: for better enchantments. you need a metric ton of book cases surrounding the enchantment table
[2:39:33] Raphiezar: tayAngy üåà
[2:39:44] MadsBray: lol
[2:39:47] Dopiestshark: or at least for a higher chance for better enchantments
[2:39:48] RoboBlake: gassyHI @Raphiezar
[2:39:53] AltraWolf: its the dark souls 2 music again,  makes me wanna play it but I dont wanna lol
[2:39:54] mopp789: The table is 2 diamonds 3 obsidian and 1 book to make the enchanting table
[2:40:01] WDForty: not that many
[2:40:04] RedDogMT: like 16 book cases
[2:40:07] WDForty: but yea, you surround it
[2:40:08] Raphiezar: @RoboBlake gassyHI
[2:40:13] WDForty: on all 4 sides
[2:40:16] mopp789: 22 bookcases
[2:40:22] RedDogMT: 22?
[2:40:43] Dopiestshark: no but. the amount of leather and paper and in vanilla you need oak wood specifically
[2:40:44] wsmall99: have they changed it? it used to be 15 which you can stack easily on 3 sides.
[2:41:07] mopp789: For level 30 u need 22 Bookcases
[2:41:16] Dopiestshark: i always go with cover the floor in book cases. cover the roof
[2:41:18] Honeybadger3: D:
[2:41:19] Dopiestshark: then go with every wall
[2:41:23] This_Guy_rEd: 15 bookcases stacked on three sides of the enchant table to get level 30 enchants
[2:41:41] wsmall99: yes.
[2:41:48] WDForty: ok, it was 3 sides, i forgot

[3:40:30] azSyllus: ChatGPT: Drinking feta cheese brine may have some potential side effects, such as an upset stomach or diarrhea, due to the high salt content. Additionally, if the brine is not properly stored or has been contaminated, it may also cause food poisoning. It's important to note that feta cheese brine is not intended to be consumed as a beverage and it is not safe for regular consumption.
[3:40:33] azSyllus: sounds about right
[3:40:35] BethFreemanArtist: They can make up for it with the sun goal KEKW
