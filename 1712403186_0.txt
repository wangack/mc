[3:51:20] BethFreemanArtist: Can you play briefly with the dogs soon too to knacker them out lol
[3:51:42] MojoAI: idk if it'd help, but with some item tool tips running off-screen, turning the GUI scale down a notch may help fit it on screen (just a suggestion)
[3:52:05] 14neo: holding us hostage monkaS

[3:58:52] CapnSlipp: The shock powder is an artifact that can be used to stun nearby enemies for a certain amount of seconds, depending on the Power Level of the item. As stated in the description for this item, it is useful for escaping difficult situations, such as large crowds of enemies. It has a cooldown of 15 seconds, which can be shortened with certain armor sets and the Cool Down enchantment.
[3:59:36] CapnSlipp: Some of these items are derived from other games, this one is named after the item in Minecraft Dungeons (the top-down arcadey game).
[3:59:54] CapnSlipp: So that’s the description from MC: Dungeons, but I assume the item in this mod is similar.
[4:00:06] 14neo: Ahh, good info Capn
[4:00:21] bambam22blue: hi there!
[4:00:27] madugami: What are your goals for this minecraft run?

[4:01:43] WDForty: there is lightening in vanilla
[4:01:53] davidblain82: gassyHI
[4:01:55] CapnSlipp: In my experience, the hardest, most elusive, and valuable thing in vanilla Minecraft: A librarian villager who’ll sell you Mending books.
[4:02:03] GODHlMSELF: Craft things, maybe mine a little bit
[4:02:04] GODHlMSELF: you know
[4:02:27] madugami: Ohk sweet
[4:02:32] CapnSlipp: I’ve been playing on the same Minecraft save file for 10 years (about a week or 2 a year), and have yet to find a Mending librarian.
[4:03:13] CapnSlipp: I generally just backup once a year, when I upgrade a major version.
[4:03:13] ok_juju: going to sleep see you later  have a nice stream chat and gassy will catch the vod later ijpHI

[4:03:46] 14neo: @ok_juju adios gassyBRO ijpCOMFY
[4:03:53] Tpocket: what if in the divorce they took the minecraft save
[4:04:48] CrimsonRaven86: CrimsonRaven86 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 43 months! 
[4:04:52] Camshot4: @Tpocket lawyer up
[4:04:54] SombrerBOT: Did you know Max has a new video up? Go check it out here! SCPs Are Scary! (SCP: Secret Laboratory Shenanigans) https://youtu.be/_K5TGfNzP4U
[4:05:00] CapnSlipp: It’s often a server running on my home computer.  Right now, it’s on a Linode host, but I have a slightly older copy of all the save files on my external drive too.
[4:06:11] 14neo: @CapnSlipp i've never found one either - but i thought there was a mechanism to make villagers into Librarians, and then remove the 'Librarian' trait from them? Or is that just a modded thing?
[4:06:14] BigRigGamez: minecraft java doesnt like the controller support mod a whole lot
[4:06:25] 14neo: i wonder if the gleaming feathers can be used for making arrows haha, otherwise nahh
[4:06:42] 14neo: exactly
[4:06:50] lonewander1998: pretty sure they are just like torches
[4:07:07] ShaiHulud66: they dont craft into anything?
[4:07:20] CapnSlipp: @14neo Yeah, I may have to resort to that.  I try to play semi-blind, only looking up general stuff on the wiki not specific ways to build things, but I may give in and min-max it.
[4:08:23] CapnSlipp: @14neo I’m more inclined to build a giant library in my town with a couple dozen librarians living inside— like a monastery.  I like it when the mechanics match the fiction.
[4:08:37] 14neo: @CapnSlipp Ooo, that could be fun
