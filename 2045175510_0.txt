[2:03:30] lorddelea: dinner
[2:03:43] OmIAm: Jonbams, you don't need a spray tan, you need less cancer fear and more vitamin D from the sun.
[2:03:47] brawlin_mando: Libtards is another good one

[2:10:53] Anullmentor: @JonBams you might want to rethink about moving to luxenburg : When planning to buy real estate in Luxembourg, expect that the average price per square meter ranges from 7,000 to 15,000 euros. A one-room apartment in the central part of the capital can cost up to 500,000 euros, and a three-room apartment - about 1,000,000 euros.
