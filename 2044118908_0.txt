[1:01:54] vincesola: The point he was trying to make, which he failed horrible to do, was that the actor/writer strike killed the 2024 slate. And the reason for the dropped stock prices was due to that Not because of the company itself. And that with the 900 million of capital that was raised last year,                      AMC is going to make it through it all.

[2:20:48] monkeyharhar69: Can you do a row of glass one below the droppers and outer hoppers?
[2:20:57] slackertron: honey  blocks
[2:21:08] ktorn_: item filter
[2:21:14] Gelzer: Vacuum hoppers
[2:21:20] BubbleGuts32: @jonbams Just do an Item sorter for the straggler buckets where the empty Iron buckets drop have them separate to their different storage areas
[2:21:32] slackertron: yeah its transparent so you are fine

[2:25:33] rockeva: u had honey to try and lock ur council in place

[2:25:44] knockinpistols: would a minecart with a chest not collect that for you?
[2:25:49] RealWickedBrew: Cheer200 Wouldn't it work closer to 100% if you picked up the lava on the way back out too? Am I the dent head here?
[2:25:53] Idifee: Stinkfoot
[2:26:01] Benhoolio_: Zappa lyrics?

[2:26:38] stevenseagal101: They need a minecart bucket that you can load and itll suck up water or lava in buckets
[2:26:49] slackertron: its a transparent block you pass through it
[2:26:51] wheaties2k2: @JonBams can't you just put glass around the outside of the farm to keep the empties in?
[2:27:18] goudacheeseburgers: full buckets are non stackable
[2:27:20] slackertron: its a transparent block you pass through it
[2:27:30] somelucky_: yeah, transparent blocks don't hurt

[2:28:31] just_cro: the world is about having all farms not using them to be fair
[2:28:34] 4tw0ne: it would be even funnier to have this whole farm built above a lava ocean in the nether :)
[2:28:56] DBKynd: Donk is the name of the dude in Crocodile Dundee in the bar with the beer on his head

[2:53:05] wheaties2k2: @JonBams waterlog that and let the waterfall go right through it
[2:53:11] connor_assassin5: iCup?
[2:53:16] jerrythomas55: looks off center

[2:53:56] jerrythomas55: I’m too hungry to think about it
[2:54:00] sarosa25: @jonbams put chains from the top so at least it looks like it’ll lower
[2:54:09] Skyhoshi: the tower to hold the pistons would need to be at least 2 times as tall as the lift.
[2:54:12] ytbtank: HANG LANTERNS ON THE BOTTOM ON PLATFORM

[2:54:53] RealWickedBrew: Good point @connor_assassin5
[2:55:03] 4tw0ne: bubble columns not good enough for this entrance? Or still working on framing before that?
[2:55:04] DeadlyYaeger: Only good thing about bedrock is that slab is not full block and lets light go through. So when I have big projects, all light source blocks are hidden and whole space is lit
[2:55:20] Gelzer: Need to go play some flight simulator
[2:55:28] wheaties2k2: water column down from the ceiling opening. Let it pass right through your platform in the center @JonBams
[2:55:31] alomantic_copper: shoutout to @sarosa25
[2:55:34] RealWickedBrew: @4tw0ne think we are still at drywall phase

[2:56:12] 4tw0ne: thats fair. maybe just a ladder for that area under the trap doow
[2:56:16] jerrythomas55: bamPEG
[2:56:18] saygentheragincajun: soul laterns don’t fit the vibe

[2:57:11] wheaties2k2: water column down from the ceiling opening. Let it pass right through your platform in the center @JonBams
[2:57:11] saygentheragincajun: “secret” entrances

[2:57:28] hardlined: cave entrance behind the waterfall
[2:57:30] Trucker_Torpedo: Bubble  elevator from under the trapdoor @JonBams
[2:57:34] Saulted: mobs don't go down through scaffold and it can be waterlogged
[2:57:55] b_r_a_y: could go up and down through the turn offs of the temple
[2:58:03] CherriKushBearE: you just need a Pool to fall into you don't need a Down column
[2:58:08] wheaties2k2: @JonBams waterfall down through that opening. Let it pass through your platform
[2:58:08] ytbtank: @JonBams UOU CAN WALK BEHIND THE WATER FOUNTAINS
