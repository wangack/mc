[0:14:09] HostileLogOut: why would they be scared of Apple?
[0:14:18] HostileLogOut: Apples headset is far out of reach
[0:14:19] banshay3: that controller less control has to be adapted to other headsets
[0:14:33] ninopanda: the Quest 3 is going to have a lot of the same shit the vision pro has on it
[0:14:39] R1Rider01: ski goggles
[0:14:45] StardustDragon08: I mean most headsets look dumb when wearing them KEKW
[0:14:45] ba_nanananananana: did they test the hand control thing with black people or
[0:14:46] FingerGames: thefly45Tffmad

[0:15:38] mainG__: widepeepoHappy dads live
[0:15:38] HostileLogOut: lets not forget that this headset will overheat like hell
[0:15:46] weppet: the eyes projected in front look so unbelievably stupid
[0:15:56] BeepBop94: With Mkbhd after hands on it seems quite impressive
[0:16:00] CasualCooky: I won't be using it anyway it's not for me Seemsg
[0:16:02] GandalfTheGrump: how much do the prescription lenses cost? i wear glasses so am i looking at 4k base?
[0:16:05] iceberg271: Gooood Morning Waffle!! waffleHey wafflePizza
[0:16:08] DJ_ZG: it tracks the eye

[0:16:19] R1Rider01: what if i have a lazy eye?
[0:16:20] banshay3: he gets to it in a sec
[0:16:26] Sanduckchan: well.. they asked 1000 bucks for a fkin metal stand.. so i dont even suprised about 3.5k for this
[0:16:30] vladutzul123: eye tracking will be a wet dream for advertisers
[0:16:38] WolfKnight85: Ironman
[0:16:39] ba_nanananananana: "but it's an apple product so i call it magic even tho it's just technology"
[0:17:01] Sanduckchan: imagine the ad keeps floating where you're looking :D
[0:17:07] warcake: "look at the mcdonalds logo for 30 seconds to continue"
[0:17:08] usernameNull: wait until they make you look at the ad for it to go away
[0:17:11] ninopanda: and your iris scanners
[0:17:15] OddsTV: if Apples first gen of a product stops that tracking, you know its a problem

[0:17:21] StardustDragon08: @ba_nanananananana it's called marketing
[0:17:26] banshay3: didn't they claim that this is hidden in the system of the thing and not available to third parties?
[0:17:26] Slender209: is it not locked behind the enclave
[0:17:32] Francisco_Scaramanga: 20 years to late
[0:17:32] 0x000000: just wear shades 4Head
[0:17:35] sam1390: Apple said it was only done on device and apps don't have access to that

[0:17:41] TioJay_PR: ads tattooed on ass & tits
[0:17:42] ohbi78: he brings that advert up
[0:17:46] thisisjdavis: i thought they said eye tracking is on a separate thread or something so apps can't access it
[0:17:46] 514484: creating the path to dystopia, this is why i am not interested in "high"-tech
[0:17:51] ohbi78: with the same concerns
[0:17:53] Chris_Cross_Crash: Just get some for your kids. Problem solved Kappa
[0:17:57] noxiiiouse: just like the movie minority report from tom cruise @Giantwaffle
[0:17:58] Tabakhase: @banshay3 for the normal webbrowsing context yea ... native apps may be whole nother deal
[0:18:00] weppet: eh i don't care too much, it's inevitable anyways
[0:18:04] Hitoearth: NotLikeThis
[0:18:08] DanologyUK: @squeezeyo It has Apple Arcade and will allow controllers to connect via bluetooth
[0:18:12] isfil: @Giantwaffle 20 years ago it was unthinkable to give that much of privacy but look at us now
[0:18:12] banshay3: @banshay3 I guess we'll see when the sdk opens up
[0:18:15] AdamMcAdamson: Boil the frog
[0:18:20] ba_nanananananana: you youngins have no idea how the internet used to be.
[0:18:21] officialhunterx: i just want it for theater mode

[0:19:28] ba_nanananananana: "You did not read this 500 page EULA. Read it or else"

[0:20:17] Deystan: waffleHmm
[0:20:17] Vargh: yes?
[0:20:18] kenshin2666: @TheApiculturist thats it, the dudes name was Albi or something and they were FORCED to watch ads
[0:20:19] DanologyUK: Yes
[0:20:23] ajdtalon: They did.
[0:20:24] BeepBop94: Both options
[0:20:24] CorSPACE: ya its both
[0:20:25] DanologyUK: Yes they did
[0:20:26] GoatXYZ: you can do both
[0:20:27] Kellorian: they did a keyboard
[0:20:27] ajdtalon: Probably has both.
[0:20:29] vladutzul123: it's probably similar to the laser projected keyboard
[0:20:29] authorized411: he just said you can
[0:20:30] Dr_McCarthy: they did NODDERS

[0:21:00] Moobot: You can sub to Waffle by clicking this neat link -> twitch.tv/giantwaffle/subscribe SUBprise
[0:21:01] OddsTV: maybe he meant look at the keyboard, click fingers over the keys you want to press
[0:21:08] weppet: that kind of keyboard is terrible, no way it's the main method
[0:21:10] Sanduckchan: you have the apple vr keyboard for 599$
[0:21:14] GandalfTheGrump: @kenshin2666 yea you either pay credits to skip it or you need to watch it to make it go away. whole idea was the idea that you cant skip everything or you would have no money. and the whole idea behind bad food costs verylittle but good food is really expensive.
[0:21:16] kenshin2666: imagine they make you BUY the virtual keyboard, separately KEKW
[0:21:22] authorized411: tops of your hands probably get in the way of the sensors for typing
[0:21:22] BeepBop94: YOu can use a normal bluetooth keyboard with pass through
[0:21:28] FingerGames: add 4 more cameras for keyboard
[0:21:42] ohbi78: same with the laser keyboards

[0:23:17] Xev_00: I'm sure there will be ways to display whatever you want on the outside

[0:23:17] ba_nanananananana: they missed the opportunity to remove that outside screen yes

[0:25:00] Chris_Cross_Crash: Programming in VR KEKW
[0:25:00] 514484: my PC is better for 1/3 the cost EZ
[0:25:01] OddsTV: with a 2 hour battery life yeah right
[0:25:01] Beufff: better than my 10k apple pc?
[0:25:03] Math354e: the tv i can see it would be better
[0:25:05] MinusKills: and its a little expensive KEKW
[0:25:05] ToxicAWOL_TV: @Giantwaffle My Laptop and TV are worth $2500... HUH

[0:25:11] byrd3242: all it will take is some rich goobers and then the apple sheep herd will follow
[0:25:12] BeepBop94: Its an eco system thing. Apple products dont replace products
[0:25:14] Speedkill3r: The extra monitors would make it great for a macbook
[0:25:16] HostileLogOut: 2 hour lifetime is not gonna get you anywhere lol
[0:25:31] weppet: tv can also be used by more people at once
[0:25:32] authorized411: in social situations people want to see other people
[0:25:33] Sanduckchan: no-one thought that having only one screen in your car can replace your whole instrument clusters and panels 🤷
[0:25:33] Smithii: @Giantwaffle You still need your watch to track....  movement.... Kappa
[0:25:36] TheeSouleater: It's crazy but what if this is your intro to two f those. Like what if this is your first tv and or pc. Like thats where we could be in 5-10 years

[0:26:01] HostileLogOut: there is no Revolution is a Devolution
[0:26:05] thisisbrad: what if it also replaces your need for a house to hold TV etc, live in a 5th element shoebox instead $$$ stonks
[0:26:12] Satic: Mmm I love me some T9 typing
[0:26:16] Bigbenzi: its a revolution if your aim is to look like an absolute dork
[0:26:18] journey_in_ai: dynamic land is pretty novel
[0:26:26] CoolReal: That's me :)
[0:26:28] Jack_Snack_: I'm a developer, gimme Kappa

[0:26:29] StardustDragon08: @Bigbenzi so like most tech
[0:26:31] Chris_Cross_Crash: Remember Google Glass?
[0:26:54] HeyAFrozenZebra: But like for iPhone, the general public didn’t pick it up till the iPhone 3
[0:27:00] CorSPACE: twitch got a shout out in the keynote
[0:27:04] ba_nanananananana: it's not worth the money to develop this for the 100 users who will watch Twitch on this
[0:27:05] GoatXYZ: sit in a theater with other people wearing the headset
[0:27:05] banshay3: but twitch chat already pops out
[0:27:10] philipkatis: Multiple streams would also be cool.
[0:27:10] michaelbelgium: apple products only compatible with apple products, forget twitch/sideloading/custom apps lol
[0:27:11] authorized411: Stream Extensions on Extensions on Extensions
[0:27:14] SailorWS: and emote window
[0:27:15] jawnythompson: imagine if you could cuddle streamer in vr <3
[0:27:16] Deranged_Player: @chris_cross_crash the one everyone disliked lmao
[0:27:20] Tabakhase: so open your 3d-safari twice KEKW
[0:27:25] Schb3rg: fixed positioning Pog
[0:27:26] TechNaOkami: grid of streams and as you look at other streams the audio switches
[0:27:27] TheodenArratay: more expensive than a fully decked gaming pc in my region KEKW
[0:27:28] spexs_5: imagine having a 2hr battery with the extension
[0:27:29] StardustDragon08: @michaelbelgium so why is there a twitch app in the app store?????
[0:27:31] Chris_Cross_Crash: @Deranged_Player Yep KEKW
[0:27:32] ba_nanananananana: imagine you could just place screens in your living room and play streams on that
[0:27:33] FingerGames: too much work
[0:27:34] cager1233: yeah but it still wont have 7tv so its useless lololol
[0:27:36] Ryanpete4: I wonder if you can have multiple screens up at a time, like a stream on the side and a tv show
[0:27:37] Speedkill3r: Im actually considering getting this if the quality for mac monitor extension is good...
[0:27:37] BeepBop94: If they open the face tracking APIs the face tracking is impressive
[0:27:38] TheodenArratay: 2hr battery KEKW
[0:27:40] OddsTV: have multiple streams up at once in your space, like watching a world first race
[0:27:45] Tidalllwave: how much is it
[0:27:45] lord__pasqual: we're at exploration step of what VR can be integrated to and with
[0:27:46] Yizzles: I'd want FFZ/BTTV/7TV to work with the app
[0:27:47] roky696: @Giantwaffle fintech :P
[0:27:50] 514484: also it's apple, what is it compatible with? only apple shit?
[0:27:50] hiddenredacted: People will grind their ass once they see how cool it is.
[0:27:52] Deranged_Player: @chris_cross_crash I tried it for a few days, and it was interesting to say the least
[0:28:00] Mandorake: you know apple doesnt want peoplet ouching their tech
[0:28:00] Francisco_Scaramanga: they got to have an ac adapter
[0:28:02] skignas: aint battery external
[0:28:04] authorized411: being first to do something is worth it
[0:28:04] weppet: i wonder if you can increase the video size so that it looks cinema-sized inside the vr set
[0:28:05] ba_nanananananana: OddsTV yeah I have that with multiple screens, didn't cost 3500
[0:28:13] KuramaTheF0X: you can only plug in a cable to charge it and not use the battery
[0:28:15] FingerGames: 1st gen KEKW
[0:28:17] TechNaOkami: does it not have an internal batterie also?
[0:28:17] BeepBop94: He says there is a USB C input on the battery so you can continue to use and charge
[0:28:18] Nafurie: or its becouse its not done
[0:28:19] cager1233: @Yizzles i dont think it would because it's kind of similar to a phone in the sense of you cant have chrome extension on apps, if that makes sense but who knows
[0:28:26] Chris_Cross_Crash: They did mention the price
[0:28:29] banshay3: you can plug in a cable to the batters
[0:28:30] Chimpulse: I'm not going to feel one way or another about this product till actual reviews drop
[0:28:30] TheodenArratay: $4k paperweight KEKW
[0:28:30] authorized411: on GMA this morning Tim Cook said each eye is over 4K
[0:28:31] banshay3: battery
[0:28:32] Zohaas: @Giantwaffle To be fair, this is Apple, and they HATE talking hard specs
[0:28:32] CorSPACE: but the headset has a small battery
[0:28:32] KuramaTheF0X: yea get rekt KEKW
[0:28:33] OddsTV: @ba_nanananananana obviously
[0:28:34] hiddenredacted: 5 minutes who?
[0:28:40] Bigbenzi: I mean 100% proprietary battery pack
[0:28:40] 8R00KS: You can plug the battery in and keep using it
[0:28:45] Grimholde: The first plasmas were ridiculously priced and people bought them. Everything that’s ever changing costs so much and then it all comes down and becomes mainstream.
[0:28:46] KuramaTheF0X: yea thats how it is
[0:28:47] 8R00KS: thats how it works
[0:28:48] thisisjdavis: he talks about it in a minute
[0:28:49] banshay3: yes he says you can do that
[0:28:51] skignas: just watch video
[0:28:52] BeepBop94: Thats what MKBHD say you can do
[0:28:52] Redvlurpee: pass thru bat is best
[0:28:53] GoatXYZ: There has to be some small internal battery - because isn't it magsafe?
[0:28:55] Nafurie: yeees
[0:28:55] banshay3: watch the video
[0:29:00] lord__pasqual: people need to realise in the presentation is what they want it to do, when they will decide to manufacture it, it will be completely different
[0:29:00] Moobot: You can find Waffle's Youtube channel here - https://youtube.com/giantwaffle
[0:29:01] Bbluess: watch the video

[0:31:06] orangelabrador: She has a team of like 25 just on the glass.
[0:31:08] spexs_5: NODDERS one of the buildings at apple has that ufo in it fo sho
[0:31:09] Senrian: I work in an outsourcing game company where we do FQA and coding support to game devs and its the same here
[0:31:09] Schb3rg: or when they "lose" a new prototype KEKW
[0:31:10] silentscope306: patents are public, so not much of a leak

[0:44:21] HostileLogOut: @thisisbrad i rather have a Varjo.
[0:44:22] DanologyUK: @Ryanpete4 Your phone gets hot because the battery is getting hot in your phone. When charging the heatset, the battery is external so i dont see the headset getting hotter

[1:43:02] heymarkhansen: peepoHmm
[1:43:02] Dresden71: if top left of 4 was bomb then u cant have the 1 to the top right of it, otherwise 4 would be 5
[1:43:03] MrSilverMatch: right of Top Left 3 isn't a bomb
[1:43:05] RoninStorm: how many bombs left? put down that many and see if it satisfies
[1:43:06] フリクリ: @TonyT475 mb then the 1 would be a 2. i misspoke
[1:43:08] prelk0: now you can solve it with proces of eliminations.. 2 bomb in left corner 3 bomb near 3 nad 3 bomb left (1 need to be next to right corner)

[1:43:38] フリクリ: @TonyT475 i think ur right
[1:43:42] boppbippitybup: 1 with flag on top of it means below 1 is no bomb
[1:43:42] Apocalypto07: if thats a bomb you cant statisfy the 1 to the top right
[1:43:42] Dresden71: 1 to the top of right GURANTEES ITS NOT BOMB
[1:43:42] kuba_91: you should pick a tile near 1 on the right side, you have 67% to pick correct

[1:50:53] trabadam: top row , beteen 1 and 3 is safe ?

[1:51:04] adogkills: Look at how many bomb are left when you put a flag it the square. Near the left with the 1’s
[1:51:04] Saketas: remove the last 2 you jsut put
[1:51:05] punkgeek: Use the right side of the 50/50 instead
[1:51:06] rollen123: Yesterday I left with minesweeper and today I join with minesweeper. I like this modpack
[1:51:07] babyaddalyn: left above 3 cannot be a bom cause you cant satisfy 1 above to left it has to be on the right

[1:51:07] AdamMcAdamson: Try r
[1:51:09] MrSilverMatch: flip the  last ones
[1:51:09] TimTheEnchanter15: top middle of the 6 is guaranteed safe right? @Giantwaffle
[1:51:09] Saketas: And put it above right 3
[1:51:09] NephilimXS: in none of your possible solutions the space between 1 and 3 is never factored, that's your safest bet to new information
[1:51:10] captain_chew: the middle one between the 1 and 3 is safe
[1:51:11] Mico027: There's a 3rd partten
[1:51:12] MatthewDubs: top row middle slot is safe
[1:51:12] JaySkinny: Above the 2 in left corner is guaranteed no bomb
[1:51:12] Mrtastybottom1: Guess a 50/50 on the left side and then you can solve the rest
[1:51:12] c4l89: it is solvable. the trick is to find out what suare CAN NOT be a bomb.
[1:51:12] blizzardmagic: middle between the 1 and 3 on back wall is save
[1:51:13] Xerexos_: wait y'all still doin this pepeLaugh
[1:51:17] RoninStorm: over the two 3's is wrong
[1:51:17] Mikto1000: just remove those last two and place it above the 3
[1:51:17] Rhink: Start all the way from the left and solve from where the ? is. Then swap ? to the second block and solve from there. Count ending bombs.
[1:51:18] bigfrank23183: Wheres the bombe count
[1:51:22] Saketas: Good

[2:42:22] usernameNull: when you order a computer, it is insured
[2:42:22] Jibbur: not perishable, but fragile
[2:42:23] Noblez_: Perishable enough
[2:42:23] jmm548: monday chatters joined tuesdays chat LUL
[2:42:25] kenshin2666: you arent eating it  KEKW
[2:42:26] thethurst_: Shipped my 3090 without in insurance
[2:42:28] QaptainGeebs: insurance is just spreading out risk, many people are OK with the risk so don't insure
[2:42:29] BADboiz_TV: fragile
[2:42:34] silv: just lock it in a bank vault??
[2:42:35] Jeraa122: a literal piece of cardboard lmao
[2:42:37] BringBackLucky: a print Kappa
[2:42:39] OddsTV: bro sending a mobo for repair the insurance to send through UPS cost more than the board
[2:42:40] kenshin2666: fair enough, i take that back LUL
[2:42:41] Grimholde: Common sense.
[2:42:44] Rhink: Wonder what the nutritional value of cardboard is...
[2:42:46] BattleRedHTX: Insurance just feels like the mob
[2:42:46] vistage: Now that I think of it the ring would be the only card in history that would not need to be graded @giantwaffle
[2:42:47] boogerbomb01: I imagine the insurance makes it take 6 months of paperwork to end up denying your claim
[2:42:50] FuzzyPomPoms: Personal article policy’s actually are extremely cheap and pay out for the most stupid reasons
[2:42:51] crosskaese: Well insurance companies will do everything to not pay you first …
[2:42:52] UZMeNow: why send it, just take a picture??????
[2:42:53] vistage: Since there is only one
[2:42:54] zonizyde: when you get it back you eat it to gain its power
[2:42:55] Miestro: @thethurst_ the insurance for consumer products is built into MSRP and Shipping costs
[2:42:56] Atzgee: not much
[2:43:00] Rubinix: It's high in fiber
[2:43:00] BADboiz_TV: fiber
[2:43:02] BudsTWITCH: 1
[2:43:02] Trsg_craig: waflle are some multi blocks not four tale might need a taller roof
[2:43:04] BringBackLucky: all the artists mad now
[2:43:05] IronGajeel: time how much it takes it to burn
[2:43:07] bobolpwnz: paint it red for ketchup flavor
[2:43:09] Trident901: as much as it makes sense, it can be abused with out it being transparent
[2:43:09] Wetware: Lots of fibre I guess?
[2:43:10] TigerLuv: high in fiber
[2:43:12] ConfusedQuark: they do say fibre is good for you
[2:43:12] Battokage: ask gpt
[2:43:13] Grimholde: It’s not about the insurance company. It’s about the grading company not being liable to pay however much it’s worth.
[2:43:14] Bow_Shock: Cardboard is fibre, and fibre has no calories
[2:43:14] Zenk200: ask gpt
[2:43:19] drummernerd: 7 Kappa
[2:43:19] Mackmora: @Giantwaffle You don't have holo goggles yet to watch in the chests?
[2:43:22] フリクリ: depends on the pokemon type obv
[2:43:24] Rhink: There is a reddit for the calorie amount of a MTG card...
[2:43:27] Dmw345: standard insurance is $100 on a package, if the package gets destroyed and you don't have insurance the carrier send you a $100 check and you're out of luck for the rest
[2:43:28] zzzDai: If you shipped cards in a rigid case isnt it effectively 0% chance to get damaged?
[2:43:37] KuramaTheF0X: @Trsg_craig he is only doing a storage room rn, im sure the other rooms will be taller
[2:43:38] slyjedi: Whoever gets that card better photo copy it and make a useable copy.
[2:43:41] kolbias_13: The pokemon card is primarily paper, so you get no calories... says google
[2:43:50] Mxylopink: Spending 600k on a card is just as crazy
[2:43:51] Jibbur: we usually use insurance on anything we ship over $150
[2:43:53] lvyEartman: cardboard has the same nutricial value as some cereal? or was that disproofed by mythbusters?
[2:43:54] jdog0616: ive never lost a package in the mail why would i pay more when the odds are in my favour??
[2:43:59] IronGajeel: paper has calories
[2:44:01] usernameNull: and that is a known price, the grader can't do it because the value is unknown
[2:44:01] Rhink: @Giantwaffle So what I read, a card is essentially a bunch of cellulose which the body cant digest so its 0 calories.
[2:44:02] ymelus: Then why is tipping still a thing in the US KEKW
[2:44:04] boogerbomb01: 1 cal
[2:44:05] Strider1515: and then they add on more insurance at the end if you want it KEKW
[2:44:07] Jibbur: paper has no digestible calories,
[2:44:10] Skappzz: different calorie definitions
[2:44:11] jdog0616: ...thats not how that works
[2:44:11] ZyrnUwU: Paper can burn so yeah
[2:44:13] Bow_Shock: No it does not, fibre cannot be processed by your guts
[2:44:14] hulkomania: ofcourse paper has a calorific value
[2:44:15] Lambinicioh: prob takes more calories to consume than gained
[2:44:15] drummernerd: calorie or kilocalorie?
[2:44:15] maccabeus: your body doesn't light the card on fire
[2:44:20] XyneTheFirst: Two different types of calories.
[2:44:22] mkam225: I mean, not usable by our bodies
[2:44:26] jdog0616: joul
[2:44:27] Wetware: It just flows through, you don't get any nourishment out of it
[2:44:29] Bow_Shock: You mean jouls?
[2:44:29] DeMayon: joule??
[2:44:31] weightmaker: joule
[2:44:31] Balefati: Energy?
[2:44:31] Rhink: A kcal?
[2:44:32] OddsTV: do pokemon cards have any trans fat? trying to cut those
[2:44:32] tripwires: energy value?
[2:44:33] Rubinix: KCal?
[2:44:33] Mully_33: joule
[2:44:34] jmm548: wood burns so is wood calories ?
[2:44:38] Razznab: heat calorie
[2:44:42] Jibbur: nutritional calorie is actually digestable kcals
[2:44:43] sablefoxx26c: paperis wood..
[2:44:44] JERICHOLOLO: @Giantwaffle are you going on a pokemon card diet?
[2:44:44] Bombalo3: Kilo
[2:44:45] Jibbur: kilo calories
[2:44:47] jdog0616: joules of energy is used in heat measures
[2:44:50] Rhink: Hmm, wonder if you light a card on fire how many lumens it would put out.
[2:44:52] hulkomania: 13.5 MJ/KG
[2:44:53] one_shady_merchant: 93cal/oz of paper
[2:44:54] mkam225: Kcal is just a thousand calories lol
[2:44:55] Konhacas: Kcal is Kilo calorie, meaning a thousand calories
[2:44:56] Atzgee: 10 grams of cardboard contains 2.1×1011 kcal of energy.
[2:44:56] BloodBlight: kilo-cal
[2:44:58] BringBackLucky: altCrayon
[2:44:58] IronGajeel: A4 has 6.64 kcal.
[2:44:58] schwebels428: that size of paper would burn up too quickly to heat any volume of water
[2:45:07] snahsnah: no big companies dont take out insurance for shipping. It makes no financial sense to insure frequently occuring risks. You're just paying the margins and paperwork of the insurance
[2:45:07] averagekaze: how many calories do calories have tho
[2:45:09] lvyEartman: One calorie is defined as the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of one gram of water through one degree celsius
[2:45:09] BloodBlight: All food goods are listed in kilo cals
[2:45:11] Mully_33: roughly 4200 joules per kcal
[2:45:23] palagrim_: Waffle:"We have to make progress today". Also Waffle:"I am curious how much kcal does a Pokemon card have?"
[2:45:37] Rhink: Hmm, wonder if you light a card on fire how many lumens it would put out.
[2:45:40] mahoraz: @BloodBlight tic-tac is only 2calories, no? Kappa
[2:45:45] daemonaedryn: KEKW
[2:45:46] QaptainGeebs: Reddit says the enthalpy of a piece of paper is .0289 moles of cellulose is 230*(.0289)=6.64 kcal, if digestible
[2:45:49] kenshin2666: how is a question illegitimate?
[2:45:50] Vargh: pepeLaugh
[2:45:51] jmm548: legitimate is a stretch
[2:45:51] Gruumzh: wait i came in as i saw the lotr 1  of 1 did someone get it already?

[2:50:53] Lemures322: Just tuned in, sure I'm not the first to ask, but I thought Waffle already played new horizons? Was it some other modpack? Also, why this instead of D4?
[2:51:08] maccabeus: @Lemures322 you're thinking of nomifactory
[2:51:24] Iksess: @Lemures322 d4 is boring and he never finished gtnh

[3:26:30] GeneralSpoon12: Laws too foggy to commit to with such a safe set of disallowed content imo
[3:26:30] Immp: Does branded exclusively mean Paid for? if you are FREELY advertising a product, does that mean you can still use the logo etc?
[3:26:32] Strider1515: like Hello Fresh
[3:26:32] boogerbomb01: Twitch wants more of them ad dollars for themselves instead of streamers gettingthem
[3:26:32] Suikerfeestje: Weed is legal in Netherlands

[3:26:46] usernameNull: Is the disclosure tool new?
[3:26:47] Allmostdone: federally it isnt
[3:26:47] Vizion_TV: Twitch is based in the US
[3:26:48] Mechemical: Twitch has to cover the laws of the entire planet. Just easier and safer for an umbrella policy of content
[3:26:53] LeBeauTV: twitch just limiting creators options so they can negotiate bigger contracts with certain companies the overlords have spoken
[3:26:57] Catdaddyneff: product availability is different from legality
[3:26:57] thisisbrad: when does this take effect?
[3:26:58] JJaaYY: WhySoSerious @giantwaffle
[3:26:59] Rothguard: imagine me living in the middle east  KEKW

[3:27:18] KuramaTheF0X: sub only watching KEKW
[3:27:19] Alamose: yeah GDQ is gunna have issues
[3:27:20] silv: lets start PPV tourneys
[3:27:21] DeMayon: going thru twitch directly might get around the rules @Giantwaffle
[3:27:21] GuyDefeaten: I dont understand why twitch gets a say in this.
[3:27:22] weppet: maybe big events have a permit
[3:27:23] Spikey770: It says limited, so there is almost certainly exemptions
[3:27:23] 8R00KS: Thats actually insane from twitch's POV
[3:27:24] Iksess: thats awesome, fuck ads
[3:27:24] Asphoron: They just want their cut
[3:27:25] OddsTV: maybe theyll do exceptions for large events??
[3:27:26] albi1202: run the ads through twitch
[3:27:26] Manacaym: rip league and csgo
[3:27:26] maccabeus: they'll give exemptions to major event orgs
[3:27:27] Nexhunter: @ba_nanananananana and that why they're clarifying shit KEKW
[3:27:29] Intohimos: is that not the same for LEC/LCS?
[3:27:30] thisisbrad: blast kept promoting their competing streaming service during paris too
[3:27:32] le_Pure: can we have a 3% screentest? OMEGALUL
[3:27:33] Kosernik: they`ll move to youtube
[3:27:34] MrKurrie: they will make money by moving to youtube KEKW
[3:27:36] Beltorz: Time for the events go to Kick LUL
[3:27:37] Immp: 3% on your video resolution is like 32x57 @Giantwaffle LUL
[3:27:39] JommyBee: twitch would proberly have deals with big companies for liek the majors
[3:27:40] Hibame: Twitch is telling us to fuck off to youtube
[3:27:40] nAZAr1uS: ADs on background screen???
[3:27:40] Vizion_TV: LUL What if i just do everything  Translucent instead of Opaque
[3:27:41] Rozz161: now i want a calculator
[3:27:41] GFQPR1882: That does sound like BS drinking ok kids gamba not KEKW
[3:27:41] Oodeanoo: 33 3% logos
[3:27:41] xaubercrowTV: someone has the link? im to lazy KEKW
[3:27:42] Aldizzert: Can you show us a 3% logo?  How big it is?
[3:27:43] XavinNydek: Twitch wants to be in the sponsorship chain and get their cut
[3:27:43] Myekos: Put a physical banner in your background in your room and blow up your cameo
[3:27:45] henry_w40: @Giantwaffle 100 3% sized to make a big advert
[3:27:45] Yakobro: 3% is literally nothing
[3:27:45] Pekter: SPONSORED TABACCO game Kappa
[3:27:45] Zohaas: @Intohimos They might have exceptions.
[3:27:46] QaptainGeebs: so more annoying
[3:27:48] ImposterArchitect: Monster Fridge in Waffle's Background
[3:27:48] h3llmer: can you get a sponsored tatoo on your forehead
[3:27:49] weasel9999: written on your forehead NODDERS
[3:27:51] Nexhunter: bruh how the fuck did gigabyte's bios update cause my memory controller to have issues
[3:27:52] charlies_reverie: im probably being really dumb but what about charity streams
[3:27:53] Jovi1246: no more raid shadow legends banners
[3:27:54] Tanketorsk: Sponsored fireplace? Pog
[3:27:55] Nexhunter: tobiiiFacepalm
[3:27:57] Intohimos: @Zohaas that's what I was thinking
[3:27:57] Davastro: What if they have the ad playing in the background KEKW
[3:27:59] Catdaddyneff: wonder how it works with big events like GDQ
[3:28:00] Vizion_TV: @Giantwaffle people will just have their stream be transparent behind the ads LUL
[3:28:00] Tabakhase: do transparent pixels count? Keepo
[3:28:01] gregcee: What if its a promotion for a game? Thats a fullscreen promotion???
[3:28:04] GandalfTheGrump: @Giantwaffle you can also do live ads, so you can have the caster or talent hold up a monster and talk about how tasty it is. or whatever
[3:28:08] Pekter: in game full screen ad Kappa
[3:28:12] 2Flip: everything is okay, but those fullscreen ads.. come on twitch..
[3:28:12] JJaaYY: It says formats limited on full screen ads so bigger events might have something
[3:28:13] Nexhunter: @Giantwaffle it has to be sanctioned in the USA for gambling
[3:28:14] Akunin_EQ: They'll create a seperate account for presentations with advertisers, just won't be able to do ti on a regular users stream
[3:28:19] GuyDefeaten: while I understand the gambling stuff I dont understand what they have to gain from this?
[3:28:22] Racko5: so there taking away the otk banner ads?
[3:28:25] Dracos555: @Giantwaffle 50% of those rules are REALLY stupid
[3:28:26] TheCairon: 57x32 pixels
[3:28:27] gregcee: Oops i missed that
[3:28:28] SimonSez: Time to switch to 640x480 streaming Kappa
[3:28:28] JoniSusi: They just want to force you to use their own twitch promotions now.
[3:28:29] Immp: literally what i said 32 x 57 pixels
[3:28:31] TheSparMan: so could you not full sreen an ad on a tv in your room?
[3:28:33] Askjong: Do 4% EZ
[3:28:34] atamala: @GuyDefeaten liability? id guess
[3:28:34] iMelon: Time to do 33 3% ads at once
[3:28:35] Atzgee: focus more on gaming
[3:28:36] GFQPR1882: What about cannabis factory game?
[3:28:36] Hibame: Twitch wants their cut
[3:28:36] Kardiiac: @Giantwaffle what if you play the ad on the fireplace in the background
[3:28:37] banshay3: playing sponsored game on 3% Pog
[3:28:37] Dagmoo: So is it just going to be streamers "talking" about their banner ads below?
[3:28:38] aeadon: effective immediately?
[3:28:40] MonteKuchen: probably money
[3:28:41] GeneralSpoon12: This seems to me like an attempt to very thoroughly sanitize something that has given Twitch a lot of problems in the past
[3:28:42] holypt: 32.4px => 3% of 1080px
[3:28:43] JoniSusi: They want promo money going through their hands.
[3:28:43] TheWonderLlama: Because they are adding banner ads to all streams
[3:28:44] 8R00KS: Because their sponsors are mad
[3:28:45] SidneyJKs: Some regulation
[3:28:45] drummernerd: so they can push their own banner ads?
[3:28:46] lvyEartman: what about cohh he adjusts his format to the game
[3:28:47] Ksiuran: 57.6x32.4 px
[3:28:48] JERICHOLOLO: they want ads themself probably
[3:28:50] TallicDragon: they want the ad money themselves
[3:28:50] Rekkt_MD: Just have a camera set on only a banner boom it's not in the background Kappa
[3:28:51] Nexhunter: if people aren't properly displaying stuff
[3:28:51] weightmaker: are those global guidelines or only for US?
[3:28:51] Catdaddyneff: twitch wants people to use sponsorships that give twitch a cut of the money
[3:28:52] siebharrin: so... no streaming trailers for games/movies and so on?
[3:28:53] Tiaden: 3% of 1080p is 250x250 aprox.
[3:28:54] Dino4Delta: I wonder how it this will go for championships for videogames like ESL and stuff
[3:28:54] Rolymole09: Twitch want to take a slice of that cake.
[3:28:54] weasel9999: don't want streamers bypassing their new revenue sharing rules pepeLaugh
[3:28:55] Nukgru: I think it is to push more advertisment through them.
[3:28:55] Racko5: maybe to vague of sponsor transparency?
[3:28:55] pwrreset: if you sponsor dildos, can you stream with one in your mouth?
[3:28:56] le_Pure: so you can play a sponsored game but not play a trailer for it?
[3:28:59] Aldizzert: Or they just want more ad revenue to go through them
[3:29:04] Vizion_TV: So twitch ads aren't allowed? No more 30 second ads :)
[3:29:04] Asphoron: @Giantwaffle They just want their cut of the revenue
[3:29:06] GummiKu: Probably their advertisements dont want to be together with the on screen content ads
[3:29:06] ShireaTV: @Catdaddyneff this 1000%
[3:29:07] ba_nanananananana: the thing you're irritated about, cannabis, is still federally illegal, so what's the problem
[3:29:08] kenshin2666: 10 3% sponsor ads at one time KEKW
[3:29:09] RainDoc: Don't you dare to put logos but hey, here's 9 prerolls ads
[3:29:09] h3llmer: stream in 8K 5Head
[3:29:09] sablefoxx26c: yeah thats like the size of these icons lol
[3:29:11] Grav1s: Wait… so LTT cant do the WAN show ad reads.
[3:29:11] Vargh: ask chat gpt
[3:29:11] Joshuapetch: well.. it is
[3:29:12] Joshuapetch: tiny
[3:29:12] StOrMy1100: @Giantwaffle Can you do a test on stream?
[3:29:13] YourLittlePuppy: wait thats slightly bigger than an icon LUL
[3:29:13] dylan0806: Maybe big tournaments get an exception
[3:29:13] Tiaden: no its 250 by 250
[3:29:14] Vangelis716: That's lower resolation than an emote
[3:29:14] boogerbomb01: 10% of 1080 is 108
[3:29:15] chadaccountant: go to paint!
[3:29:15] Pekter: skins casinos are reading this and searching for the workaround right now
[3:29:15] Swingeing_Folk: ppL ads
[3:29:17] waterlimon: put a hole in the ad to save on pixels
[3:29:18] Nexhunter: @Racko5 a lot of folks def are uhm forgetting to put sponsored and stuff in their thing
[3:29:19] Kosernik: 249*249
[3:29:21] Shmoopy0: Nahhhhh, they want to control the ads. Those AD Dollars from on screen ad plays, etcwere not coming to them to then pass on to streamers with a cut. So this is purely money. @Giantwaffle
[3:29:23] MaIlchad: ? 57 pixels is like almost as small as an emote
[3:29:25] DeceitfulPear: Idk I feel like thats average... huge maybe even Sadge
[3:29:25] Girthiest: Doesn’t twitch want to prioritize their own ads versus you promoting a sponsored burner in ad?
[3:29:27] KluDeez: they don't like people adding ads to their already ad infested content would be my guess
[3:29:28] Yizzles: Twitch wants a cut of that advertiser money instead of it all going to the streamer.
[3:29:28] KuramaTheF0X: 1825 pixels .. GL
[3:29:31] albi1202: they want the companys to hit up twitch and to go through their ad system instead of giving the money to the streamers directly
[3:29:33] D1CKENSS: OMEGALUL
[3:29:34] Aaugr: you're not meant to use it consciously, its so its okay to have stuff in your background
[3:29:35] Joshuapetch: OMEGALUL
[3:29:35] thisisbrad: if the logo/ad is IRL on your camera view, its not burned in so no 3% rule? 5Head
[3:29:35] AdamMcAdamson: That's wrong
[3:29:36] StOrMy1100: KEKW
[3:29:36] Hot_Rodster: it says max 3% for "sponsers" not "sponsor", so all sponsers max to 3%
[3:29:36] Intohimos: when do these rules go live?
[3:29:36] Vargh: YEP
[3:29:37] HumbleMetal: OMEGALUL

[3:29:39] SirKaelan: OMEGALUL
[3:29:41] Racko5: KEKW
[3:29:41] drummernerd: that’s wrong
[3:29:42] Akunin_EQ: UE probably came down on them for promoting Random Chance gambling (slots,plinko,roulette) but Poker and Blackjack are skill based.
[3:29:42] Yizzles: KEKW
[3:29:42] yoVespart: LOOOL
[3:29:43] AdamMcAdamson: 3% area not length....
[3:29:44] ImposterArchitect: someone did the math wrong
[3:29:45] DeadlyMyth: nah I bet it's because they want advertisers to go to them for full screen ads
[3:29:46] quickclassy: OMEGALUL Thats so tony
[3:29:46] Kosernik: 1920*1080*.03 = 250*250
[3:29:46] 2Flip: LMAO
[3:29:47] Nexhunter: that def not the right size
[3:29:47] Davastro: Math ain’t nothing
[3:29:47] Mick_: its not different than what YT does
[3:29:47] trabadam: ppL
[3:29:48] Swingeing_Folk: KEKW huge advert

[3:29:51] KluDeez: KEKW
[3:29:53] ImposterArchitect: 250x250

[3:29:55] Hot_Rodster: so if you want to do 2 at once, they can take up 3% max
[3:29:55] MinusKills: we gonna need magnifying glass KEKW
[3:29:55] Dead_InsideXd: KEKW
[3:29:55] MonteKuchen: 60k pixel is 3% of 1080p
[3:29:57] Gido01: That’s 3%*3%
[3:29:57] Nexhunter: bruh people can't math
[3:29:58] MaIlchad: in 720p though?
[3:29:59] pwrreset: But can you have multiple of them?
[3:30:01] Yakobro: ????
[3:30:02] LeBeauTV: this is literally just a money move for them. The more they limit creators the more appealing it is to negotiate with twitch instead of you.
[3:30:03] drummernerd: yes
[3:30:04] UnforkableOnion: 249x249
[3:30:05] Travess: Pixel Artists sharpen your pixel pencils, we got work!
[3:30:05] AdamMcAdamson: 62k
[3:30:10] MaIlchad: twitch streams are not 1080p on a standard screen
[3:30:11] ImposterArchitect: 62208
[3:30:15] KuramaTheF0X: thats quite fair
[3:30:16] Aldizzert: you have to count the pixels, yeah
[3:30:18] Racko5: thats not bad
[3:30:21] maccabeus: someone doesn't know how to calculate area KEKW
[3:30:22] Rubinix: we've gone off the rails here waffle
[3:30:27] Myekos: that's way bigger than 3%
[3:30:28] Vangelis716: That's way larger than 3%
[3:30:29] JERICHOLOLO: thats not looks like 3%
[3:30:29] Kamis0ri89: @Giantwaffle couldn't we just do multiple logos
[3:30:30] Vizion_TV: Thats much larger than 3% LUL
[3:30:30] AshhanX: just do (width * .03) x (height * .0)3

[3:30:32] Pekter: dats 3%?
[3:30:32] Tabakhase: thats never 3% just looking at it tbh...
[3:30:32] bEC69_: this is 3? brother, look at it
[3:30:34] DeMayon: thats not 3% of the area LOL
[3:30:35] Yizzles: No shot
[3:30:35] Askjong: that is way biger
[3:30:35] Aldizzert: That doesnt look like 3%
[3:30:35] le_Pure: no way is that 3% OMEGALUL
[3:30:36] F1berz: No way that's 3%
[3:30:36] danimemo1: Thats not 3 %
[3:30:36] Aaugr: thats way more than 3%
[3:30:37] FirstBornAcorn: way more than 3%
[3:30:37] boogerbomb01: That is way bigger than 3%

[3:30:39] TrickyHi: thats not 3%
[3:30:40] Dagmoo: No way thats 3%
[3:30:40] Pine_Noir: That is not 3%
[3:30:41] MaIlchad: That's about 800 pixels
[3:30:41] Zucate: that is way bigger than 3%
[3:30:42] ScarceLoot: that looks like 20% lol
[3:30:42] 2Flip: "Twitch made an estimated $2.8 billion revenue in 2022 " OMEGALUL
[3:30:43] oxidexd: no way that's 3%

[3:30:43] Joshuapetch: that's NOT 3% bruh
[3:30:45] yoVespart: That doesn't look like 3% at all
[3:30:45] waterlimon: das not 3 percebt
[3:30:45] BlainL: thats like 20%
[3:30:45] RainDoc: Banner on eSports?
[3:30:45] Messworld: ad size -> . Looking
[3:30:45] Myekos: chatGPT confirms, 32x57
[3:30:46] maccabeus: who tf said that was 3% LUL
[3:30:48] dylan0806: That’s not 3%
[3:30:48] cager1233: thats like 15% thats not 3%
[3:30:50] Catdaddyneff: look how big it is lol
[3:30:52] myKunami: 1080*0.03
[3:30:56] Yakobro: can you fit 30 of those on screen
[3:30:56] h3llmer: How bout ads in overlay apps?
[3:30:56] LeBeauTV: thats way more than 3 lool
[3:30:56] GFQPR1882: Why does it even matter?
[3:30:58] Aldizzert: Fit 33 of those
[3:30:59] henrikbg: everyone that said 250x250 is Clueless
[3:31:00] AshhanX: formula = (width * .03) x (height * .0)3
[3:31:00] Nexhunter: it surely is
[3:31:01] zzzDai: yah at 1080p its 249.4x249.4 pixels for 3%
[3:31:03] albi1202: look at the size. its never only 3% of the whole screen
[3:31:04] Jovi1246: can't you make the box in obs
[3:31:04] GummiKu: What is your display capture at?
[3:31:04] zzzDai: or probably 250x250
[3:31:05] Stragmol: thats like 20%
[3:31:08] weppet: chat and math
[3:31:11] Agente_L: Bro how is 250x250 3% of 1920x1080
[3:31:14] KuramaTheF0X: it is scaled then for you rn
[3:31:15] Myekos: scale to broadcast
[3:31:16] legomaster18: that would
[3:31:18] 0x000000: it does matter
[3:31:18] ba_nanananananana: weppet no it's waffle and math
[3:31:20] cager1233: Pepega
[3:31:21] Kisheen: @Agente_L because math
[3:31:22] JERICHOLOLO: do it in obs
[3:31:23] Vargh: 62 208 pixels is 3%
[3:31:24] Pekter: well do 3% of 1440
[3:31:25] zzzDai: @Agente_L math is hard
[3:31:27] 4729_zex: rip small streamers?
[3:31:27] Rolymole09: 1080x1920=2073600x0.03= 62208.. so you canhave 62.2k pixels
[3:31:28] killslash: GTNH….I went so hard on that pack and burnt out by MV tier
[3:31:30] SirHuddy: Think of it as 3 square inches if it’s 10x10 inches
[3:31:31] Tjinthehood: “20” haha
[3:31:32] Joshuapetch: make a box in OBS @Giantwaffle
[3:31:33] Allmostdone: I wonder how Cohh stuff will work at all
[3:31:34] Aldizzert: slrMaff slrMaff slrMaff slrMaff
[3:31:38] Racko5: its 58x32
[3:31:38] hisdue: ppL we must go smol
[3:31:42] usernameNull: 250 x 250 is right, 62208 is 3% of 1920x1080
[3:31:46] weppet: @ba_nanananananana idk man, i see all kinds of numbers here LUL
[3:31:48] AdamMcAdamson: Pixels squared boyss
[3:31:49] sablefoxx26c: is like 6030
[3:31:50] 2Flip: i guess you can wear t shirts with sponsor logo LUL
[3:31:51] StOrMy1100: Wait is says 30%?
[3:31:51] MaIlchad: wait. are we doing 3% of pixels or 3% of area?
[3:31:54] legomaster18: @Allmostdone im pretty sure cohhs stuff will not be affected especially since it is usually small
[3:31:57] drummernerd: 3% area folks
[3:31:58] CSpud1: @usernameNull agree
[3:31:58] DoctorLongBalls: is someone from twitch going to have a ruler on their screen to measure or count the pixels
[3:31:58] AdamMcAdamson: Area vs length.
[3:31:59] Messworld: @Giantwaffle ask ChatGPT :)
[3:32:00] MaIlchad: width vs area
[3:32:02] Floppyfish21: @giantwaffle it's a good thing you're not advertising that calculator cuz they'd be upset with this math
[3:32:03] DoctorLongBalls: how is this going to be enforced
[3:32:04] StOrMy1100: Nvm
[3:32:05] JJaaYY: Talking about less IQ the  doing this LUL
[3:32:06] ba_nanananananana: weppet the only numbers that matter are the ones waffle puts out tho LUL
[3:32:09] charlies_reverie: I wonder if this will affect the Jingle Jam at all
[3:32:09] boogerbomb01: 3% of 1080 is 32
[3:32:16] Oodeanoo: 250x250
[3:32:16] MinusKills: @MaIlchad this which one are we doing
[3:32:17] FirstBornAcorn: no its not
[3:32:17] Nexhunter: bruh where the fuck is tech we gotta bitch
[3:32:20] Bored______________: pixel is not size
[3:32:20] itsRynosuki: no its 250 total
[3:32:21] holypt: that seems a LOT
[3:32:24] AdamMcAdamson: Yeah, but your scalling must be wtong
[3:32:24] henrikbg: @Tech
[3:32:26] Atzgee: 250px
[3:32:27] ChillyFierce: ???????????????
[3:32:30] Yizzles: PepegaChat
[3:32:30] yoVespart: That seems WAY too much
[3:32:32] Yakobro: 250px
[3:32:34] FowD8: do the math with a square @Giantwaffle 100x100... 50x50 is 1/4 of the screen @Giantwaffle
[3:32:34] 4729_zex: chat PepegaChat
[3:32:34] GFQPR1882: @giantwaffle  Is @tech gonna be counting pixels KEKW
[3:32:37] FirstBornAcorn: its c^2=a^2+b^2
[3:32:39] Yakobro: 50x50
[3:32:41] Rothguard: %10 of 1920   is only   192  so 1/3rd of that is 66
[3:32:42] chochi314: It looks quite close to 3%
[3:32:43] HumblePhil: Reality is a lie
[3:32:45] KuramaTheF0X: @TWITCH pls clarify MadgeLate
[3:32:45] Kamis0ri89: change your webcam size
[3:32:46] AdamMcAdamson: ~1/4 of the stream height
[3:32:47] whyt0: save it and then open it up
[3:32:48] cager1233: im lost as hell
[3:32:51] HeartisticPanda: ClappyDerp MathTime
[3:32:52] ImposterArchitect: ehh
[3:32:52] Bored______________: mesure you screen in cm and then 3% of that
[3:32:52] Kisheen: Does OBS say how big your webcam is?
[3:32:52] DuctTapeNinja_: scale it to your resolution
[3:32:53] Othixz: but the screen isnt a square
[3:32:53] TheSparMan: make a 1080 spirte and then a 250 in that @Giantwaffle
[3:32:53] Vizion_TV: 57.6 by 32.4
[3:32:54] dylan0806: It’s zoomed
[3:32:54] weppet: @ba_nanananananana the problem is that we are multiplying Waffle*chat
[3:32:54] AdamMcAdamson: Your thing is like 1/2
[3:32:56] MeMonkee: its not square ... so its 1920*0,03 for width and 1080*0,03 for height
[3:32:58] 2Flip: @Nexhunter after these news i would guess celebrating his paycheck increase? LUL
[3:32:58] ImposterArchitect: it's 250px they're right
[3:32:58] Smelly_Badger: 58x32
[3:32:59] hisdue: Pixel in text with no backround good luck doing the math waffleEgg
[3:33:01] Solitude411: its 58x32
[3:33:01] skignas: just open any image on google 250 x 250
[3:33:02] Justsevenstars07: 3% of widrh and 3% of height instead of 3% of area
[3:33:02] Aldizzert: 1/4 of a 100x100 square is 50x50
[3:33:03] Archelonde: 3% of 1080 and 3% of 1920?
[3:33:04] Shroadie: 58x32
[3:33:04] Vangelis716: By default Windows enables scaling when using 4k resolution. Probably that's messing with it
[3:33:06] Kohru: 250 250
[3:33:07] AdamMcAdamson: 249x249
[3:33:07] Tiaden: 250x250
[3:33:09] Lambinicioh: 57.6 X 32.4
[3:33:10] Racko5: 58x32?
[3:33:12] MinusKills: techs new job to count streamers pixels to prove its not bigger than 3% KEKW
[3:33:12] Dracos555: 57.6x32.4 would be the pixels
[3:33:12] MaIlchad: 1920 * 0.03 is 57 pixels but 3% of 1080p pixels is 250 pixels wide
[3:33:14] Shroadie: its 58x32
[3:33:15] KimikoKirk: isn't it (1920*0.03)*(1080*0.03)?
[3:33:15] Yakobro: @MeMonkee 1920x0.5 and 1080x0.5 is 1/4 of your screen

[3:33:30] Smelly_Badger: 58x32
[3:33:30] Vizion_TV: 57.6 X 32.4 This is the correct size
[3:33:33] MeMonkee: 58*32 for 1920*1080

[3:33:39] danimemo1: 58x32,4
[3:33:40] AdamMcAdamson: Yes
[3:33:40] Kohru: yep
[3:33:40] ChillyFierce: match
[3:33:41] iceberg271: Pog
[3:33:41] KuramaTheF0X: huh
[3:33:41] boogerbomb01: 250 isnt 3% of anything 1080
[3:33:42] Pekter: how is 250 3% of 1080
[3:33:42] Vangelis716: That's already lot smaller
[3:33:43] Nexhunter: yea that about right
[3:33:43] Vargh: that's correct
[3:33:43] skignas: that seems like it
[3:33:43] praxiz: Waffle, does that mean you can only restream apple presentations in that size?
[3:33:43] CandideCrendraven: that looks about right
[3:33:45] ScarceLoot: that looks correct
[3:33:47] MaIlchad: that looks correct. its also 13% of the length
[3:33:47] drummernerd: looks right to me
[3:33:48] Yakobro: looks correct
[3:33:49] Apparentthreat: seems about right
[3:33:50] GummiKu: Thats looks way better
[3:33:51] lvyEartman: that seems right
[3:33:52] usernameNull: that looks right, you can get about 30 on the screen
[3:33:52] Justsevenstars07: 3% of widrh and 3% of height instead of 3% of area @Giantwaffle
[3:33:53] AdamMcAdamson: 1440p
[3:33:54] HobbyMonkey: it's 57.6 x 32.4 on a 1080p monitor
[3:33:54] cager1233: thats way more than 3%
[3:33:55] MaIlchad: because you're measuring area
[3:33:55] Vargh: it's more than big enough tbh
[3:33:56] zzzDai: 1920*1080 = 2,073,600/100= 20736*3 = 62208.  sqrt(62208) = 249.4
[3:33:56] ba_nanananananana: FailFish jfc
[3:33:57] LatHund: 43x43 is 3% of space
[3:33:58] Aldizzert: I think you could fit 33 of those
[3:33:58] Kosernik: make 33 of them and fill the screen
[3:33:58] FREEZE_ball: seems reasonable
[3:34:00] Smelly_Badger: 58 x 32
[3:34:01] Kisheen: 33 of those fill the screen
[3:34:01] DonGromus: ItIsWhatItIs
[3:34:02] Myekos: now compare it to 32x57
[3:34:02] foxxdonut: idk but Tomato, leek, carrot soup sounds good
[3:34:02] GummiKu: Add more of them
[3:34:04] Shroadie: 58x32 waffle!

[3:34:10] CiVR: What happens when the transcoding makes it 3.00001%
[3:34:10] enki1337: chat you have to take 3% of the area
[3:34:11] MaIlchad: its 13% of the whole screen if my math is right
[3:34:11] hlmbrg: You can fit 33 those
[3:34:11] TallicDragon: looks about right
[3:34:12] Takiiu: just copy it
[3:34:12] ba_nanananananana: because you use a square and your screen isn't a square
[3:34:13] sour_doritos: test it KEKW
[3:34:13] Kohru: looks right
[3:34:13] DorkManTV: It's to your screen resolution scale
[3:34:13] Askjong: ratio
[3:34:14] ChillyFierce: fill the screen to see KEKW
[3:34:14] artykQBR: its right
[3:34:15] ZentilBlight: 57.6 x 32.4 yah this is it.
[3:34:15] legomaster18: waffle, chat GPT says it should be 57.6 x 32.4 for 3% of 1920x1080
[3:34:15] enki1337: it's right
[3:34:16] Takiiu: 33 times
[3:34:17] Kohru: test it
[3:34:17] chadaccountant: put 33 of them down
[3:34:17] usernameNull: lets put 33 in and cover the scren
[3:34:17] Moobot: You can sub to Waffle by clicking this neat link -> twitch.tv/giantwaffle/subscribe SUBprise
[3:34:18] JJaaYY: Compared to the photo that’s right @giantwaffle
[3:34:19] Dagmoo: That seems right
[3:34:20] holypt: So if that is 3% you need to fit 23 boxes in the screen
[3:34:20] FlammAlpha: is your obs panel 1440p?
[3:34:21] FirstBornAcorn: lose 250 its stupid
[3:34:22] Kohru: do it
[3:34:22] Tiaden: there is scaling for sure
[3:34:22] dylan0806: Can you have 33 of those on your screen?
[3:34:22] FirstBornAcorn: ;P
[3:34:23] InoUno: Copy it and fill the screen KEKW

[3:34:24] bobolpwnz: monkaMath
[3:34:25] LeBeauTV: No imagine sponsors are looking at that as your offer or twitch and using your whole screen. Twitch is trying to make themselves the more attractive offer to sponsors.
[3:34:25] Aldizzert: Thats a decent enough ad
[3:34:25] Fufcia: do it
[3:34:25] StOrMy1100: Do it

[3:34:33] trabadam: DO IT
[3:34:33] Apparentthreat: @Giantwaffle 250 * 4 is not 1080
[3:34:33] FowD8: @Giantwaffle just do a simple example. a 100x100 box. if you want 50% it's not 50x50, that's 25%
[3:34:34] holypt: 33 boxes let's go

[3:37:10] Mandorake: @Nexhunter why is there an argument about pixels?

[3:37:11] Shroadie: chatgpt said 58x32!

[3:37:52] Yizzles: He took .03 of 1920 and 1080 separately.
[3:37:52] DorkManTV: But you need to take into account, if your screen resolution is different than 1080p, it will look smaller if you capture screen

[3:38:25] MaIlchad: @Akunin_EQ that only works if you multiply 1920 and 1080 seperately. together you get a completely different answer. be careful how you format mathsa
[3:38:27] GamingWithJackson: Waffle what do you not understand that it's 1920 x 0.03 and then 1080 x 0.03
[3:38:28] Myekos: here's the thing, if you take 3% of both width and height,   you get 3% of 3%.  If you want 3% of the total screen you only take height OR width
[3:38:38] Nexhunter: @Mandorake so like some streamers were the ad logo is fucking giant that is no more

[3:44:53] ba_nanananananana: @MaIlchad square root isn't really what you want for a banner on a 16:9 screen tho.

[3:45:42] Ryhian: Still doing night time photography?
[3:45:48] MaIlchad: @MaIlchad we were talking about icons not banners, it doesn't matter because we were talking about area not dimensions. square root gives the maximum *square* logo allowed

[3:49:01] KluDeez: corpos are the worst
[3:49:04] OddsTV: yeah give YxY amounts for 720p and 1080p..
[3:49:04] LetMeTellYouWhatToDo: twitch making clear rules LUL good one
[3:49:07] AdamMcAdamson: Only confusing because people can't do math
[3:49:13] MaIlchad: I hate it when they put things like 3%. its so ambigious. 3% of what? area? dimensions? screen size? I do NOT run twitch fullscreen
[3:49:15] Bored______________: because it looks better in certain games
[3:49:15] FreakSimon: @TheBored_   1920x1080 -> square root -> 3%
[3:49:17] GamingWithJackson: It's 332 x 187 officially

[3:50:05] IronGajeel: i might be dumb but how these changes are bad for watchers?
[3:50:10] snoipa__: that's similar to how governments outline size requirements for things in the built environment. Shit like "4% of the linear square footage facing the north-east elevation if it's next to a gas station" per business within each establishment
[3:50:12] Burshaz: What ever happened to Hytale?

[3:51:01] MaIlchad: paper bindings are one o fthe best tool parts

[3:51:09] k1n3c7x: paper binding gives +1 modifier
[3:51:12] mainG__: @IronGajeel normal streams it doesn't do much but for esports it takes a bit portion of their funding pushing them to other platforms

[3:52:53] RussianRainbowTV: You were literally bitching about that yesterday xdd
[3:52:53] Alamose: drawers are still nice for all of the microcrafting bits
[3:52:58] MaIlchad: it depends on what materials you have, drawers are better for lots of 1 item
[3:52:59] MonteKuchen: and i think you cant make diamond chest yet
[3:53:00] boogerbomb01: How bad are JABBA Barrels?
[3:53:02] KuramaTheF0X: you could do double chests just faced to the side to make them 1 block for the wall @Giantwaffle
[3:53:03] KiloJoel: if you use 1x1 drawers for 64 stacks, that helps a lot vs the small storage of 2x2 drawers
[3:53:04] 1killersquirrel: you already have 7 stacks of 64 in drawer
[3:53:10] IamCapZz: You have a fuck ton of chests :D

[3:55:56] Tabrizz99: Pati is always so chill
[3:55:57] Grimholde: QOL
[3:55:58] KiloJoel: you can chisel chests into trapped chests
[3:56:04] THEgoodCOW: you cant btw not open the top chest then there is a solit block on top
[3:56:15] ThatWeirdoGuy: But... why not Space Exploration instead? waffleDrip
[3:56:16] MaIlchad: *confusion*
[3:56:25] SailorWS: THEgoodCOW its not a solid block
[3:56:28] SailorWS: so he can
[3:56:32] Immp: Doing the double chests like you have saves the top chest not opening problem, as you have the other side free
[3:56:37] Vovosunt: @ThatWeirdoGuy wanted to see K2SE with pati man
[3:56:40] mainG__: make them presents Madge

[3:56:53] rickthe_punk: @giantwaffle you cant stream on both at the same time but can you restream your twitch stream live on youtube ? loophole ?
[3:56:53] MaIlchad: This modpack is basically like relearning minecraft. did you forgot how hard that was? :D
[3:56:55] restfulblue: true, pre-mv sucks
[3:56:55] SailorWS: Chat the top chest can be opened. Its a framed block
[3:56:56] Whitemage082: then why do you hate yourself?
[3:56:57] VenomMellow: looks good, can even color chests with chisel
[3:57:00] hisdue: instead of QOL it is QOSuffering
[3:57:11] boogerbomb01: Why not use them since you have them?
[3:57:11] Foooks: @hisdue LUL
[3:57:20] germanmikrowave: @hisdue so jail?
[3:57:33] 1killersquirrel: you'll need drawers, Pati and Orange used a lot because you can see the contents for small parts @Giantwaffle
[3:58:01] Dodara87: !gtnh
[3:58:01] Moobot: Pati and the crew are restarting GT: New Horizons because they are complete Chads. Waffle is playing until the Despairge sets in | Get the pack at gtnh.miraheze.org/wiki/Main_Page
[3:58:03] MetalBBA: There's plenty of QOL stuff but it's geared towards earning that QOL through tier upgrades
[3:58:06] restfulblue: do you even need that much of storage? you could do less storage for now and extend it later in lv/mv
[3:58:09] k1n3c7x: you cant make obsidian plates until MV. theres 2 types of plates
[3:58:11] xerminator2k: You need the Yabba barrel upgrades
[3:58:14] Alamose: 16 is fine for now
[3:58:15] xerminator2k: not the drawers one
[3:58:24] MaIlchad: 2 types of plates? Lmao, you wish
[3:58:24] Moobot: You can sub to Waffle by clicking this neat link -> twitch.tv/giantwaffle/subscribe SUBprise
[3:58:29] hisdue: MuchoGato
[3:58:31] pixfix2k2: 16 stacks is fine for a long time
[3:58:31] Francisco_Scaramanga: the base draws for low count items
[3:58:33] MrSilverMatch: 16 stacks is sufficient for a lot of things like saplings dyes etc etc
[3:58:35] GFQPR1882: Just get an me system :)
[3:58:38] 1killersquirrel: yeah, you need max 1 stack for small parts, for all the machines
[3:58:42] 514484: this modpack KEKW
[3:58:42] Vizion_TV: Yabba Barrels? Or Better Barrels?
[3:58:44] xerminator2k: You can't use the drawers upgrades on the yabba barrel @Giantwaffle You need them from the Yabba mod.
[3:58:53] Ghostfdw: But 16 stacks are enough for a lot of stuff no?
[3:58:58] ImposterArchitect: Just Big Crates?
[3:59:28] MaIlchad: barrels are very inconvenient compared to drawers, you can't pick them up without a dolly
[3:59:35] ublighthero: what pack is this? :)
[3:59:36] KiloJoel: a void chest voids things
[3:59:38] boogerbomb01: either way void upgrades aint happening yet
[3:59:40] 1killersquirrel: upgrades for what though? You have like 10-20 items max for which you need more that 3 stack of space
[3:59:46] MaIlchad: GregTech: New Horizons (The Game) @ublighthero

[3:59:56] atamala: drop an enderman in the smelter
[4:00:04] ublighthero: Thanks
[4:00:08] 514484: good idea
[4:00:11] boogerbomb01: Why not just a lot of single stack barrels?
[4:00:16] DragonApoc: What about the vanilla storage solution with hoppers
[4:00:22] Silver_Skeeter: bro digital storage will be so fucking huge by the time you get there hahahah
[4:00:26] MrSilverMatch: I mean you wouldn’t need any upgrade for the next week or so
[4:00:28] MaIlchad: @DragonApoc costs an arm and a leg.
[4:00:30] xerminator2k: How expensive is the bronze chest from greg if that is in the pack? It has 54 slots per chest.
[4:00:31] JommyBee: isnt it 16 stacks per sqaure
[4:00:31] DaddyDiddy: also too slow
[4:00:32] MaIlchad: hoppers. lol.
[4:00:35] 1killersquirrel: you don't need 16 stack for most things
[4:00:37] hisdue: this man said, with hopper OMEGALUL
[4:00:39] 514484: KEKW
[4:00:39] ImposterArchitect: Do it in Aisles and use the Dewey Decimal System
[4:00:40] Tidalllwave: no upgrades in the beginning
[4:00:43] Iksess: never
[4:00:44] JERICHOLOLO: u wont last that long
[4:00:44] JommyBee: so 64 stacks if u use all 4 corners @Giantwaffle ?
[4:00:46] Dynotrox: !gtnh

[4:00:49] DragonApoc: Will you make it that far?
[4:00:53] Silver_Skeeter: yeah 100% LUL
[4:00:54] Rubinix: catharsis lol
[4:00:55] pixfix2k2: 16 stacks per square will last a while man
[4:01:03] bobolpwnz: Before AE, you can use EnderIO remote terminal thingy
[4:01:05] 1killersquirrel: this is not Nomifactory, you won't have massive amounts of anything for the first 1-2 months @Giantwaffle
[4:01:07] Rhink: You'll have it by Saturday...
[4:01:08] KuramaTheF0X: isnt it post EV ? KEKW
[4:01:16] MaIlchad: This pati has issues last time because they had literally like 50 chests and barrels of crap
[4:01:20] 514484: vanilla iron farms were much harder to do in 1.7 than they are now
[4:01:22] The_kid_as_a_teen: get halo chest mod shows you whats inside the chest
[4:01:24] Alamose: yeah its not good for blocks, good for parts though
[4:01:26] biggerginger: stuff that gets used alooot
[4:01:28] boogerbomb01: gears, screws and shit like that
[4:01:29] Kygo_: it's not 16 stacks total, so 4 x 4stacks
[4:01:31] Silver_Skeeter: yeah all the middle steps
[4:01:31] pixfix2k2: Yep I'm on EV tech and I still use those drawers
[4:01:32] ImposterArchitect: Thats how I used Shelves
[4:01:39] YOUCEP: how far away is the ender io panel?
[4:01:46] DaddyDiddy: the only other thing that's kinda cheap until we get digital storage is if we do logistics pipe but that's expensive to make a sink module for each chest @Giantwaffle
[4:01:50] imeasytokill: are the multiblock chests in the pack?
[4:01:53] Dizz1227: Eating different food increases your health
[4:01:53] TheWonderLlama: Just make junk chests

[4:15:31] StardustDragon08: Right clearly we should all agree it's not 250x250 KEKW pepeLaugh
[4:15:32] kenshin2666: we dont talk about the 3% Kappa

[4:15:34] Yizzles: We're like the 10000 monkeys on typewriters and only one of us got to write Shakespeare
[4:15:39] saintmyles: maths hard
[4:15:40] CiVR: That was year and half ago
[4:15:45] Zafrion: am engineer so I can just admire the maths and not have to actually do it
[4:15:45] Sap_: just do it like tip math! value x 3, then shift the decimal twice!
[4:15:49] KuramaTheF0X: @StardustDragon08 yea cause its 249x249 Nerdge
[4:15:52] MaIlchad: @Miestro we didn't agree on whether we were doing dimensions or pixel count. the rest forgot to square root

[4:17:00] KuramaTheF0X: yea
[4:17:11] Rubinix: Twitter is blowing up over it
[4:17:12] JommyBee: ive seen alot streamers tweeting their thoughts
[4:17:15] OddsTV: @IronGajeel ahh a reply to the zachbussey tweet earlier
[4:17:27] Dracos555: other chats absolutely went off about it
[4:17:30] MaIlchad: like 5 years ago
[4:17:32] Vargh: never?
[4:17:33] xindianx: what happened? TLDR?
[4:17:33] Rolymole09: Long time ago.
[4:17:37] Bored______________: why would they that costs money
[4:17:40] IronGajeel: @OddsTV gotta love the bussey
[4:17:40] Agente_L: that costs money
[4:17:40] 4729_zex: Twitch is dying
[4:17:41] bar10dr: 4k in 2040
[4:17:41] hackett33: I think its clear they cant afford it
[4:17:42] Aaugr: or finally implement AV1
[4:17:42] Iksess: i prefer youtube over twitch
[4:17:43] alextech_1: How about av1 encoding??
[4:17:48] KluDeez: twitch has just progressively gotten worse
[4:17:51] thisisbrad: and fix the warble audio bug
[4:17:51] CiVR: I’ll apply for it and have another dev project to ignore
[4:17:52] dotsin: isnt it technically 960p for true 1:1 bit rate ?
[4:17:54] Rubinix: they'll up the bit rate when they cut another 5% streamer ad revenue
[4:17:55] Dracos555: @Giantwaffle when it was justin lol
[4:17:56] OddsTV: drip feed the amazon money
[4:17:56] TigerLuv: I wish I could have legacy settings
[4:18:02] Kisheen: higher bitrates would be exponentially more expensive,and they're trying to take ad revenue away from streamers
[4:18:03] VenomMellow: reason: money
[4:18:04] MaIlchad: I don't think Twitch can afford to push higher bitrate. they can't even keep around old vods.
[4:18:07] Rolymole09: Screwing sub revenue. Screwing Turbo… now screwing streamers with sponsors. What are they doing right?
[4:18:09] Vargh: @CiVR that's the spirit
[4:18:10] Chalkstix: and the reason is called money
[4:18:12] brightcandle: Its a real challenge to get fast moving games looking OK on twitch bitrate
[4:18:12] weasel9999: that is why they want ad revenue, so they can upgrade the servers. eventually KEKW
[4:18:13] DragonApoc: Facts
[4:18:14] Agente_L: it took them like 6 years to roll out a html 5 player, they are just incompetent let's be honest here

[4:18:19] hisdue: oh that is what I have thanks NOTED
[4:18:21] Whitemage082: wait is that a dev or waffle?
[4:18:25] brightcandle: Its one advantage youtube streaming has, you can put a lot more bits to the problem
[4:18:33] 0omkins: Why do streamers still stay on Twitch if all they do is make bad decisions with better options elsewhere?
[4:18:35] Silver_Skeeter: sometimes the reason ist just someone being stupid
[4:18:38] sleepymisaki: wait I though its just a me thing
[4:18:40] Spikey770: oh shit. @Giantwaffle OTK announced they're leaving twitch if those changes make it through. Tips replied to it on twitter
[4:18:48] Thills_: the sad part is that twitch is owned by amazon right but they dont use AWS for its servers KEKW
[4:18:51] xXLikeANinja1Xx: Not enough consumer support for AV1 yet, they would have to run it along side H264 so it's not worth
[4:18:53] bEC69_: ?
[4:19:05] jberk26: The chat is also wacky af
[4:19:07] MaIlchad: I really don't enjoy streaming on youtube. but its player/bitrate is wildly better. being able to rewind 10 seconds is a GODSEND
[4:19:13] GuardMoony: I've seen streamers leave youtube after 2y when the contract ended
[4:19:14] OddsTV: youre supposed to make normal vids and shorts alongside streams. you CANNOT get big off streams alone in this age
[4:19:15] midnight_alison: it's hard to find people on FB gaming LUL
[4:19:20] KuramaTheF0X: but at the same time, some youtube channesl that have 100k subs or more do Twitch and have 100-200 viewers
[4:19:20] brightcandle: The streaming also hurts your channel too as their algorithm is all wrong

[4:20:07] SirNickGaming: Latency to broadcaster <2 secs
[4:20:07] snurre: Isn't twitch still running on IRC?
[4:20:08] MaIlchad: I think youtube has gotten latency to below 5 seconds depending on settings? Chat is worst part about streaming
[4:20:09] ArdentDuck: does it save any server costs having a delay like that?
[4:20:10] LetMeTellYouWhatToDo: youtube chat just isn't the same

[4:21:13] Rhink: He thinked about it.
[4:21:14] Aarimous: It's a mental thing with YT vids vs Streams
[4:21:14] Kohjex: maybe if there was a cooldown on hearing the chests it would be better
[4:21:16] Vizion_TV: @Alamose WutFace
[4:21:17] Solitude411: bro how many hours have you been building a floor and chest wall

[4:21:48] Apparentthreat: Vods suck at buffering too, still
[4:21:49] boogerbomb01: very rarely
[4:21:51] Dagmoo: @mailchad sorry i meant like back in the day before twitch reduced delay. But yeah agreed its not that bad if its like up to 10-15 sec delay for me
[4:21:52] IronGajeel: only if u change games
[4:21:53] SailorWS: theres no fine scrubbing tho
[4:22:00] KuramaTheF0X: @seanp09 clips

[4:22:14] NuggetSauze: so much time on the floor
[4:22:18] NuggetSauze: lmao

[4:28:15] MaIlchad: yeah there's no way. even if you survive it you will have poor depth adjustment. something I'm struggling with.
[4:28:16] dotsin: myopic is just nearsighted

[4:28:46] OddsTV: @Vizion_TV im hovering close to LE so maybe 4:3 is now the play KEKW
[4:28:46] TigerLuv: they said they optimized the headset for myopia
[4:28:48] dotsin: you can condition your eyes into all types of -opias
[4:28:51] StOrMy1100: There is
[4:28:53] AkitaTau: playing GTNH is also a medical condition
[4:28:57] sablefoxx26c: what i read is that it widens the character models
[4:28:58] StOrMy1100: Larger heads
[4:29:00] xxLatte: frame rate?
[4:29:01] Hitoearth: You?
[4:29:02] fbritoferreira: And cs2 has removed binds
[4:29:02] SimonSez: The trend started before screens were invented. It's evolutionary
[4:29:03] orangecreamsicle3: https://clips.twitch.tv/SwissTameSpaghettiTBTacoRight-_DaeulczAl5IFUP7

[4:29:11] 4729_zex: He might experience retina detachment
[4:29:12] ninopanda: someone do 300 bits
[4:29:15] Janzert: they mentioned it not because of staring at screens but that time outdoors as a kid has been shown to have a correlation in lessening it
[4:29:21] sleepymisaki: still laughin about that myopia awareness into apple vision pro transition OMEGALUL
[4:29:26] MetinCS: The main reason people played 4:3 back in the day was because computers were shit at Lan till 2016-17
[4:29:28] Onred: omg this conversation was in the DBD community when they had a problem with stretched rez. You always have those people who scream "no advantage" when it's false
[4:29:29] lgamer7: 3% 1600 x 900  = 48 x 27 3% 1920 x 1080 = 57.6 x 32.4

[4:29:43] n00rman_: players look closer on 4:3 stretched, preference thing
[4:29:44] Janzert: yep
[4:29:44] Renny_S: people just find it easier to see
[4:29:45] dotsin: wrong
[4:29:45] saintmyles: and they're less time outside because of.... screens
[4:29:46] TheWumbologist101: it makes sense

[4:29:59] ninopanda: :P
[4:29:59] TigerLuv: as a kid there was no computers, and I have myopia
[4:30:00] Infra_Roodborstje: My eyes got from -1 to -6 in a span of 7 years by using the computer
[4:30:01] maccabeus: outdoors also means more UV exposure to your eyes, which is probably bad long term
[4:30:03] AshhanX: its almost certainly just preference
[4:30:03] Vizion_TV: And on this topic, I will put on my Blue Light Glasses L)
[4:30:06] 4729_zex: yes
[4:30:06] OddsTV: now the vision pro wants us to take our screens outside YEP
[4:30:07] MaIlchad: I've found lack of looking at things in the distance made my far-field depth adjustment poor. I think its trainable. being inside causes it.
[4:30:08] fbritoferreira: Models are fatter
[4:30:11] phriisk: What percent of your screen is your webcam?
[4:30:17] Silver_Skeeter: wtf

[4:30:26] xxLatte: fortnite they do it so they don’t have to move mouse vertically as much i think to build
[4:30:27] mmDust: whether someone is myopic or hyperopic is based upon the anatomy of the eye at birth
[4:30:27] JJaaYY: Less pixels so easier to tell when color changes?
[4:30:29] iTents: Increased head size, decreased field of view. Same accuracy
[4:30:34] midnight_alison: can you change resoulation for Minecraft please?

[4:41:58] Allmostdone: @Nexhunter I'm cryig tears over that
[4:42:07] rajahgold: love engine building
[4:42:08] Nexhunter: @MaIlchad i already suck at it
[4:42:12] StardustDragon08: @TheMeowstardCat I've heard 8k hours thrown around?

[4:42:30] Thills_: fuck thats kinda sick
[4:42:36] le_Pure: if this is an ad its bigger than 3% TrollDespair
[4:42:44] MaIlchad: @Nexhunter sounds like a skill issue. In all seriousness 1 indexing in Lua is a choice, it takes very little effort to make it 0 indexed. or how about -42 indexed?
[4:42:45] SparkyMCJesus: @fbritoferreira windows 11 LUL
[4:42:49] OddsTV: basically advertising

[4:43:14] weasel9999: no 6 hour setup YEP
[4:43:16] Obliviron: it's a bad idea for a company, because they are relying on tabletop sim letting them operate. But they could just pivot to a real video game dev company if tabletop sim shuts them down @Giantwaffle
[4:43:17] Bweggar: NOTED
[4:43:19] StardustDragon08: @TheMeowstardCat pulled from their wiki "The average estimate for completing GT:NH is over 8,000 hours, for someone who knows what they're doing."

[4:43:50] MaIlchad: @Nexhunter it's not my suggestion its just an offering from the web wolfsSIP I will leave it at 1 indexing because its convenient, 0 indexing is unintuitive
[4:43:50] Infra_Roodborstje: Tabletop shutting down ICANT
[4:43:51] OddsTV: tabletop sim would literally be carried by the community if it ever got shut down

[4:54:27] Sir_Darkstar: you’re asking Amazon to be rational

[4:54:46] Makaheehee: But that costs money.. Kappa

[4:54:47] Chalkstix: that's called socialism
[4:54:51] RainDoc: They are not doing that. You as American still pay 5dollars or subs. In the rest of the world changed, it depends on the country so streamers of other countries get even less
[4:54:52] nl_r1o: and you lose less streamers to other platforms as well
[4:54:53] Luxen77: that would never work Kappa
[4:55:04] BigDumbAnimal: Twitch is no longer for the streamers, it's for the Amazon share holders.
[4:55:10] OddsTV: @Zalhat new twitch rules, esport events cant show big ads anymore, so they cant make money broadcasting to twitch. like CSGO
[4:55:11] MisterRabbitHead: twitch literally forgot to increase local sub prices for Turkey so I can subscribe for 40 cents peepoEZ

[4:55:29] Travess: Wonder how much it costs twitch for each person watching? like energy / bandwidth / maintenance.
[4:55:31] MaIlchad: encouraging people making 6 figures to leave their platform means you lose 6 figures of revenue....
[4:55:32] shankwolf: is twitch profitable? or stilla  money sink for amazon
[4:55:33] Infra_Roodborstje: xqc xqcL
[4:55:38] Cantide1: Amazon is a paperclip maximizer
[4:55:38] LeBeauTV: he has already hinted that he isnt going down
[4:55:39] BallForceOne: Is it like taxes where the split only gets reduced for anything after 6 figures?
[4:55:40] Nexhunter: @shankwolf no streaming platform is profitable
[4:55:49] mkam225: 6 figures is barely middle class in a lot of places now lol

[4:56:01] Obsidian_Vanir: Waffle: Past a certain threshold, what incentive does Twitch have to have streamers stream more? If they stream enough to still generate their full # of subs, any more just costs them money on hosting/bandwidth (insane or not)
[4:56:02] enki1337: another Cory Doctrow fan, I see YEP
[4:56:03] Nexhunter: hell kick is gonna go the same route or just be dead when the owners of stake meet the US federal gov KEKW
[4:56:03] Iksess: when did last time someone left twitch, everyone is to paranoid after ninja did it, and then who is ninja nowdays
[4:56:05] Travess: Like, does each view cost Twitch more than one cent?
[4:56:07] devlyn187: As much as everyone complains about this.. without Prime Subs.. none of this matters?

[4:56:26] R1Rider01: taxes are a bitch, lol
[4:56:31] LeBeauTV: the problem with twitch's model isnt the big streamers. It the thousands of mid to small streamers that cost more money on bandwidth than they return for the platform
[4:56:35] Chalkstix: who's making all the money from those crazy rents?
[4:56:36] resku89: isnt sodas rent 15k a month in his penthouse?
[4:56:36] warlock_1984: dual audio will be nice to mute just music if you want to listen your music with stream
[4:56:37] drankanddank: i think twitch has this misconception that they can lose individual creators and there will always be another up and comer to replace them.
[4:56:39] mkam225: Which is hilarious since you can work from almost anywhere
[4:56:39] fbritoferreira: Taxes are not cheap when you making 6 figures
[4:56:40] Nexhunter: @LeBeauTV yep
[4:56:43] OddsTV: @Zalhat the events are, if they cant show ads they dont get paid from those ads. so why be on twitch if they cant show the ads that get them money to run the event
[4:56:48] Nexhunter: change to what platform KEKW
[4:56:54] shankwolf: is twitch as a service isnt profitable is it likely twitch will ever up the creator cut
[4:56:56] aeadon: Imagine if your company cut your paycheck and was like "just move for cheaper col lmao"
[4:57:00] Iksess: @Nexhunter waffle makes it sound like people would leave just coz twitch is bad, not coz they got offered
[4:57:01] Nexhunter: unless the other platform gives them money they're gonna be worse off
[4:57:01] MrSneevle: just hard to feel sorry for them
[4:57:02] THEgoodCOW: @Giantwaffle there is only one type of sign, then other ones are from tinkers
[4:57:02] Makaheehee: Wait what. Soda is in a penthouse paying 15k a month now a days? Wtf
[4:57:05] devlyn187: But they did choose to stream on Twitch.. where Amazon subsidizes huge percentages of thier income.. which didn't previously exist.

[6:12:27] thepolaroidbear: iPad was memed super hard at first
[6:12:28] AviNex_: i mean the audience audibly gasped when they released the price
[6:12:31] StardustDragon08: @Miestro meh. Wouldn't call it that\
[6:12:34] FingerGames: KEKW
[6:12:35] webbsk: oh no! lol
[6:12:38] Thills_: ICANT
[6:12:44] GFQPR1882: OOF

[6:12:47] Moobot: Pati and the crew are restarting GT: New Horizons because they are complete Chads. Waffle is playing until the Despairge sets in | Get the pack at gtnh.miraheze.org/wiki/Main_Page
[6:12:49] daemonaedryn: oof
[6:12:49] boogerbomb01: Thats how advanced it is
[6:12:51] Krystalchan: KEKW Vision Pro is just gonna be in the same hole as Hololens. Industry/Corp only
[6:12:54] enki1337: Do you not have credit cards?
[6:12:59] D1CKENSS: idk im not gonna doubt apple
[6:12:59] Rangetuur: how people react today is very different then 17 years ago i think
[6:13:00] GuardMoony: i saw a youtube of someone who tested it. and he thought it was 120hz refresh rate
[6:13:03] molson82: It will get cheaper over time
[6:13:06] molson82: It's the first one
[6:13:10] chadaccountant: Hailing thunder storm on long island right now
[6:13:13] Math354e: But do you think the headset is stupid or just the price
[6:13:14] molson82: Just like folding phones.
[6:13:14] Apparentthreat: Why not have Gen 1 be a peripheral instead of a whole ass computer
[6:13:15] Krystalchan: Hololens is still doing *decent*
[6:13:16] OddsTV: i see it as a dev kit until a more economical model comes out 5-10 years from now
[6:13:16] Jibbur: why does the minimap have ore on it?
[6:13:22] 00cosmo: apple doesn't like gaming
[6:13:23] hermionelgc: @Giantwaffle The iphone was something that would make life much easier and more convenient while being affordable. The vision pro is very niche and not affordable for average people
[6:13:24] AviNex_: the sports stuff was kinda cool though
[6:13:25] brightcandle: The existing market is all gaming, your headset has to be gaming AND
[6:13:26] Jodeatre: i want holodeck tech
[6:13:26] boogerbomb01: Sev showed the specs for the upcoming Quest 3 and it looks way better

[6:13:36] MinusKills: wrong tile
[6:13:37] Jibbur: ah, that is pretty cool
[6:13:39] Xev_00: The VIsion Pro won't change the world. But IF the eye based input control is as good as they claim, that might.
[6:13:39] Mechill: stop wrong stone
[6:13:40] extrasaulty: when you are a company worth almost 3 trillion dollars, I think they forget what the value of money is
[6:13:41] Miestro: @StardustDragon08 why not, the only actually new bit is the in headset eye tracking and maybe the resolution
[6:13:41] Jibbur: that it shows you
[6:13:46] Apparentthreat: @boogerbomb01 and it's 1/7 the price
[6:13:50] Alamose: why stone and not marble?
[6:13:51] daemonaedryn: is that the right tile?
[6:13:51] Strider1515: the ad placement alone in the headset is huge
[6:13:51] boogerbomb01: yep

[6:14:02] jmm548: id like full dive
[6:14:03] Ghostfdw: Wrong block
[6:14:04] Kisheen: @Xev_00 But it's an Apple product, it will never hit the mass market and will always be a hyperinflated price.
[6:14:04] OtonP: KEKW
[6:14:04] Jibbur: AR I think has FAR more productivity
[6:14:04] daemonaedryn: Brainrot
[6:14:05] MinusKills: Pepega
[6:14:06] AviNex_: do you think we're gonna have a real life SAO incident hmjj
[6:14:06] 2Flip: KEKW
[6:14:07] philip0524: I want to see UE5 VR
[6:14:08] Catdaddyneff: oooooooop
[6:14:11] zissouthebear: @Xev_00 From people who have had the chance to test it yesterday, it sounds like the eye based input is absolutely insane with how good it is
[6:14:12] AleXanDreMau: KEKW
[6:14:16] GeneralSpoon12: I want to be able to be in guild leadership in a VRMMO. That is my ask
[6:14:17] MisterRabbitHead: I dont know you guys but my employer will not buy 3.5k VR sets for productivity and I am not doing that myself
[6:14:23] Nuuf: StillWaiting still waiting for full dive VR
[6:14:23] Miestro: @StardustDragon08 the quest has passthrough using the external tracking cameras
[6:14:24] SimonSez: In 10 years the technology will be in contact lenses
[6:14:30] Thills_: @AviNex_ monkaS would be kinda cool but scary
[6:14:35] StardustDragon08: @Miestro Quest is still just VR
[6:14:42] P0tat0killer: yea
[6:14:42] Xev_00: I mean yeah

[6:14:58] MrSilverMatch: Architects will buy them by the crate
[6:14:59] asagura: My work laptops are 4k and 5k. But VR, hell nah. Not a dime
[6:15:00] Stragmol: if you're selling $15M properties maybe
[6:15:01] MofuLord: aint no way it's replacing a physical keyboard OMEGALUL

[6:15:12] philip0524: Like that wheels for the Apple pc
[6:15:13] webbsk: the hardware budget is 5 years long right now
[6:15:13] Apparentthreat: I have 8 cores, 32 GB ram, a quadro, and it's less than that headset
[6:15:14] Jodeatre: why would anyone have a macbook?
[6:15:15] k0nk_: network eng here, 5k laptop from work @Giantwaffle

[6:15:16] Catdaddyneff: battery tho :(
[6:15:18] ImposterArchitect: and it has a 2 hr battery lol
[6:15:19] StardustDragon08: It's about how you sell it to those with the4 buying power in your company KEKW
[6:15:21] NoFeaR_Tv: It probably just needs to be proven
[6:15:27] Docgalaad: wrong
[6:15:28] ImposterArchitect: actually, the laptop was 5.5 when it was new
[6:15:29] webbsk: no
[6:15:31] kappathirteen: So less than half LUL

[6:15:54] MSPaintEnthusiast: UI dev stuff
[6:15:55] StardustDragon08: @Jodeatre why do you use a computer
[6:16:00] Krystalchan: I think fields like an architect might have a good use for the new lens. ability to visualize the structure and what not
[6:16:00] StOrMy1100: CTRL F?
[6:16:02] WCNMat: they just work, and they are great at web browsers and basic productivity without dealing with bullshit microsoft changes
[6:16:02] Sap_: My team is java and kotlin and we use macbooks
[6:16:04] earthtowers: I know macs get used a lot in graphics, but I dont see a lot of them elsewhere
[6:16:11] Lidl_Username: we all use macs both front backend and mobile native devs
[6:16:14] Sir_Darkstar: My sisters job, managing/training Nurses in a hospital department gave her a laptop, a desktop with four monitors in her office. Jelly

[6:16:53] Xev_00: I work on Windows, game on Linux, and dev on Mac
[6:16:54] kenshin2666: ^
[6:16:56] subfin: Mac is nice because is closer to linux which is nice for a lot of development
[6:16:59] ublighthero: @webbsk actually they are...I work for 1 and specifically with the dev team.
[6:17:00] Kisheen: Chat  just doesn't understand enterprise budgeting. An employee costs 70k+ a year, a few grand for a laptop is nothing
[6:17:01] Ransaked1: You are not reading it correctly
[6:17:04] thisisjdavis: how about a chat poll?
[6:17:07] Docgalaad: 1 mac for 100 devs. Who has it ? The web designer.
[6:17:07] SimonSez: I only run Linux now :)

[6:17:33] FREEZE_ball: its not strange, Linux is solid for gaming rn
[6:17:33] Miestro: pepople can use multiple
[6:17:33] earthtowers: drives us nuts, because we have to redesign huge parts of the environment to integrate them
[6:17:33] RamseyRinehaus: love WSL for work
[6:17:33] MrSilverMatch: More than 100% total
[6:17:34] Xev_00: Susge

[6:17:40] kenshin2666: 136% of users KEKW

[6:17:44] BiJay0: multiple choice
[6:17:44] AviNex_: I use more than one

[6:18:25] thunderdan11: @Giantwaffle i think it is that of the people that own one what do they use it for
[6:18:38] ImposterArchitect: Yeah, fortune 100 here.  Mac's require a VP to sign off on the exception
[6:18:39] Hietsom: @jmm548 same
[6:18:40] CoolReal: It shows % of all the user count
[6:18:43] Miestro: it was multiple choice. I fill out that survey every year
[6:18:44] Jibbur: 30% people use mac, but maybe 50% of those use linux also
[6:18:45] jmm548: cohhGG
[6:18:46] MrSilverMatch: Percent of responses but multiple platforms per response

[6:18:53] i_W4tCH_i: Two subjects, professional and users
[6:18:54] AviNex_: i cant believe more people use linux than mac
[6:18:57] Krystalchan: Chat you dont compare the % to the other OSs, its of responses
[6:19:25] bigfrank23183: How's the healing axe going
[6:19:25] bobolpwnz: dinkDonk

[6:23:00] Rubinix: 3 or 4 years
[6:23:01] Shroadie: they didnt get ejected, they just had to go to the lockeroom because there was less than 2 minutes in the game so they have to go back to the locker room because its less than the amount of penalty they need to serve. Thats very common in a blowout like that
[6:23:01] SawyerStreamsStuff: 6 i think

[7:06:53] Helo_KiX: It's literally a regression, all systems need to use descriminators. As more people are online it's harder to get the name you want.
[7:06:53] StOrMy1100: @ClumsyZombie Whats your date?
[7:06:53] rektumtv: how do you your name

[7:10:49] tgrambin: tgrambin subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 20 months! 
[7:10:50] Thills_: the scummy part was discord workers taking YTers and streamer names
[7:10:51] script_terror: maybe give you first dibs
[7:10:54] boogerbomb01: What a horrendous time for Discord to do something so stupid
[7:10:56] ShadowBlade72: @bensmcc I had to go back to look. I bought Minecraft Sep 6th 2010.

[7:11:48] kotwin: @Vizion_TV take Vizion Pro Kappa
[7:11:51] Kounga: I'm hyped for discord pulse now
[7:11:51] GeneralSpoon12: If you are company like Discord that has been hemorrhaging money forever, and you think you have 10% chance to take Twitter's place, do you do it?
[7:11:55] Niller2005: You could just change your number with nitro anyways LUL
[7:11:55] Moobot: You can sub to Waffle by clicking this neat link -> twitch.tv/giantwaffle/subscribe SUBprise
[7:12:02] Vizion_TV: @Vizion_TV ITS TOO LATE. You're a legend though.

[7:12:14] jmm548: it recomended mine with otu the numbers
[7:12:14] Apparentthreat: what do you expect
[7:12:15] DuctTapeNinja_: twitch just tweeted that they will rewrite and make ad contect policy more clearly
[7:12:15] szabikkkka: it gave me the suggestion without the number now

[7:12:19] munko: just got it pop up, sept 29 2015 no nitro

[7:12:21] Helo_KiX: Mine suggested my name with an underscore in front
[7:12:24] DoPlusSee: Not when I did mine, my discord name was DPS and it suggested DPS Without the Numbers
[7:12:24] Igneous3: im all set then
[7:12:31] munko: and was able to get my name
[7:12:32] Apparentthreat: it's almost like people like their username
[7:12:32] ShadowBlade72: That's going to work for the first wave.  Once it goes on, you won't be able to get just your name without the #0000
[7:12:33] RafaLorenzo: My name  on discord. My Name 69
[7:12:33] Tuskon15: it suggested mine to be .tuskon rather than anything with numbers
[7:12:34] Nexhunter: @TheMeowstardCat wait so they're killing the TS beta already OMEGALUL
[7:12:34] Zucate: for me the suggestion was just my display name

[7:12:43] NevaDaha: good thing noone has my name anywhere KEKW
[7:12:46] m0nkeyman_14: where do you go to get your name
[7:12:47] Nexhunter: https://twitter.com/Twitch/status/1666183145526538240 @Giantwaffle walkback has begun
[7:12:48] Marenti: not the OG giant? Kappa
[7:12:54] MrArrig: If everyone had just taken the same number they had it would've been funny as it would functionally be the same
[7:12:55] Helo_KiX: Helo is already taken because of BSG (I picked the name before the character existed)
[7:12:55] Marcopach: Gotmine :D ty
[7:13:01] GFQPR1882: They should call it concord . discord devs if u take my idea I want 10% waffleGun :)

[7:13:21] Nexhunter: ads are the biggest source of revenue
[7:13:24] TheMeowstardCat: Now why can not Discord roll back their username shit lol
[7:13:29] Pekter: mrBeast tweet LUL
[7:13:30] jmm548: cause people make more money from sponsers then twitch
[7:13:32] Nexhunter: also Cohh with his hate on regional sub pricing Susge
[7:13:47] Marenti: this is a better reaction than reddit did LUL
[7:13:58] Pekter: ???

[7:22:12] Filikeu: @Giantwaffle it's funny the verbiage they use to excuse the change pretending it's to benefit streamers and not twitch hitself lol
[7:22:14] maccabeus: we're talking about it :)

[7:22:36] Jolle450: Youtube, Twitch and Floatplane
[7:22:36] monkky110: leave twitch
[7:22:37] ninjakirby: Twitch is gonna lose some people lol
[7:22:38] topgunnerccl: tons of slammer creators stream on tiktok too
[7:22:38] tripwires: they're just gonna ditch twitch
[7:22:40] Vizion_TV: The most recent Big CSGO tourney was broadcast to their channel and their own site too lol
[7:22:43] yoVespart: What
[7:22:43] brightcandle: They are all going to choose the other platforms
[7:22:43] AndyHayes: nah Riot and etc have media deals that supercede this type of thing
[7:22:43] Svardmastaren: Think about the CSGO major or ESL
[7:22:45] Yakobro: ???
[7:22:45] Systox: LTT stays on YT
[7:22:45] Chalkstix: most of the streamers on twitch don't actually understand any of this
[7:22:47] mrkaszkeit: Will they ban them over streaming on floatplane? their own platfor?
[7:22:48] DonGromus: League of Legends Esport streams to YT Twitch and something else can't remember
[7:22:50] bballaustin: twitch is a phone app
[7:22:51] jmm548: that tiktok is still ok
[7:22:51] 0X_0: Tiktok
[7:22:55] EZL1190: Don't need a Mac just need an ISO and VM
[7:22:56] Nexhunter: mobile first
[7:22:57] PaulFlies: This seems a bit 'cut you nose off to spite your face'
[7:22:58] Nexhunter: so TikTok
[7:23:01] GFQPR1882: Is twitch looking to get people to leave ???
[7:23:03] Tabakhase: Insta/Tik for example in the music-bubble
[7:23:06] L707644: Twitch is just trying to bully them and get that money. Extortion in other words..
[7:23:07] drummernerd: TikTok has no web interface, right?
[7:23:08] ShadowBlade72: Linus also streams to Floatplane. So he's for sure done with Twitch.
[7:23:08] Stretford_Sean: It seems like it was moved so that it now applies to everyone rather than just partners
[7:23:08] Igneous3: nasa
[7:23:09] Nexhunter: yea
[7:23:11] kane1941: Stream in discord Pog
[7:23:11] Jamswhat2: yea
[7:23:13] ninjakirby: HAHHAHAHHA
[7:23:14] bmac66: Push Tiktok stream  to youtube ?
[7:23:15] SwekAap: @drummernerd it does
[7:23:16] Bloodshot234: why does Twitch keep shooting themselves in the foot?
[7:23:17] Jolle450: It says "extended period of time" How long is that?
[7:23:18] Nexhunter: discord is desktop first @kane1941
[7:23:18] GeneralSpoon12: KEKW
[7:23:19] Yakobro: @Giantwaffle what about stuff like the game awards or directs...
[7:23:21] AndyHayes: guys 100% the big companies like Riot/ESL/CR have media streaming deals and aren't affected by this
[7:23:21] Nexhunter: @Giantwaffle cause it mobile first
[7:23:22] yoVespart: Wtf
[7:23:24] Nexhunter: not desktop friendly
[7:23:25] CaptainAlkohol: my god what is twitch doing
[7:23:26] Askjong: no
[7:23:28] Helo_KiX: TikTok has a website
[7:23:30] MinusKills: gotta watch wanshow on tiktok KEKW
[7:23:31] 2Flip: whats the point of doing that lol
[7:23:31] Apparentthreat: you can login to tiktok on pc
[7:23:31] SwekAap: tiktok has a website tho
[7:23:34] jmm548: correct
[7:23:34] Askjong: tiktok is also a website
[7:23:35] Nexhunter: the website sucks ass chat
[7:23:35] Jibbur: a mobile app is web based
[7:23:35] Jolle450: It says "extended period of time" How long is that? @Giantwaffle
[7:23:36] anbhuu: Tikok has website
[7:23:37] Silver_Skeeter: what about nintendo direct?
[7:23:39] stormballe: @Giantwaffle  you didnt like diablo 4 ?
[7:23:40] jmm548: u can
[7:23:40] Bloodshot234: you can
[7:23:40] yoVespart: But it says Mobile-first
[7:23:42] Nexhunter: it not desktop first it mobile first
[7:23:43] VanDomand: has this already gone through?
[7:23:44] Jibbur: its not browser based, but is web based.
[7:23:44] Rolymole09: But tiktok has websites yes
[7:23:45] FREEZE_ball: no, tiktok is okay because its government KEKW
[7:23:50] Askjong: you can
[7:23:50] pwrreset: youtube is mobile app
[7:23:54] maccabeus: @FREEZE_ball KEKW
[7:23:54] Feist_: What if Linus broadcasts on YouTube then simulcasts to twitch? Kappa
[7:23:56] Chalkstix: how is tiktok not web-based?
[7:23:58] XyneTheFirst: What is not "web based", seriously.
[7:24:00] kane1941: Can someone restream you ?
[7:24:03] VanDomand: because i would think that the big corpos would not like this like tencent or something for league esports and stuff
[7:24:03] GFQPR1882: Who watches TikTok shit KEKW
[7:24:05] Nexhunter: @Chalkstix cause it is mobile first in implementation
[7:24:08] Chalkstix: yeah sure it's an app, but so is google chrome
[7:24:14] Vizion_TV: They are going to lose every awards show, every esport, every Major streamer, and every large release event @Giantwaffle
[7:24:21] yoVespart: They specified mobile-first in implementation
[7:24:23] Askjong: Twitter streaming!
[7:24:28] Nexhunter: TikTok is seen as your phone app
[7:24:29] Jellyjaymon: Its says in terms that unless you have written permission to do so
[7:24:32] Nexhunter: not as a desktop site
[7:24:32] rell3k: could you not just WATCH your own stream off youtube on twitch to circumvent this? :<
[7:24:35] Apparentthreat: @GFQPR1882 ReallyMad
[7:24:40] brightcandle: A lot of the big events are gone then
[7:24:40] SaltyGoldfish01: @Giantwaffle i believe this was a rule since the beggining no ?
[7:24:44] drummernerd: What is with all these companies speedrunning their demises?
[7:24:45] Kandarjr: Sooo the last tournament of csgo cant be made like they did?
[7:24:45] anbhuu: So if you have a friend restream your stream to another platform for you its ok?
[7:24:45] Nexhunter: @SaltyGoldfish01 yes
[7:24:47] GFQPR1882: @apparentthreat LUL
[7:24:47] 0x000000: there much more
[7:24:56] Nexhunter: they were never enforcing the TOS
[7:24:59] Chalkstix: @Nexhunter but isn't the point of the mobile tiktok app still that it's connected to the web?
[7:24:59] restfulblue: @Vizion_TV i disagree, i think everyone will just complain for a wekk and forget about it :)
[7:24:59] Nexhunter: so will they begin now
[7:24:59] Apparentthreat: @GFQPR1882 how do you think I get through the work day pepeLaugh
[7:24:59] yoVespart: I love companies burning themselves to deth
[7:24:59] Nexhunter: no
[7:25:02] VanDomand: Twitch just lost every esport event ever LOL
[7:25:02] kane1941: Like what happens if some other 3rd party restreams Twitch SpaceX broadcast to Youtube?
[7:25:02] D1CKENSS: no chance
[7:25:05] brightcandle: They are focussing on the interactive streamers over and above big event streams
[7:25:06] szabikkkka: chat dont be stupid, they will allow events for $$$
[7:25:08] PaulFlies: events will get exceptions
[7:25:11] drummernerd: Unless its govt KEKW
[7:25:11] CPUfreezer: even their own? like rivals? KEKW
[7:25:14] anbhuu: They probably want events to be exclusive on Twitch
[7:25:16] Nexhunter: @Giantwaffle but will they ever enforce their TOS no KEKW
[7:25:17] fbritoferreira: Cs2 update released
[7:25:17] earthtowers: I bet theyll backtrack on events
[7:25:18] brightcandle: Its a weird choice, I don't see even why they needed to make it
[7:25:18] holypt: @Giantwaffle did you see Asmongold saying he is pursuing another platform as of today?
[7:25:20] JoxerTheM1ghty: The events will be fine. They will have separate deals
[7:25:22] GFQPR1882: @apparentthreat Watching shit I guess KEKW waffleLove
[7:25:22] Zucate: good thing they did this 2 days before SGF
[7:25:23] MinusKills: so it begins, fall of twitch
[7:25:24] xxLatte: So confusing why they’re doing this lol
[7:25:24] LokiRulez: what was the sponsor one they changed @Giantwaffle
[7:25:24] Kounga: They have more competition than ever and they try to pull this out
[7:25:28] hackett33: because money
[7:25:33] Nexhunter: well non profit events are exempted
[7:25:34] Jellyjaymon: it says without advance written permission from Twitch
[7:25:36] SaltyGoldfish01: true, because money
[7:25:37] nAZAr1uS: which events???
[7:25:37] Dizz1227: Is this the actual TOS?
[7:25:40] fbritoferreira: Esports majors are gone like the csgo one
[7:25:42] ShadowBlade72: Twitch is just forcing them to choose.  They can either come to Twitch where all the people are, or not.
[7:25:42] Apparentthreat: so this even applies to having a different "stream" on the youtube side at the same time?
[7:25:49] pwrreset: pretty sure that does not includes streamers with contracts
[7:25:50] Silver_Skeeter: maybe Sony or Nintendo don't count as "Streamers"?
[7:25:50] Myekos: yeah, no special treatment
[7:25:50] johnnnnieg: Unless events pay big money i think they wont be allowed to stream on multiple platforms
[7:25:50] Jeraa122: they think that they gonna monopolize on the other platforms and people gonna want to just stream to twitch
[7:25:51] Vizion_TV: And if events get exceptions, then I have an event every day in my stream :)
[7:25:52] charlies_reverie: @holypt i dont think he did though i doubt he has much interest
[7:25:53] thisisbrad: blast was already promoting their own streaming site during Paris major, so 900k viewers gets a pass?
[7:25:53] Yemtron: @Giantwaffle Now you can't stream tech events on youtube to us :(
[7:25:54] HobbyMonkey: i think twitch isn't afraid of people leaving when they will if this continues
[7:25:57] Nexhunter: @Apparentthreat it for simulcasting
[7:25:58] jmm548: i bet in the new rules once they clarify it will exempt events
[7:26:00] ShadowBlade72: It's an all or nothing gamble.
[7:26:01] jmm548: true
[7:26:05] Tabeus_: true
[7:26:07] Apparentthreat: @Nexhunter flip the camera peepoEZ
[7:26:12] Grimholde: They are in competition with you tube for live content. It was only a matter of time
[7:26:17] brightcandle: This is going to hurt them more than it helps
[7:26:17] holypt: @holypt he did tho. During his stream. Will whisper you the clip
[7:26:22] Chalkstix: imo, the worst part about Twitch is that all this is so one-sided. There's no communication with streamers and compromises
[7:26:23] DragonApoc: Oh sweet summer child, you don’t understand business like they do
[7:26:23] Alamose: because they want money, they don't care to grow it
[7:26:23] SimonSez: On Trovo you get a sub button from day 1
[7:26:24] Nexhunter: @Grimholde it always been the rule just never enforced
[7:26:27] yorkzOG: tiktok would be attacking china again
[7:26:29] AleXanDreMau: @Giantwaffle Its not COPIUM its about money! if you want to make a show and stream on twitch you give money to amazon and bomm permission to stream!
[7:26:29] drummernerd: Yea, this is omega dumb
[7:26:31] Dizz1227: Keep in mind that your reading an article and not the actual TOS/
[7:26:33] brightcandle: But I bet things like CS:GO don't get many donations as they aren't interactive?
[7:26:34] Jellyjaymon: @Giantwaffle go to the twitch terms it says without advance written permission from Twitch
[7:26:36] Chalkstix: Twitch is honestly one of the absolute worst workplaces
[7:26:37] thisisbrad: its more about squeezing at this point like netflix sharing crackdown
[7:26:40] Grimholde: Exactly
[7:26:41] GFQPR1882: YEP
[7:26:44] restfulblue: i don't think these changes suppose to grow twitch, most probably it should increase income from current audience
[7:26:47] Pekter: they had to pull the PR department with the reaction of the streamers
[7:26:48] Jibbur: the advertising one I can see being an attempt to standardize what kind of content is on the site for more uniform info
[7:26:49] Aaugr: They dont like not getting a cut from the sponsors
[7:26:54] Strider1515: have you ever thought that they are trying to thin the herd a little, maybe they think they have to many partners already
[7:26:55] Askjong: OTK might be leaving twitch
[7:27:01] cosmicblip: can you link that page
[7:27:15] Giantwaffle: https://www.twitch.tv/p/en/legal/terms-of-service/#11-simulcasting
[7:27:16] Math354e: does most streamers not have in their contracts that they can't muti stream
[7:27:17] thisisbrad: YEAHBUT7TV
[7:27:19] SaltyGoldfish01: KEKW
[7:27:22] drummernerd: "without advvance permission frm Twitch"
[7:27:23] haitham506: KEKW
[7:27:25] Nexhunter: @Math354e yes
[7:27:26] Jakodii: !gtnh
[7:27:26] Moobot: Pati and the crew are restarting GT: New Horizons because they are complete Chads. Waffle is playing until the Despairge sets in | Get the pack at gtnh.miraheze.org/wiki/Main_Page
[7:27:26] hangoalo84: Lol
[7:27:27] GFQPR1882: LUL waffleD
[7:27:34] SwekAap: hasnt this been a thing for ages though? i thought partners were not allowed to simulcast anyway unless this is for normal streamers too
[7:27:36] Spikey770: It says you can get written consent
[7:27:40] jmm548: all partners and afiliates say u cant
[7:27:41] Nexhunter: @Math354e then they removed exclusivity so folks could stream elsewhere but simulcast always been tos
[7:27:42] Kandarjr: The "without advance written prermission" is the key for events
[7:27:43] Dizz1227: "Without advanced written permission from Twitch" sounds to me these events can still get permission
[7:27:44] Askjong: this applies for everyone
[7:27:48] jmm548: correct
[7:27:49] UKWILD23: ???
[7:27:52] PaulFlies: there is 'without advance written permission from Twitch'
[7:27:53] SaltyGoldfish01: that is so wierd
[7:27:53] D1CKENSS: yikes
[7:27:54] Chalkstix: if only streamers would talk together and unite a front
[7:27:58] holypt: @charlies_reverie check that link I sent you with Asmongolds being pissed
[7:27:58] drummernerd: YEP
[7:27:58] Moobot: Come join the Waffle House Discord! <# https://discord.gg/fhGFtMuzdS
[7:28:03] munskin: What about the events from Nintendo, Sony etc..?
[7:28:04] 0x000000: do you have an end date for the contract?
[7:28:11] hipsi85: they own you DansGame aka slavery Kappa
[7:28:14] john_wicks_beagle: Whaaat? Thats so fucked up you can't
[7:28:14] JoxerTheM1ghty: Backdoor deals will always be there for some
[7:28:15] Nexhunter: @munskin there are commercial activity same rule
[7:28:20] Tabakhase: this very page yesterday - no "simulcasting" section at all LUL https://web.archive.org/web/20230605152231/https://www.twitch.tv/p/en/legal/terms-of-service/
[7:28:22] ShadowBlade72: LTT is definitely going to get an exception for at least Floatplane.  It's literally their premium platform.
[7:28:28] Math354e: so it's not really a new rule
[7:28:30] Obsidian_Vanir: Money money money!
[7:28:31] Stretford_Sean: People will assume they can do it because others do
[7:28:31] SaltyGoldfish01: sketchy AF
[7:28:33] Crothgeb: I feel they are making people choose them or other services in hopes they can draw the audience back to twitch, but with all the other changes they are making it’s actually pushing the people away.
[7:28:37] Nexhunter: @munskin but there is no chat interaction so it probably wouldn't be a violation of the TOS
[7:28:39] thisisbrad: then you dont
[7:28:39] Yakobro: I really wish youtube would improve its social stuff to make twitch actually try
[7:28:41] mephisto__ttv: no :)
[7:28:45] HeyAFrozenZebra: I started on this platform during the JustinTV days, never thought it would turn into this
[7:28:45] Tompop23: Can’t wait for the intern to forget to submit the paperwork and a massive event gets shutdown
[7:28:47] Dagmoo: Let the double backtracking commence KEKW
[7:28:47] Voltrah7: Adding friction is the opposite of what they need to do to grow their brand
[7:28:49] maccabeus: straight to jail
[7:28:50] SaltyGoldfish01: u dont generate money = u dont get the benefits (=
[7:28:50] SimonSez: GDQ is shrinking :p
[7:28:50] Vizion_TV: Monopoly Clause )
[7:28:51] Vizion_TV: :)
[7:28:52] TrevorVictrus: Then twitch won't pay enough attention to care, so its entirely pointless
[7:28:56] usernameNull: what is simulcast? can you have a second camera with a different angle to different places?
[7:28:58] holypt: gatekeeping galore
[7:28:59] Marksmen31: I don’t think Ltt will ask for an exception
[7:29:01] SaltyGoldfish01: yes
[7:29:04] Nexhunter: @SimonSez they are non profit it doesn't matter
[7:29:05] pikabuhhh: yes :)
[7:29:05] GFQPR1882: :)
[7:29:05] drummernerd: Youre good due, this is literally your livlihood
[7:29:06] D1CKENSS: no i want despair
[7:29:06] Pekter: i dont Kappa
[7:29:06] 2Flip: i want to be happy :)
[7:29:07] DonGromus: No I want to be Despairge
[7:29:07] munskin: @nexhunter yeah that's confusing. Or they get permission of course
[7:29:08] boogerbomb01: LTT wont lose much by dropping Twitch if they do. Floatplane and YouTube are their bread nad butter
[7:29:09] Kounga: happy minecraft stream :)
[7:29:09] MinusKills: @Tabakhase KEKW
[7:29:10] Chalkstix: it's going the way all other companies owned by Big Corpo is going
[7:29:10] praxiz: I want my streamers to be as miserable and unhappy as possible
[7:29:11] kane1941: like civ tournament
[7:29:11] mrkaszkeit: Im polish, never happy anyaway
[7:29:13] enki1337: Despairge pls
[7:29:17] charlies_reverie: @holypt i think you sent it to the wrong person
[7:29:18] StardustDragon08: @usernameNull streaming to two platforms at the same time I think

[7:29:30] CanYouDigIt7: So aliens huh?
[7:29:31] xxLatte: they’re like sabotaging themselves
[7:29:31] Nexhunter: @munskin true an actual corporate entity engaging in commercial activity will have their lawyers double check shit first
[7:29:33] johnnnnieg: At the end of the day its your job and its normal for you to be worried about such changes
[7:29:33] 2Flip: what are you building there?
[7:29:34] Flaaf: And happy viewers makes happy accidents. And happy accidents means more happy viewers
[7:29:34] swirvster: Are you playing this solo?
[7:29:39] SimonSez: @Nexhunter Ah. Didn't think of that
[7:29:41] GamingGoggs: Subathon
[7:29:45] hipsi85: didn't they change this rule like every other month?
[7:29:45] Xev_00: It's just a weird business decision
[7:29:49] drummernerd: Speedrunning their death
[7:29:50] GFQPR1882: Subune
[7:29:51] D1CKENSS: new ceo was a plant to take the compan y down
[7:29:51] DaddyDiddy: @Giantwaffle what about ninja who streams on multiple platforms every day, surely he gets an exception?
[7:29:53] blizzardmagic: joehills from hermitcraft streams usually both youtube and twitch and he could go partner but doesnt and now im pretty sure he will leave twitch
[7:29:55] holypt: @charlies_reverie I sent it to you in whisper LOL
[7:30:00] treeswift: Kick is gonna start paying by the hour too shits not looking good here
[7:30:03] charlies_reverie: @holypt oh i have to refresh
[7:30:03] IveBeenWandering: as protest you should move to onlyfans
[7:30:06] enki1337: 🌶 🌶 🌶
[7:30:11] Nexhunter: @DaddyDiddy technically no even without a sub button but he doesn't care he got paid enough from mixer to retire tbh KEKW
[7:30:13] Hunter1701: Lv today? COPIUMTRUCK
[7:30:30] pachvara42: @Giantwaffle does Healing Axe works in off-hand?
[7:30:33] kane1941: @Hunter1701 already have a few machines
[7:30:46] 2Flip: well see you on youtube soon LUL
[7:30:54] NarwhalArgy: my ocd with that block is off center
[7:30:56] brightcandle: Big companies doing anticonsumer weird monopoly shit is a bit of a theme of the last decade
[7:30:57] vasyapupkin1999: Streaming on 2 platforms NOPERS Streaming almost nude in bathtub PeepoClap
[7:30:58] StardustDragon08: @treeswift Is Kick actually going somewhere? I feel like I remember it was getting hated on pretty hard when it was announced
[7:31:00] Marksmen31: @42424242424242424242 there is no off hand in this version or mc 1.7.10
[7:31:01] turb99: controller on bottom
[7:31:07] jmm548: but u could Kappa
[7:31:08] Chalkstix: people wanna stay because there aren't really any other places to go with the same crowd
[7:31:14] Xev_00: As a viewer, the only thing I think twitch has over youtube is its much better chat
[7:31:16] rell3k: and now you cant build it anymore, thats what twitch was aiming for i guess
[7:31:16] SaltyGoldfish01: @Giantwaffle id follow you whereever you go, no cap <3
[7:31:17] thisisbrad: i know a few channels that do that (bigger on yt ignore twitch partner) but get no notice theyre live on yt so
[7:31:19] 2Flip: your followeres are awesome and probably wouldnt mind
[7:31:19] olewk: start dual streaming
[7:31:20] 2Flip: ;)
[7:31:20] theunderjack: Id follow you to youtube. I wouldnt like it but i would
[7:31:21] mapplelord240: i think its for people stream on TikTok live and twitch at the same time
[7:31:22] D1CKENSS: tbh you would probably carry a large percentage of your following
[7:31:24] enki1337: it doesn't have to be at the bottom
[7:31:26] restfulblue: @Chalkstix i agree with you :)
[7:31:32] turb99: oh
[7:31:33] Kandarjr: At least channels like gdq can still multicast when they are doing their charity event
[7:31:33] fafuja: honestly waffle you're the only streamer I watch here... you can go to Kick and I follow.
[7:31:34] pachvara42: oh ic @Marksmen31
[7:31:36] JustGlennBE: I would follow you to youtube, but ye. I get you wont switch
[7:31:37] Belfiglio3: i hate youtube but anything for waffu
[7:31:39] weightmaker: doenst have to be on bottom, but needs to be onb the same height as other tank/faucets
[7:31:41] CanYouDigIt7: `perfoverlay.drawfps 1
[7:31:42] Chalkstix: there are no good alternatives to Twitch - yet
[7:31:42] Linkitch: Tank also has to be at the bottom
[7:31:44] blizzardmagic: i mean i would follow you to youtube this decision sucks and has no real upsides
[7:31:47] 2Flip: :D
[7:31:50] CanYouDigIt7: oops
[7:31:53] Kellock93: Next thing they do is ban people from using/ promoting other forms of donating except for bits and subs ^^
[7:31:58] GFQPR1882: N OMEGALUL Kappa
[7:32:01] Grimholde: It’s market share. Each entity is going to fight for their “piece” the creators are the collateral dmg. Google is the big guy. Once they take some of the pie. Other companies freak out.
[7:32:01] SaltyGoldfish01: @Giantwaffle your fkn OG on twitch. its insane. you're one of my first followings
[7:32:02] Math354e: Well Twitch is the best platform for the viewer IMO, so that is why as a streamer you should stay, there will be more viewers on the best platform.
[7:32:02] ninjakirby: I remember watching Waffle when I was like 16 playing MC, good old days haha :D
[7:32:04] ScrimpyBoar0: ElNoSabe
[7:32:08] VikashPindoria: waffle might want to put the faucit on the corner so you can have more output
[7:32:10] bballaustin: all the people that have left and come back
[7:32:11] jmm548: depends on the content
[7:32:13] SawyerStreamsStuff: its a totally different vibe too to youtube streams
[7:32:13] drummernerd: The factory must grow kappathirteen
[7:32:14] anbhuu: To be on YT you need to have offline content
[7:32:16] Chalkstix: yeah, youtube is just not geared towards streamers
[7:32:26] munskin: @giantwaffle but both policies are not really impacting you right? So no reason to leave..
[7:32:26] jmm548: timthetatman grew
[7:32:32] JustGlennBE: To be fair, with minecraft you might be.. But you would get a lot of different kind of viewers.. (kids) I think.
[7:32:35] HeyAFrozenZebra: I'm sure Apple will start a streaming service at some point

[7:32:38] teleslynga: kixk
[7:32:42] Grimholde: Yt live is becoming more popular. That’s why this is happening.
[7:32:42] Tech: oh, what a time to join

[8:08:38] HeyAFrozenZebra: How many shotguns can you bring
[8:08:40] SusanTN: But you should lose them if you die
[8:08:42] Tech: going to be interesting
[8:08:42] Quinnerdude1: SO HYPE FOR CS2
[8:08:43] Gabousky_: @lgamer7 you should with the cheaper one and put a ssd in it

[8:09:28] lgamer7: @Gabousky_  thanks for the advice!
[8:09:36] TheNoWhereKing: pepeLaugh Pro Team gun shuffles
[8:09:37] Gabousky_: @lgamer7 you welcome!
[8:09:39] 0x000000: who will decide what weapons are in?
[8:09:41] Speedglass: the side scroll at the bottom is your glory hole of guns you can choose to populate those 15 spots
[8:09:42] Twister1M: I'm not sure I like this... just make them all available?
[8:09:43] StOrMy1100: @fbritoferreira If you bring the p2k and the usp
[8:09:49] Tabakhase: famas is nr. 3 in the slider
[8:09:50] tloone: which means 5 stacks becomes more techy cause you can have your friend bring in the negev
[8:09:51] Shroadie: might be adding more guns to CS2?
[8:09:58] Tompop23: So you have to decide on guns Prematch and regret your decision imminently
[8:09:58] TrevorVictrus: this is a terrible idea I'm pretty sure
[8:10:02] Sniperspy_1: m4 and m4a1 are different stat wise
[8:10:02] Moobot: New here? Welcome! You can usually catch Waffle Mon-Fri at ~1400 UTC, and Sat at Soon™. Feel free to hang out in chat before the stream and/or join the !discord. waffleEgg
[8:10:03] BallForceOne: is it player specific or team specific?
[8:10:05] Tech: so you have to choose between heavy and SMG
[8:10:07] Trifoks: Maybe back to CSS style, Glock vs USP-S, no more P2000?
[8:10:17] Vizion_TV: What about Ts
[8:10:20] AndyHayes: wait so you still can't use AK on CT right?
[8:10:21] RodriCraft93: yes it involves more thinking on what gun everyone brings
[8:10:23] hisdue: can you drop an awp? No not on my loadout GIGACHAD new level trolling
[8:10:25] Vizion_TV: Can Ts use the usps??
[8:10:28] Tech: Mid-tier
[8:10:32] StOrMy1100: Not on my loadout KEKW
[8:10:33] Twister1M: 5500 M249 is a mid-tier KEKW
[8:10:34] AndyHayes: okay phew
[8:10:35] TrevorVictrus: This is just more restrictive than the old system
[8:10:36] Tech: I don't hate it
[8:10:39] Csstform: this isn't minecraft KEKW
[8:10:40] BruisedCranium56: but why cant i just bring them all...
[8:10:42] philip0524: I definitely will put M249 in there Kappa
[8:10:43] tloone: where does the m249 go that thing costs the whole bank
[8:10:45] Speedkill3r: Man today has been a day.
[8:10:45] Tech: It's more restrictive for sure
[8:10:49] Tech: less options through a match
[8:10:49] hondough: can you change your knife in game?
[8:10:56] D1CKENSS: good for the game
[8:10:57] holypt: So what happens if I get an AK from the T?
[8:10:58] BowTieGuy21: interesting, but i dont see this being a big deal or really different?
[8:11:00] Tech: but pro's barely use anything aside from a small list of guns
[8:11:05] SusanTN: Cheap mob traps using pressure plate and trap doors
[8:11:06] Tech: Because it's 1700
[8:11:08] hisdue: zues has its on slot on teh left NOTED
[8:11:08] Shroadie: Pretty cool to me
[8:11:09] RodriCraft93: it alwayss was
[8:11:10] maccabeus: because it sucks
[8:11:11] PlaguedV: because its for mid people
[8:11:11] fbritoferreira: I guess is to add more variety to pro matches
[8:11:12] Twister1M: M249???
[8:11:24] Ras2709: so what tier is m249?
[8:11:25] BruisedCranium56: negev on B site dust is best gun
[8:11:31] Tech: OH
[8:11:35] Champton2664: Could you have both a CZ and a 57? And then have the Deagle as the last pistol?
[8:11:37] Tech: THEY KEPT THE NUMBERS
[8:11:38] Tech: WOOOOO
[8:11:39] cosmicblip: Isn't this similar to the valorant gun screen
[8:11:41] fbritoferreira: Maybe in pro they can ban guns
[8:11:48] fanta_x_thomas: refund button :O
[8:11:50] StOrMy1100: @fbritoferreira Won't add variety
[8:11:50] Svardmastaren: Waffle look in the bottom. You can buy old loadout from previous round :O
[8:11:57] philip0524: Revolver
[8:11:59] Tech: CZ has higher damage
[8:12:05] Scruffle34: cz is so much more fun
[8:12:07] Speedglass: the ump-45 shoots .45 all others shoot 9mm
[8:12:10] Svardmastaren: Wait it has
[8:12:16] Ras2709: when do they add riot shield in comp?
[8:12:18] HeyAFrozenZebra: Cause now when you use a meme gun it's more of a flex cause you're wasting a whole slot on it
[8:12:23] Speedglass: mp9 may be .45 dunno
[8:12:23] hondough: it says f4 in the bottom
[8:12:30] Xev_00: I love that 95% of my autoexec still works after 15 years

[8:15:19] Puck_: yeah but you can drop everything so
[8:15:29] Miestro: it'd be crazy if pros get to pick a load out once per match rather than per map
[8:15:29] RodriCraft93: @Giantwaffle  it makes it more intereseting with the exchange within teammates, to manage the money
