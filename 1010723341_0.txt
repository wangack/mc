[2:01:45] Mega_R: yes when they are inside
[2:01:53] seymour47: Make a dammed airlock
[2:02:00] laura2daisy: Probably because they want to be free
[2:02:02] RubelliteFae: @MoochyDaCat Which kind? Fish tail or fish head?
[2:02:11] JohnBod: NotLikeThis

[2:02:34] Z0eff: @Skelecorn Is that actually a thing?
[2:02:37] Vicxy_Littler: making an airlock would be exactly the opposite of what our bee-loved yogs would do, because it is the 'easier' thing to do
[2:02:40] MoochyDaCat: yogD either he's flexible @RubelliteFae
[2:02:40] notafloor: hmmmm i tried lol

[2:03:14] nc_Helix: look underneath it says the tier
[2:03:15] meridius_91: It worked on the number of bees allowed in it
[2:03:15] skelaria: it said it was tier two in the description it just looks like tier 1
[2:03:16] parrapaTh3Rappa: read it again
[2:03:21] GoatusEponymous: @Z0eff Yeah, it only lets specific mobs through, so the Mob Filter (Player) block only lets you through and not bees. I use it on my bee houses.
[2:03:31] Imperator_Benny: that's kind of annoying
[2:03:33] nc_Helix: the item name won't change
[2:04:00] Peaceful_Panda: vacuum hopper is so good
[2:04:02] parrapaTh3Rappa: most modded items store object settings fine when picked up..dunno how that mod operates, though.
[2:04:08] RubelliteFae: @Skelecorn That's cool!
[2:04:17] Ginger1y: It's probably saved in the NBT data

[2:07:11] RubelliteFae: @Z0eff Civ's only a dirty word when it's CivVI
[2:07:12] Imperator_Benny: because it makes 9 full bottles
[2:07:22] Z0eff: @RubelliteFae Hey Civ6 isn't that bad yogHands
[2:07:28] Imperator_Benny: huh could've sworn th at was it

[2:07:42] AureliaaX: You can generate basalt with lava and ice iirc
[2:07:47] EsotericFish: Just make a heat generator for the powered centrifuge
[2:07:50] visstick_: blue ice and lava makes basalt

[2:07:54] Mega_R: does it work with blocks?
[2:07:56] Clairion: Maybe you can only do it in a electrical centrifuge and not the manual one?
[2:07:57] RubelliteFae: @Z0eff lol I like it, but I only play vs AI. But the Yog boys sure don't like it
[2:07:57] Z0eff: oh god blue ice
[2:08:01] LuckyRashes: @magikaas thanks for the sub!
[2:08:03] MoochyDaCat: re-log see if it fixes it
[2:08:04] Dlemming: Break it and see if it is jammed with coal?
[2:08:05] JohnBod: The vanilla netherrack generator is the vanilla netherrack generator which produces netherrack by making netherrack.
[2:08:09] starlitesparkl3: you can generate basalt
[2:08:09] EsotericFish: Ped already made the powered centrifuge!
[2:08:12] Elykidan: did you do coal block in it again it might be broken with to. much coal
[2:08:14] JohnBod: SeemsGood
[2:08:17] Z0eff: @RubelliteFae I feel like they have a love-hate relationship with it
[2:08:20] NielsKuehn: I seems to happen when you change the stuff inside. maybe something is stuck "inside". Earlier it was coal
[2:08:30] evinwins: need botania first to unlock power
[2:08:30] Imperator_Benny: heat generators are "free"
[2:08:31] visstick_: you can dupe netherack with botania
[2:08:33] Elykidan: theres a honey generetor
[2:08:33] evinwins: powah specifically
[2:08:37] EsotericFish: Heat generator

[2:09:26] JohnBod: {Powah} KAPOW MorphinTime {/Powah}
[2:09:35] starlitesparkl3: you can make a heat generator and just leave it immersed in lava. They dont generate much but they basically make free energy
[2:09:41] patvonckze_bird: pretty sure in this modpack there is a door that allows player to go throught but not mobs could make your life easier/ mob filter block
[2:09:43] dwaynetherockross: What modpack is this?

[2:12:35] RubelliteFae: @Purplecrown And also with you
[2:12:35] SpellitOutLoud: If you pour lava around the heat generator, on each face, it generates passive power
[2:12:41] Imperator_Benny: pipe lava into it
[2:12:46] starlitesparkl3: @pedguin as long as it touches lava it generates a bit of power
[2:12:55] Danriths_: With a wood base....
[2:13:19] BurnoodTakedown: CUNK

[2:14:38] Slousifer: LUL
[2:14:41] Fisrath: So you can surround that heat pump with lava and it'll slowly make passive energy, it's overall pretty inefficient on it's own but it works.
[2:14:43] RubelliteFae: Are you suggesting they date fish???
[2:14:44] torrid5: ye dogs never let you down
[2:14:48] ztepher: just pedguin lol

[2:15:06] Dlemming: break the manual centrifuge. Last time it was jammed with coal
[2:15:10] BurnoodTakedown: Because Ravs is Nick Frost
[2:15:14] UntouchedWagons: You could probably disassemble the old cobble gen

[2:15:39] Z0eff: @BobaWitch your current build project is right in the view of the timelapse PoV :D
[2:15:45] starlitesparkl3: @pedguin you can generate a bit of extra power if the heat genreator is touching lava
[2:15:49] Ginger1y: is canola an option?
[2:15:49] Imperator_Benny: i could've sworn heat generators were the ones that wanted to be surrounded in lava
[2:15:50] Candoran: "Darmok and Jalad at Tanagra" - Pedguin
[2:15:51] Areleos: Pretty sure that is the worst power source in the game
[2:15:53] SockBadger: It puts the power in the basket, or it gets the bees again. Pepega
[2:15:56] MartyFixit: what  series was the one where Lewis went off the deep end about bees? Jaffa Factory?
[2:16:00] Aadam78692: Yeah it's true
[2:16:02] hgfhdhss: that is true
[2:16:06] wazzatwazzit: it is truew
[2:16:06] Imperator_Benny: yeah, didn't ben build that in one of the series
[2:16:08] vibb0: Its true
[2:16:08] Slousifer: It is the mekanism one
[2:16:09] wazzatwazzit: w
[2:16:10] JohnBod: This is a beautiful base, jeez
[2:16:10] Nemet: It's a passive generator, yeah.
[2:16:10] Fisrath: It's absolutely true.
[2:16:11] starlitesparkl3: duncan you've DONE THAT before in another pack
[2:16:11] Aadam78692: Put lava next to a heat geenrator and its a passive power gen
[2:16:13] RubelliteFae: @MartyFixit yeah

[2:16:14] Pankreas99: trufe

[2:16:15] tobi4307: its true
[2:16:15] Imperator_Benny: a big wall of lava with heat generators in
[2:16:15] Goldthwait: It is true. It's how Mekanism works
[2:16:16] MoochyDaCat: twue
[2:16:16] vibb0: mekanisk baby
[2:16:17] Z0eff: Nah tis ok BobaWitch LUL
[2:16:17] Ginger1y: seems right
[2:16:20] Nemet: I spent waaaay too much time with mekanism.
[2:16:20] JohnBod: beeautiful even
[2:16:22] Imperator_Benny: but it could be a different heat generator
[2:16:23] XuantheTrain: that's true, just very little power
[2:16:24] Slousifer: you can put lava around it and it will be constant
[2:16:28] Aadam78692: Put lava next to the heat gen
[2:16:31] MoochyDaCat: mekanism is weird that way
[2:16:34] Mapsir: I am using 4 heat gens in a 3 by 3 square with lava in each corner and apparently you can put lava inside of the heat gen block in the small slit in the middle
[2:16:34] Areleos: Its true, but its still the worst
[2:16:36] walkthental: It‚Äôs for sure true just a rubbish gen
[2:16:42] Zarquonnix: it is true; 5 by touching side
[2:16:43] Danriths_: Ben did use it to power your base once remember? he immerse it in lava
[2:16:50] walkthental: Surround it by lava
[2:16:52] AureliaaX: baybees beeJAM
[2:16:54] oofle: It makes power, but not a lot of power.
[2:16:57] hgfhdhss: it might not work with the storage barrel tho, has to be flowing lava or lava block boupheShrug
[2:16:58] nerdcave_justin: You need to surround it with lava pretty much for that to work I thought?
[2:17:01] Fisrath: You need someplace fireproof. It's energy for nothing so it's not very fast to balance out.
[2:17:03] JohnBod: Bae Bee beeJAM
[2:17:06] walkthental: Look at the wiki guys

[2:17:58] rorchach_test: itlwBed
[2:17:59] Aadam78692: So heat generators produce passive power for each face touching lava. So that's 5 faces since you need one for a power cable BUT there's also the neat trick when you can lavalog the heat generator itself like you can do with stairs and water. That makes 6 "sides" of lava per generator
[2:18:02] Spider_Hunter: LUL
[2:18:07] starlitesparkl3: Duncan you've DONE the lava contact trick before in All The Mods 3/4 lets play.

[2:21:01] starlitesparkl3: liquid starlight and lava
[2:21:04] Danriths_: For each side that is next to lava, it will generate 100 J/s (5 J/t per side), giving a maximum of 500 J/s of passive power.
