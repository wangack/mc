[4:03:46] vortex_namazu: im yaboijackharlow
[4:03:47] oscatty: i need my antrose duo in mcc
[4:04:08] CassianG: I think it needs a revamp and breathing time
[4:04:18] CassianG: yea exactly
[4:04:23] Tw1lightXD: I think they just need new players
[4:04:41] CassianG: april-may should be the earliest yea
[4:04:41] mainsequencestar: May feels too long
[4:04:47] noa_1ne: i feel like april may
[4:04:48] azryliam: not really cause season 2
[4:04:53] CassianG: I mean for new games they need like may minimum
[4:04:54] Tw1lightXD: maybe a new finale?
[4:04:55] pizzahotdog312: I hope they add a dropper related content, like a TGTTOS map
[4:04:57] raimundao03: this new final game is so good
[4:04:57] ryxnl0l: season 2 started in may i think right?
[4:04:58] SeanoTM_: unnick
[4:05:00] azryliam: may was when it came back
[4:05:01] Vallowz: lowkey that block wars hit like an mcc I can't lie
[4:05:08] CassianG: @Vallowz literally
[4:05:19] Fraudfrost: Billie Eilish, Khalid - lovely (with Khalid)
[4:05:21] CassianG: pb, mayhem, mania, bw are really hitting rn
[4:05:36] noa_1ne: omg this song
[4:05:37] noa_1ne: sdjasodjsaoidjas
[4:05:39] noa_1ne: 18 is crazy
[4:06:05] oscatty: i wonder if mcc will add a new game
[4:06:08] Vallowz: blockwars got a good finale game we're so back
[4:06:09] mainsequencestar: What sort of changes do you think would be the best ones for mcc?
[4:06:12] mainsequencestar: I'm curious
[4:06:17] CassianG: lowkey with bridges lime would've rolled you there
[4:06:26] ryxnl0l: i want an SOT revamp, but idk what they could do
[4:06:40] oscatty: i want more maps
[4:06:42] Vallowz: that sweep was more entertaining than a round 7 bridges
[4:06:52] noa_1ne: the redditors are annoying
[4:07:01] noa_1ne: fine sorry i said it
[4:07:01] mercuryhype: tru
[4:07:05] Amstamm: i dont get hating on remixes
[4:07:07] conpro24_: i feel like discord complains the most
[4:07:11] Vallowz: idk I dont see a problem if a REMIX is a bit rng
[4:07:23] s0lar_p: no offense but them adding waterfight to the event was stupid
[4:07:23] ryxnl0l: @noa_1ne speak your truth
[4:07:25] s0lar_p: sorry
[4:07:36] Lipthulip: yeah ive stopped going on the reddit for a while
[4:07:43] Vallowz: im bias towards waterfight though because I was like the goat at that
[4:07:54] s0lar_p: yeah i also stopped going through the reddit
[4:07:56] OIivears: i want the old mcc ui
[4:07:56] ryxnl0l: i dont think sandyland was a good map either
[4:08:02] oscatty: i tjhink we overdue a pkt map
[4:08:03] s0lar_p: @OIivears yes
[4:08:04] s0lar_p: like
[4:08:05] mainsequencestar: I think personally sot should get something, because it's been the same since mcc15
[4:08:09] s0lar_p: actaully
[4:08:12] amusedlurker: MCC Party was a perfect example of Reddit whining
[4:08:14] mainsequencestar: But idk exactly what
[4:08:19] Tw1lightXD: the whole reddit now is just making teams
[4:08:20] JJKALANI_: new mcc ui is perfect for island not for the event
[4:08:21] s0lar_p: the old mcc ui was way better
[4:08:28] oscatty: we need more sot rooms i think
[4:08:28] Fraudfrost: Doja Cat - Rules
[4:08:30] conpro24_: i feel like redditors are only talked about negatively but when they do anything cool no one says anything
[4:08:34] Vallowz: sands of time was really good and I feel like they removed some of the more fun rooms
[4:08:34] conpro24_: but maybe thats just me
[4:08:42] JJKALANI_: @conpro24_ most of the time yea
[4:08:45] ryxnl0l: am i the only one who likes the new ui? I like seeing where people placed in rounds n stuff idk
[4:08:46] kitcantfrost: catJAM
[4:08:51] kitcantfrost: catJAM catJAM
[4:08:53] oscatty: there were fan made sot rooms and they actually look good
[4:08:55] CassianG: DOJA catJAM
[4:08:59] oscatty: like they would work
[4:09:01] Amstamm: i would love a new building game its just hard to make one thats not just copying builds
[4:09:15] s0lar_p: i think some things they point out are valid but other things just make no sense
[4:09:22] CassianG: I just hate reddit as a ant fan my honest opinion
[4:09:29] raenavolante: I’ve gtg again Byee
[4:09:30] Vallowz: new game off launch for season 4 would set the tone icl
[4:09:30] JJKALANI_: reddit as a whole is silly
[4:09:33] Vallowz: if they dont its fine though
[4:09:37] noa_1ne: fuck m eatong while parkouring
[4:09:42] s0lar_p: VERY
[4:09:44] raimundao03: reddit did u guys dirty
[4:09:44] s0lar_p: BIASEWD
[4:09:45] CassianG: idc idc they're straight up biased against you
[4:09:48] ryxnl0l: they hate you ngl
[4:09:49] noa_1ne: they hate u
[4:10:03] raimundao03: they hate punz
[4:10:04] Greninja: read disc
[4:10:05] mainsequencestar: MCC reddit used to be a lot better than it was now I think
[4:10:06] quinnbbles: i have a vendetta against mci so i’m not participating
[4:10:13] Tw1lightXD: they underrate you so bad
[4:10:13] raimundao03: poor punz
[4:10:14] quinnbbles: reddit scares me
[4:10:14] mainsequencestar: It's like all tiers and stuff
[4:10:15] ryxnl0l: reddit has serious recency bias
[4:10:20] red_umbrella_: That is such a polite way of saying it
[4:10:20] s0lar_p: THE REDDIT MEAT RIDES PURPLED
[4:10:22] CassianG: while they're slurping up and down on fruit pete and purp's ender rods
[4:10:39] Vallowz: ?
[4:10:54] CassianG: RIGHT I GOT -10 DOWNVOTES FOR SAYING THAT
[4:10:57] quinnbbles: they just hate you for no reason
[4:11:05] quinnbbles: like at least i have reasons
[4:11:08] pizzahotdog312: The reddit loves sleeping on Jojo
[4:11:09] ryxnl0l: all your teammates were bottom 10 too right? like LOL 11th is good ??
[4:11:20] Tw1lightXD: the reddit is just nostalgic for S2
[4:11:30] mainsequencestar: Islanders is way worse with that lol
[4:11:37] quinnbbles: it’s really hard to get top 10 when you have a bottom 3 team, it’s so much easier when you have a really good team
[4:11:39] Fraudfrost: Troye Sivan - Angel Baby
[4:11:40] noa_1ne: guys ummm
[4:11:46] CassianG: They use jojo to hate on other ppl and thats about it. they dont like her for her own stuff
[4:11:52] ryxnl0l: @quinnbbls exactly, and 11th is a crazy performance IMO
[4:11:54] quinnbbles: so if you place 9th then getting 11th indv is great wtf are they on
[4:11:55] noa_1ne: dont play minecrat with soy sauce on ur hands
[4:12:01] quinnbbles: i just hate reddit
[4:12:03] Vallowz: my bad
[4:12:19] ryxnl0l: no Ant I was referring to you
[4:12:20] noa_1ne: thats just dumb
[4:12:20] ryxnl0l: LOL
[4:12:28] s0lar_p: VALLOWS
[4:12:30] quinnbbles: theyve got the weirdest bias
[4:12:35] Jacqueline_Moon: solar 10-10
[4:12:39] noa_1ne: the bias is so weird
[4:12:44] Vallowz: SOLAR I SAW
[4:12:45] CassianG: you also have the highest top 5 percentage for s3 out of everyone but god forbid you get 11th
[4:12:46] Vallowz: HOLY SHIT LMFAOOO
[4:12:49] quinnbbles: i don’t think you’ve got a big ego at all tbh so many people are way more egotistical about their minecraft skills
[4:12:57] Jacqueline_Moon: omg
[4:13:00] noa_1ne: nah they shouldnt be doing that
[4:13:07] ryxnl0l: if you have a different opinion is like you're done for
[4:13:18] quinnbbles: youve gotta be one of the chillest and most down to earth streamers too
[4:13:23] Vallowz: ant I haven't played survivor since launch should I practice that one maybe
[4:13:29] thesnatcher1: Hi Ant could you scream I'm at my friend's house and it's quiet
[4:13:31] theduck1989: my pc hates parkour warrior
[4:13:35] noa_1ne: its fucked to treat people like stats no matter what
[4:13:41] s0lar_p: WAS THERE A PUNT RETURN VALLOWS????/
[4:13:45] Vallowz: @s0lar_p YEAH

[4:13:48] s0lar_p: OMGGG
[4:14:03] s0lar_p: look the reddit meat rides purpled shane and couriway
[4:14:14] JJKALANI_: someone could comment that least harmful critical thing and they get downvoted the hell out
[4:14:15] Jacqueline_Moon: i love football
[4:14:18] thesnatcher1: hawkaCatscrem
[4:14:19] CassianG: W rant that felt good
[4:14:20] Vallowz: you and jojo are tied for the 4th spot imo

[4:14:38] s0lar_p: AND PETE
[4:14:39] SeanoTM_: TBH MCC now (apart from non-canons) feels like just another MC Event
[4:14:41] Amstamm: "ant's 1st in tr doesnt count because non-canon and op team"
[4:14:45] noa_1ne: fruit, pete and who?
[4:14:46] kitcantfrost: HAI STUUU
[4:14:52] s0lar_p: purpled noa
[4:14:53] CassianG: @noa_1ne purpled
[4:14:55] noa_1ne: yeah
[4:15:01] Tw1lightXD: like so many people want iskall just move on
[4:15:02] CassianG: stu is veryyyy low
[4:15:02] Vallowz: ant performed in the bright lights and they still cook you 😭 😭
[4:15:07] kitcantfrost: i cant hear stu, TURN HIM UP
[4:15:11] JJKALANI_: turn him up
[4:15:12] noa_1ne: we cant hear
[4:15:18] kitcantfrost: i can barely hear him
[4:15:19] quinnbbles: turn stu up
[4:15:26] CassianG: @Vallowz BUT TWITCH RIVALS IS NON CANON like go suck a dicque
[4:15:26] s0lar_p: dude i said one time that antfrost is in the top 3 for best performace overall in season 3 AND I GOT DOWNVOTED -43
[4:15:28] JJKALANI_: uuh
[4:15:30] s0lar_p: LIKE WTF
[4:15:30] Fraudfrost: Glass Animals - Heat Waves
[4:15:32] quinnbbles: posture sit up straight
[4:15:37] Tw1lightXD: people who think Sapnap is better just look at TR
[4:15:46] quinnbbles: speak up ‼️‼️
[4:15:52] OIivears: @tw1lightxd meltdown dif
[4:15:53] quinnbbles: don’t leave us with just antfrost
[4:16:00] Lipthulip: he's quiet
[4:16:03] quinnbbles: it’s better
[4:16:05] quinnbbles: still quiet
[4:16:08] CassianG: he's still emo sounding
[4:16:09] JJKALANI_: still quiet uuh
[4:16:09] leo_vc_3: he's still a little quiet
[4:16:09] ryxnl0l: its better
[4:16:10] quinnbbles: yes
[4:16:11] kitcantfrost: THATS BETTER
[4:16:14] JJKALANI_: better
[4:16:15] CassianG: emoninja
[4:16:15] quinnbbles: thank you mr stu greninja
[4:16:18] SeanoTM_: MCC needs to eradicate Canon events and just do non-canon /hj
[4:16:23] Tw1lightXD: @OIivears like fr all he does is just kill the same team 3 times
[4:16:31] Greninja: !code
[4:16:32] JJKALANI_: uuh
[4:16:37] JJKALANI_: its pinned uuh
[4:16:39] CassianG: wait ask stu who he watched for blockwars...
[4:16:40] ryxnl0l: @Seano_Trademark i love non-canons but pls no
[4:16:50] mainsequencestar: I swear islanders has worse recency bias than anyone too lol. Someone has a crazy pop off in an event and they're the best player of all time. Someone falls out of the top 10 in one event and they're washed
[4:16:50] Jacqueline_Moon: i hear ant and stu in one ear and football in the other
[4:16:50] quinnbbles: wait i wanna play too
[4:16:51] fsyara: I wish I watched ants pov 😓

[4:17:12] Lipthulip: don't underrate yourself
[4:17:13] noa_1ne: AUTOMOD DIE
[4:17:14] Lipthulip: your the goat
[4:17:17] Vallowz: I thought you guys were doing ass but like its all good
[4:17:17] marscurio1: noa...
[4:17:20] Jacqueline_Moon: @noa_1ne real
[4:17:21] CassianG: it did not
[4:17:24] ryxnl0l: yeah you were cooking actually
[4:17:24] JJKALANI_: @noa_1ne real

[4:18:02] ToriSmori: I completely missed the win  sadOk
[4:18:08] CassianG: stu doesnt want his fans to see him ig
[4:18:16] Jacqueline_Moon: holy shit the texans are play
[4:18:16] CassianG: you might be the best yea
[4:18:17] Vallowz: I think you're lowkey the best extraction player
[4:18:20] Vallowz: imma be real
[4:18:20] mainsequencestar: You definitely cooked extraction
[4:18:22] pizzahotdog312: It did not consistently feel like a winning pov, but it was very hilarious and fun
[4:18:23] ryxnl0l: extraction is your game
[4:18:24] rocketan12: kel is better
[4:18:29] Tw1lightXD: you got the record so you can say that
[4:18:31] mainsequencestar: Definitely the best bwcc extraction goat
[4:18:34] quinnbbles: i want to get in to play with ferb
[4:18:39] Tw1lightXD: @rocketan12 yeah but he's kel
[4:18:41] azryliam: ...
