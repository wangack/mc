[1:24:07] GoodOldXijan: i would love a ai to programm the logic i have in my head. i think building the logic out of what the customer etc. wants is more a human thing still
[1:24:07] Zyie: Eventually, AI will replace all coding pretty much. We're just not quite there yet.
[1:24:09] Elfikalio: yeah i called it Google on steroids
[1:24:11] iWALL_E: true
[1:24:11] DrYProtoss: chatGPT can be wrong with a high degree of confidence
[1:24:36] iWALL_E: its wild
[1:24:37] xRafikus: Github Copilot showed us how AI is helpful in programming
[1:24:39] IAmJester: @DrYProtoss how is that any different from humans now?
[1:24:40] xDeadBringerx: The main issue I'm not using ChatGPT or CoPilot for coding is the unclear background on licenses and copyright.
[1:24:44] LosBurritosHermanos: it's a very bad googling replacement. ChatGPT is not really a "chat bot" in nature. It is a prediction of next word based on pormpt.
[1:24:48] DatoPotatoDato: im excited for it tbh
[1:25:03] DiamondDestructe: chat gpt is going to be included in some level in the Microsoft 365 'office' applictions. so that is gone be fun

[1:26:03] GGoodGGuy: time to stop sharing dik pics on web :D
[1:26:06] Zyie: @MisterRabbitHead As someone who speaks more than one language fluently, translation software is still far from perfect. Lots of issues.

[1:28:26] Pigero: pokemon or bigdata LUL
[1:28:28] Zyie: @MisterRabbitHead Yeah, machine translation is for sure a tool that can save lots of time, not arguing that. It is however years away, at least, before it can be trusted to translate things correctly, without a human that speaks the language fixing all of the errors

[2:19:04] Rollingx: i love the big ban theory
[2:19:04] Nexhunter: @Giantwaffle they VAC banned the bots but then they ran a new wave and that caught up non bots
[2:19:04] DemonsDawn: yea, i heard a guy had his 13 y old steam account VAC banned
[2:19:06] JasonDM_: it's not a VAC ban, but it still shows up on your account
[2:19:17] Larklen: It would show on your steam profile, yeah
[2:19:18] PxlSauce: wait, which game?
[2:19:20] kinglouisxvii: I play sometimes the server relocation in europe was also a mess
[2:19:21] DemonsDawn: lost ark
[2:19:22] Nexhunter: the VAC bans were reversed for the 2nd wave
[2:19:35] Nexhunter: the first wave is still VAC banned
[2:19:40] raironzera: why are we optimizing code if the main purpose of the machines is to adapt to our needs? Humans FailFish
[2:19:46] Nexhunter: they had hit over 130k bots in the first wave
[2:19:51] Nexhunter: it was the 2nd go around to cleanup
[2:19:54] Minelmonia: Marketing?
[2:19:54] JasonDM_: the game actually needs to use VAC to have VAC bans
[2:19:56] Nexhunter: that fucked up
[2:19:57] GFQPR1882: Really why would you get pissed off if you get banned OMEGALUL

[2:20:09] Nexhunter: @GFQPR1882 vac bans are basically steam bans
[2:20:10] Kryllyk: still is, everything they've done has not fixed it
[2:20:13] Allmostdone: Maybe they still don‚Äôt know how to do it in their own system
[2:20:19] Nexhunter: it the 2nd go around that got fucked up
[2:20:22] Provision_: @raironzera well 40% of my programming is to get the line working. 60% is to prevent people from doing stupid stuff LUL

[2:20:36] GFQPR1882: It was a joke LUL
[2:20:38] Baske_T: there's still about 100k bots usually.  You can tell when a new patch comes out and it drops 100k users for teh first few days until they fix tehir botting software
[2:20:40] DiamondDestructe: one look at the review of lost ark tels a lot
[2:20:42] Naicella: do you think you'll go back and try artist

[2:21:32] Nexhunter: given Amazon is their fav target
[2:21:41] Baske_T: they are slowing down updates, artist won't be until april
[2:21:45] Baske_T: supposedly
[2:22:07] lazyTidus: Blizzard is quitting China, imagine all those freed up bots
[2:22:11] Nexhunter: artist is getting skin changes to add shorts and longer skirts

[2:22:44] BuLLeT_LV: @DemonsDawn ^
[2:22:49] Shadow_Phoenix_Gaming: they did not renew the contract and yes they are all the chinese players had to save their players
[2:22:51] Termanader: They couldn't come to an agreement on a contract so its getting pulled from their servers
[2:22:54] lazyTidus: they need a publisher
[2:22:54] IamWambo_: They already added a way to download account data to save it
[2:22:55] frainsbreeze: CHY-NA

[3:13:14] frainsbreeze: is there a quadruple compressed?
[3:13:40] lazyhot: ok speed up EBF's with double LuV's gotcha
[3:13:44] Jaydepps00: KEKW
[3:13:44] CantTouchDisNow: KEKW
[3:13:46] KnightofObv: you made zpm
[3:13:54] OMICRON: @Jaydepps00 nice waffleYes
[3:14:04] TheMegaDud: explode inc
[3:14:22] KnightofObv: correct wire for zpm?
[3:15:30] lazyhot: It is double LuV outside, inbside machine single Zpm kinda
[3:15:36] frainsbreeze: 3 sec POG
[3:15:46] winulff: daaaamn

[3:16:11] iWALL_E: the machine produces
[3:16:13] jmm548: more solar pannels Kappa
[3:16:14] daemonaedryn: Pog
[3:16:16] RussianRainbowTV: time to make more power

[3:16:39] GFQPR1882: Yh second one
[3:16:49] frainsbreeze: i guess the bottleneck is at the vacuum freezer now
[3:16:50] lazyhot: Can your array of freezers catch up?
[3:16:50] Docgalaad: 3*16~50
[3:17:00] bobolpwnz: Better coils also give boost
[3:17:04] Shazzypoo: time to upgrade all to zero point and set limiters
[3:17:06] IAmJester: 16
[3:17:23] Dagmoo: 50 -> 3 EZ
[3:17:24] Vovosunt: it's ZP?
[3:17:25] Rollingx: different coils too?
[3:17:28] Schutter07: don't question it
[3:17:35] FusRohDakkaDakka: bugged calc
[3:17:36] Jaydepps00: more power more speed
[3:17:38] Wingy_: If your coils are more than 1k+ temp I think it is then 4x power is 4x speed
[3:17:38] Jaydepps00: EZ
[3:17:40] bobolpwnz: Coils do
[3:17:41] daemonaedryn: Check the questbook
[3:17:43] DaddyDiddy: waffle is the vacuum freezer keeping up? that was my biggest problem
[3:17:44] frainsbreeze: coils are for temp
[3:17:46] IAmJester: EV->IV->LuV->ZPM?
[3:17:48] Wingy_: Check the kanthal quest in the book
[3:17:52] aundros: how much energy does that zpm take pr tick?
[3:17:53] GFQPR1882: Is it A percentage of your overall power ?
[3:17:54] Moobot: You can sub to Waffle by clicking this neat link -> twitch.tv/giantwaffle/subscribe SUBprise
[3:18:05] Jaydepps00: @IAmJester yes
[3:18:06] DaFez_: it's all about the amount of EU right? it needs a certain total and you are providing 100k per tick, so you can do that math
[3:18:13] Novaht: Yeah hood shift on the coils and it willl show you @giantwaffle
[3:18:17] eurqa: @Giantwaffle read the entry on coils in the quest book it explains ebf speed
[3:18:17] Novaht: Hold**
[3:18:20] bobolpwnz: UPgrade coils to Naq on your aluminium EBF and see :P
[3:18:34] frainsbreeze: why are the ingots stuck at 7?
[3:18:35] mrleonehart: Osha!!!!
[3:19:01] Scerion_TX: dude it's 76 out, I have the back door open :p

[3:19:23] Askjong: pepeSmoke
[3:19:32] SvenQoala: Its -1 here :(
[3:19:34] MisterRabbitHead: OMEGALUL imagine being have to get up to turn on your heating, poor waffle
[3:19:46] Nessirra: Nessirra subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 8 months! Yo waffle
[3:20:00] bcdmonkey: Neat could help with that wafflePoint
[3:20:01] Kryllyk: You can just turn the fan on with heat/cold off to circulate air
[3:20:03] Allmostdone: That‚Äôs a heat pump
[3:20:06] Beufff: set your heat to kick on at 65
[3:20:14] Jaydepps00: thats same as me rn
[3:20:14] LinkHub_Pro: make sure you have auto output on ebf, hot ingots in machine.
[3:20:18] StormTiberius: your cheap thermostat at work craft a NEW one :D
[3:20:20] Docgalaad: humidity% changes our perception of temp
[3:20:21] Allmostdone: What is your humidity
[3:20:22] Uphoric: same
[3:20:23] maccabeus: fireplace is causing a draft
[3:20:24] LastSajin: That's warm lol
[3:20:24] slyjedi: Put some shoes on.
[3:20:29] Beufff: our heat is set to that and hasn't kicked on at all this year
[3:20:31] Satanaell: Are you hungry?
[3:20:36] Askjong: pepeSmoke
[3:20:39] xDeadBringerx: 22C? Queue me sitting here in 18.5C LUL
[3:20:41] Asphoron: I have a ton of thermometers around my place
[3:20:44] Noscofosho: I've lived in the same place for 3 years, and still haven't turned my heat on.
[3:20:45] Invalidm_: 25C is your okay temp!? wtf is wrong with you
[3:20:46] TitusDE: mostly there is a master/the first one that decides if heat or colding is active at all devices
[3:20:50] Jaydepps00: maybe move it if you can, maybe its a spot with not much airflow and doesn't update regularly @Giantwaffle
[3:20:51] slyjedi: That‚Äôs low ish.
[3:20:52] Scerion_TX: check with your electric company, they'll have rebates for smart thermostats
[3:20:52] Cooper_XX: off thats low
[3:20:57] PureSpider: @Invalidm_ didnt he say 22C=
[3:20:58] PureSpider: ?
[3:20:59] mrleonehart: Sounds like someone needs heated floors
[3:21:08] Ïô∏Íµ≠Ïù∏ÎàÑÎ¶¨: @Invalidm_ Didn't he say 22?
[3:21:08] Invalidm_: thats still too hot
[3:21:09] Venamah: you need to put some meat on your bones, your to skinny
[3:21:11] eurqa: @Giantwaffle for every 1800K above the ebf recipe one overclock speed is 4x instead 2x
[3:21:16] Allmostdone: Try to get it to around 40. That should make it feel warmer
[3:21:26] PureSpider: mine's around 21C, very nice
[3:21:36] xDeadBringerx: Heating my house to 21-22C right now in The Netherlands would bankrupt me
[3:21:37] ikmyer: !mc_pack
[3:21:37] Moobot: Waffle is playing Nomifactory (GTCEu Port) | https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/nomi-ceu | Already missing one deadline, will the bois be able to beat it by NYE 2023? Tune in to every stream to find out! pepeLaugh
[3:21:43] Invalidm_: mine is 16C constantly

[3:22:45] xDeadBringerx: @PureSpider I paid 320 euros for natural gas and 88 euros for elec last month D:
[3:22:50] Invalidm_: no I love it
[3:23:03] PureSpider: xDeadBringerx by far most heating is electric here
[3:23:03] JJenson: YEP brrr

[3:23:53] daemonaedryn: Check the Kanthal Coil quest to see EBF calculations
[3:24:03] daemonaedryn: for future reference
[3:24:14] PureSpider: xDeadBringerx doesnt make much sense, it's just kinda developed that way, i think remote heating would still be a lot cheaper, but this is just the way it is :D
[3:24:20] Invalidm_: watching waffle, chilling. Gf is at work and I got today and tomorrow off
[3:24:24] Wingy_: The coils

[4:43:30] phoss2k: what is skull and bones? new ip? Or a dlc?
[4:43:33] Allmostdone: good the game looked so bad
[4:43:34] Jhreks: i wouldnt mind if starfield is delayed if it ends up being better
[4:43:35] 0sem0: Starfield is gonna be another Fallout 76 I bet.
[4:43:37] Bunjimus: there was finally some news on bloodlines 2 possibly end of 2023
[4:43:39] Joshuapetch: Production started in 2013 for skull and bones
[4:43:40] Bloodshot234: meanwhile Beyond Good and Evil however
[4:43:44] GSBressan: it's the 6th delay... and they cancelled 3 unannounced titles.
[4:43:46] jdog0616: @phoss2k its AC: Black Flag without the AC
[4:43:46] k0nk_: i thought they cant cancel due to deal with country they are making it in. like they got funds and tax breaks, want to say Portugal @Giantwaffle so they HAVE to release a working game
[4:43:51] SailorWS: Elder scrolls 6 kekw
[4:43:54] Mandorake: i was not impressed with Skull and Bones
[4:43:55] DrHax_: Obligatory fuck Ubisofts CEO peepoSip
[4:43:55] IAmJester: DC: Black Flag

[4:44:05] metalwrath22222: elder scrolls 6 on e3 COPIUM
[4:44:07] KritterIsBack: remember when they pulled out gordon joseph levitt
[4:44:18] Simon04090: Indefinitely postponed = cancelled
[4:44:20] Ghosstk: I tested the skull and bones and it's nothing compared to what they announced at the beginning... :(
[4:44:22] ChiefChilly: yea it's nationally funded or smth
[4:44:24] Wazepas: @k0nk_ Singapore, not Portugal
[4:44:27] dylan0806: Like cyberpunk
[4:44:34] iamforever27: EA = working game LUL
[4:44:34] Allmostdone: oh yea I remember that as well
[4:44:42] daemonaedryn: KEKW
[4:44:44] nAZAr1uS: First Beyond Good and Evil was a masterpiece at the time. Today it WILL be random nostalgia trash
[4:44:45] KritterIsBack: signapore pirates?
[4:44:50] ChiefChilly: or subsidized or smth
[4:44:51] Stragmol: a good business model to produce a crap game
[4:44:52] Ceratic: That is like very common
[4:44:52] Larklen: Canada has something similar, a media fund. If you fail to product/release, you have to repay back the credits/tax benefits
[4:44:53] k0nk_: @Wazepas thats it thanks for the correction
[4:44:55] ChiefChilly: they gave them money
[4:44:57] WARHERO322: Skull and bones release date now is March 9 unless it changed again
[4:44:58] IAmJester: i think some governments give out art grants for things like games.
[4:45:03] Ceratic: Movies do it a shit ton too
[4:45:09] The_Holas: Singapore Pirate Association Kappa

[4:45:24] toolos: yep you return the money you got
[4:45:25] Mayhan_GM: @giantwaffle it‚Äôs kinda true skull and bones is supported by the country and that‚Äôs why they must to release it (confirmed information I work in Ubisoft)
[4:45:31] KritterIsBack: just have a skeletoncrew work on it indefinitely I guess
[4:45:33] Mandorake: @Giantwaffle States do this with video games here.  That oen guy scammed a state in the Northeast for a bunch of money
[4:45:36] Mandorake: cannot think of his name
[4:45:37] Larklen: If they can't release a game, how they gonna have the funds to pay it back? :)
[4:45:51] Doooobz: wasn't it part of the deal with the gov that they would hire X amount of people for X amount of time
[4:45:59] Butterwhales: bankruptcy YEP
[4:46:00] aundros: it prevents people from stealing grant money @Giantwaffle
[4:46:01] SailorWS: bankruptcy
[4:46:08] jdog0616: ya, Singapore goverment game tax breaks on the coniditon they hire local talent and release the game
[4:46:09] DrHax_: Ubisofts CEO should take an 80% pay cut after those recent comments, then they would have enough money Kappa
[4:46:11] IAmJester: I. DECLARE. BANKRUPTCY!
[4:46:18] tomey36: Is pati‚Äôs The Line Finished?
[4:46:19] Mandorake: @DrHax_ Woah there lets not be hasty.
[4:46:20] Allmostdone: werll I guess its called jail time. Kappa
[4:46:21] Larklen: Yes, but hence why from a government perspective, they'd want to force a release than it being dumped and lost debt to an llc

[4:47:02] Flobu_: r6 siegr was also restarted like 5 times until it is now what it is
[4:47:03] TheRackster: Lets hope its 5 years of proper delays with development so we dont get another cyberpunk, No matter how much i love that game it deserved more love
[4:47:06] daedmissica0: Skull and Bones Got 30 Minutes of New Gameplay Following Delay
[4:47:06] CarriedNeko: what about hytale?
[4:47:09] Bloodshot234: look for all the amogus. Ci scattered them throughout the base
[4:47:13] mechoriet: @jdog0616 KEKW classic
[4:47:32] The_Holas: why not 5 years Kappa
[4:47:33] DrHax_: Surely Skull & Bones being in development for so long wont be another Duke Nukem Forever situation Clueless
[4:47:39] TheRackster: If they gave cyberpunk the year or two that the developers wanted. It would hands down be one of the greatest games released
[4:47:43] RamseyRinehaus: gotta get that infinite growth for the investors, #1 priority! Kappa
[4:47:47] calebhub514: They should've seen the writing on the wall, and scrapped the last gen version earlier and not even try to release.

[4:49:13] MetalBBA: the game feels like it came out a decade ago

[4:50:50] Larklen: $5B in 2002 is $8.25B today :)
[4:50:52] MiniApprentice: it's gotta be money

[6:49:47] kryptonite_dnb: CDJ's are love, we got them at our bar, I'm so sadge I can't use them at home
[6:49:53] winulff: 3000's are overkill. the xz is almost 3000's

[6:50:14] kryptonite_dnb: but I agree, get the 2000nxs2 if you plan CDJ's
[6:50:16] mrleonehart: !dj
[6:50:18] Swocoom: have you seen DJ Suat and his mobile rig?
[6:50:25] Yogithebaer: crashed the site
[6:50:25] Smileynator: pioneer is not pioneering websites
[6:50:26] LaroStar007: I can't find the RX3 anywhere here in Belgium :(
[6:50:27] Joshuapetch: chat close the site
[6:50:27] Amatean: did we crash them?
[6:50:29] Sevgeni: accept cookies kek
[6:50:29] Jaimster08: @PureSpider Thanks - any recommended apps or just try
[6:50:32] DarkbuilderX: It's just slow
[6:50:34] Swocoom: yep, thats him
[6:50:35] kryptonite_dnb: I preefer the physical buttons of the CDJ2000 over the touchscreen CDJ3000
[6:50:37] Styzer369: suat is absolute unit
[6:50:37] Lufcthorpy: @dagmoo Thank you sir!
[6:50:38] winulff: @kryptonite_dnb so annoying that only nx2 and 3k play flac.
[6:50:47] Rollingx: all of your cookies are mine
[6:50:49] kryptonite_dnb: @kryptonite_dnb yup agreed. slowly evolving I guess
[6:50:49] twoshotBN: right click open in new tab?
[6:50:52] LaroStar007: @Giantwaffle I can't find the RX3 anywhere here in Belgium :(
[6:50:59] prsli: did we ddos it
[6:51:05] LaroStar007: No, the pioneer site is crap
[6:51:05] kryptonite_dnb: XZ is nice, but I hate having 4 decks on 2 decks
[6:51:17] Calls1gn: Casual $2500
[6:51:25] winulff: pitch shift
[6:51:33] winulff: key shift*
[6:51:54] kryptonite_dnb: XZ+3rd CDJ that you bind to either channel 3 or 4
[6:51:56] kryptonite_dnb: is winning
[6:52:01] wolfd91: playing vinyl through it sound bad as well
[6:52:01] kryptonite_dnb: you don't need more than 3 decks realistically
[6:52:10] KritterIsBack: Do you havea virtual representation in vr?
[6:52:17] kryptonite_dnb: I very much suggest get the CDJ2000nxs2
[6:52:21] kryptonite_dnb: Physical>Touch buttons
[6:52:22] Jaimster08: Woah he's been streaming for 7hrs?
[6:52:28] LaroStar007: @Giantwaffle I thought you could use Shift-Load to sideload in deck 3-4
[6:52:35] kryptonite_dnb: We like to drink so we need to feel the buttons
[6:52:38] kryptonite_dnb: KEKW
[6:52:52] AleXanDreMau: KEKW
[6:52:52] LaroStar007: @Giantwaffle i was using the controller
[6:52:55] coolcake2: why need dj controller if you can have virtual dj
[6:52:56] winulff: and there, the denon double layered decks work better
[6:53:00] LaroStar007: no rekordbox @Giantwaffle
[6:53:54] winulff: Use memory cues, and use the call cue buttons
[6:53:55] kryptonite_dnb: CDJ's are so simple to use though... I used to DJ on rekordbox and only ever google the CDJ's before my first gig. And it felt easier then a controller
[6:53:56] haydcarney: I've been having heaps of fun with my new FLX4, I've been working on a new set all day
[6:54:03] kryptonite_dnb: dj on traktor*

[6:54:33] Mandorake: @Giantwaffle should you have pati and ci help you with your space exploration pack so you can finally finish
[6:54:34] prsli: @Giantwaffle why didnt you  ast ChatGPT to fix it?
[6:54:38] Lufcthorpy: Do you record your mix and put them anywhere?
[6:54:51] kryptonite_dnb: honestly the only reason we got them was so we can host big DJ's, because they're club standard and requested by djs
[6:54:52] ChromaCym: yoooo house
[6:54:59] winulff: Standalone players are really only needed for clubs, if you need to replace a single deck
[6:55:02] haydcarney: I got to play on the CDJ3000 at the store and they were rather juicy
[6:55:03] PureSpider: we talking house house, or like tech house or deep house?
[6:55:17] DTCxPredator: DTCxPredator subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 21 months!

[6:55:23] winulff: @haydcarney The whole file browsing system is amazing
[6:55:25] kryptonite_dnb: Let me just suggest: if you ever spill a drink on it, don't till the machine
[6:55:27] Rollingx: are you getting paid for those gigs?
[6:55:28] kryptonite_dnb: it's got a spill tray
[6:55:33] kryptonite_dnb: tilt*
[6:55:53] haydcarney: @haydcarney Yeah it's really nice!
[6:56:08] iloveplants: what if you vomit on it tho
[6:56:15] kryptonite_dnb: nice one! bottom plates are super protected anyway, and I'm sure the XZ is lifted by itself aswell
[6:56:22] jdog0616: @iloveplants maybe dont do that?
[6:56:27] kryptonite_dnb: honestly you don't need more than the 2k software tho
[6:56:31] IlsaGold: It is not that expensive, I bought my first double Denon 25 years ago and it cost over $1000.
[6:56:35] ryanmgeek: Do you have a link to your mixes?
[6:56:38] prsli: @Giantwaffle you gget paid or just for fun?
[6:56:38] mechoriet: Copege never say its not possible KEKW
[6:56:39] haydcarney: @Giantwaffle Have you seen the evolution of the CDJ's?
[6:56:42] iloveplants: @iloveplants you can't stop me Kappa
[6:56:42] kryptonite_dnb: it's the same, only the 3k's have a nicer U
[6:56:44] kryptonite_dnb: UI
[6:57:05] kryptonite_dnb: ahhh okay that makes sense
[6:57:10] kryptonite_dnb: for big shows I always have sets prepared
[6:57:11] LaroStar007: What would you recommend? The XZ, RX3, or the Traktor S4?
[6:57:17] prsli: @Giantwaffle you need to go to gym more :P
[6:57:23] kryptonite_dnb: so I don't really use the filtering at all
[6:57:42] kryptonite_dnb: mate I still use the DDJ-RB at home and doubledrop and do technical mixing all the time...
[6:57:42] Moobot: You can sub to Waffle by clicking this neat link -> twitch.tv/giantwaffle/subscribe SUBprise
[6:57:51] LaroStar007: @Giantwaffle i do have a RR already tho and want to upgrade
