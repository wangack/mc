[1:45:49] NCNJ: there’s something to be said for people operating at the top of their profession. A doctor can be a family doctor or a heart surgeon for example. To me doing AA runs is like operating at the top of a speed runners profession. So if there are some hoplite carryovers they should appreciate it more. IMO

[2:55:50] penguinsandstuff: forting
[2:55:51] Dfanm: the best double spawners are buried double spawners

[2:58:44] FlaiFlai: Fein in general rarely uses boats, even with woods
[2:58:52] shig_tv: the fact that you can’t make boats out of nether wood is tragic
[2:58:53] FlaiFlai: as long as he has food
[2:59:02] shig_tv: makes sense though
[2:59:05] shig_tv: since they wouldn’t burn

[3:05:35] penguinsandstuff: YIPPEE
[3:05:36] CurtisDN_: well you should always look for portal room first because its the thing you can use the piechart for
[3:05:37] the_mmx: PLEASE
[3:05:38] FlaiFlai: @TheRealZimmShady oh he looks for pr first because you can locate that with preemptive
[3:05:43] FlaiFlai: and so he knows where that is
[3:05:43] CurtisDN_: you should always go where you know something is first
[3:05:48] CurtisDN_: insetad of just wandering
[3:05:48] penguinsandstuff: nope YEP
[3:05:51] Novamb: surely its right behind you

[3:06:59] Daniel_H212: pog
[3:07:03] CurtisDN_: and if you find the library before the portal room, then its gravy
[3:07:03] TheRealZimmShady: makes perfect sense gotcha

[3:07:37] FlaiFlai: TheRealZimmShady actually knowing that it's usually less than like 8 deep is super useful, because you know when to turn around
[3:07:39] Novamb: limit
