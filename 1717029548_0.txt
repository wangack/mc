[0:51:15] 1killersquirrel: arsenic and ruidit in the same miner, sounds like value miners right now
[0:51:21] deadgolfer: sounds like drone side quest

[0:55:38] Maximus439: sanity 📉 -  COPIUM 📈
[0:55:38] TigerLuv: 📉
[0:55:48] kane1941: did Pati tell you about the crafting card inside the microminer interface?

[0:56:04] Twin5un: WhySoSerious all it takes is one bad machine
[0:56:18] Dagmoo: just make another line 4Head
[0:56:21] Swocoom: @kane1941 he found it already, and removed it
[0:56:21] gozdon: you wanted to do what again before Pati logs in? pepeLaugh
[0:56:40] IAmBr3tt: that one onlu has a x16
[0:56:42] Dioxinn: instantly turned back into liquid arsenic?
[0:57:02] deadgolfer: adding a 2nd ore washer would help a lot, main backup i think
[0:57:03] OfficialNickNack: check for realgar in me
[0:57:11] frainsbreeze: you say shouldn'T be...
[0:57:11] kane1941: unless you use it for gallium arsenide

[0:59:46] kane1941: unless you use it for gallium arsenide
[1:00:03] PureSpider: tier five miners, isnt it?
[1:00:25] PureSpider: didnt you need something else from them as well?
[1:00:34] sorefingers: maybe there i a stack of arsenic happily waiting in the interface of the mk2 reactor. you deactivated it getting pulled by the conduit, not the interface i think
[1:00:36] Dagmoo: 6 tonks dude LUL
[1:00:43] Yakobro: sounds like a forge hammer
[1:00:52] kane1941: metal bender?

[1:01:50] PureSpider: imagine how slow this processing woult be without parallel recipes
[1:02:45] meanhattermeanderer: Where is he getting all his resources? A digital miner?
[1:02:50] jpd65800: sift and crush gems for more dust?
[1:03:06] Archie8300: "The Line" should have another source of arsenic right?

[1:03:52] deadgolfer: might be processed now, check me?
[1:04:51] frainsbreeze: make a 2nd centrifuge here?
[1:04:56] 0sem0: can you make it faster?
[1:04:57] Morlega: I think it just started on realgar
[1:04:57] Superswag3211: Empty it out?
[1:05:00] Yakobro: how far are you from the next parallel hatch lol?
[1:05:08] Egrassa22: can't you make separate line for it?
[1:05:22] HiroOfTime: Do you need stone dust at all?
[1:05:37] BigClown264: Build a second Line LUL
[1:05:38] jdog0616: @HiroOfTime one of the by products is important
[1:05:44] Moondarra: 'arse'
[1:05:48] Swocoom: stone dust is slow
[1:05:52] PureSpider: @Moondarra EleGiggle
[1:06:03] Morlega: You can split the realgar stacks and use half to replace the other dusts
[1:06:04] deadgolfer: is the arsenic being auto liquified? i
[1:06:04] Rollingx: maybe its not going in because of a filter or somehting
[1:06:04] akaCube: fill everything fix half-stacks of raelgar
[1:06:17] DX_Plates: @BigClown264 Pati is build The Last Line Before Creative
[1:06:32] HiroOfTime: is there a filter?
[1:06:36] Rollingx: its processing the rest, not realgar
[1:06:38] Morlega: Replace the other stacks with half of the other realgar stacks
[1:06:38] Superswag3211: Fill all the inputs
[1:06:38] kane1941: check output?
[1:06:48] sorefingers: why not just throw 64 realgar in the system and prepare another thing until its processed?
[1:06:49] Traverus98: the arsenic in the buffer for the reactor still has to be filled in the interface
[1:06:50] Reksel_: What ever happened to bacondonut?
[1:06:52] EllisVlad: EllisVlad subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 38 months! 
[1:06:54] TPells67: Is it filtered out?
[1:06:55] PureSpider: seqChat is there a filter seqChat fill all the slots seqChat check the output
[1:07:06] octopusgrime: @Reksel_ whatever happened to google?
[1:07:19] 0sem0: finally lol
[1:07:21] Reksel_: try me
[1:07:41] TuxLafitte: hands out the required copium for today's strim....
[1:07:45] kane1941: maybe trioxide is the alternative way ?
[1:07:47] xindianx: question, genuine - wasn't the plan to beat this mod pack by Jan 1st? Did that change or?
[1:07:55] Reksel_: fell off face of the earth and this person right here worked with them LMAO yes lemme ask google
[1:07:57] PureSpider: @kane1941 no lewSmile
[1:07:59] 0sem0: @Reksel_ he did something stupid
[1:08:01] Simon04090: What even does the stone dust give?
[1:08:07] Reksel_: ah
[1:08:12] DX_Plates: @TuxLafitte Sir, you are under investigation for distribution of large amounts of mind altering substances.
[1:08:19] PureSpider: Reksel_ yes, do ask google, please - this is not the bacondonut answering machine stream
[1:08:22] pickleboa: hows the grind?
[1:08:40] Reksel_: Oh my bad didnt know i asked 69 questions about him

[1:10:31] Vovosunt: I still don't get why you don't make all recipes x64
[1:11:05] Morlega: Not all ratios allow x64 LUL
[1:11:13] Vovosunt: you can put more stacks into the recipe...
[1:11:32] Morlega: Yeah he could multi-stack for the over-64 ones but it's just a pain
[1:12:32] Vovosunt: it doesn't usually, outside of the machines where you made the interfaces block
[1:12:36] MasterKraft: juice isnt worth the squeeze chat
[1:12:55] DX_Plates: @MasterKraft poppy cock, juice is awesome
[1:12:57] xrokic: maybe just a limi on the ebf
[1:13:17] matori666: it is in the mixer downstairs
[1:13:54] matori666: Pati made it 16 for some reason
[1:14:29] sorefingers: its insane, when the subserver managed to finish the pack, they said they were making one heart of the universe every 1.5 Minutes. Of course the creative tank helps, but still the amount of resources neededare insane. they basically crafted everything in 90 seconds what youve been working on for the past 3-4 days
[1:14:30] matori666: yoink a few more ebfs
[1:14:45] kbigLiar: limiter + crafting card time?
[1:15:00] kane1941: what if there is no other use for the dust?
[1:15:38] ogirinoalbino: how much system memory is this ModPack taking up at this point?
[1:15:51] banutzul: where is your armor?
[1:16:01] deadgolfer: put the drones in that you made
[1:16:03] iQuantumFlux: Make sure to request more dust

[1:16:11] eckphoenix: whats the wood situation looking like?
[1:16:18] officialhunterx: so doesnt the angel ring
[1:16:20] jdog0616: check the space station

[1:19:59] boogerbomb01: MOAR machines!
[1:20:04] Swocoom: go look what Pati did
[1:20:08] PureSpider: if you craft them by hand, put them into an interface to put them back into the system, that way they will be used in the recipe
[1:20:09] Bagz_69: @swocoom patty did that already
[1:20:11] mage178: pati already did that
[1:20:12] Hegberr: You might want to buy some lapis, that lapis crafting is not going anywhere
[1:20:13] kane1941: go see what pati did
[1:20:19] Pict1on: PAtti did already but you can add more IIRC
[1:20:36] Swocoom: yup

[1:23:48] F0xyTheFox: @Giantwaffle  i can't craft rubber sheet with a hammer and i can't figure out why
[1:23:51] Morlega: Touching the interface
[1:23:59] boogerbomb01: Make 10 more
[1:24:02] boogerbomb01: 10 times as fast
[1:24:08] Simon04090: Yes exactly
[1:24:08] Morlega: @Giantwaffle you know how a single ME interface can use multiple molecular assemblers at once? Exact same principle
[1:24:16] kbigLiar: is the bottleneck now lapis from dust?
[1:24:18] matori666: that slot on the right, under the power, what is it for? are there some speed upgrades or capacitors?

[3:11:39] Apparentthreat: would be my guess
[3:11:44] Noamwild: I believe that it is being auto exported into a regular mixer somwhere
[3:11:50] Apparentthreat: change HW acceleration on your browser to see if it helps
[3:11:59] ExumeTV: @Apparentthreat  i can promise you its not a Computer "power" issue. lol
[3:12:32] Jaydepps00: @ExumeTV try changing from fullscreen to borderless

[3:12:35] Jaydepps00: or vice versa
[3:12:35] Apparentthreat: @ExumeTV anecdote, I couldn't play Modded MC and watch streams on source quality on my weaker computer. same thing

[3:13:37] MrArrig: Can't you update tthe recipe to ignore nbt?
[3:13:37] usernameNull: can't you update the pattern to ignore information in the pattern terminal
[3:14:02] ExumeTV: @Apparentthreat  with video and path going 25% CPU usage and 40% memory
[3:14:34] Apparentthreat: @ExumeTV is opera using an HW acceleration?
[3:14:44] Apparentthreat: I mean, do other browsers do the same ting?
[3:15:00] ExumeTV: Thats what i was about to check because i had the issue with chrome and it was HW accel being turned off fixed it
[3:15:26] tony_rex666: you have an upgrade to keep 1 seed
[3:15:38] brattyssiss: Yo !!!! @Giantwaffle
[3:15:57] MisterRabbitHead: can't you ignore NBT on recipes?
[3:16:27] ExumeTV: i did have Hardware Accel lets see if that fixed it
[3:16:28] SeanTKE: @Giantwaffle send out a couple tier 8 missions they also provide dragon eggs
[3:16:44] boogerbomb01: with NBT stuff just do itr by hand. it sucks but its just easier
[3:17:09] MisterRabbitHead: simplest solution seems to be to remove the dislocator pattern and craft by hand
[3:17:11] Morlega: Dislocator should only have NBT when you've configured it, but can't really trust that LUL
[3:17:14] Thalmize: Thalmize is paying forward the Gift they got from mrleonehart to SeanTKE!

[4:04:00] Morlega: Warp Engine vs Warp Core?
[4:04:01] Simon04090: That is warp engine
[4:04:04] drsnaki96: click your autocrafted dislocators in to be sure
[4:04:08] Lupic: hello chat and waffle pepeSmoke
[4:04:13] obylix: factorio is getting an inflation fueled price increase next week $30 -> $35
[4:04:16] Lupic: I am here for the sidequest content
[4:04:25] Nexhunter: @obylix greed fueled price increase
[4:04:33] fbritoferreira: You need to use the one from the system for it to work
[4:04:39] caopradog: is there another recipe that uses it?
[4:04:46] Simon04090: Another recipe still messed up maybe
[4:04:46] Morlega: You removed the wrong pattern?
[4:04:52] fbritoferreira: Make the recipe frome jei and replace from the ae2 inventory
[4:05:05] x1xamen: ^
[4:05:06] Morlega: You removed the Warp Engine pattern though
[4:05:17] Nexhunter: can the chaotic injectors speed it up?
[4:05:32] Nexhunter: dwjftSuffer
[4:05:41] Vovosunt: is it not an input issue?
[4:05:44] BlackNocturne: Injectors only speed up power draw, not crafting time
[4:05:50] boogerbomb01: lets cheat and add a tick accelerator mod to the pack lol
[4:05:51] omar_i_: imagine crafting these with your old power gen setup pepeLaugh
[4:05:52] TheShelfman: What's with all the rumbling?
[4:05:56] thomasausen: you did not change the nbt info you did it the same way you made it the first time
[4:05:57] HostileLogOut: @Giantwaffle what are those wierd sounds in the background?
[4:06:05] Nexhunter: @HostileLogOut it the draconic crafter
[4:06:15] HostileLogOut: sounds like a dam war :D
[4:06:20] HostileLogOut: no it sounds fun
[4:06:23] kinglouisxvii: yes
[4:06:26] Code4Coffee: @omar21cu You mean they ever updated it or just recycled the power? pepeLaugh
[4:06:28] fbritoferreira: The problem is that pattern recipe is using the wrong dislocator, the one in the ae2 is the correct one
[4:06:43] maimvice13: do it make us deaf
[4:06:46] Variandra: @Giantwaffle unmute it all for the content!
[4:06:47] omar_i_: Code4Coffee its not cheating COPIUM
[4:06:52] Grieve_r: i dont think it is because of the fuel level
[4:07:12] fbritoferreira: There was a 1 in there
[4:07:19] rektumtv: use oredict subsitutions?
[4:07:20] inforv: Did it say fuel:0
[4:07:32] fbritoferreira: Try replacing it and see if it works
[4:07:39] boogerbomb01: he JUST replaced it
[4:07:41] inforv: The ones from NEI
[4:07:44] Simon04090: Is there another recipe using it
[4:07:46] ImposterArchitect: Does it use it for any other components?
[4:07:48] Simon04090: ?
[4:07:50] Morlega: Try toggling ore dictionary in the pattern?
[4:08:11] officialhunterx: is that fans or gpu for white noise
[4:08:12] Moobot: Come join the Waffle House Discord! <# https://discord.gg/fhGFtMuzdS
[4:08:17] officialhunterx: its going ham
[4:08:24] Simon04090: That is not just ore dict
[4:08:33] Simon04090: Also does some types of nbt
[4:08:33] Intohimos: You should just set up a pattern for it
[4:08:35] inforv: I was saying the ones from NEI use ones with fuel. And when you craft them it will say Fuel:0
[4:08:36] jayrickson87: late game is just staring a me crafting window mostly
[4:08:37] Simon04090: (Not all)
[4:08:50] Simon04090: The switch also does some types of nbt
[4:09:08] FishhNado: and watching for errors
[4:09:31] omar_i_: how's your Melvor Idle going Waffle? you still play it?
[4:09:31] Lenny1130: every time i play a modpack i grind to get the me system set up but then once its set up i never know what to do and quickly phase out of playing the modpack
[4:09:33] DarkKnghtt58: warp engines
[4:09:35] DarkKnghtt58: not warp drives
[4:09:36] Simon04090: Well vault hunters is no autocrafting until very late game (and you really dont need it)
[4:09:46] Simon04090: So it’s not all of modded minecraft
[4:09:47] Tyraelol: i bet you need more awaken draconium for the drones
[4:10:48] sorefingers: Nbt is weird. What worked for me with some recipees is changing the outcome for example of the dislocator recipe with the one the system created, some you have to try to change the ingredient. always trial and error🦧
[4:10:56] Code4Coffee: At least ME looks nice and not like something from xnet :P
[4:11:26] xDeadBringerx: @code4coffee Xnet’s user experience is so shitty
[4:11:33] SebastiaanO: it shouldn't be, you make draconium using scales i thought
[4:11:52] fbritoferreira: Maybe is the dislocator recipe output that is wrong
[4:12:00] yoghi356: Is it a public server that you are playing on?
[4:12:00] Code4Coffee: @xDeadBringerx It really is. I really like the mod though. Very handy once you get a hang of it.
[4:12:54] SebastiaanO: use an interface
[4:13:01] inforv: ^
[4:13:04] x1xamen: interface, blocking mode?
[4:13:07] Askjong: crafting card?
[4:13:18] BlackNocturne: Interface + size filter on enderIO conduit?
[4:13:21] Rollingx: filter with 4 stacks
[4:13:26] thomasausen: make a recipe that says intupts as recipes and the output of the miner as a result
[4:13:28] SebastiaanO: it'll put everything it needs in
[4:13:37] fbritoferreira: yeah it should work with crafting card, you can do the interface with 4 stacks
[4:13:39] TheUsefulDistraction: TheUsefulDistraction subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 6 months! hello bby
[4:13:41] mrleonehart: Big filter
[4:13:49] mrleonehart: Tot he right
[4:13:56] turtles844: Wambo filter
[4:13:56] Allmostdone: how about 3 and half stacks. Kappa
[4:14:01] GrumpyEngineer: crafting card should do it
[4:14:16] thomasausen: make a recipe that says miner intupts as recipes and the output of the miner as a result
[4:14:28] nathy_rl: could always try the big one
[4:14:32] Timiderxbox: Big advanced filter works that way
[4:14:35] FishhNado: AE2 interface -> chest -> enderio conduit

[4:15:40] StraightErro: @mrtraxx yeah he got up for a few
[4:15:46] Snah__: you could use a robot arm and keep exact 4 stacks or w/e
[4:15:54] Morlega: Direct bus isn't needed if recipes don't overlap?
[4:15:59] xDeadBringerx: Laser input it
[4:16:02] daedmissica0: dont break it

[7:12:20] rydemtb: education system is complete garbage
[7:12:22] Larklen: I mean, people have paid others to past tests/write essays for them before, this is just another version of that imo.
[7:12:22] Jimanjim: what are we more than a insane neural network tho KEKW
[7:12:22] FluffyWubbler: lol same
[7:12:22] A_Tin_Rat: reevaluate the education system
[7:12:24] omar_i_: what is chatGPT?
[7:12:24] Smileynator: ChatGPT is like google, it's not cheating.
[7:12:28] wondox: humans are becoming dumber and dumber
[7:12:31] Snah__: also you'll use cursive for the rest of your life
[7:12:34] TigerLuv: crib-notes?
[7:12:37] glove_17: chat gpt is like a tool and its not brain
[7:12:46] jdog0616: @Smileynator louder for the dumbass teachers who dont understand
[7:12:46] Duke1454: I used chatgtp to make my entire drug treatment evaluation for a fake patient that is addicted to cocaine, and i got a 100%
[7:12:47] Troupster: When I grew up they told me I wouldn't have AI in my pocket and now as an AI chatter I proved them wrong.
[7:12:48] DigitalVortex92: @Giantwaffle And yet we'll still have to write programs with pen and paper for tests krippKEK
[7:12:50] Smileynator: it should be
[7:12:51] leadtooth: @versioux who cares about how somethign gets done LUL
[7:12:52] Kardiiac: chatgpt is closer to using google for hw
[7:12:53] slyscaz: AI will make us like Irobot
[7:12:54] cheppard: if an ai can pass your exam it can probaply do your future job study something else
[7:12:55] Longor1996: More like, everyone has a *billion* calculators in their pocket. :D
[7:12:55] dollar_cave: This problem is only going to get worse
[7:12:56] onkelkonkel: Education systems hasen't adapted for AI yet.
[7:12:57] yuhikyaku: it deff needs to update majorly
[7:12:57] bcdmonkey: Knowledge ≠ aptitude ≠ skill
[7:12:57] venom366: i mean they just mad they didn't have this when they were in school Kappa
[7:12:58] HolyIceCube: the problem is not AI is getting smarter but people are getting dumber.
[7:12:59] arkun_: The assessments were already flawed, but using ChatGPT is still wrong
[7:12:59] Lupic: chatgpt is a calculator for text, give it some time and it'll be the norm
[7:13:01] bird404: The system fails. The goal must be for students to become smarter, not get better grades.
[7:13:01] MasterKraft: come on @Giantwaffle chatGPt is so dang good.  With that said there are tools that test for AI, so not a big deal just an extra step.
[7:13:03] hiposlipo_: it will replace
[7:13:05] Opusdeity: Teach people how to think, cook, and do their taxes
[7:13:05] navalship55: I could see AI as like an actual functioning Siri
[7:13:05] praxiz: I saw an AI that would sync lip movements to dubbed movies.. that was pretty cool... didn't replace the job of the actor tho
[7:13:08] mrleonehart: @Giantwaffle At the rate we are going I fully expect AI to teach our kids and then humans will be the assistant.
[7:13:08] yuhikyaku: eventually
[7:13:11] Smileynator: @Smileynator pepeGuitar
[7:13:11] jdog0616: you will get replace by someone using AI
[7:13:12] ByAnAnus: one of my yeacher said he tested us to know if we know how to use the tool we have
[7:13:13] Jaydepps00: education system hasn't changed for a hundred years
[7:13:14] BuffManKyle: There was a reddit post where someones professor told them to use chatgpt
[7:13:14] Opsidill: What's that item you have 1M of?
[7:13:15] Jaydepps00: maybe its time
[7:13:15] bigvariable: it will also replace some
[7:13:16] Tenkaichi500: company greed will make it replace jobs lol
[7:13:16] Nexhunter: chatgpt is gonna fail once microsoft gets it hand on more of it to integrate into their products widePepeLaugh
[7:13:17] Sloppy_D: Yeah ChatGPT will be used to help draft essays and basic coding
[7:13:20] A_Tin_Rat: education also wasn't adapted for online either. so strike number 2
[7:13:22] CoolAcid: Growing up I was told I wouldn't have AI in my pocket. Little did they know I am AI...
[7:13:24] Rocknsugar: it'll enhance some jobs, but it will definitely be used to replace even more
[7:13:25] SniperDude24: I had a phsyics teacher not make us remember forumals. said we can always look them up. just need to know how to apply them to the question
[7:13:25] Jimanjim: the AI just increase the demand for higher education
[7:13:25] DareDeFlug: I do think it will replace
[7:13:29] DecoyOcelot: if you are copy pasting an essay or whatever out of chatGPT, thats a problem. like what are you actually learning by doing that?
[7:13:35] nick43087: truee @bigvariable that's what happens with productivity
[7:13:38] mrleonehart: @Nexhunter Dont disrespect Microsoft....They/We are listening Kappa
[7:13:39] hiposlipo_: we only have 10 years left max
[7:13:39] Nexhunter: also chat do not use chatgpt for essays
[7:13:44] Munku9980: I went back at 36 for my degree
[7:13:51] coolcake2: bruh
[7:13:52] coolcake2: what
[7:13:54] ImposterArchitect: Fuck that guy
[7:13:54] Nexhunter: OMEGALUL
[7:13:54] Jaydepps00: KEKW
[7:13:55] TerenceBlake: keep them poor and stupid injoy  the system
[7:13:55] cmmeth: wtf
[7:13:55] ImposterArchitect: Seriously
[7:13:56] cheppard: ez
[7:13:57] melenejason13: KEKW
[7:14:01] Morlega: KEKW
[7:14:01] xxLatte: jesus
[7:14:02] ImposterArchitect: Fucking Boomers
[7:14:04] B0N37ESS: a good engineer doesn\t need to know stuff, they need to know how to apply and find stuff
[7:14:08] Troupster: teacher was like git gud
[7:14:11] frainsbreeze: i ask my students to just use python
[7:14:11] PaulFlies: thing is, at the end of the day if you're not learning stuff you need to learn you are just cheating yourself in the long run. Gonna trip up eventually
[7:14:14] philipkatis: oof KEKW
[7:14:14] rydemtb: very stupid
[7:14:15] Smileynator: i never learned how to transform formulas
[7:14:17] Smileynator: such bull
[7:14:17] ReedS77: Like the Superman formula in Physics in high school haha. Anyone else have this?
[7:14:18] Jaydepps00: because you'll be doing chemistry in a forest w no reference books :)
[7:14:22] rydemtb: memory test not knowledge
[7:14:26] knowledge_within: difference between an engineer and a theorist
[7:14:26] Smileynator: my memory is a sieve
[7:14:27] fbritoferreira: Memorization based education is going to be replaced soon
[7:14:28] boltzmanC: i got an 8x12 cheatsheet for me EM2 final.... no way i would of been ableto memorize all that shit
[7:14:28] Sloppy_D: Tbh EE classes suck
[7:14:29] Igneous3: why not both
[7:14:30] broseph_larz: @B0N37ESS applies to may jobs indeed
[7:14:32] FluffyWubbler: had a very similar experience to that in an econometrics course
[7:14:32] PaulFlies: agree about memory testing. it's dumb
[7:14:36] yuhikyaku: yeah i hate that
[7:14:39] NephilimXS: this is why math and science was my strong suit
[7:14:40] Kryllyk: Isn't knowledge actually knowing and remembering it though?
[7:14:41] A_Tin_Rat: remember and forget it as soon as you finish the class
[7:14:42] bigvariable: no it isn't
[7:14:43] melenejason13: Signal processing was one of the worst things I have ever done
[7:14:45] yuhikyaku: memory testing was only thing that mattered really
[7:14:46] phoss2k: at the same time though, if you had showed up to a no-calculator maths exam with a calculator, isnt that the same as the chatgpt issue?
[7:14:46] frainsbreeze: always evaluate the application of knowledge
[7:14:49] Jaydepps00: nothing changed
[7:14:50] bcdmonkey: I had a professor try and revoke my degree because I took his classes out of order
[7:14:51] yuhikyaku: which was dumb
[7:14:51] B0N37ESS: @broseph_larz  fo sho
[7:14:52] Smileynator: nah, it's still the same
[7:14:53] TigerLuv: 7:05 into vod -- been 10 mins. turn the circuit thingy in the clear room back on
[7:14:54] Qbertman: as someone with good memory i skipped half my classes and passed with honors lol
[7:14:56] A_Tin_Rat: still the same
[7:14:57] MasterKraft: only one i remember is a2+b2 = c2, ha ha.  all other formulas can be looked up, could you imagine doing it wrong at work?  you gotta validate man
[7:14:57] boltzmanC: yea tests should test you on your ability to solve problems, not regurgitate info
[7:14:58] trabadam: We had to memorize the Laplace transforms NotLikeThis
[7:14:59] Flyer_Soul: No still same
[7:15:01] hiposlipo_: i rember the doorm room days
[7:15:01] ImposterArchitect: I just started my masters again.  it's still stupid.
[7:15:02] Morlega: not much changed
[7:15:02] blastfamus: for my job, i need to be able to memorize a lot of stuff, so that practice in school was helpful
[7:15:02] Askjong: T-20 minutes until Rocket Lab launch
[7:15:05] fbritoferreira: I passed school in the uk without story because I could remember all I have done in my classes
[7:15:08] Dioxinn: I wonder if teachers can design a test using ChatGPT to realize actual utilization of the information taught.
[7:15:08] navalship55: In school summer is forget everything, and prepare room for new assignments
[7:15:09] Askjong: t-30*
[7:15:17] DonGromus: @Giantwaffle turn on the machine
[7:15:21] burrrst: College is still the same. Memorize and apply to exams
[7:15:21] arkun_: I got my degree, got out, not looking back
[7:15:26] DDPrime: most schooling is proving you can be asked to read some documentation on a topic. and it's more than most people can
[7:15:28] arkun_: * unless someone pays me to go back
[7:15:32] TigerLuv: turn the circuit thingy in the clear room back on
[7:15:33] nighttron: Reaktivate the machine
[7:15:42] Longor1996: @Dioxinn Use ChatGPT to generate fresh tests for every student? ;P
[7:15:48] n3wtpond: i just discovered wallpaper engine and its fantastic
[7:15:50] navalship55: Rough
[7:15:54] iQuantumFlux: I finished EE BS and MS a little over 10 years ago. I found MS was way easier than BS because you were applying knowledge, not just spitting equations like you talked about.
[7:15:55] semie0012: most of my mechanical enginering exams are open book
[7:15:56] banshay3: @Dioxinn absolutely no
[7:16:07] Jeatio: Make sine tea
[7:16:08] DigitalVortex92: that didn't make enough
[7:16:10] kaos4666: who likes school KEKW
[7:16:11] DigitalVortex92: You're missing 4
[7:16:16] Larklen: cant wait to see how virtual assistants evolve over the next 5 years :)
[7:16:18] Lambinicioh: Passion is a very strong driving force
[7:16:19] TimmyVRC: yeah Ive been at school for the past 1 1/2 years straight and its starting to get really old
[7:16:21] deandosss: shouldnt of been deep throatin patti last night lul
[7:16:22] Feist_: I did that. had classes from Jan - Dec, with no break until Christmas break
[7:16:23] ImposterArchitect: Degrees don'te mean anything after your first job
[7:16:23] A_Tin_Rat: I kinda appreciate my Econ prof for making us learn the material rather than just memorizing it
[7:16:34] mrleonehart: @Giantwaffle That was me as well. I worked full time during school and even now my degree while nice looking it has not helped my career in my work...I work in the field I studied for but my degree was never even looked at or asked about
[7:16:39] ImposterArchitect: unless you're trying to get to that next EXP level for promotion
[7:16:45] glove_17: degree is not to determine you quality of your life
[7:16:48] SmokeBaIl: What degree did you study?  @Giantwaffle
[7:16:49] ReedS77: Started in ChemE in college and finished with a business degree and MBA lmao
[7:16:50] yuhikyaku: you got to care about it to get something out of it
[7:17:01] iQuantumFlux: @imposterarchitect Not necessarily. My MS has been required for promotion through the DoD career progression.
[7:17:07] PODD: and network
[7:17:10] bcdmonkey: Degrees are BS some time. One of the guys I work with has so many yet messes up the most
[7:17:23] mrleonehart: I already had my first job in the field I studied for. @Giantwaffle I expected school to improve my skills but it honestly drew me back lol
[7:17:35] Nexhunter: it happens
[7:17:39] arkun_: I would love to go back and get a CompE MS, but I ain’t payin for school now
[7:17:41] yuhikyaku: waste of time
[7:17:43] Kardiiac: its not even degrees anymore. its all about internships
[7:17:44] oxlBEASTlxo: my degrees has been 8 years of memorization
[7:17:47] PaulFlies: but when your dad studied they probably didn't have software / CS degrees
[7:17:48] iQuantumFlux: Unfortunately some promotion paths are blocked by MS degrees, for me.
[7:17:51] yuhikyaku: alot of classes were a waste of time
[7:17:55] TelRehiad: back then.. CS degrees were pretty rare
[7:17:57] banshay3: yeah that'll do it
[7:17:58] Baysyxx: i wish schools taught how to build credit, how to buy a house, how to  set up your end life
[7:17:58] broseph_larz: True. Got a degree in innovation management and nowadays working on stuff that didn't existed back then
[7:18:00] Tiggaboo: CS Degree --> Lighting System Architect
[7:18:08] mrleonehart: I have a Degree in IT and Cybersecurity.....I work in IT and Data Center Infrastructure Security
[7:18:10] DX_Plates: I don't have a degree (Software Engineer II) and no one on my team has a CS degree.
[7:18:14] phoss2k: what is that building in front of you?
[7:18:22] jmm548: so dumb
[7:18:22] Moobot: You can sub to Waffle by clicking this neat link -> twitch.tv/giantwaffle/subscribe SUBprise
[7:18:27] Kardiiac: mechanical engineer --> software development
[7:18:34] BlackNocturne: Welcome to society
[7:18:38] Larklen: Yeah, but your dad uses spaces sooooo... ItIsWhatItIs
[7:18:39] IlsaGold: people are stupid
[7:18:40] Dagmoo: yeah sometimes thats very dumb
[7:18:40] Larklen: Kappa
[7:18:41] fbritoferreira: its a us thing tbh in europe is the other way around
[7:18:41] kaappx: turn machine back on @Giantwaffle
[7:18:44] PaulFlies: gate keeping YEP
[7:18:45] yuhikyaku: yeah so wrong
[7:18:47] Apparentthreat: companies don't want to spend money/time on workforce development
[7:18:48] Rampage_eM: I hated college honestly dropped out 8 years ago now making over $100k/yr and only 28just grabbed IT Certs imo work experience trumps what you learned in school
[7:18:53] praxiz: Do you have 25 years of experience or do you often have 1 year of experience repeated 25 times?
[7:18:56] drsnaki96: what's even better is when clients disregard your degree and knowlage and go full Karen mode on you
[7:18:56] arkun_: @dx_plates I have a Comp E with a CS minor, and I forget that I have the highest CS formal education on my team
[7:18:58] k0nk_: thats like that in almost all job markets in US
[7:19:05] glove_17: yeah sometimes Experience is nothing compare to study
[7:19:10] Nexhunter: if the job is involving say a lot of  mentoring and career progression assistance it could be seen as less of a risk if the person has a PHD cause in theory they could teach the younger devs
[7:19:16] flameofazure: @rampage_em How did you find your first job
[7:19:17] monocerotis94: Hello, first time watching 👋
[7:19:18] aaaas3: nothing strange, cuz we hire ppl "for", not by "why"
[7:19:36] RogueLightning_: Same thing happen to my dad because he had a college degree and they wanted him to have a university degree
[7:19:43] Sloppy_D: For SWE experience is better than the degree with a few exceptions.
[7:19:44] Tenkaichi500: we do be parasocial
[7:19:51] Larklen: ItIsWhatItIs
[7:19:54] Tiggaboo: your dad? my dad
[7:19:56] aaaas3: if we need CFO we must hire ppl with CFO skills, not an "excellent colleague"
[7:19:57] SebastiaanO: i got paid more than my collegues who had like 20 years more experience, just because my degree was higher. which is really stupid to me
[7:20:01] JessikaRae: JessikaRae subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 65 months! 
[7:20:03] mrleonehart: Imagine doing a job for 20+ years and being told you can't have the role because you are missing a degree.....That sucks and hurts @Giantwaffle
[7:20:07] Rampage_eM: @flameofazure my first job paid me $30,000 6 years ago honestly just applied to every entry level it job
[7:20:07] Jaydepps00: OUR dad kkomrade
[7:20:16] Nexhunter: @SebastiaanO cause more is expected out of you
[7:20:26] DX_Plates: @arkun_ Yea we have a Dr, but he doesn't use his degree at all (except for maybe hobby stuff) LUL
[7:20:42] Frecked: Frecked subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 35 months! 
[7:20:53] Frecked: Yo
[7:20:56] ricdesc26: you should always try to craft the better versions of the circuits cause they're cheaper ItIsWhatItIs
[7:21:05] n3wtpond: @flameofazure yeh be prepared to take low paying positions or internships for at least 2 years. but it pays off in the end
[7:21:07] Igneous3: it is
[7:21:08] DX_Plates: We used to call him Dr [Lastname] when we were in the office, he would cringe every time it was great.
[7:21:11] TelRehiad: poly!
[7:21:29] navalship55: It’s not what you think
[7:21:40] SebastiaanO: @Nexhunter yeah but i was still a student and i was earning more already at that time
[7:21:41] arkun_: @dx_plates LUL
[7:21:49] Nexhunter: @SebastiaanO danHuh
[7:22:13] Rampage_eM: @n3wtpond exactly beats going to school my second job after 1 year paid me $55,000
[7:22:17] Smileynator: 2
[7:22:23] DX_Plates: arkun_ But he is my lead now, so I guess that does mean something... LUL
[7:22:27] Smileynator: nah 2 bars
[7:22:42] Smileynator: just 2 bars of the 1 type :P
[7:22:50] Tamerlain: hello how today was on the factory ?
[7:23:07] n3wtpond: @Rampage_eMfor sure.  i dont know of another career path that escalates in pay that quickly, other than doctors or some shit
[7:23:17] DX_Plates: @Rampage_eM I made better than that at my internship... Ouch.
[7:23:36] Morlega: ItIsWhatItIs
[7:23:50] mechoriet: ItIsWhatItIs
[7:23:51] Smileynator: into the thing

[7:23:54] Snah__: ItIsWhatItIs
[7:23:59] DigitalVortex92: its using wetware instead of anothrer LUV circuit i think
[7:24:05] DigitalVortex92: another*
[7:24:06] n3wtpond: @DX_Plates first 6 months was unpaid lul
[7:24:14] broseph_larz: waffleWave  ItIsWhatItIs
[7:24:17] tomey36: Probably the mk3 controller
[7:24:29] arkun_: ItIsWhatItIs
[7:24:34] Igneous3: wetware going into the nuero?
[7:24:35] Rampage_eM: @n3wtpond yea I was just great at my job honestly making over $100k in my 20s is great for me especially when my wife makes about the same as me
[7:24:42] ricdesc26: if you have everything well automated, it should be fine pepeLaugh
[7:24:48] Smileynator: unless you tell it "no ore dict replacement" or something, right?
[7:24:57] Jimanjim: so stop it maybe? KEKW
[7:24:58] DX_Plates: @n3wtpond I would never work unpaid... Anyone asking you to work unpaid is going to treat you like shit even if you earn a paid position.
[7:25:00] Morlega: It should use the pattern ones, unless maybe ore dictionary is set

[7:25:13] grid_space: ore what?
[7:25:23] Rampage_eM: @dx_plates that’s great for you!
[7:25:24] Morlega: It's probably a deeper subingredient you don't know about
[7:25:26] TelRehiad: maybe one of the other dependancies has the wetware
[7:25:32] GuardMoony: maybe some other recipe is set to use it
[7:25:41] Jimanjim: so stop it KEKW
[7:26:03] DarkvirusNZ: you can turn off wildcard items in the pattern craft
[7:26:04] Alamose: does it not have the resources to make a different circuit?
[7:26:06] mechoriet: check the pattern
[7:26:09] spiwn: you can search the interface terminal for ingrediants
[7:26:13] IamtheJK: Check pattern for oredic?
[7:26:15] Smileynator: try and find what is "using it" and then look up what it is using as it's recipe thing
[7:26:21] kypudo: remove the ore dic from me, then click to processing unit
[7:26:26] mysts_07: maybe u already had a pattern for it with that recipe?
[7:26:26] Moobot: Come join the Waffle House Discord! <# https://discord.gg/fhGFtMuzdS

[7:33:26] Morlega: If only the terminal had an auto-build mode you could unlock YEP
[7:33:27] TelRehiad: you can use the multiblock building tool in your pad device thingy
[7:33:27] mastertrain: what did you think of the menu?
[7:33:27] matori666: why not use the multiblock app?
[7:34:08] Purple_haze12: it wasnt working for pati last night also

[7:40:57] Dioxinn: recipe needs full stack to start?
[7:41:56] gikei: Can you patterns for different stack sizes or does that confuse the machine
[7:42:17] DecoyOcelot: if the machine has a multi processor then 64x at once is kinda meh. might as well be 4x or 8x. just as fast
[7:42:35] DecoyOcelot: splitting it would be faster
[7:42:38] Morlega: You probably could but AE2 might just pick the big one anyway
[7:42:49] Apparentthreat: so it's not really any faster... it's just parallelized
