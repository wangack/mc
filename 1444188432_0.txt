[2:09:13] TheHeroOfNoOne: @Mixican You need to take the mouse apart, reach the scroll wheel mounting component and clean it up. Carefully rotate it a few times and put it back. I need to do this every 2 months. Razer isn't that quality product D:

[3:22:04] Balafore: Quebec and Ontario
[3:22:04] pt0ughneigh: each tree is good for 2ish gallons i think
[3:22:06] Brianmose12: you can do it with other kinds of trees as well, maple is used because of the good taste and high sugar content
[3:22:11] Aoewin: yea the sap
[3:22:11] tripwires: wasn't their a big heist of maple syrup?

[3:30:12] CommanderRudolph: If you've never used mods, curseforge is a fine alternative.
[3:30:19] Egrassa22: why no curseforge launcher?
[3:30:29] Tabakhase: what launcher is a taste thing, but you certainly want one - the manual way with java is quite the madman thing LUL
[3:30:44] Draiv_: @DX_Plates Sure yeah but if they bypassed the timer they could paint the whole map black in 10 seconds with bots
[3:30:50] TheMeowstardCat: Overwolf sucks ass

[3:31:42] DX_Plates: @Draiv_ Most of r/place is bots fighting bots now already, with small bursts of streamer activity.
[3:32:00] daemonaedryn: you know, your not too far away from getting a drawer controller, some of the things needed for it are needed for rf
[3:32:31] Draiv_: @DX_Plates I understand what your saying I'm just saying I'm suprised no one hacked to bypass the timer

[3:33:08] Larklen: @Draiv_ cause thats all handed server-side - never trust client data :)
[3:33:12] daemonaedryn: Because fuck making a machine frame holy fuck is it annoying
[3:33:27] SimonSez: @Draiv_, The timer is server side. You would have to hack the server
[3:33:29] DX_Plates: @Draiv_ Not worth the effort, it is most likely server side.
[3:33:32] DimensionalShadow: Yeah now the fun part of making the piping system lol

[4:07:46] coolcake2: @Giantwaffle then you log in to server and just see giant 100x100 holes everywhere LUL
[4:07:50] pt0ughneigh: those quarries with logistics pipes was so satisfying to watch
[4:07:54] Smaps54: Hey waffle what key switches do you use
[4:07:57] Lapideous: didn't enderio have a quarry?
[4:07:59] Obliviron: Is there any great buildcraft-like modpacks for newer MC versions?
[4:08:13] Warkless: I liked it, the only negative thing were some performance issues
[4:08:14] virtualstorm24: FTB Unleashed
[4:08:16] pt0ughneigh: lol yeah and lava
[4:08:23] Morlega: I remember creating a factory with BC quarry, (logistics) pipes, the automatic crafting tables... I had a bottleneck and the pipes would spill their items into the world, leading to a massive laggy chunk KEKW
[4:08:24] Obliviron: lol
[4:08:44] Obliviron: @virtualstorm24 that's on the new versions?
[4:08:47] AzireVG: i wished they ported the old IC2 to new MC
[4:08:55] PigIron: I remember having my factories blow up all the time
[4:09:07] Morlega: "why is the server lagging?" while my factory had thousands of items on the ground LUL
[4:09:10] DimensionalShadow: Sulfer to make the rubber and then sulfer again to cure it lol
[4:09:22] Morlega: Wasn't GregTech an addon for IC2?

[4:09:45] Artifact_D: @Giantwaffle Blue Corner is coming in very well!
[4:09:49] Kaomie: GregTech was originally a joke about how complicated mods like IC and BC were getting
[4:09:52] Artifact_D: FeelsGoodMan
[4:09:57] Andersxa: when quarries dropped items on the ground
[4:09:58] Inzeption: uu matter ;)
[4:10:00] Kaomie: But it backfired and got popular on its own
[4:10:03] daemonaedryn: PogChamp
[4:10:04] NurseTrevor: You would literally have 40,000 entities on the ground LUL
[4:10:05] Brianmose12: buildcraft pipes were terrible but damn it felt good to build automation with them
[4:10:07] Obliviron: nice!
[4:10:08] ChillyFierce: thats why wou make overflow pipes
[4:10:13] Obliviron: chat Is there any great buildcraft-like modpacks for newer MC versions?

[4:10:41] daemonaedryn: Time in a bottle also useful for pneumaticcraft
[4:10:46] Kaylome97: is the watering can not in this
[4:10:52] Arimil: I want if /r/place is just a bot fest darkoThonk
[4:10:52] 125Moose: I watched a video about gregtech for 10 minutes and heard more scientific names for things than I heard in all my years of school
[4:10:55] SkitsofRandom: @brianmose12 they were so fun to watch working!
[4:11:01] bEC69_: I went afk with auto sieves on for like an hour, chests got full and uuuhhh..... dont do that
[4:11:04] TelRehiad: you made the clock already
[4:11:20] daemonaedryn: Crush the tree
[4:11:31] ChillyFierce: do you have big crusher?
[4:11:36] daemonaedryn: The tree leaf in nether are nether wart blocks i think
[4:11:36] ChillyFierce: 2 wheels
[4:12:16] Morlega: "I'm just gonna use one" 3 times until we're left with none
[4:12:23] ChillyFierce: also create crusher is best for processing ancient debri

[4:12:48] daemonaedryn: Yes
[4:12:52] xClod: yrah
[4:12:52] SkitsofRandom: are the automation aspects of create good/fun? I like mods where I can watch the factory work
[4:13:01] McSauce: Blazs powder lasts quite a while.
[4:13:05] McSauce: *Blaze
[4:13:07] Kaylome97: @Giantwaffle Is the watering can in this modpack?
[4:13:09] 125Moose: Create is super interesting to do anything with
[4:13:12] 125Moose: The modularity is crazy
[4:13:14] ilpra: turkey going crazy
[4:13:16] daemonaedryn: Create has like 0 invisible components
[4:13:21] Jibbur: No magic blocks in create
[4:13:30] Morlega: Create is one of the most visual/"feedback" mod
[4:13:33] d43Shakesbeer: looks like asmon and soda are at it with their chats lul
[4:13:46] Obliviron: Is Create found in the E6E modpack? @Giantwaffle
[4:13:49] CommanderUrsus: and then throw it all inside a compact machine and never see it again
[4:14:00] Apan222: YEP Cogs
[4:14:05] TelRehiad: @Obliviron yes
[4:14:10] ChillyFierce: new vanilla stuff starting to get more automation stuff
[4:14:11] Obliviron: thx
[4:14:15] Squibblezx: All the pixel art going on and no tribute to Minecraft
[4:14:16] AzireVG: They could make in NG+
[4:14:24] daemonaedryn: You have to keep it in your inventory
[4:14:27] Morlega: It's automatic
[4:14:27] AzireVG: Gate the tech behind the End
[4:14:29] TelRehiad: you hold it and that stores time
[4:14:31] daemonaedryn: Which is why its a great early game item
[4:14:32] Ras2709: you store time by haveing it in the inventory
[4:14:34] Morlega: If you hold it 5m in your inventory you store 5m
[4:14:35] McSauce: Keep it in your inventory and it collects time.
[4:14:44] inorganic: big pog
[4:14:46] Tabakhase: if its the old bottle of time, it just collects while you run arround and then you can "use it on a block"
[4:14:47] Sam_1443: you have to build up time to spend at later points
[4:14:49] daemonaedryn: Shift click blocks
[4:14:52] Ras2709: shift right click i belive
[4:14:52] daemonaedryn: To use time
[4:14:53] Speecker: rightclick on blocks
[4:14:54] VaguelyPro: you right click on the blocks
[4:14:54] PigIron: you right click with it
[4:14:54] McSauce: Right click the block to speed it
[4:14:55] rickster845: right click
[4:14:55] NikFliks: shift right click
[4:14:58] madseed15: right click on blocks
[4:15:00] Morlega: Right-click a machine and it'll use like 30s to double the speed for 30s or so
[4:15:02] madseed15: consume time
[4:15:03] VaguelyPro: It uses the time
[4:15:03] kkotoro: consumes time
[4:15:03] 125Moose: It consumes time
[4:15:04] McSauce: No just the time
[4:15:04] Ras2709: no just the time
[4:15:06] TelRehiad: no.
[4:15:06] RafaLorenzo: among us is taking Starwars :(
[4:15:14] daemonaedryn: YEP
[4:15:14] Jibbur: anywhere
[4:15:15] Ras2709: anywhere
[4:15:15] daemonaedryn: Anywhere
[4:15:16] NikFliks: anywhere
[4:15:19] McSauce: Anywhere
[4:15:19] Speecker: the more often you click the more you speed up but also use more time
[4:15:23] daemonaedryn: You can click more than once
[4:15:24] madseed15: do it again
[4:15:28] Jibbur: you can click many many times too if you save it up
[4:15:29] Ras2709: and you can use it more than 1 time
[4:15:29] Morlega: Not sure it works for random ticks
[4:15:29] CommanderUrsus: again
[4:15:32] rickster845: doesnt work on hemp
[4:15:33] dobie: you can go up x256 speed if you have enough stored
[4:15:33] Jibbur: up to I think 256x
[4:15:40] SirNickGaming: Are those hydrated?
[4:15:44] Addar81: need to let it build up time
[4:15:46] rickster845: because it grows to the block above
[4:15:47] Tabakhase: the old-old version of it did this instantly even i think...
[4:15:50] Tabakhase: not 100% tho
[4:15:51] Jibbur: not sure it works on plants?
[4:15:52] Ras2709: i dont think it works on hemp since hemp is 2 blocks high...
[4:15:56] Addar81: just hang onto it and try later when it has more time
[4:15:58] Morlega: If you right-click twice, you'll use like 90s for 4x, right-click thrice is like 150s for 8x, etc
[4:16:02] Tabakhase: its rly for machines and such
[4:16:06] razborsek: Maybe someone link the wiki theres a good explanation there
[4:16:14] Inzeption: watercan in the mod ?
[4:16:18] DopewasHere: Watering can?
[4:16:19] Kaomie: Oh No
[4:16:21] jmm548: bless u
[4:16:23] madseed15: covid monkaS
[4:16:23] daemonaedryn: Plants arent the best test item since theyre a random growth chance
[4:16:24] Morlega: It's difficult to notice on things like plants with random ticks
[4:16:24] TheWonderLlama: anneDab Bless you
[4:16:26] Valorz_san: a water block in a 9x9 area
[4:16:27] Obliviron: monkaS
[4:16:27] Warkless: PauseChamp
[4:16:28] Zonear: rooBless
[4:16:30] McSauce: Gesundheit
[4:16:32] maccabeus: it's so much more obvious if you use it on a furnace
[4:16:33] daemonaedryn: Do it with a furnace
[4:16:37] dadish: night
[4:16:37] 125Moose: You're only doing 2x, it wouldn't be easy to notice on a plant like this
[4:16:38] Tabakhase: it works, but it aint no bonemeal ;-)
[4:16:42] PigIron: water can or growth accelerators ?
[4:16:42] theknightpaco: bonemeal?
[4:16:43] dobie: i think crop growth is done a weird way isnt it? its like random tile picking rather than tick rate of that "block"
[4:16:44] Sam_1443: use a furnace or machine
[4:17:11] 125Moose: Uses twice as much power too if that wasn't obvious
[4:17:13] daemonaedryn: Imagine when you have like 40 hours in it
[4:17:17] Drudo: look up organic compost
[4:17:19] Morlega: You don't have stored enough time to go to 4x or 8x, it costs exponentially more time
[4:17:19] Jibbur: just has to be in your inventory
[4:17:20] Addar81: yup
[4:17:23] Jibbur: can't be in chest or backpack
[4:17:24] CommanderUrsus: power usage does up too though
[4:17:26] TelRehiad: remember that it eats 2x the power as well
[4:17:27] Addar81: just keep it in your inventory
[4:17:27] CommanderUrsus: goes
[4:17:28] Lapideous: isn't upgrading the thermal machines relatively cheap?
[4:17:30] redwall467: i've got 26 hours on mine LUL
[4:17:31] dennis3833: can you craft multiple?
[4:17:38] Morlega: If you go up to x256 you use up your stored time very fast LUL
[4:17:39] dobie: is no nice to jus x256 anything that u need to wait for
[4:17:40] Tabakhase: now we can never pause again YEP
[4:17:42] Ras2709: no
[4:17:42] TelRehiad: @dennis3833 no. 1 per person
[4:17:42] orangecreamsicle3: @dennis3833 but why?
[4:17:47] Sam_1443: plants have a random tick grow pattern, its helping but because its random you don't see any results when you don't get the random proc
[4:17:48] coolcake2: you can but only 1 will accumulate time
[4:17:50] Ferrariblue247: is there a lit of time per bottle?
[4:17:52] PenguinHero247: it only charges one if you have multiple
[4:17:53] DopewasHere: No you cant
[4:17:53] The_Holas: does it work in chest or loaded inventories zou can make multiple and make like time storage Kappa
[4:17:54] Ferrariblue247: limit*
[4:17:55] Enryu14: it multiples power consumption too
[4:17:57] QuesoBad0nga: cann you use it on the dirt block?
[4:18:00] 125Moose: @Lapideous Not in this pack, he keeps crafting integral components because they're part of other recipes here and it's a pain
[4:18:07] DopewasHere: The time isnt bottle specific
[4:18:15] MrAppl3: popCat
[4:18:16] Unkn0wn_Nam3: can you speed up spawners?

[4:18:44] Jamswhat2: YEP + efficiency
[4:18:53] Morlega: But mind that some spawners have a mob cap, so might not be that useful
[4:18:58] coolcake2: you can accelerate a solar panel )
[4:19:09] Sam_1443: plants have a random tick grow pattern, its helping but because its random you don't see any results when you don't get the random proc
[4:19:11] pt0ughneigh: a good salad just his different cobb salads are pog
[4:19:15] The_Holas: can you speed up  chest with bottle in it?
[4:19:19] orangecreamsicle3: you can make a bonsai to grow trees or plants and use time in the bottle to accelerate it
[4:19:21] Morlega: Oh right, if you're out of power, x32 or so a solar panel for a quick boost LUL
[4:19:39] redwall467: I remember telling you about the pipe pressurizer and you were like "I think were going to get into RS today so im not going to worry about it" COPIUM
[4:19:45] sankhazo: Is there any tradeoff from accelerating time?
[4:19:51] Snah__: making back the time it took to make the pressurizer/solar panels easily
[4:20:00] cpt_gagarin: Canada is still struggling with the leaf ...

[5:36:26] WarpOs: @giantwaffle Balance dude!
[5:36:28] captainoppi0: too much water can destroy your kidneys, if the pee is yellow it's not the sugar, but all the surplus salts you have in your body, if you have sugar in your pee you better check your sugar levels, cause our body is very efficient in reabsorbing sugars @Giantwaffle

[6:18:02] Speedglass: you dont 'add' optifine you install it
[6:18:06] itsjusttriz: Optifine isnt really built with modded in mind LUL It can be the cause of many crashes.
[6:18:14] Face_32: @Face_32 orly? would it need to be hooked up to the create chests or something?
[6:18:28] DewDragon: uh oh there are 4 of those reactor idle games. idk which one xD
[6:18:32] GFQPR1882: EZ :)
[6:18:34] orangecreamsicle3: @Speedglass optifine is not great for these modpacks
[6:18:36] Speedglass: drop the entire .zip file in the mods folder
[6:18:41] Face_32: @LiveType ahh i will have to look into this mod more
[6:18:47] redwall467: the controller is probably the easiest part KEKW

[6:19:53] Moobot: Come join the Waffle House Discord! <# https://discord.gg/fhGFtMuzdS
[6:19:56] dobie: @Face_32 it works similarly in all of the options, where you add some kind of crafting interface or something which essentially just says if you send these ingredients here, these results will be returned
[6:19:56] Face_32: is it RS or AE2 that uses the micro chips and stuff
[6:20:04] agent_e: grid the blaze rod
[6:20:08] LiveType: 500rf/t is nothing.
[6:20:16] dobie: @Face_32 i think in prettypipes it is just called "crafting module"
[6:20:21] redwall467: @Giantwaffle per drive i meant
[6:20:24] kkotoro: lava gen?
[6:20:30] Borlaq: Blaze powder
[6:20:33] SaturdayHS: the discs themselves adds more power requirement
[6:20:45] ThatExcitedViewer: solar panels creat a flat amount right? like, regardless of where they are placed
[6:20:49] daemonaedryn: 500 rf/t is a lot with only 1m rf storage, that wont last the night

[6:22:38] Kipe33: I made coke oven and blast furnace with one deployer, alloy kiln was nothing
[6:22:45] LordDusk: You have the electron tube in the chests...
[6:22:54] Face_32: @Speedglass or use create to make a tree farm, or just get spruce sapplings and manual farm the big ones
[6:22:56] stanls: I bought Minecraft Java edition on Mojang site. When trying to install it, windows store says I have not bought it. What do I do
[6:23:00] SaturdayHS: mek might be a good option for power but powah got buffed a bit, the solar from powah is buffed a good bit
[6:23:03] redwall467: @Giantwaffle instead of using a bunch of belts look at a weighted ejector
[6:23:03] dobie: @DaemonSzyman ill look into that thanks.. atm iv jus got 5 of the powah thermogenerators, 600rf/t each but rs jus uses so much
