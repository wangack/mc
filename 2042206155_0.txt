[1:53:14] eLguL: swapping your liquid intake to 0 calories stuff already helps alot
[1:53:20] evanontwitch01: what helped you push through the hunger? been struggling with weight loss....
[1:53:26] 4tw0ne: its probably somewhere between eating better, and having kids.

[1:54:10] Rodimus_Supreme: I think m family has genetics that contribute to being fat, but I also don't do anything about it.
[1:54:30] ItsLordHuncho: yes
[1:54:31] flyingQtip: Nascar drive the Warden, fatty
[1:54:36] Lim3rr: genetics is a small part of it
[1:54:37] PrimeBlackDodo: I was fat because I was shoveling food in my mouth at the speed of light and just sitting on my ass
[1:54:39] earth295: genetics do contribute
[1:54:42] Rodimus_Supreme: Low metabolism can contribute.
[1:54:43] RollyPinder: my neighbor was fat growing up and I caught it from her
[1:54:43] FrankFromDisney: i went to high school with someone named Special Edwards. i hope she got married fast.
[1:54:44] pinhad: slow metabolism -> harder to lose weight
[1:54:45] cmndrzander: agree, alcoholism also not a disease, self control
[1:54:48] yakefromstatefarm: some people have naturally fast metabolisms
[1:54:48] goudacheeseburgers: @flyingQtip holeeeeee! Hopefully UK will legalize soon. Had the same bud for months now. Its nice, just could do with a change

[1:55:36] netherite_bong: sounds like excuses
[1:55:44] pinhad: nah
[1:55:48] JaySkinny: There are different metabolisms, but you choosing not to adjust calorie intake/outtake to your metbaolism is in your hands.
[1:55:49] SqueezeME666: thats very true too jon
[1:55:50] yakefromstatefarm: yeah, thermodynamically some people require more calories to maintain bodily function
[1:55:56] PrimeBlackDodo: yeah somehow governments want to stay blind on that topic
[1:56:02] pinhad: its cheaper to but whole foods than go to a fast food joint with inflation
[1:56:04] CSideTurner: YES, healthy food in stores are more expensive
[1:56:08] Rodimus_Supreme: Jus eat the box. You'll lose weight. Kappa

[3:21:29] Rodimus_Supreme: @CBRRider1 PLEASE put your mouth on the tip. cedGasm
[3:21:30] 4tw0ne: Flowing water and lava will not cause the stalactite to fill the cauldron. The liquid must be a source

[3:22:45] Nightbot: Lets catch everyone up. John decides to build epic wool farm from bedrock to sky limit. He's fat so he doesn't want to dig it out and decides he needs TNT. But then realizes he needs to fix the creeper farm by lowering it 64 blocks to bedrock. But again he's fat and needs gunpowder for TNT. so to make farm more efficient he wants tinted glass and finds 4 geodes close to each other but needs to connect it to the nether highway.
[3:22:46] b_r_a_y: LuL hmmmm

[3:24:39] MrSelenix: its either anything, or otherwise just dripstone block
[3:24:41] slackertron: only works with netherite
[3:24:45] Saulted: for lava it can be any block, for growing the dripstone it has to be dripstone block
[3:24:45] flyingQtip: Biology
[3:24:48] CBRRider1: Netherite blocks for faster dripping
[3:24:51] Chonfelito: any non transparent block is what the wiki says
[3:24:59] somelucky_: anything that doesn't burn
[3:25:02] 4tw0ne: Wiki just says " checks for a water source or waterlogged block two blocks above it " so it does not check for what block type it is

[3:26:07] Tyvern: @hardlined LUL
[3:26:09] MGWilsonz: other farms ive seen use glass or dripstone blocks or stone bricks
[3:26:14] Underpaid_Spoon: If lava is above a non-transparent block supporting pointed dripstone, dripping particles are created on the end. These can fill cauldrons with lava.

[3:26:48] goudacheeseburgers: science it breh
[3:26:49] 4tw0ne: Test one before doing the rest :)
[3:26:49] MrSelenix: anything solid works, transparent or not. so even glass would work
[3:26:52] skeptium: just test on one first
[3:26:56] slackertron: start with one for science
[3:27:01] toxic_gas0_1: pach test

[3:27:08] 4tw0ne: as long as you see the drips, its working
[3:27:11] 4tw0ne: NODDERS
[3:27:13] CBRRider1: @jonbams netherite blocks make it drip faster
[3:27:17] yakefromstatefarm: slackertron: start with one for science
[3:27:21] ordinarytwitchname: this build looks really nice great job
[3:27:28] goudacheeseburgers: @CBRRider1 KEKW
[3:27:49] imsilentdreamer: and it also doesn't take as long as you might think
[3:27:54] cmndrzander: you need the specific block to hang from
[3:27:56] Rodimus_Supreme: No?
[3:27:57] latishPlahish: snow you see incrementally too
[3:28:02] kayccs: is it?
[3:28:03] Underpaid_Spoon: any non-transparent blocks (does not include stairs, fences, and slabs)
[3:28:05] 1pric: wool would burn no?
[3:28:07] fakeyfail: idk why not get a handful and find out lul
[3:28:07] 4tw0ne: it cant be since its hotter than boiling water, right?
[3:28:10] BornNaked2: Would you be able to see the progress in F3?
[3:28:13] executer48: Lava contains no water

[3:28:43] Bigguy692009: man this stream is getting moist
[3:28:48] CaptainOkay: oil is wet I’d say
[3:28:50] executer48: No the other things contains water
[3:28:55] b_r_a_y: lava is liquid stone. so yes it's wet
[3:29:00] goudacheeseburgers: its all about viscosity?
[3:29:01] MGWilsonz: "wet: covered or saturated with water or another liquid."
[3:29:04] luman_og: but lava wouldn't "wet" a shirt, it'd burn instantly
[3:29:11] 4tw0ne: No you would probably say, "why is my shirt all gooey"
[3:29:12] luman_og: so to apply lava is basically to apply fire
[3:29:13] BornNaked2: PepoG
[3:29:13] slackertron: hot wet, sounds hot
[3:29:14] JuliusKobe: It would be dirty
[3:29:16] flyingQtip: moist
[3:29:19] TeeeGreen: mud is dirty wet
[3:29:21] executer48: Glycerin tinctures must consist of more than 55% pure glycerin if they are to have preservative capacity (vegetable glycerin contains 5% water, which must be factored into the calculation).
[3:29:22] skeptium: nope
[3:29:23] 4tw0ne: "cold" is relative

[3:29:48] 0lincoln0: heat and cold are just the motion of atoms
[3:29:49] 4tw0ne: cold is the action of heat being sucked away
[3:29:53] executer48: Vegetable glycerin contains 5% water
[3:29:53] ivyiss: If cold doesn't exist why am i coughing?
[3:29:55] MGWilsonz: and heat is just energy
[3:29:56] goudacheeseburgers: whats is the absence of intelligence?

[3:57:53] Qelnan: Cheer100 Cheer100  From the wiki - source block confirmed - Lava can be collected by using a bucket on a lava source block or a full lava cauldron, creating a lava bucket. Lava may be obtained renewably from cauldrons, as pointed dripstone with a lava source above it can slowly fill a cauldron with lava.
