[0:21:43] memothegreat: you won't be able to use US credit card on Turkish site tho
[0:21:48] DarkSpooon: "How much can a loaf of bread cost? $20?" - @Giantwaffle
[0:22:01] Redlessx: when is those sub changes gonna go live? cuz it will be cheap for me
[0:22:02] DoctorScorch: I think it would be better if it was based on the minimum wage of the country
[0:22:05] Mapleton: I find it crazy that Eggs cost less than bread peepoHmm

[0:31:47] 0x000000: that looks overcomplicated monkaHmm
[0:31:47] CocoScruff: ez
[0:31:49] ninopanda: well sort faster Kappa
[0:31:52] Mka696: oh god sorting the list each iteration of the loop lol
[0:31:52] DarkSpooon: I remember in Algorithms in college we had to create an encryption program. My first working program took 45 minutes to encrypt and compress a file. KEKW It was the most satisfying cleanup when that got down to a few seconds.
[0:31:53] Ebonmourn: you'd have to use from collections import OrderedDict or something like that
[0:32:01] Linkmasteh: Eyyy, Python?
[0:32:03] Joshuapetch: @ninopanda hospitals are slow Sadge
[0:32:04] DaGMC: now its time to rewrite from scratch
[0:32:05] srgp2015: monkaHmm
[0:32:10] Rodik: hey waffle are you mining your own crypto?
[0:32:14] DaGMC: you can use sorted
[0:32:25] mobfarmer: isn't it module that tests for prime etc
[0:32:30] thomasausen: have you seen the fp1 highlights ?
[0:32:34] mattertater: why sort keylist every time you append? why not just once at the end of that loop
[0:32:51] cheppard: cant you just divide by 2 untill its Not an even number gehen divide by 3 and so in?
[0:32:53] rickitikki: once I had to do a list of list of tuples of dictionary keys
[0:32:59] ninopanda: @Joshuapetch oh shit!!! i hope everything is ok! you are no longer in trouble!!
[0:33:03] gutter54: we had to do that with linked lists, etc. learning the basics is good..
[0:33:06] DaGMC: now you need to loop
[0:33:33] Chronoes: You could've gotten a sorted list of keys by using "sorted(primeDict)" though, that's the point
[0:33:57] DarkSpooon: He cheesed the answer KEKW
[0:33:57] arcticae: you should implement everything in collections, probably a better learning experience than programming puzzles
[0:33:58] TimmPure: NotLikeThis I couldn't imagine this was possible but that is even more hacky than my programming stuff
[0:34:05] mobfarmer: SymPy is a python module which contains some really cool prime number related library functions. Given below is the list of these functions : isprime(n): It tests if n is a prime number (True) or not (False). ... nextprime(n): It returns the next greater prime than n.
[0:34:21] qiakgue: go to sqrt to find the first factor, then test num/factor as the second?
[0:34:29] CocoScruff: as long as it works haha
[0:34:44] Larklen: now what does the elegant solution look like? KEKW

[0:35:23] Mka696: @Giantwaffle btw, to get a sorted list of a dicts keys, you can just do "sorted(dict.keys())"

[0:36:20] gutter54: it's "pythonic"
[0:36:21] NemesisXKL: but its working
[0:36:32] itsIffy: readable code is better
[0:36:34] ninopanda: is there an amusement park within 2 hours of london? @Joshuapetch
[0:36:39] dasmako: yea maintainable code is better imo
[0:36:40] TheGreatLemon: @Giantwaffle say it louder for the people in the back!
[0:36:40] mattertater: list comprehension not being very comprehensible there
[0:36:42] MrMoneybagMan: NOP
[0:36:44] gutter54: total code golf haha
[0:36:47] Appz: lol people flexing with one liners
[0:36:48] DecoyOcelot: stuff like that is only good if the compiler acctually treats it differently
[0:36:53] Rawb_: code golf is cool
[0:36:54] Kevincav: They’re different things for sure
[0:36:55] 0x000000: what about c# solutions ?
[0:37:03] tygez: code obfuscation ?
[0:37:13] gutter54: it's cool to a point - then it's an unreadable mess and more importantly - less maintainable
[0:37:20] Joshuapetch: @ninopanda actually quite a few
[0:37:32] CocoScruff: @Giantwaffle you have to check out the youtube video "if programming was an anime" it's so funny
[0:37:38] D3athKai: i wish i can code like you
[0:37:42] DarkSpooon: lol Kind of
[0:37:51] Chronoes: Good luck, there're plenty of challenges with prime numbers KEKW
[0:37:51] mobfarmer: SymPy is a python module which contains some really cool prime number related library functions. Given below is the list of these functions : isprime(n): It tests if n is a prime number (True) or not (False). ... nextprime(n): It returns the next greater prime than n.
[0:37:57] Sakutera: crypto = primes
[0:37:57] gutter54: @D3athKai you can - python is free :)
[0:37:59] gartoks: @D3athKai Waffle started learning end of last year.
[0:38:00] 4729_zex: did you know 4729 is a prime number?
[0:38:04] Pine_Noir: @D3athKai don't let your dreams be dreams. always time to learn!
[0:38:08] Joshuapetch: The best i've been to is the Hyde Park Winter Wonderland but thats only winter obviously @ninopanda
[0:38:08] tygez: thats numberwang
[0:38:11] Chronoes: sympy is not stdlib
[0:38:12] D3athKai: senpai?
[0:38:35] gutter54: Programming/Coding is one of the best fields to learn at home.. most resources are free
[0:38:55] ninopanda: oh, my sister cant remember the name of the park they are going to in a couple of weeks and just told me its 2 hours out of london. @Joshuapetch
[0:38:57] Joshuapetch: He said he hates primes, everyone stop subbing with prime Kappa
[0:39:14] Bleu_Forge: Kappa
[0:39:32] Mka696: @Giantwaffle for future ref, "sorted(dict.keys())" will get ya a sorted list of a dict's keys
[0:39:32] Moobot: Support Waffle by using his Epic creator code: Giantwaffle
[0:39:32] Chronoes: 1 million is easy, it's like 2 and 5 KEKW
[0:39:48] Mka696: nope
[0:39:54] Mka696: sorted is a standard func
[0:39:55] Chronoes: sorted is a standard function
[0:40:09] Mka696: yeah sorted just returns a list yeah
[0:40:09] Chronoes: a sorted list
[0:40:10] TheOfficialHector: @Giantwaffle How did you learn this/ what you know can you give me resources
[0:40:11] gutter54: iterable object
[0:40:19] DaGMC: a list
[0:40:19] TimmPure: I can easily read off all even-numbered primes from 0 to a million by heart Kappa
[0:40:24] Mka696: sorted is like sort, but returns a new list rather than change the list you pass in
[0:40:29] TimmPure: it's a great party trick
[0:40:34] Chronoes: you can iterate them, you can't index them
[0:40:37] Joshuapetch: @ninopanda could be Alton towers, think that's just a little over 2 hours away
[0:40:42] sky_moo: Heyis it a bad idea to buy bitcoin now?
[0:40:49] Sundrata: NO
[0:40:55] Sundrata: Buy now
[0:41:02] DaGMC: you could do list(set(x))
[0:41:04] Bleu_Forge: asking twitch chat for money advice KEKW
[0:41:12] gutter54: list(your_set)
[0:41:13] alurosu: @sky_moo risk is different for everyone, I can't say if it's good for you
[0:41:13] ninopanda: let me ask her @Joshuapetch
[0:41:14] HamburguerGG: minecraft sure looks different today Kappa
[0:41:17] Chronoes: you can but why
[0:41:20] gutter54: yup
[0:41:22] mobfarmer: sky_moo yesterday was better to buy,   doge up 26% in a day...
[0:41:31] DaGMC: you get a unique list
[0:41:39] gutter54: we use sets all the time - faster for getting diffs
[0:42:12] DaGMC: just try to kiss
[0:42:12] Mka696: yeah its a super common pattern to get rid of dupes is just do list(set(listYouWantUnique))
[0:42:18] Appz: sets are pog
[0:42:51] DaGMC: just write a pep
[0:43:00] Nivelhein: just write it yourself 4HEad
[0:43:01] Schnorzel: It is iterable. Stop saying iterable you cant access by index. :D
[0:43:05] 4729_zex: they are meant to be that way
[0:43:05] Chronoes: they are iterable, not indexable..
[0:43:14] FrostedSentry: Yep yep. Sets are an unordered collection. Can show up in any order. They're super fast. Use a dif data type when you need that.
[0:43:14] ninopanda: @Joshuapetch that was the one. have you been there?
[0:43:21] MrArrig: Why is that important?
[0:43:28] Shotch: No it's not, if it was you'd make it a list or enumerate it
[0:43:37] Nivelhein: but why is it important? You could work around it pretty easily
[0:43:41] Mka696: it's not a list internally, but not a linked list either
[0:43:44] Appz: indexing >(
[0:43:48] Mka696: it's prob some type of hash table internally
[0:43:53] FrostedSentry: Because there are other data types when you need that behavior
[0:43:54] Joshuapetch: @ninopanda I think everyone in the uk has been to Alton Towers at least once in life, it's great!
[0:44:01] DaGMC: or a dict
[0:44:04] PossibleScam: You always don’t want to view your reference  output. Sometimes it just used for storage with know values. So there is no need to iterate through it.
[0:44:06] Schnorzel: What language are we talking about?
[0:44:08] FrostedSentry: Who gave me a waffle? Neat
[0:44:11] Mka696: basically
[0:44:15] mahoraz: linked list would assume every element has a pointer value to the next object
[0:44:16] Chronoes: you can consider it a dictionary but with only unique keys, values are irrelevant
[0:44:22] FrostedSentry: Thanks @Bulva!!
[0:44:38] mahoraz: yup
[0:44:42] ShellingFord55: in best case scenario it has unique position in it, does not need to be always
[0:44:51] PossibleScam: Not for know values.
[0:45:00] CoolReal: Queue Dequeue
[0:45:06] DaGMC: vector
[0:45:07] Ezrion1: trees
[0:45:07] gutter54: sets don't record element position - so don't support index or slicing
[0:45:07] galaxy_berry: Thought about writing a neural network yet?
[0:45:11] Rangetuur: deque
[0:45:12] the0fficialse7h: the key is the pointer and each key is unique
[0:45:12] Mka696: linked list have very few good use cases. stacks and queues and arrays have way more uses
[0:45:14] mattertater: heaps
[0:45:16] ninopanda: @Joshuapetch she sent me their website. and it looks like fun. all they have been told is that the package is a weekend with everything included. but really no details
[0:45:18] Mka696: and dict*
[0:45:21] Shotch: I'm pretty sure you can just do an ordereddict if you want to keep order by drop values. Which should be indexible too
[0:45:21] mahoraz: linked list is easier to use if you need to delete stuff in the middle since all you need to do is reassign pointers
[0:45:25] DaGMC: vector is dynamic list/array
[0:45:26] LordDynom: Those are different types of vectors

[0:46:12] DaGMC: this could be the next crypto coin
[0:46:19] mahoraz: inserting and deleting in regular arrays is really costly, since ytou need to make another array (copy stuff over)
[0:46:21] Onailgam: waffle would you please share the link to the cryptowatch?

[2:21:09] Myekos: it's expensive because so many people haven't been working the last year
[2:21:11] Allmostdone: The new law in Texas is gonna make it even harder to get ammo

[2:21:55] Hunter1701: if they dont have armor
[2:21:55] Lagoholic: Glocks are great
[2:21:56] That0neGeye: In the future the gun control bill will make ammo impossible to get
[2:21:57] GamesWithJT: My every day carry is 9mm 124 JHP...PLENTY of stopping power and more easy to conceal
[2:21:59] GenerlKat: no f glock
[2:21:59] Piper_Primed: @natsu130 people normally buy in bulk

[2:22:20] Zippomaster93: its actually shot placement
[2:22:21] DecoyOcelot: "my M1911 won two World Wars!"
[2:22:21] TallBro97: @generlkat i love my legion
[2:22:25] randyf69: Hitting something at all is more important than stopping power
[2:22:27] moon_monk1: irl pvp monkaS
[2:22:30] DarkSpooon: 9mm and 45 "stopping power" is effectively the same
[2:22:32] Fooker: Just get some sweet collateral when the zombies invade

[2:22:45] MrMoneybagMan: there was a new glock released

[2:22:53] GenerlKat: glock cheap????
[2:22:54] Hunter1701: 1200
[2:22:57] Hunter1701: rpm
[2:22:57] RoninStorm: my manhood isnt attached to the size of round my gun shoots.  9mm has many benefits over a 45

[2:23:44] arcticae: g19 is a smol g17
[2:23:48] Myekos: @Giantwaffle only police need to shoot 30 rounds to stop an unarmed person, as a civilian you can't get away with that
[2:23:50] brsmith2358: The 18 is full auto lol
[2:23:52] skech3rs: get a lepua magnum
[2:23:59] skech3rs: for home invasion

[2:25:07] c0nan666: you fall asleep shooting a gun
[2:25:09] loganpod2000: @giantwaffle what type of gun do you have?
[2:25:10] BONBONNIE13: KKona Fuck yeah Brother, preach it.

[2:25:22] BADboiz_TV: Quantity of rounds matter
[2:25:26] Crack9860: i would love to have one tho
[2:25:27] gartoks: @Lagoholic I guess that's a difference in the US. I've never even been close to a situation where I considered needing a gun
[2:25:27] Beeerg94: Tried a bunch of guns in Prague two years ago. So much fun
[2:25:30] Allmostdone: @gartoks Hmm… it’s hard to say. In America we have lived with guns around all our lives. So it seems “normal” to us
[2:25:33] Troupster: Minecraft does the same thing with melatonin

[2:27:47] Apparentthreat: wtf
[2:27:48] Askjong: Is the meme-bot still working?
[2:27:52] DarkSpooon: @gartoks Our country was also founded with an armed revolt. It's in the DNA of the country. It's not that Americans need them but we specifically prevented our government from disarming the people incase another armed revolt is needed some day

[2:40:03] Mapleton: ill be lucky is i can buy a trailer home before im 30
[2:40:06] Larklen: @Piper_Primed did you buy it brand new?
[2:40:11] ruccoa: conflict of interest
[2:40:20] Piper_Primed: @larklen no
[2:40:43] Larklen: @Piper_Primed then there you go, home warranty is typically applicable to only new builds
[2:40:47] KekPek_: NOTED
[2:40:55] bedbuggies: NOTED
[2:40:56] Stompie: Bought a 10 year old home and it came with a home warranty included so it definitely isn't only on new homes
[2:41:17] Allmostdone: A good home inspector is worth gold
[2:41:18] Moobot: You can sub to Waffle by clicking this neat link -> twitch.tv/giantwaffle/subscribe
[2:41:23] Strayer_J: @Larklen its typical in any kind of home sale, 400 bucks for ease of mind on the buyer covered by seller
[2:41:32] aliceoface: it's not normal
[2:41:40] TheRedNomad: In my EU country it exists in exactly the same way, it's just called differently
[2:41:40] PureSpider: our house is from 1960, any insurance that was on it has long ran out when we bought it bamKEK
[2:41:51] Rinc_RH: in the uk, the government provides a 10 year garuntee on new builds
[2:41:52] Larklen: @Strayer_J this is not in regards to a typical home inspection you do in every home sale, this is in regards to the warranty on his new build
[2:41:52] usernameNull: I wish I had done it, a few hundred dollars to check on a multi hundred thousand dollar investment is totally worth it
[2:41:55] Exerion09: You're just mining stone at this point lol
[2:41:58] mahoraz: even apartment buildings usually have a structural insurance
[2:42:01] Tawmcruize1994: when i bought mine i had a offer in my folder for warrantys but seemed like a waste of money to get it at the time
[2:42:15] Frozen_Toilet: ahh you originally made it seem like you were just getting one to get one. if it's related to home warranty that makes total sense. home warranties are only common with new builds, which is why most of chat is probably like wtf
[2:42:16] BaTu016: thats a big vein
[2:42:21] colinbobolin: just got a fantastic new job offer! now I'm dreading the conversations about resigning D:
[2:42:28] Allmostdone: Yea I got it done years ago. Money worth it
[2:42:30] Strayer_J: @Larklen Ya i understand, inspection  and warranty are totally separate things..
[2:42:39] dcirusc30: veins is this pack are huge @BaTu016
[2:42:44] simble: re-zine-ing
[2:42:45] Strayer_J: you can get an HSA warranty on your house right now if you want
[2:42:46] BeardSyndicate: resign -> quitting
[2:42:50] BaTu016: @dcirusc30 tought so KEKW
[2:42:51] Strayer_J: its just insurance on appliances and hsit
[2:43:10] CantTouchDisNow: it depends
[2:43:11] Apparentthreat: only real minecraft players can spot the difference Kappa
[2:43:19] LordDynom: Not if you like the old place

[2:43:23] thebodge: put in your 2 weeeks notice
[2:43:23] colinbobolin: yeah but I like my coworkers and my job. this is just a much better offer
[2:43:25] McDreamyh: Snow runner today later?
[2:43:25] Hakzertt: ive heard people lose their new job and old job for trying to do that
[2:43:25] Surge43: I did it once. Got a 12k raise.
[2:43:26] Allmostdone: Nope
[2:43:27] CantTouchDisNow: if you like the stuff at the new company more you just say you leave
[2:43:34] Joshuapetch: I'm getting a pay rise next month peepoHappy
[2:43:34] Stormflare: never take the offer your current company gives you. they know you want to leave and will prob fire you in a year or less
[2:43:34] joseiico23: quita el fuego
[2:43:35] Hibame: If it comes to the point I got the job offer Im already leaving, not asking the existing place to match
[2:43:35] killerpaul: they can sometimes beat it to keep you, then look for replacement
[2:43:37] johnny_dan: i usually force a raise 3 months before I leave to a new job
[2:43:37] benjamin_berry: The US norm is 2 weeks notice. It’s normally a curtesy.
[2:43:40] CommanderUrsus: matching an offer, they tend to resent you
[2:43:46] bloodycliff: sometimes they match with a counter offer then start finding your replacement
[2:44:04] Chronoes: But work life is like 60% of your day
[2:44:05] zynithtv: depends on how much  you already make
[2:44:09] Napster9000: hahaha, I did that once, the old boss called my new boss to try to sabotage me @Giantwaffle
[2:44:11] complexprotein: I loved my boss and coworkers at my last place but a 25% raise is too big to pass up.
[2:44:13] colinbobolin: 43% par increase
[2:44:13] DaGMC: but money cant buy you health
[2:44:13] jeffrrreee: Money isnt everything, not having it is
[2:44:14] kypudo: i feel like if they match the new offer u'll just feel riped off because u should have been getting payed more
[2:44:17] rooskie89: its a jump i made
[2:44:30] SlinkySuh: But money ain’t easy to make. The struggle is real
[2:44:32] MrMoneybagMan: LUL

[2:44:33] Larklen: "So here is how I plan to integrate it into my Discord bot..."
[2:44:36] Strayer_J: the problem is... the best way to get a "raise" is to jump companies
[2:44:39] EntropicEGO: ive renegotiated salary several times with getting new job offers. Ive even gotten job offers just to strong arm my current employer into increasing my salary
[2:44:40] Strayer_J: esp competing companies
[2:44:42] KekPek_: PogChamp
[2:44:53] BADboiz_TV: DrDisRespect tried that allegedly
[2:45:05] MrLorenthal: @Giantwaffle did you finish your electrical engineering degree? if not are you going back to it?
[2:45:06] SchroTN: Money can't buy happiness, but it sure fuckin helps
[2:45:08] JoeCrow: I quit my job last year and took a 50% salary drop. Best decision I ever made, shitty boss and work conditions
[2:45:17] BaTu016: @Giantwaffle have u seen the video about a guy from EU printing 3D illegal guns its so weird KEKW
[2:45:24] Mikenice08: I do CNC an make 25 hr,  shit is super stressful. rather make 20 an a much chill environment
[2:45:28] aliceoface: that is actually what last job want from us
[2:45:29] Myekos: when I gave my notice at one job it was right after I had been promoted.  they asked what it would take for me to stay and I said it would take so much money that I'd know they would be immediately looking for my replacement
[2:45:48] stanls: what is the idea behind this modpack?

[3:13:17] ko_kachoff: never knew that
[3:13:18] TheMrDrix: robinhood also sells your information to bigger institutions which use it to manipulate the market
[3:13:19] ThatOnneGuy: rpo_Mave because people don't know they don't own the coins on robinhood
[3:13:19] Coffee_Mugger: convenience is the biggest advantage i guess
[3:13:20] coolcake2: so is robinhood one of those larger dogecoin wallets?
[3:13:21] tonigmaa: is this same for binance?

[3:13:56] ThatOnneGuy: My brother was telling me he owned "1000 shares of doge" and I was like... shares? what? he told me he had it on robinhood... I was like bro, no. Delete that now.
[3:13:57] tonigmaa: @PureSpider cool thanks
[3:13:59] Miestro: but all my actualy coins are on a real exchange

[3:15:32] Larklen: Only offchain one I know if is robinhood. Kraken, coinbain, bitrex, and other major ones are onchain because you buy/sell the actual currency and not a "share of" the currency

[5:06:20] lange__: Why should GMO be bad?
[5:06:24] ByakurenHoujuu: GMO's are great. Monsanto sucks doe
[5:06:27] GenerlKat: corn is a GMO
[5:06:29] ByakurenHoujuu: Our banana's are clones
[5:06:31] Hikyy: watermelon too
[5:06:31] CoolReal: Original bananas had huge seeds
[5:06:32] SlinkySuh: Watermelons are gmo
[5:06:33] Wetware: It was a mutation, not GMO really
[5:06:33] DaGMC: but without bee and crop pandemics we are fucked like in interstellar
[5:06:36] drsnaki96: so are carrots
[5:06:37] Orin_The_Sly: Full of seeds and taste bitter and green
[5:06:43] HornScipo: GMO's are also heavily regulated
[5:06:45] twiQsP: GMOs are everywhere what are people talking about?
[5:06:47] alexwilliam: Look into farming 3.0
[5:06:49] Moobot: Support Waffle by using his Epic creator code: Giantwaffle
[5:06:52] DaGMC: but we dont have a wormhole
[5:06:54] Klorell: selective breading isnt gmo
[5:06:56] Nilau: pepeSmoke Have you heard GMOs being bad for you? pepeSmoke
[5:06:58] Mapleton: All food we eat are from many generations of selective breeding
[5:07:00] Tasar_: primitive GMOing?
[5:07:01] SlinkySuh: Our current bananas taste completely different as well
[5:07:02] Wetware: Kind of, but GMO seems more invasive?
[5:07:05] EntropicEGO: all bananas are clones. the original  banana was practically inedible
[5:07:10] ike2ike: @Giantwaffle i actually did my undergrad thesis on this. People are more scared of the artificially made ones with dna implants than selective breeding.
[5:07:12] x_Crawley: Bill Nye used to be against GMOs but he changed his opinion on them after studying them more, and that's enough proof for me.
[5:07:22] DatoPotatoDato: the original bananas taste really sweet i heard
[5:07:24] Wetware: Tomaccos are coming!
[5:07:25] DaGMC: the engineered seeds that you can just use once

[5:07:34] twiQsP: next thing you know they making fruit people
[5:07:39] RainDoc: making tentacles
[5:07:42] ThatOnneGuy: We're currently trying to modify banana's again because our current version is mass dying to a disease
[5:07:43] DaGMC: so you have to buy their seeds always
[5:07:43] IvanGodlike: There was a popular youtuber that produced rice with B-carotin, actually super useful
[5:07:45] Nilau: 10/10/10 seeds.. thanks for the PTSD
[5:07:48] cranberryleaf: it's just semantics if selective breeding are GMO some defs include some don't
[5:07:57] Mapleton: Natural bananas like most un touched fruit are like 90% seeds 10% fruit
[5:08:35] MrSoSo: i found 10/10/10 seeds in PO3 rly relaxing to do lol
[5:08:38] twiQsP: yes
[5:08:40] ByakurenHoujuu: Beta-Carotin is what makes carrots orange. It's a vitamin

[5:09:25] GSBressan: F1 Rocket League Pack is OUT!
[5:09:31] twiQsP: carotin is what gives flamingos their color
[5:09:34] DatoPotatoDato: thats it?
[5:09:34] CaptainAlkohol: bananas are fucking scary, every banana is a clone so if a new disease evolves, all banana plantages are fucked basically
[5:09:35] Biletooth: the eye sight thing is a meme from the English to fool the Germans cus they had radar tech google it :p
[5:09:48] dasmako: dope
[5:09:49] ByakurenHoujuu: carotin is needed by lots of bodily functions. Helps with your eyes too. The benefit of the rice is, that you can grow it for example in Africa, where they usually have defficiencies in it
[5:09:51] MrMoneybagMan: i found another clip from his stream
[5:10:12] DaGMC: Pump, pump the catJAM

[5:11:50] Winner5001: resin core
[5:11:50] FalleNM3rC: RainbowPls
[5:11:54] rpo_Mave: They still use lead in solder.
[5:11:56] keittehvan: antimony
[5:12:00] lalashkin_G: pepeD
[5:12:01] CaptainAlkohol: why is solder pronounced sauter? never knew how to spell it
[5:12:11] AsHackDM: There are lead free solders

[5:14:01] rpo_Mave: @CaptainAlkohol it's basically America being America again. They need to change the pronunciation of things :P
[5:14:24] lazermage24: Lead based is Tin-Lead, Lead Free is tin, copper, silver, bismuth, indium, zinc, antimony, and traces of other metals, Hard Solder is alloys of copper with either zinc or silver
