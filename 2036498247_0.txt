[0:56:30] Nightbot: In a beta test build, the player would respawn with a stack of bookshelves, enchanting tables, end portal frames and end portal blocks so the devs could easily test their functions. That's why everything is built out of bookshelves and enchanting tables. smolWow

[0:57:20] LuaDotExe: @bigspiderii Chests are block entities, not actual entities; they're still blocks. Being a block entity just means it stores data in a way that's similar to entities.

[0:57:52] livipup: NODDERS I think at the very end the stuff that feels cheaty is fine since the content is seeing what can be done in skyblock
[0:57:52] mariopastry: Woohoo
[0:57:54] bigspiderii: @jugardecisiveable the dimensions still only void

[1:48:25] YS_GAmes: Wow that's actually awesome
[1:48:26] awsmrs: @RyanYeet2010 he tried, it didn't work, it specifically need the bastion chest nbt data for the advancement

[1:51:53] electraminer: you could do it with an external program to convert. but this seems like cheating if you have to use an external program to edit your world yk
[1:51:54] RyanYeet2010: @smallant bedrock is coded in c++ while java is coded in java

[1:53:04] HighOnCrax: @awsmrs I mean yeah sure, but maybe the way world files/player data is stored is the same/similar? Theoretically you could just turn the data from java to c++ but idk how that would work, I was just suggesting smth lmao
[1:53:04] niamhistired: @sapphceleste woag you have a really good imagination you're right
[1:53:07] SuperTheUnderDog: @awsmrs It's gonna be very funny then XD (or just broken)

[3:33:52] awsmrs: @portalplayer1509 idk it was years ago
[3:33:57] Zyonji: The Activator Rail is supposed to place the shulker directly into the portal, but because you added a block diagonal to it, it picks that block instead.

[3:34:50] MintKori: @SmallAnt we were trying to get you to see my original message, I was messing around with the infinite update and it seems to be true that every dimension randomizes mob spawns, I found a dimension which spawns the unused illusioner which leads me to believe cave spiders may spawn

[3:37:41] FurnaceMC1: make spawn platforms in infinite dimensions
[3:37:41] Cherby7: @awsmrs stickerbrush is good but this is better
[3:37:49] jugardecisiveable: you could scout out a normal world with the same seed and find cave spiders/silverfish, then go back to skyblock and get them there
[3:37:53] logmania: shelden with all of the rare stuff PauseChamp
[3:37:54] awsmrs: @Cherby7 nuh uh
[3:37:59] logmania: sheldon*

[3:38:26] awsmrs: @Cherby7 nuh uh
[3:38:39] narancia1235: So you can't get bastion chests?
[3:38:43] logmania: @ash_needs_cash he has a swimming pool peepoJuice
[3:38:52] Cherby7: @awsmrs yuh huh Stare
[3:38:54] awsmrs: @thsgrn they can't spawn holding nbt data
[3:38:54] HellionGames: If there's a glitch for NBT modification maybe, but yeah that seems tough
[3:38:59] awsmrs: @Cherby7 nuh u Stare
[3:38:59] lastpimaster: could you push a chest into the spot where the chest is supposed to spawn before it loads so it generates a loot table?
[3:39:01] SwampSounds: what is the goal here

[3:39:04] g8e_8oy8r8ge2: we could........ cheat....... youtube would never know........
[3:39:05] lajotu: maybe overloading chunks so they corrupt and reset?
[3:39:07] thsgrn: @awsmrs they did though?
[3:39:07] blast1314: hello
[3:39:10] sweatshirt_z: could you somehow reload a chunk with the chest remaining
[3:39:15] CheezyCade: you should force it as the last achievement after youve done everything

[3:39:34] Cherby7: @awsmrs yuh huh huh Stare
[3:39:34] niamhistired: NOOO dark esau got me on pre-corpse mom's heart
[3:39:35] logmania: regen chunk Madge
[3:39:35] Piron4: Surely there's a way without generating whole chunks but we need someone 10x smarter than all of us combined
[3:39:36] peltrux: with carpet for fabric you can push a chest
[3:39:36] narancia1235: Are you going to still try and get every achievement?
[3:39:36] niamhistired: devastated
[3:39:36] Dezponia: Would a enderman farm in a bastion chunk work?
[3:39:38] pcaland: Maybe you should make the grass platform jump off proof for the rabbits?
[3:39:38] luckyluc1207: Is there a glitch that would only generate structures?
[3:39:41] bhutch12345: @niamhistired noooo

[3:39:48] SLowFRosTY: just enable cheats Clueless
[3:40:03] Jewshy__: good evening mr. smant, how are you today
[3:40:10] lastpimaster: is there anyway to place a chest in an unloaded chunk then?
[3:40:13] Liorhaddad: is the condition to generate loot in a bastion, or generate bastion loot?
[3:40:16] Meank_King: @SLowFRosTY fr though
[3:40:19] bananasinyourface_: your field is beautiful!
[3:40:19] niamhistired: LUL
[3:40:23] logmania: its such a simple solution
[3:40:25] jugardecisiveable: @Liorhaddad generate a bastion loot table i believe
[3:40:27] bhutch12345: life could be dream
[3:40:28] awsmrs: @jackthetack2 239 hours
[3:40:29] narancia1235: I arrived here around 1 minute ago, what are you building?
[3:40:30] flushyboy: not 2 levels of barricade for rabbits ?
[3:40:31] CheezyCade: if you do that isnt all netherite achievements as well?
[3:40:33] Paco_IX: maybe with slime block
[3:40:41] logmania: HOUR 239 DinkDonk HOUR 239 DinkDonk GIVE IT UP FOR HOUR 239 DinkDonk MISSED IT NOOO

[3:40:51] sweatshirt_z: no
[3:40:52] Bkt443: spin your propeller hat please üôè
[3:40:52] Cherby7: @awsmrs how about they're both good (mods are probally getting annoyed by this) KEKW
[3:40:53] dukeofburgerz: id beleive it
[3:40:54] rikkino: no
[3:40:56] awsmrs: @shadowz71z he cheated
[3:40:57] peltrux: with carpet mod you can push chests, there is a setting that enables to push some unpushable blocks
[3:40:59] FurnaceMC1: @shadowz71z mud cheated
[3:41:04] Dustlng_: how many real days have you been doing this?
[3:41:14] Goomba_Crusher: Goomba_Crusher subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months! 
[3:41:15] xorinzor: Perhaps if you did the tick overload thingy with redstone you could place a chest in an unloaded chunk. Having said that, that doesn't automatically assign a loot table to it, so it'd be quite pointless.
[3:41:15] manasar: No piston contraption will get a chest into an unloaded chunk?
[3:41:24] Grigori22: will leaving the chest there and switching the version to one with different loot table work?
[3:41:24] awsmrs: @pcaland he JUST said he isn't doing htat
[3:41:28] DamienPup: @manasar chests can't be pushed with pistions
[3:41:31] Leapxx: When's the mudflaps diss track dropping? I can't wait
[3:41:31] LDNTyler: Rabbits hop around aimlessly instead of walking. They can jump up almost 2 blocks in height. They slowly approach players holding carrots, golden carrots or dandelions within 8 blocks.
[3:41:34] ceo_pi: then its not sky block
[3:41:37] MintKori: 2 rules, no vote update either
[3:41:39] riku21997: Rabbits do have strong urges to jump into infinite voids of emptiness
[3:41:41] logmania: not sky block just block YEP
[3:41:41] sweatshirt_z: yeah makes sense
[3:41:46] livipup: atirelShy What about when it is the very last thing to do?
[3:41:56] fish_in_a_bottle1: hey @SmallAnt you should rebuild a chunk with your own blocks sometime that'd be cool to see
[3:41:57] izzyisdead666: Day what?????
[3:42:01] r3volverz: heh
[3:42:05] Liorhaddad: wait 3 month for the next april fools update?
[3:42:05] narancia1235: Dang
[3:42:08] pedddit: how
[3:42:09] SuperTheUnderDog: Oh. ianxofour did explain how to use the backup. In the Restocking chapter (18:51 into the video). @SmallAnt
[3:42:09] logmania: @livipup we might Prayge for an nbt glitch
[3:42:11] xorinzor: wait what, how üòÖ
[3:42:13] Trobinson: which is hilarious
[3:42:15] iansonofthor_: !novoteupdate

[3:42:18] rlscat: what does the goal rabbit mean? Are we just waiting for them to spawn?
[3:42:18] dukeofburgerz: doesnt the endermen do that too?
[3:42:19] Goomba_Crusher: what about the snapshot which the infinite dimensions?
[3:42:20] circa_du_soleil: so bastion chest update is just straight up impossible in skyblock huh
[3:42:25] some_stupidusername: no vote update
[3:42:26] Jewshy__: you could intentionally corrupt a chunk or two
[3:42:26] circa_du_soleil: achievement i mean
[3:42:28] platinumsun1: The Vote what?
[3:42:29] DamienPup: !novoteupdate
[3:42:30] narancia1235: Wow great explanation

[3:42:43] bhutch12345: plus also completely random
[3:42:43] platinumsun1: What is the vote update?
[3:42:47] some_stupidusername: because of rng
[3:42:47] supermembrane: so much different
[3:42:47] SLowFRosTY: I feel like its worth putting that in the banner
[3:42:49] jugardecisiveable: the enderman dont spew 50 items a second
[3:42:49] dukeofburgerz: yea the endermen are def more work
[3:42:55] luckyluc1207: Do you use the april fools update with like all those different portals?
[3:42:56] PyjamaMole: the infinity update addss a new advancement thats very fun, switching dimensions over a billion times
[3:42:59] pedddit: sounds fair and balanced
[3:43:01] SmolFanPls3_: what‚Äôs going on right mow
[3:43:09] livipup: Takes hours to get what you want from endermen even with the farm NODDERS
[3:43:09] logmania: @PyjamaMole a billion POGGIES
[3:43:10] RankStrailMan: 4 minutes instead of 4 hours
[3:43:13] thsgrn: @jugardecisiveable unless you make the mistake of letting them take fall damage, in which case they do, for about one second :)
[3:43:13] themellord: The difference is that using the vote update wouldn't be fun
[3:43:15] supermembrane: netherite
[3:43:16] catcatmegan: the endermen had a farm and saving the blocks was difficult too
[3:43:19] narancia1235: Are you building this in a desert chunk?
[3:43:22] some_stupidusername: yea
[3:43:24] thebigds124: and command blocks PAGGING
[3:43:26] RemiTh3Rat: there was also a risk of throwing things out accidentally, you had to focus
[3:43:31] GabryKiane99: force mojang to make bastion chest april fool update EZ
[3:43:33] awsmrs: @PyjamaMole fun
[3:43:35] thsgrn: @narancia1235 taiga, which also works
[3:43:42] dukeofburgerz: true
[3:43:43] xorinzor: So mojang first nerfed the fishing loot table, and now is like screw it, lets make it basically creative mode?
[3:43:52] SuperTheUnderDog: ianxofour explained how to restock the shulkers. It requires a bit more building so you could work on that while waiting?
[3:43:57] logmania: foxes?
[3:44:00] Scitto_: @logmania that's 37 years if you can go between dimensions in 1 second
[3:44:01] thsgrn: yeah taiga can get wolves too
[3:44:02] dukeofburgerz: foxes?
[3:44:02] usingername_: wolves foxes
[3:44:02] SLowFRosTY: foxes
[3:44:03] PyjamaMole: alr from reading the wiki page on the infinity snapshot it looks like the only thing we will be able to get are unique mobs we otherwise wouldnt be able to get
[3:44:05] awsmrs: @xorinzor tbh it IS an april fool's update
[3:44:06] riku21997: All my watchtime of Sparklez's Skyfactory 3 is finally comming in clutch

[3:44:08] rlscat: its the journey that counts not the end
[3:44:08] Nexacon_: polar bears?

[3:44:09] terakin21: puppies
[3:44:14] supermembrane: @xorinzor no it was a april fools update...

[3:59:26] narancia1235: @liorhaddad true
[3:59:27] logmania: wait the bricks make it spawn fortress stuff? never knew
[3:59:42] SuperTheUnderDog: @logmania no, it's in a fortress bounding box
[3:59:46] 1eyed_doge: how are you today smant?
[3:59:47] dukeofburgerz: it needs to be where a fortress would be too Logan

[4:00:01] SmolFanPls3_: 4 hours WOOOO Pog
[4:00:04] itzl0tus: hello
[4:00:09] Misserette: I'm impressed by how far you're pushing Skyblock to it's limits with all this crazy stuff
[4:00:10] peltrux: the good thing about skyblock farms is they are the most efficient they can be with the natural perimeter
[4:00:11] lastpimaster: i may have found a way to get the bastion chest achievement

[4:00:41] seio173: Oh
[4:00:41] lastpimaster: i found a reddit article talking about overloading a chunk immediately after it loads in so that it doesnt save
[4:00:44] logmania: @xenon5019 rockets DinkDonk
[4:00:45] randomroc: @xenon5019 rockets better if in the sky
[4:00:49] 1eyed_doge: I‚Äôve never played Minecraft I wish I understood any of this. smolEcksdee
[4:00:50] lastpimaster: then going to the chunk again to force it to reload
[4:00:52] Rokkakkei: Good evening Sir, is by chance the lucario run in pokemon still alive?
[4:00:56] Snioflake: @lastpimaster we know
[4:00:59] lastpimaster: but i dont know if that would keep any chests you placed
[4:01:03] seio173: Are the moms going to spawn in the
[4:01:04] supermembrane: omg
[4:01:07] Galejo927: If you have to take it all down why not blow it up with tnt?
[4:01:09] regahOG: Did he get all the impossible items?
[4:01:16] SmolFanPls3_: you might need blaze rods :<
[4:01:16] Yoshilfer: How does a wither skeleton farm work?
[4:01:21] lastpimaster: well if you overload a bastion chunk then the chunk could be from a bastion
[4:01:24] electraminer: does this work without just loading in the bastion (thus removing the void world)
[4:01:27] xbowsxbows: Is it acually day 2mil
[4:01:31] pcaland: Small ant doesnt want full chunks cause its cheesy
[4:01:33] dukeofburgerz: sand is annoying
[4:01:34] seio173: Are the mobs going to spawn
[4:01:35] peltrux: @lastpimaster but that loads back the original chunk

[4:02:22] seio173: Are you going to take down the mobs
[4:02:28] bald2nd: Place a water candle to increase spawning of mobs
[4:02:37] kegknight2400: Prime is the best hydration drink in the US
[4:02:42] awsmrs: back smolJuice
[4:02:44] akobjay21: @HyBye22 it is day 2.5 mil yes
[4:02:48] logmania: smolJuice aws
[4:02:50] coldcupofbleach: did you go in creative and add in an end portal or did you find a way to make it to the end for the elytra?
[4:02:51] seio173: Put a mob spawn
[4:02:53] HellionGames: I'm like 99% sure with my experience with structure code, loading a Bastion chunk with a hand placed chest in it would not generate the loot in the player placed chest no matter what. It would have to generate or somehow modify the NBT of a chest.
[4:02:54] fl4t_is_justice: Apparently all that's needed for the achievement to trigger is to open a chest with the "bastion_treasure" NBT tag according to a still open bug report from version 1.16.1 in the Mojang bug portal
[4:02:56] pcaland: There is a way to regenerate a chunk in skyblock its just that it tales the whole point of skyblock away
[4:02:56] magnitude_8: @HyBye22 2.5 mil minecraft days is 800-900 real life hours
[4:02:57] coolcharacter: how'd you get elytra in skyblock?
[4:02:58] xolsion_: @kegknight2400 Absolutely not
[4:03:07] seio173: Can you put the mob spawn
[4:03:09] Misserette: Use a battle potion with the water candle for even better odds of them spawning
[4:03:12] hsvydgh_hisvyy: Hi smant KonCha intern65Shocked
[4:03:24] SmolFanPls3_: does it notify you when we spend SmolCoins?
[4:03:28] kegknight2400: Absolutely yes
[4:03:31] xbowsxbows: @HyBye22 I ment minecraft dayd
[4:03:32] exploudx7: are you excited for the armadillo? or did you vote for another one? (or none at all?)
[4:03:34] Diegothon: Do fortresses work differently ? Usually mobs don't spawn 24 blocks around you so they wouldn't spawn while you're working on it
[4:03:35] lastpimaster: can shulkers be pushed with chests?
[4:03:40] seio173: Do you like Ghostbusters
[4:03:42] misterK3wl_: mobs only spawn if you're far away from them
[4:03:42] bald2nd: And drink a battle potion
[4:03:51] dukeofburgerz: dang
[4:03:55] pcaland: What if you can make an enderman spawn with a bastion chest loot
[4:03:55] logmania: Sadge
[4:03:55] Paco_IX: @lastpimaster chest cant be pushed
[4:04:00] coolcharacter: what's your fav movie
[4:04:05] seio173: I like your videos
[4:04:06] punnyplayer: @coldcupofbleach A pervious version makes you spawn with portals (it was for testing)
[4:04:07] catcatmegan: @pcaland no can do
[4:04:09] Liorhaddad: iirc, ever since 1.9 new structures are loaded using structure blocks (and jigsaw blocks), so either the structure doesn't generate at all or it generates entirely
[4:04:10] Spark_Horizion: if you have a wither rose in a certain area only wither skeletons will spawn.
[4:04:15] HellionGames: Infernal Expansion, yeah lol
[4:04:19] xddavi6: when are u going to do more super Mario Odyssey
[4:04:28] seio173: I like your videos üòÑ
[4:04:32] Snioflake: what specific skyblock datapack is smant using?
[4:04:36] HellionGames: I'll take a peek in the structure generation code real fast to see if I can see a loophole, but I doubt it
[4:04:38] SuperTheUnderDog: @HellionGames but does the achievement care about the loot?
[4:04:39] komatoses_: day 2,546812?
[4:04:39] Misserette: With the name "Hellion" it's no wonder they know that
[4:04:40] RiskOfTea2: Theoretically, if you hoppered out of a mine cart with chest, thus generating its table, on the same interval as opening a default chest, would that complete the requisites for the advancements?
[4:04:43] dukeofburgerz: LUL
[4:04:45] PyjamaMole: that was my initial guess why it was so slow yes
[4:04:52] seio173: You need a shield

[4:05:11] PyjamaMole: hellion as far as I could see there was not smom7

[4:05:23] some_stupidusername: what do I say I don‚Äôt want to lurk but I don‚Äôt know what to chat rn
[4:05:25] awsmrs: We need Thanks Lycel for the design I really apprec back smant
[4:05:26] HellionGames: @SuperTheUnderDog Yes. Opening a chest in a bastion doesn't count. It has to be marked as a bastion chest for loot
[4:05:26] bigdaddywonston: That makes a lot of sense if so then is it possible to modify the nbt data does one block allow you to obtain a chest with the bt data of a bastion
[4:05:27] logmania: @minecraftmods_be_op just 8 bedrock, command blocks
[4:05:27] p0int_crow: @smallant what are you getting
[4:05:32] seio173: I like your videos a lot
[4:05:39] livipup: @fl4t_is_justice Interesting that it's in the bug tracker when that seems like a reasonable method for implementing the feature
[4:05:40] dukeofburgerz: @p0int_crow redoing the wither skeleton farm
[4:05:44] Spark_Horizion: if you have a wither rose in a certain area only wither skeletons will spawn.
[4:05:45] awsmrs: crazy?
[4:05:47] dukeofburgerz: getting pent up
[4:05:49] HellionGames: @PyjamaMole Yeah, I don't think so, but I'm working on a project rn anyway so already have it open so it doesn't hurt to peek lol
[4:05:54] pcaland: @riskoftea2 that honestly might work
[4:05:58] p0int_crow: thx @dukeofburgerz
[4:06:02] carsonwlyon3: rotten flesh middle right could go
[4:06:02] logmania: @awsmrs NOOO
[4:06:04] Liorhaddad: @bigdaddywonston if you can modify the nbt data of a block, you can probably do much more than just getting bastion loot
[4:06:04] PyjamaMole: @HellionGames fair enough smolLUL

[4:06:14] p0int_crow: how did he get nether bricks?
[4:06:21] Spark_Horizion: if you have a wither rose in a certain area only wither skeletons will spawn.
[4:06:21] usingername_: how do you even do that
[4:06:23] seio173: How does a mobs go out

[4:06:42] p0int_crow: ooooohhhhhh thx @awsmrs
[4:06:42] SuperTheUnderDog: @HellionGames So if it's marked it's gonna have loot for sure? Like, I'm wondering if there's a way to get a chest in before it properly loads- will it for sure not count as 'naturally generated' as far as the achievement is concerned, ya know?

[4:07:33] DeadlyAmbitions: Did we get our rabbits
[4:07:35] thsgrn: @SuperTheUnderDog it has to have the NBT tag, that's what we need. if the chest exists with the NBT tag, even if it's not in a bastion, it would give the cheevo, but getting that....
[4:07:35] awsmrs: @bhutch12345 was the brea good? Kappa
[4:07:36] quinnellettv: have you killed the ender dragon yet?

[4:08:17] bhutch12345: !bookshelves
[4:08:17] Nightbot: In a beta test build, the player would respawn with a stack of bookshelves, enchanting tables, end portal frames and end portal blocks so the devs could easily test their functions. That's why everything is built out of bookshelves and enchanting tables. smolWow

[4:09:17] terakin21: be careful!
[4:09:18] awfullyfp: what farm is this?
[4:09:23] p0int_crow: you can use the same bedrock mining technique found by Raysworks to mine in an unloaded chunk, so if you could use that method and find the exact place a bastion chest was, and place a chest there while you are in the unloaded chunk, it might generate with loot, and count as looting a bastion chest. just a theory, but it might work.
[4:09:27] seio173: Go!
[4:09:27] darken6265: good god the redeems are expensive
[4:09:32] thsgrn: @SuperTheUnderDog even if they did, we wouldn't be able to tell what NBT tag it was and there'd be a whole lot of NBT tags to sort through. (I think they did, but...)

[4:09:56] komatoses_: CORRECT CORRECTCORRECT CORRECTCORRECT CORRECTCORRECT CORRECTCORRECT CORRECTCORRECT CORRECT
[4:09:57] lavender_sunsets: wait didnt the amythyst blocks smant was holding on his head and offhand from the one block update have the NBT tag??? so if the chest just needs the tag then couldnt it happen that way? (note i have ZERO knowledge about this stuff lol)
[4:09:58] Liorhaddad: @logmania no

[4:12:22] iansonofthor_: riley softH
[4:12:22] zild__: honestly I thought the last name was a meme until Anthony Padilla introduced you that way
[4:12:25] catcatmegan: Wendy's is super tasty
[4:12:25] p0int_crow: @smallant u can watch rays works video on bedrock mining, to enter and interact with a chunk while it is unloaded, so if you were to place a chest in the exact spot a bastion chest would spawn, and place a chest there while it is unloaded, and then load it, it may spawn with loot, and you could loot it for the achievement
[4:12:25] thsgrn: @awsmrs well if you can interact with a block in an "unloaded" chunk you might be able to open the chest before it disappears...?
[4:12:25] komatoses_: Give ted a sub
[4:12:27] Riley_AngryFishFace: hi pyjama, aws, ian smolJuice
[4:12:28] HellionGames: Yeah, no loopholes on the looting a bastion advancement I see. The advancement very specifically checks that you *generate* loot from one of four loot tables that are in a bastion and there's really not a way to force that to happen

[4:14:21] catcatmegan: PauseChamp
[4:14:22] PyjamaMole: the only ways I can think off for getting the chest is resetting the entire chunk, as the chest and nbt only gets set when generating the structure, but this is out of the question.
[4:14:23] awsmrs: @akobjay21 KEKW Tanner Ant
[4:14:23] bhutch12345: i cooka da boiga
[4:14:25] TheMostEpicest: riley peepoJuice
[4:14:25] HexnerUS: RaysWorks Pog
[4:14:28] PyjamaMole: Then there are glitches to transfer nbt from one item to another in certain versions, but only transfer, this would mean we already need to have an item with the bastion loot nbt tag
[4:14:29] Liorhaddad: i've done some thinking and i'm personally sure that there's no way to get a bastion chest without actually generating a bastion, which would probably be easier
[4:14:34] iuntehounin: I feel like all wither skeleton farms use soul sand, idk why

[4:23:44] livipup: @Riley_AngryFishFace Yeah üôÉ It got pretty bad, even after I stopped the meds. Two or three nights ago it got so bad that there were spiders everywhere I looked. Probably because I had been awake over 40 hours at that point. smolThink Technically, it was usually just squiggly lines that looked a lot like spiders in dim lighting, but sometimes it was whole spiders.
[4:23:48] SuperFire92_: probably like 1x1

[4:24:38] p0int_crow: @liorhaddad watch rays works video on bedrock mining. he figures out how to get into an unloaded chunk, and interact with it. I tested it and if you place a chest in the place a bastion chest will be, it will spawn with loot in it, and it works.
[4:24:38] thanos12345635: Hello
[4:24:41] jugardecisiveable: is that pixelriffs
[4:24:41] pcaland: @p0int_crow sayd it works! u can watch rays works video on bedrock mining, to enter and interact with a chunk while it is unloaded, so if you were to place a chest in the exact spot a bastion chest would spawn, and place a chest there while it is unloaded, and then load it, it may spawn with loot, and you could loot it for the achievement

[4:55:52] Thekingofhotdogs: @RaccoonMarioFogo the reason why people hunt for skulls in soul sand valleys is because there are very little spawns outside of the fortress, improving spawns inside of the fortress. But that doesn't matter here because the only blocks to spawn on are inside of the farm
