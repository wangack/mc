[1:17:43] Flipplur: man i still remember years ago when waffle went to space for the first time playing get lucky as he left the overworld. so many memories
[1:17:44] Wetware: Have they announced when the orbital try for Starship will be yet?

[1:19:36] MidwayAtom: Hey waffle :)
[1:19:37] CorSPACE: @Flobu_ very lightweight to mass ratio, like a feather
[1:19:38] martinpao3: Was the rocket unmanned?
[1:19:39] Gh3ttoboy: i wonder if one of the fairings has killed a person
[1:19:49] Superswag3211: It will land and then it’s over?

[1:22:39] Purecrew: Idiocracy the movie is pretty much the route society is taking.
[1:22:40] Superswag3211: Where is the rocket landing?

[1:23:58] MAADSolar: PeepoClap
[1:24:00] PureSpider: @strafehelix name of the mission

[1:24:01] BananaStreaker: BananaStreaker subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 23 months! 
[1:24:01] Orkrist13: i love it when you see the esxcavators on the platform and they look like ants
[1:24:01] Brakebein: the landings are the coolest part of spacex launches tbh
[1:24:03] Opusdeity: So insane, every time
[1:24:05] FiIthy_Rat: How much do you think this cost
[1:24:06] TippletonJohn: Casually landing a rocket on a drone ship in the ocean.
[1:24:08] iCLUTCH193: Insane how consistent it is now.
[1:24:17] iPreferPi: remeber when they were first doing this and the cam would keep cutting out now its like glass
[1:24:18] LayWastedd: so crazy how they are able to get it every time
[1:24:18] bcdmonkey: Drown ship and all in KSP 2?
[1:24:23] Noblez_: Is that the Pacific or the Atlantic?
[1:24:32] Sreolla: ya cant ask for better day, crystal clear, smooth seas
[1:24:35] iloveplants: the martian was filmed on Mars
[1:24:36] CorSPACE: like dec 21st 2015
[1:24:37] PureSpider: @Noblez_ it's my bath tub YEP
[1:24:49] TheEnderHydra: why does she keep saying ofcourse i still love you?
[1:24:57] PureSpider: @TheEnderHydra because it's the mission name
[1:25:00] Larklen: @TheEnderHydra thats the drone ships name
[1:25:01] TheEnderHydra: ah
[1:25:03] CorSPACE: they crashed alot on barges for different reasons
[1:25:04] DecoyOcelot: its the barge name
[1:25:11] mechoriet: @iPreferPi they are now using starlink instead of a point to point los connection
[1:25:20] daedmissica0: Dec. 21, 2015 Landing Zone 1: SpaceX's first rocket landing pad
[1:25:21] PureSpider: TheEnderHydra but do you still love me? YEP
[1:25:25] CorSPACE: jason-3 was a ironic one
[1:25:25] TrickyHi: @TheEnderHydra Thats the name of the badge its landing on
[1:25:31] iPreferPi: indeed
[1:25:31] banshay3: aw fuck, I missed it?
[1:25:34] Grimstar_: what data are they collecting?
[1:25:35] yo11e: shes talking to her husband on the phone
[1:25:38] TheEnderHydra: haha
[1:25:40] TheEnderHydra: if only
[1:25:42] PureSpider: @yo11e seqKEK
[1:25:43] Littleme02: its almost boring now
[1:25:47] Knightishift: for me this 2 booster landing was insane
[1:25:48] calebhub514: Watching the Double Booster landing on stream was a moment i'll never forget tbh
[1:25:57] kinglouisxvii: Prayge for starship
[1:26:02] daedmissica0: waffle https://twitter.com/F1 did you see haas
[1:26:02] Maximus439: at least elon is kinda hands off now at spaceX
[1:26:05] iivu1canii: first one i watched here was the one where they tried catching something with a rope
[1:26:05] Polystyx: It will work its just a matter of time and money
[1:26:06] PureSpider: waffle how far did you get in the pack yesterday?
[1:26:07] Lazermage23: Now imagine when the big boy comes back down with 33 rockets burning
[1:26:09] P00nDozer69: Aren't they in big trouble financially if it doesn't work?
[1:26:10] SniperDude24: they basically knew the first ones were going to crash so much. now its routine
[1:26:24] PureSpider: three digits?????
[1:26:25] PureSpider: wtf
[1:26:26] Superswag3211: @giantwaffle what’s the point to fly rockets?
[1:26:27] PureSpider: how
[1:26:32] SimonSez: SpaceX is already in big financial trouble
[1:26:33] thecodealive_original: i expect if starship manages to fly at all, then they will be able to make it as accurate as falcon
[1:26:35] espi: imagine leaving earth
[1:26:36] Moobot: You can find Waffle's Youtube channel here - https://youtube.com/giantwaffle
[1:26:43] mata95: Also spinlaunch
[1:26:46] PureSpider: yea but multiple ten thousands, vs three digits
[1:26:46] Marabou_Dude: KEKW
[1:26:50] weasel9999: you don't do that?
[1:26:55] 0x4273: spinlaunch will never work
[1:27:01] banshay3: more like keep the engine and get a new chassi
[1:27:04] Littleme02: Even if they never get it reusable and only fly expendable its still a amazing rocket
[1:27:06] Hurtwolf: i drive my car once and buy a new one
[1:27:06] iPreferPi: spin launch on the moon
[1:27:06] xxLatte: what’s spin launch
[1:27:13] Blitzonite: spin launch would make sense if you made a cannon barrel all the way to the upper atmosphere  KEKW
[1:27:14] PureSpider: spin deez 4Head
[1:27:15] kinglouisxvii: gib satisfactory space elevator
[1:27:16] DrHax_: the rocket didnt even come out straight in that spinlaunch video KEKW
[1:27:18] Chilz_Dude_7: only 10k Gs
[1:27:24] Fibus: yeet tech
[1:27:24] xxLatte: lmaoooo
[1:27:24] mata95: The scaled 1/3 spinlaunch has been tested successfully
[1:27:25] xDIGIT84: spin launch is a ponzi scheme
[1:27:26] vasflam: Spinlaunch is perfect for sending rocks to space, not technical devices
[1:27:28] PureSpider: xxLatte basically catapulting rockets into space instead of active engines
[1:27:28] FiIthy_Rat: Like Power Ranger Time force?
[1:27:29] Narcotical: Imagine yeeting it from earth KEKW
[1:27:30] thecodealive_original: theoretically you can, but the g-forces involved really limit the possible payloads
[1:27:31] Asphoron: Railgun across the desert
[1:27:32] 0omkins: YEET LAUNCH
[1:27:35] dollar_cave: but now it has the word "yeet" to make it more fashionable
[1:27:41] Larklen: It will work, but it has a very limited launch weight range
[1:27:45] CorSPACE: spinlaunch has gotten some nasa money, doesnt mean much since nasa gives out money to alot of small companies, but im interested where it leads
[1:27:46] LayWastedd: what about some kind of magnet launch like a rail gun
[1:27:49] Hykisho: damn playing MC for 40 days lol
[1:27:52] iPreferPi: the atmosphere is very thick
[1:27:53] iivu1canii: yeet launch ? sounds like something i'd make in middle school LUL
[1:27:57] Kjoelby: Yeeting things into space is my new favourite method of propulsion
[1:27:59] Littleme02: You need to make an rocketengine that can take 10kG and fire after
[1:28:02] Sreolla: fraction second missed, faceplants
[1:28:06] xxLatte: @purespider yeeted rocket nice 👍
[1:28:07] mata95: The real engineering has a good mini documentary on the scaled version of it
[1:28:09] vasflam: Space elevator!!!!
[1:28:13] LayWastedd: ah yeah good point
[1:28:20] PureSpider: xxLatte literally
[1:28:26] banshay3: what about a big trebuchet, like BIG
[1:28:27] TippletonJohn: Yeet launch... seqKEK
[1:28:30] bytebeagle: have we finished the modpack?
[1:28:30] UnRealParaDoX: health buff ran out?
[1:28:30] Rongoel: Also 0 communication with it for lik 90% of the way to space.
[1:28:32] Chilz_Dude_7: the technology looks interesting though, ngl
[1:28:34] bytebeagle: or one more hour? ahah
[1:28:35] yo11e: how about a giant slingshot?
[1:28:45] mata95: The friction is not that big of a deal given the time it spends in the low atmosphere, and its focused on copper tipping thats a good heat sink
[1:28:48] PureSpider: waffle how far did you get in the pack yesterday?
[1:28:52] Littleme02: The friction is actually fine apperantly. since its in the atmosphere for such a short time
[1:29:00] LOGICIOtv: we will get there faster than you think
[1:29:03] Bongo5e: COPIUMTRUCK
[1:29:05] sorefingers: i wonder what alloys they use for the thrusters and fins. the temperature and stress requirements must be mad. do you know something about this? @giantwaffle
[1:29:05] bytebeagle: an hour away KEKW
[1:29:06] TippletonJohn: Nearly done @PureSpider
[1:29:06] Larklen: their scaled test has already been succesfully tested, so its not that farfetched
[1:29:08] DX_Plates: You mean investing my 401K in the spin launch wasn't a good idea?
[1:29:14] Maximus439: pepeSmoke
[1:29:15] Larklen:  pepeSmoke

[1:29:34] traemonsta666: !away
[1:29:35] Azata_Zeeth_Kyrah: I'd prefer a launching rail. Big track where you basically ride an induction motor for a kilometer, eventually reaching mach speed. it doesn't remove launch cost, simply reduces it
[1:29:35] Moobot: Streamer is away. Where did he actually go?
