[0:35:06] Speedglass: the number tells you how many mines in vacinity
[0:35:24] Manacaym: or you 50/50 every tile :P

[0:38:25] NothingEverLoss: pepeSmoke
[0:38:37] The_Flembo: NODDERS When like 99% of the board is bombs, it auto clears
[0:38:45] フリクリ: oh the 3 on the wall advanced strat. i see it bot right
[0:38:52] フリクリ: bot left
[0:38:52] Larklen: pepeLaugh
[0:39:09] germanmikrowave: pogsweeper PogChamp
[0:39:09] Moobot: Come join the Waffle House Discord! <# https://discord.gg/fhGFtMuzdS
[0:39:22] Shiirouken: on the right side of the 3 on the right is a bomb
[0:39:40] danilul9: they doesnt know pepeLaugh KEKW
[0:39:42] フリクリ: the 4,3,3,3,2
[0:39:45] thethurst_: @ValueTown the 3-3-3 at the bottom
[0:39:48] フリクリ: who's valuetown?
[0:39:54] thethurst_: under the left and right
[0:39:56] thethurst_: i think
[0:39:58] OTD303: this modpack is something else entirely
[0:40:04] thethurst_: because the left 3 only needs 1 more
[0:40:04] Winstonrocks: bottom row 2 has them diagonal
[0:40:06] The_Flembo: No, middle
[0:40:08] arkun_: 2-1 you should be able to get 1 square out of it (bottom right of 1)
[0:40:11] HeyAFrozenZebra: The 321 on the bottom, the 1
[0:40:12] The_Flembo: Then below first 1
[0:40:14] HeyAFrozenZebra: Yeah that
[0:40:15] thethurst_: so under the middle 3 cant have one
[0:40:25] Winstonrocks: bottom row 2 has them diagonal because the one
[0:40:33] ValueTown: this?
[0:40:35] thethurst_: @ValueTown yep\
[0:40:37] germanmikrowave: @OTD303 Watch his Garden of Glass playthrough - was awesome, def not as in depth as GT though
[0:40:41] フリクリ: oh i see the issue is that the 3 has a flag above. my bad
[0:40:51] Macrophage4: ? ?
[0:40:57] headtr1ck: The right ? Is correct
[0:40:57] thethurst_: @ValueTown the left 3 gives it away
[0:40:58] Shiirouken: right question mark is a bomb 100%
[0:41:00] HeyAFrozenZebra: The two on the bottom row and the - next to it @valuetown
[0:41:02] rheonyn: PauseChamp
[0:41:07] rfholloway: Right question mark near the 2 is a bomb
[0:41:08] strangelovejr: 2-1-1  last one is safe
[0:41:11] CanYouDigIt7: dirt sounds
[0:41:17] thethurst_: @ValueTown or your right haha
[0:41:18] Catdaddyneff: ding dong
[0:41:20] biggerginger: punch waffle 4 times and click where ever he lands :)
[0:41:20] vivera0wn: @ValueTown u can get 2 spaces from looking at the 4 1's in a row, meaning under the 2 2's is safe
[0:41:25] Winstonrocks: bottom row 2 has them diagonal because the one @ValueTown
[0:41:48] Wazix11: @ValueTown question under the right most(from waffle pov) 3 is definitely a bomb because of the 2-1 next to it
[0:41:58] Invalidm_: LETHIMCOOK
[0:42:02] フリクリ: i would have blown this up already NODDERS 4 sure
[0:42:06] The_Flembo: 3-2-1 | below the 3 and 1
[0:42:06] ValueTown: i'm trying to understand the logic
[0:42:15] drummernerd: peepoPooPoo
[0:42:16] rheonyn: OMEGALUL
[0:42:19] mr_moos: Stuck UwU
[0:42:19] rajahgold: how was your poo?
[0:42:22] KannarinKEKW: Lots of 50/50 KEKW
[0:42:30] Shiirouken: nah
[0:42:33] HeyAFrozenZebra: So the two will always have the 1 next to it partially solved
[0:42:33] ValueTown: this is one is hard
[0:42:34] Shiirouken: there are 100% bombs
[0:42:34] drummernerd: twitch chat plays minesweeper
[0:42:39] arkun_: It’s solvable, I just don’t feel like explaining them
[0:42:47] ValueTown: i'm trying to understand why these 3 are bombs
[0:42:47] johnnnnieg: !GYNH
[0:42:49] KannarinKEKW: Well, yeah...but there's a ton of logic involved
[0:42:49] フリクリ: D: i'm a nice chatter
[0:42:51] johnnnnieg: !gtnh
[0:42:51] OTD303: @germanmikrowave this modpack me and the cuz been on it for 4 months its sooo deep
[0:42:51] Moobot: Pati and the crew are restarting GT: New Horizons because they are complete Chads. Waffle is playing until the Despairge sets in | Get the pack at gtnh.miraheze.org/wiki/Main_Page
[0:42:52] Mr_Jarv1s: Chat like "Oh this looks hard, def a 50/50"
[0:42:54] strangelovejr: 3-2-1, under 3 is bomb
[0:42:55] Wazix11: @ValueTown the 3-2-1, under the 3 has to be a bomb because the spot under 2 and 1  can only have 1 bomb between it because of the 1
[0:42:57] germanmikrowave: If you click a random square near the wall gift a sub
[0:42:57] Xev_00: @Giantwaffle did you see my dm?
[0:43:11] Shiirouken: this yes
[0:43:15] JinM0: above the 4 have to be 3 bombs at the top
[0:43:18] Wazix11: focus on the 2-1 part of the 3-2-1
[0:43:19] Shiirouken: the question mark under the 3 is a bomb
[0:43:28] Deranged_Player: pretty sure the block under the far right 2 is a bomb.
[0:43:30] Mr_Jarv1s: @Wazix11 100
[0:43:32] ValueTown: they are saying these 3 ? are bombs. i believe them
[0:43:32] Mr_Jarv1s: %
[0:43:33] arkun_: They should be treated like 2s and 1s with that bomb next to them
[0:43:34] Khobahi: cause the 2 needs 2.. and cant have below the 2 and 1
[0:43:37] pixfix2k2: That gregtech Stargate rush base is extremely cool
[0:43:38] Shiirouken: 10000%
[0:43:39] germanmikrowave: anyone see the article about those MC mods having malware?
[0:43:39] weppet: yes, under the 3 there is a bomb 100%
[0:43:40] ValueTown: i'm just trying to understand the logic
[0:43:40] biggerginger: 4 on the right side solveable
[0:43:43] HeyAFrozenZebra: The bottom right of the 1 is always safe
[0:43:46] The_Flembo: No
[0:43:48] daedmissica0: is to early for this crap
[0:43:49] Larklen: Waffle, its time to yolo click somewhere else
[0:43:50] Lijazos: Which server is this
[0:43:50] Wildport: On the right side there’s a 2
[0:43:50] deadgolfer: under that 3 is a bomb, 100%
[0:43:50] Shiirouken: no
[0:43:52] Swocoom: better logic... there is 100% a ? under the 2 and the 1... so for the 2 1 1, below the right 1 is clear
[0:43:53] bigfrank23183: Get in a vc with value
[0:43:53] Invalidm_: just hit one and reset pepeLaugh
[0:43:57] strangelovejr: and 2-1-1, last 1 is safe
[0:43:57] Wildport: That can be solved
[0:43:58] Winstonrocks: random click time haha
[0:43:58] xxLatte: under second 1 from left is safe no?
[0:43:59] Shiirouken: i mean yes younare, but there is more to solve
[0:44:03] Invalidm_: you have two lives you can do it
[0:44:03] mr_moos: Chat is wrong as usual
[0:44:06] zzzDai: 321 - bottom right of 1 is always safe
[0:44:07] woodlaphroaig: Yes, the 3 next to the 2 is a bomb
[0:44:07] Khobahi: That 2, needs 2 bombs... so one has to be under the 3 diagonal
[0:44:09] JommyBee: go to the 3 on left wall
[0:44:12] Rangetuur: what happens when he picks a bom?
[0:44:13] Swocoom: yes
[0:44:15] arkun_: Yes
[0:44:15] shnaitz: Yes
[0:44:15] Swocoom: that is safe
[0:44:16] zzzDai: yes
[0:44:16] deadgolfer: that is safe
[0:44:17] Wazix11: can only have 2 bombs under the 3-2-1 and only 1 can be on the right 2 spots, this means under the 3 is 100% bomb @Giantwaffle
[0:44:17] Shiirouken: it is
[0:44:19] HeyAFrozenZebra: Yes
[0:44:20] IvanGodlike: it is
[0:44:20] danilul9: it is
[0:44:21] Immp: Yeah thats safe
[0:44:21] The_Flembo: It's safe
[0:44:21] deadgolfer: yes
[0:44:22] Swocoom: yes
[0:44:24] JommyBee: go to the 3 on left wall it can be solved over there
[0:44:25] bigfrank23183: 2 lives
[0:44:26] ValueTown: i know they are right. i'm trying to learn why
[0:44:28] xxLatte: W
[0:44:30] Mr_Jarv1s: for the 3-2-1 there can only be one under the 2-1. which means there has to be one under the 3
[0:44:31] strangelovejr: yes
[0:44:32] The_Flembo: Left is bomb
[0:44:35] rfholloway: Middle question mark is a bomb
[0:44:37] deadgolfer: under 3 is a bomb
[0:44:37] zzzDai: below that new 1 is safe
[0:44:39] Swocoom: below that should also be safe
[0:44:40] Wazix11: can only have 2 bombs under the 3-2-1 and only 1 can be on the right 2 spots, this means under the 3 is 100% bomb @Giantwaffle read :)
[0:44:41] zzzDai: all 3 spots below
[0:44:41] arkun_: Bottom row under that 1 is safe
[0:44:41] InoUno: For the pattern 1-2-X on a straight side, the tile next to the  X is always a bomb
[0:44:44] shnaitz: the 3 spaces below the 1 must be safe
[0:44:45] Shiirouken: @ValueTown you want a quick rundown?
[0:44:46] MrArrig: below is safe
[0:44:49] strangelovejr: and all 3 under that 1
[0:44:53] zzzDai: left/right of that new one is safe
[0:44:53] HeyAFrozenZebra: And again
[0:44:53] xxLatte: to right is also safe?
[0:44:57] Swocoom: and left and right of that one
[0:44:58] Travess: If that 1 is safe too, the one below that is safe
[0:44:59] nvrmissashot: the ? under the 3 should also be a bomb
[0:45:00] Swocoom: yes
[0:45:01] strangelovejr: yes
[0:45:04] ShireaTV: HUH
[0:45:05] Shiirouken: yes
[0:45:08] krakosek: yes
[0:45:09] strangelovejr: and left/right also
[0:45:13] daedmissica0: chat what do you get for winning this ?
[0:45:15] jay7tx: y’all are still stuck on this?
[0:45:15] strangelovejr: yes
[0:45:15] krakosek: below it too
[0:45:17] Wildport: On the right side there’s a 2 that can be solved
[0:45:17] RedalousTheRed: Against the left wall both tiles underneath the 3 are bombs
[0:45:17] Shiirouken: below aswell
[0:45:17] arkun_: Again with the middle 1
[0:45:17] fauxbos: and below the middle 1
[0:45:19] zzzDai: 3 below that bottom 1 are also safe
[0:45:19] Wazix11: can only have 2 bombs under the 3-2-1 and only 1 can be on the right 2 spots, this means under the 3 is 100% bomb @Giantwaffle or @ValueTown
[0:45:27] KnightofObv: keep going on the one
[0:45:28] The_Flembo: Bomb 100% left
[0:45:28] ShireaTV: minecraftsweeper? HUH
[0:45:32] w_a_k_0: Pog
[0:45:34] brainslime1: the bomb has to be to the left
[0:45:35] arkun_: Okay, done helping
[0:45:36] Larklen: play off that one you flagged
[0:45:38] MrArrig: figure it out later
[0:45:40] strangelovejr: nice
[0:45:40] TelRehiad: work from the 1 you just opeened up
[0:45:40] brainslime1: if the 2 is beneath
[0:45:48] vuuriswarm: what is this
[0:45:48] xxLatte: back to eep now
[0:46:07] Kesler343: I have yet to find any of the loot games in my world, are they pretty rare?

[0:47:36] 冷凍スイカ: Sadge
[0:47:42] drummernerd: peepoHappy
[0:47:43] Niksia: Happy happy joy joy.....
[0:47:46] Invalidm_: i wish i were happy Sadge
[0:48:13] maccabeus: @Invalidm_ peepoPat I wish you were happy too
[0:48:19] vivera0wn: @Invalidm_ same realvrPat
[0:48:22] MasterKraft: is waffle getting better?
[0:48:34] The_Flembo: Start with middle 3
[0:48:35] フリクリ: CoolStoryBob neat
[0:48:36] thethurst_: yes much!
[0:48:37] Mr_Jarv1s: @MasterKraft def, practice helps
[0:48:37] DanologyUK: @Lijazos Talk me through the thought process for asking to join the server when you arent even a mod
[0:48:40] Swocoom: just start lower
[0:48:42] DanologyUK: @Lijazos Sub*
[0:48:45] arkun_: The third from the wall is safe
[0:48:47] strangelovejr: 1-1-1 last one is safe
[0:49:04] maccabeus: this is actually making me want to install minesweeper
[0:49:11] MDBrokenArrow: the rule for ones an a wall is the 3rd on from the wall is always safe
[0:49:23] HeyAFrozenZebra: Always look for corners to solve fiest
[0:49:26] HeyAFrozenZebra: First
[0:49:38] MDBrokenArrow: yeah
[0:49:40] arkun_: Ya
[0:49:40] The_Flembo: Ye
[0:49:41] shnaitz: yes
[0:49:42] strangelovejr: yes
[0:49:49] Swocoom: because it has to be next to one of the top 2
[0:49:50] The_Flembo: Top can only have top two spaces
[0:49:53] xxLatte: jus click
[0:49:56] nvrmissashot: @Giantwaffle because the bomb HAS to be either the first two on the wall.
[0:49:57] arkun_: [?] [?] s
[0:49:58] vivera0wn: bc the bomb has to be in the first 2
[0:50:00] mr_moos: I see
[0:50:01] Winstonrocks: otherwise the top cant be true
[0:50:06] MasterKraft: the 2nd 1 has to be satisfied from teh first
[0:50:28] MasterKraft: making the third safe
[0:50:30] Smithii: The 2 just gave you cornor 1's
[0:50:30] フリクリ: PETTHEPEEPO
[0:50:32] vivera0wn: it does not need 3 1's, only 2 is needed for that rule
[0:50:42] silv: when will they ever click a "9"? Kappa
[0:50:45] daedmissica0: @Giantwaffle or chat what do you get for winning this ?
[0:50:45] NevaDaha: Gaming gamers, gaming on a saturday pokiW
[0:50:50] LsTheRoberto: I like that game more, I can visualize it better
[0:50:50] 0omkins: that 1111 row you just solved you can cook more up there....
[0:51:01] The_Flembo: That 2-2-3-3 | space right of 2nd 2 is bomb
[0:51:15] The_Flembo: Clear? I no memba
[0:51:27] ValueTown: @The_Flembo here?
[0:51:27] strangelovejr: cant solve that yet
[0:51:33] The_Flembo: Ye
[0:51:36] Smithii: The one below the 2 is safe, right? As there must be a flag above?
[0:51:37] Shiirouken: that question mark is a bomb
[0:51:38] arkun_: Need more information, it’s a chained 50/50
[0:51:40] IvanGodlike: @ValueTown yes
[0:51:43] strangelovejr: 1-1-2-2, first 2 is bomb
[0:51:46] UnCrazed: ? is a bomb 100%
[0:51:48] The_Flembo: Is bomb
[0:51:49] AnOldNewb: the ? has to be one
[0:51:56] rickthe_punk: right to the 2 on top is safe cause if one bomb on top and one on the bottom that means no bomb can be right to it
[0:52:08] finisher70: shouldnt there be 2 bombs for the first 2 tiles next to the 1111
[0:52:11] HeyAFrozenZebra: I think you can solve around the 4
[0:52:17] AnOldNewb: due to the 1 above that 2
[0:52:21] Shiirouken: The upper 2 needs 2 bmomb but the one can only have 1 so the bomb has to be down
[0:52:21] The_Flembo: Hard to explain in text
[0:52:26] Swocoom: right of the top 1 is safe... the right of the mid 1 and 2 are ?
[0:52:29] IvanGodlike: The 1 limits the amount of bombs in the upper two spaces above the ?, so to have a 2 there it needs to be a bomb
[0:52:39] rickthe_punk: right to the 2 on topest is safe cause if one bomb on top and one on the bottom that means no bomb can be right to it
[0:52:41] pipin420420: the 2 next to a one has to satify one of the bombs outside the range of the 1 so the question mark is correct
[0:52:44] The_Flembo: Space right of 2 is bomb
[0:52:47] omar_i_: 15 mines remaining, time to count possible positions and chance it somewhere else
[0:52:54] D1CKENSS: send it
[0:53:00] The_Flembo: No, lower
[0:53:04] Swocoom: they are talking lower
[0:53:07] rickthe_punk: no safe
[0:53:10] Swocoom: the 1 1 2 2
[0:53:11] Shiirouken: lower
[0:53:15] mr_moos: It's bombs all the way down
[0:53:16] The_Flembo: Thats a bomb
[0:53:24] Shiirouken: upper 1 to the right is safe
[0:53:25] The_Flembo: NotLikeThis
[0:53:26] Swocoom: the middle 1 and 2, to the right of them are ??
[0:53:27] w_a_k_0: you could try to mark all squares where bombs could be with a "?". then the squares left with no "?" have to be safe
[0:53:31] Wazix11: chat you need to be more specific, he is moving around
[0:53:34] Swocoom: so the top 1, to the right of it should be safe
[0:53:35] Larklen: time to yolo a corner pepeLaugh
[0:53:35] rfholloway: ? Is a bomb
[0:53:36] ValueTown: i get this ? is a bomb. i'm trying to understand why
[0:53:37] omar_i_: count positions waffle and chance it
[0:53:42] rell3k: bottom at the wall is safe isnt it?
[0:53:45] The_Flembo: The 3-2-1 at the top, 2 is bomb
[0:53:45] arkun_: 2-1 the top right diagonal is safe
[0:53:45] vivera0wn: "we dont need pati" realvrSmile
[0:53:49] Wazix11: yolo time Pog
[0:53:49] strangelovejr: question mark is bomb
[0:53:52] xxLatte: click random one
[0:53:56] w_a_k_0: oh, right
[0:53:59] Vizion_TV: @Pati They need halp LUL
[0:54:00] Igneous3: yolo a square against the wal
[0:54:01] mainG__: click and Prayge
[0:54:02] MasterKraft: you have like 60 spaces left, 15 bombs.  thats like 1 in 3
[0:54:03] Stormflare: widePepeLaugh
[0:54:04] Shiirouken: @ValueTown the one 2 spaces up limits the bomb to be at the question mark
[0:54:04] The_Flembo: Trust Prayge
[0:54:06] TelRehiad: make value pick. KEKW
[0:54:06] deadgolfer: go up top
[0:54:06] xxLatte: by the wall
[0:54:10] Dannythebrill13: Ask ChatGPT YEP
[0:54:12] mr_moos: just 360 noscope it
[0:54:14] arkun_: 2-1 the bottom right of 2 is a bomb, top right of 1 is safe
[0:54:14] AnOldNewb: looks like to the right of the 1 above the 1,2 is safe
[0:54:15] L707644: Check that 3-2-1 maybe with combination with 4 you can solve it
[0:54:22] Rhicas: you can get 2 bomb with logic at the 1-1-2-2
[0:54:25] therner: For a 2 next to a 1 on a wall, there cannot be two mines next to a 1, so the square by the 2 farthest from the 1 is guaranteed to be a mine
[0:54:27] FingerGames: hachuWhat
[0:54:28] deadgolfer: try up top
[0:54:37] IvanGodlike: the relevant ones are the 1-2-x against a wall,
[0:54:38] xxLatte: dialing up my proof writing skills
[0:54:44] Shiirouken: no
[0:54:48] UnCrazed: no at the ? bomb
[0:54:48] Shiirouken: the question mark
[0:54:50] therner: The one that was just marked
[0:54:54] InoUno: A 1-2-X pattern on a straight side, the tile next to the X will always have ta bomb
[0:54:57] Swocoom: the ? value put is safe
[0:54:57] arkun_: [x] [x?] [x?] [s]
[0:54:58] MrSilverMatch: the bomb is for the 2 above, it has to be there to be ffar to the 1
[0:54:58] jay7tx: WAYTOODANK
[0:55:04] Larklen: PepeSpin
[0:55:07] Jibbur: where it goes 1-2-2 from top to bottom
[0:55:09] omar_i_: monkaHmm MathTime
[0:55:14] xxLatte: it could be
[0:55:14] Moobot: You can find Waffle's Youtube channel here - https://youtube.com/giantwaffle
[0:55:14] Winstonrocks: then the 2 isnt happy
[0:55:14] Mandorake: @Giantwaffle can chatgpt solve minecraft puzzles
[0:55:15] Shiirouken: YOu need 2 bombs at the 2
[0:55:16] Wazix11: @ValueTown the top 2 wouldn't be satisfied with how you just marked it
[0:55:21] headtr1ck: Because of the 1, there can only be a single bomb in the spaces next to the one and 2. Therefore the question mark has to be a bomb to fulfill the 2
[0:55:21] ValueTown: oh
[0:55:22] Mr_Jarv1s: Value had the solution there!
[0:55:22] Smithii: ? is bomb YEP
[0:55:23] nvrmissashot: the ? under that 2 is a bomb
[0:55:23] Shiirouken: and it cant be the 2 spots next to the 1
[0:55:24] ValueTown: ok i get it
[0:55:28] i_smitt: The 2nd 1 there next to it is a bomb
[0:55:29] The_Flembo: 1-2-3 at top | Area right of 2 is bomb and opens
[0:55:31] MrSilverMatch: put where the bombs can be to satisfy the 2 top
[0:55:32] UnCrazed: the ? is a bomb and the space 3 above is safe
[0:55:36] krakosek: ? is bomb :)
[0:55:40] strangelovejr: correct
[0:55:40] Swocoom: it is right
[0:55:41] Wazix11: 100% right
[0:55:42] Shiirouken: it cant be the 2 spots next to the 1
[0:55:43] RoninStorm: they right
[0:55:46] TheHappySocks: it is right
[0:55:47] shnaitz: the only way for the ? NOT to be a bomb is if the other 2 spaces ARE a bomb, which isn't possible due to the 1
[0:55:48] omar_i_: @Giantwaffle am sorry for suggesting minesweeper to warm up in the morning. Please accept my apologies Prayge
[0:55:50] wannewanwanban: its right yeah
[0:55:52] MasterKraft: yeah that makes sense, i like that logic.
[0:55:55] DanologyUK: Its right cos chat said
[0:55:57] Swocoom: no, it wasn't random
[0:55:58] Jibbur: where it goes 1-2-2 from top to bottom, there can only be 1 bomb in the top 2 sections, so the bottom has to be a bomb to get 2 bombs to the middle one
[0:56:00] jay7tx: it’s right (Idk wtf is going on)
[0:56:01] puapurin: EZPZ, u are one of the guys who never understand that game XD
[0:56:05] Dannythebrill13: @omar_i_ don't apologise, this is very entertaining pepeLaugh
[0:56:07] arkun_: Clap
[0:56:09] Saikenjuega: good morning chat saikCobija
[0:56:14] Smithii: The middle 2 have three possible placements for blombs. if the bottom one is not a bomb, the 1 would have 2 bombs
[0:56:15] MrSilverMatch: inside corner of 3 is a bomb
[0:56:21] Jibbur: yes
[0:56:25] JommyBee: do the top 3
[0:56:27] Lekerstein: That 2 has three possible locations for bombs, but it can't be that the top two are bombs, since then the 1 would have 2 bombs.
[0:56:27] JommyBee: 2*
[0:56:28] HeyAFrozenZebra: To the right of the 4 is a bomb
[0:56:29] maccabeus: ItIsWhatItIs
[0:56:32] JommyBee: above the middle 1
[0:56:33] PiitchFk: For that "2" reasoning: that's a bomb for sure... since if the 2 slot above were bombs the one would not be satsfied
[0:56:33] The_Flembo: Go from 1-2-3 at top | Area right of 2 is bomb and opens
[0:56:37] arkun_: Valuetown is learning
[0:56:41] PxlSauce: bottom diagonal of the 2 is safe
[0:56:44] Shiirouken: right to the 4 is a bomb
[0:56:44] kenshin2666: always a 50/50, it either is or isnt a bomb Kappa
[0:56:54] MDBrokenArrow: top left corner of the 3 just revealed is a bomb
[0:56:54] PxlSauce: yeah that
[0:57:00] HeyAFrozenZebra: Count the 3 at the top
[0:57:01] PxlSauce: was alredy clciked
[0:57:04] Igneous3: 3is solved
[0:57:10] The_Flembo: Playing with fire MONKERS

[0:57:12] PostSuper: too early in the morning for this shiz
[0:57:20] Stormflare: he didnt LUL
[0:57:23] IvanGodlike: pretty sure that was a guess
[0:57:24] Mr_Jarv1s: Value is god
[0:57:26] arkun_: The 2 next to the 50/50
[0:57:27] KannarinKEKW: trust the process.  KEKW
[0:57:27] Vizion_TV: Because the 2 above it and the 3 below clear
[0:57:32] Larklen: because the two 3's
[0:57:32] PxlSauce: beacaue the bomb Had to be at one of the bottom
[0:57:32] The_Flembo: The 2 you're standing on
[0:57:38] PxlSauce: look at it again
[0:57:44] HeyAFrozenZebra: ? Is safe
[0:57:45] The_Flembo: No
[0:57:47] Swocoom: the ? is safe
[0:57:47] MrSilverMatch: no bomb at question mark
[0:57:52] Swocoom: was
[0:57:52] The_Flembo: Oh safe, yea
[0:57:55] Amatean: maybe waffle needs to watch Girl_DM's tutorial on this
[0:57:55] Shiirouken: exclusion process
[0:57:57] bobolpwnz: process of elimination
[0:57:58] Shiirouken: yes
[0:58:11] PxlSauce: that was the same at the bottom
[0:58:18] thetexasewok09: i feel so dumb like this is great
[0:58:19] Alamose: thats the same as the 1-2-2
[0:58:19] UnCrazed: thats the same logic as the other
[0:58:21] strangelovejr: yup
[0:58:22] The_Flembo: Go from 1-2-3 at top | Area right of 2 is bomb and opens
[0:58:28] Lekerstein: same with the other 4
[0:58:31] xxLatte: has to no top of 3 right? bc of the other 4
[0:58:39] maiph_: it has to be the left one to satisfy the 3 and both 4s at the same time
[0:58:40] Larklen: KEKW
[0:58:43] mr_moos: kw
[0:58:43] KannarinKEKW: LUL

[0:59:23] Larklen: KEKW
[0:59:23] Jibbur: you can solve it from below
[0:59:24] The_Flembo: Oh my... Right of 2 in 1-2-3
[0:59:28] vivera0wn: he did it
[0:59:28] gamabunt: When playing Minesweeper, couldn't you right-click at a 50:50 chance and have the game reveal the correct squares?
[0:59:29] Jibbur: the 1-1-2 will help
[0:59:37] vivera0wn: was on the right
[0:59:46] mr_moos: Solvable now probably
[0:59:54] kuba_91: they depend on what's  under 2
[0:59:57] MDBrokenArrow: under the 2 is safe

[1:00:11] Thegrinch6: Look at the 2 2 2
[1:00:12] MasterKraft: nvm they got it
[1:00:16] NilpNet: under the 2 has a 1 diagonal up left
[1:00:17] Larklen: space above the two ?? should be safe, no?
[1:00:21] HeyAFrozenZebra: It’s solvable now
[1:00:22] HoloJr: Bomb above & below the 2 in the middle
[1:00:24] FREEZE_ball: what is it, "twitch plays minesweeper"? waffleSTAARE

[1:27:28] Moobot: Come join the Waffle House Discord! <# https://discord.gg/fhGFtMuzdS
[1:27:29] LongestMoney: Most of the game doesn't look excite tbh
[1:27:33] Mandorake: @Giantwaffle you get your renown finished?
[1:27:33] HRGruffNStuff: i disagree, there's easily $70 worth of content
[1:27:34] 514484: it's late diablo, you grind to grind faster, it's pointless
[1:27:37] Mandorake: the side qeusts are great
[1:27:45] zzzDai: its still 100+ hours until the end game
[1:27:46] punkgeek: That sounds right. Story isn't done, endgame feels more repetitive than D3 rifts
[1:27:46] aeadon: You kinda have to compare it to other ARPGs at launch
[1:27:48] Yakobro: poe has so many different things to do endgame idk what to say lol
[1:27:48] atamala: hardcore makes it fun tbh, the risk of death
[1:27:49] daemonaedryn: wtf
[1:27:51] PlaguedV: i actually grinded diablo 3 for thousands of hours lmao
[1:27:55] Kjoelby: Acting like any arpg has exciting endvame LUL
[1:28:00] K4shira: playing like 27hours a day tho LUL

[1:28:01] Iksess: it has less content then diablo 3
[1:28:03] Mandorake: @Giantwaffle at least you earn that gear instead of just trading for it
[1:28:03] Bergyi: sounds like d3 KEKW
[1:28:04] nvrmissashot: I mean D3 was basically the same
[1:28:04] dpokerdude: well blizzard is all about money grab
[1:28:06] Xev_00: I’ll revisit D4 when the first xpac drops
[1:28:06] MiesterTee: It was so lame
[1:28:12] SoFloLuna: https://clips.twitch.tv/FaintScrumptiousAlfalfaRaccAttack-7sfQbEDQFN-vPdPR
[1:28:13] MiesterTee: Also it's just like grifts
[1:28:14] HRGruffNStuff: it's only fast to streamers and people that play 10+ hours a day
[1:28:15] Cyberwire69: just wait for season 1?
[1:28:23] Goldps1: no i like that
[1:28:26] Hogpeuf: They're too slow to nerf the meta dungeon grinding
[1:28:28] Doomwyte: POE has also been out for 10 years KEKW
[1:28:34] maccabeus: casuals will take weeks to max
[1:28:34] HoloJr: The 1% of the 1% have perfect gear in PoE
[1:28:36] Mandorake: I'm a normal human and im at 58, feels good
[1:28:37] DragonApoc: It’s not an mmo though so they have to scale down
[1:28:39] Khobahi: i think 1-50 should have been as fast as it is.. but the 50-100 for paragon and shit is to fast
[1:28:41] MiesterTee: poe wasn't shit at launch tho KEKW
[1:28:42] Zedarkymon: giggity
[1:28:44] funnyc4t: Diablo always been like that I think, it's all about the seasons.
[1:28:44] thereaper199423: It takes like 70-80 hours to get to 100??? How is that fast?
[1:28:45] HostileLogOut: @Iksess what are you on about? D3 story took less then 5 hours and had no content at all at launch lol.
[1:28:46] atamala: playing the game as intended and solo it takes awhile to level
[1:28:47] petros13d: KEKW
[1:28:47] Razznab: does he have the harleyquin crest?
[1:28:49] dpokerdude: @Mandorake not even
[1:28:49] Xev_00: Way too easy to level, and way too easy to get gear
[1:28:49] DareDeFlug: Oh really ? Ifelt the exact oposite
[1:28:51] StardustDragon08: Stop checking the same chests Waffle KEKW
[1:28:51] Kjoelby: He also has like 120 hours in those 7 days
[1:28:57] Yakobro: KEKW
[1:28:58] FowD8: that's only because it's done over exploit... it's not that long if don't intended
[1:29:06] daemonaedryn: its an ARPG. 70-100 hours is nothing
[1:29:07] DareDeFlug: Dont think it is faster
[1:29:11] zzzDai: Its almost like they designed the game around solo casual play instead of optimized speedrun lootfarming
[1:29:18] Saikenjuega: i would love to reach level 100, but i dont have the time because of work waffleSad
[1:29:18] Mandorake: for a game that just released?
[1:29:22] Iksess: @HostileLogOut inferno 5h? you must never played d3
[1:29:22] atamala: @zzzDai based
[1:29:33] FowD8: they only leveled that fast because of exploits, the intended way takes FOREVER
[1:29:33] MiesterTee: And like, perfect gear for what
[1:29:36] Zerathee: season 1 isn't even out
[1:29:37] HRGruffNStuff: 100 hours for casuals which is the majority of the player base is fine
[1:29:40] MiesterTee: They didn't think the game through too well
[1:29:45] HostileLogOut: @Iksess eh i played alpha and since release lol. story took 5 hours and inferno wasnt hard
[1:29:48] TooMuchVodkaa: it's just classic blizzard timegating
[1:29:49] kappathirteen: Shroud was doing nightmare dungeons with lvl 57 enemies and almost dying. Not even close to lvl 100 enemies
[1:29:50] Doomwyte: when path of exile came grinding the lake was end game, it wans't until they redid the game, and had years to add content that it was deep
[1:29:51] woodlaphroaig: D4 is for the masses not the hardcore
[1:29:54] emnitthy: Its a pretty game bht it’s absolutely souless
[1:29:54] zzzDai: and then its another 100 hours for each other class, or hardcore, etc.
[1:29:54] PlaguedV: yea its rng af
[1:29:56] SoFloLuna: but you'll never  get it
[1:29:58] Mandorake: PoE sucks though so
[1:29:58] HoloJr: It’s took 70+ hours for the first time, next season it’ll be less time because people know the game now
[1:29:59] JoniSusi: we can't compare the two really
[1:29:59] GeneralSpoon12: meow
[1:30:04] DareDeFlug: If you came from D III, DIV feels super slow telling you
[1:30:04] Catdaddyneff: meowdy
[1:30:05] pwrreset: takes months
[1:30:05] Schismed: poe has 745 thousand systems is why
[1:30:06] elric689: catJAM
[1:30:06] atamala: i think there are pros and cons to it
[1:30:06] zzzDai: so theres tons and tons of content if you dont speedrun it
[1:30:06] MiesterTee: Again, they rushed it because people were impatient and their bosses were getting impatient @Giantwaffle And D4 was the result. A half finished game
[1:30:07] TheWonderLlama: annePet
[1:30:08] Yemtron: meowdy
[1:30:11] mainG__: meowdy
[1:30:11] Mandorake: 10 year old ARPG versus week 1 arpg
[1:30:14] WhoNeedsReasons: meowdy
[1:30:14] kotwin: gear doesn't improve much when you upgrade after switching to t4 at level 60-65
[1:30:15] kappathirteen: I dont think anyone is doing lvl 100 nightmare dungeons
[1:30:17] not_elinn: Borderlands players: first time?
[1:30:27] Zylpuppy: those are literally the 2 games, you CAN compare lmao
[1:30:30] daemonaedryn: 100% you can compare PoE to diablo. Their the same genre and are heavily inspired by eachother
[1:30:31] MiesterTee: End game crafting in ANY diablo game has been just pretty generic
[1:30:34] Doomwyte: you can't compare them, POE has been out for 10 years and they literally re-released it with more acts
[1:30:35] MiesterTee: Compared to many other arpgs
[1:30:36] DrHax_: @ededje grinding OP levels in BL2 Despairge
[1:30:37] Mandorake: @Giantwaffle i much prefer D4 where you have to play the game to find items instead of trading currency
[1:30:37] Kjoelby: Poe is also f2p and wants you to sink hours into it
[1:30:37] HostileLogOut: D4 endgame is the same as D3 endgame. but worse ngl
[1:30:46] Iksess: diablo never had crafting
[1:30:47] Rickous: @ededje LUL
[1:30:52] Xev_00: This is like the opposite of D3 launch where it was so hard to find good gear except off the AH
[1:30:54] thereaper199423: That’s always been Diablo always a grind to get any crafting
[1:30:55] MiesterTee: @HostileLogOut Right! Mayswell play D3 and blast
[1:30:56] Saintone: Saintone subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months! peepoMine
[1:30:59] daemonaedryn: How did Diddlies Bee Emporium go
[1:31:01] Cyberwire69: no mention of lost ark
[1:31:01] Bergyi: so d4 on release is basically d3 on release KEKW
[1:31:02] Astro22t: I enjoy it, building and scaling my builds but I would prob wait for the first season and see what they do
[1:31:04] JoniSusi: well, see you in season1, and season2 and season3 and...
[1:31:06] MiesterTee: @Saintone Pog
[1:31:10] Hogpeuf: Doesn't want grinding, playing gregtech? LUL LUL

[1:31:13] Itchyy_: Pog
[1:31:19] PlaguedV: honestly just wait for the season immo
[1:31:29] Yakobro: COPIUM
[1:31:29] HostileLogOut: if D4 does not get any content update for Season 1 it  wont last long
[1:31:33] LongestMoney: Chat is adding aspects of the game that isn't applicable. They're both ARPGs which is the point
[1:31:33] TheGreatLemon: have you tried other classes or jsut the barb?
[1:31:35] Astro22t: Im on my 3rd lol
[1:31:36] emnitthy: As if the season is going to do Jack shit, the game is fundamentally bad
[1:31:37] MiesterTee: @HostileLogOut I got mad at div gambing so not played for a few months KEKW
[1:31:37] kappathirteen: The nightmare dungeon grind is super difficult from what ive seen
[1:31:38] Saikenjuega: when is season 1 dropping?
[1:31:41] Iksess: first season will fix everything COPIUM still no fucking ladder
[1:31:49] Qbertman: if season 1 i still have to play through the story ill skip
[1:31:50] MiesterTee: Saint the man the myth the MS2 king Smoge
[1:31:58] VanDomand: Spin to win Barb most fun barb
[1:32:00] Valseki: seasons are all new chars
[1:32:03] TheGreatLemon: being a meta slave can be boring. Playing off meta clases and builds can strike a chord
[1:32:16] johnnymac17: I want set items so badly
[1:32:16] SawyerStreamsStuff: curious: do you think its better to D4 craft your "best" shield with rerolling mods and getting the correct imprint or PoE shield where you chance/scour spam 14k times?
[1:32:17] weppet: on an unrelated note, I'm about 50 hours into Valheim with my friends and we've been having an absolute blast. And the game isn't even out yet. And it costs 50 bucks less than Diablo KEKW

[3:41:46] ZephMW: What are you using for steam generation?
[3:41:59] Satic: Water
[3:42:10] Neonliquidsentertainments: Maybe you need a nightshift?
[3:42:18] Cannon147: @Giantwaffle for someone relatively new to greg tech, would you recommend this or nomi? or something else?
[3:42:25] Iksess: so you just gonna watch them do it?
[3:42:25] definitely_not_a_weeb: how did u do it before steam....u can do it manually lol
[3:42:29] Neonliquidsentertainments: No power
[3:42:34] That_Lurker: So we need steam to get more steam
[3:42:35] ZephMW: I recommend High Pressure Solar Boilers if you aren't using them
[3:42:36] Stormflare: time to restart the pack
[3:42:38] biggerginger: is there any where you can move the solar panel so it is usable ?
[3:42:47] TigerLuv: so all go out for a picnic
[3:42:56] hackett33: why were the chunks loaded with no one on?
[3:42:56] TigerLuv: and mine ore
[3:43:00] pixfix2k2: The base on the gtnh dev stream looks insanely good.
[3:43:00] mainG__: just afk for 12 hours then use that steam to make more steam :)
[3:43:01] k1n3c7x: switch to diesel fuel
[3:43:02] Jellyjaymon: Didnt yall get a solar panel like day one or can you not use it
[3:43:03] Neonliquidsentertainments: No back up power
[3:43:06] TarMonA: make another steam tank I I  so when every alseep you have a bigger buffer
[3:43:11] maccabeus: @hackett33 someone was afk
[3:43:18] Volcanibros: chat does waffle know about the potential malware in modpacks?
[3:43:20] Jellyjaymon: nvm you just answered it
[3:43:25] maccabeus: @Volcanibros yes
[3:43:34] Slymph: Shouldnt widePepeLaugh
[3:43:40] Neonliquidsentertainments: What are the options?
[3:43:46] ZephMW: I'd recommend swapping to redstone alloy cables if you're going to use a setup like that so that you don't have to deal with power loss, but it's a ton of resources
[3:43:48] Volcanibros: perfect thanks
[3:43:49] biggerginger: cant you take 2 of the pack of the solar panels to ? so they not feed though each other
[3:44:29] ZephMW: 32 coins = 16 tin cable
[3:45:04] ZephMW: sorry, 30 coins*
[3:45:25] Neonliquidsentertainments: Make a list
[3:46:43] ZephMW: it's sulphur + raw rubber dust for motlen rubber
[3:46:43] Moobot: You can find Waffle's Youtube channel here - https://youtube.com/giantwaffle
[3:46:48] ZephMW: and yes, it's the coated ones
[3:46:52] k1n3c7x: you can start thaumcraft actually
[3:46:57] TigerLuv: yet
[3:46:59] ZephMW: BUT it's only 1x coated ones
[3:47:20] Dizz1227: how does cable loss work in this pack?
[3:47:21] biggerginger: is the sky blocked ?
[3:47:28] mikwitty: chat said need to clean the panel with water?
[3:47:55] mikwitty: ah
[3:48:06] pixfix2k2: Mv
[3:48:14] KnightofObv: MV
[3:48:25] ZephMW: you can make the triple silver plat with a hammer in a crafting table
[3:48:55] DaddyDiddy: no more rotors with tools with MV extruder @Giantwaffle best one for sure
[3:49:12] BlockofKole: Do you have the FE mod in Waffle?

[3:55:46] ShireaTV: was it 1.18?
[3:55:47] lvyEartman: molten glass i presume?
[3:56:09] TheGreatLemon: could be quite clear glass
[3:56:18] DaddyDiddy: nah its easier to use alloy smelter probably
[3:56:35] n0tdamion: then get power
[3:56:36] Stormflare: just buy more steam lol
[3:56:57] Cmdr_Void: dont you have a lot of power stored in all the batteries
[3:57:01] ZephMW: what's using your power? Shut it off w/ a soft mallet to be able to funnel power to alloy smelter.. maybe?
[3:57:06] Slymph: Buy steam stocks Corpa
[3:57:10] ShireaTV: tinkers smeltery is such a goat in this pack
[3:57:11] Deji0: those batteries were full
[3:57:11] Stormflare: everyone could afk for 12 hours to get enough steam to make more steam Kappa

[4:00:13] Chappp: What are you using for steam?
[4:00:41] ZephMW: Use a tree farm and a pyrolyze oven for a benzene setup. One you get to HV it is self sustaining with an enderIO tree farm and you can just expand it until like... IV I think?
[4:00:46] MrFRZ: Pour to block cast?
[4:00:49] Mackmora: Use the redstone clock?
[4:00:55] Ceaoz: what's the difference between benzine and gasoline? (irl)

[4:01:19] taintgoblin8: sorry railcraft**
[4:01:28] ZephMW: I could see it being laggy if using a tree farm, but I think bonsai's prevent that
[4:01:55] restfulblue: diesel is great
[4:02:01] hyperion6767: benzene is omega laggy. Watch Threefolds series & see for yourself
[4:02:06] SimonSez: They had an automated tree farm

[4:12:25] KuramaTheF0X: or just add another storage mod that does just that
[4:12:25] ZephMW: EV
[4:12:27] thepolaroidbear: I like when the terminal is easy, but the storage is chests and stuff.
[4:12:30] LuminescentLlama: tier 1 digital should be expensive and tiny space but obtainable
[4:12:32] ShireaTV: part of the reason i hate AE2 is the meteor hunting crap they added
[4:12:34] MinusKills: are you going to costream game fest? @Giantwaffle
[4:12:38] JediOnAcid: Computer training is based
[4:12:42] LuminescentLlama: and modular so upgradeable
[4:12:44] Nexhunter: yea
[4:12:45] ImposterArchitect: It's not grinding sand yet

[4:13:20] Skorpio1: yes NOTED
[4:13:24] FlammAlpha: NOTED you played minesweeper?
[4:13:29] Neonliquidsentertainments: I feel that all the people playing could have a good job like your playing but your building the moon into earth 😂
[4:13:37] DemonicHell3: blame pati he disconnected it
[4:13:37] brightcandle: 99% time complaint, 1% minesweeper
[4:13:38] KuramaTheF0X: @KuramaTheF0X yea ofc, but they can disable the automation parts of it
[4:13:43] ZephMW: It needs HV circuits but you can make those in MV without a cleanroom so yeah. Inventory panel is the poor mans AE early on in this one
[4:13:43] tioberto: I swear I heard him saying he was going to stand for a bit
[4:13:45] Nexhunter: HUH
[4:13:46] L707644: Well you met Pati in game. Met the african american creeper and got stuck in quicksand KEKW
[4:14:00] savageshanks: greg tech but real life on the moon, makes perfect sense
[4:14:15] Neonliquidsentertainments: I was talking about using robots to build the moon into the Earth, but using everyone who plays games to do so
[4:14:16] DrunkOrNah: I was tabbed out when you read that comment and it nearly gave me a stroke lol
[4:14:17] mainG__: HUH first half kind of made sense then it was all joever after that

[4:15:18] enki1337: @Giantwaffle have you tried building the moon into the earth?
[4:15:23] JediOnAcid: time for dad voice
[4:15:25] codecab: @Neonliquidsentertainments terraforming moon would be infinitely more complex than minecraft. these people would all need to study sciences for years, which they wont do because they game
[4:15:29] kane1941: Value made the boiler
[4:15:43] FingerGames: yugFloor let them cook
[4:15:44] Neonliquidsentertainments: Yes 👍 it would

[4:17:11] Neonliquidsentertainments: Give me a go of a ufo 🛸
[4:17:24] enki1337: KEKW
[4:17:29] ZephMW: MV turbines use more fuel (less efficient) so if the fuel is the concern there I wouldn't go higher tier turbine and step down power
[4:17:37] JediOnAcid: @drummernerd what kinda kit do u have?
[4:17:43] GFQPR1882: Waffle do u have a Tree farm ?

[4:21:32] ninopanda: @Apparentthreat KEKW

[4:28:15] LongestMoney: Edible drinks are wild
[4:28:17] mkam225: water is a pretty poor solvent for weed stuff, but busting it down should increase surface area so maybe faster onset
[4:28:19] TheMeowstardCat: 2.5mg THC and CBN I took 4, Yea I use tinctures.
[4:28:19] Neonliquidsentertainments: It doesn’t help when there’s only limited power generation options

[4:28:45] Longor1996: What machine is dat?

[4:28:51] TheMeowstardCat: I wanted the 7.5mg but the shit was 50 dollars for 30
[4:28:53] punkgeek: Depends on the person, I've seen friends get stoned from a 10mg eddible

[4:40:23] rickthe_punk: so basicaly pay for nitro your gonna get your name faster than cancel it after your name is set
[4:40:30] ImposterArchitect: did it delete the Charcoal when it turned itself off?

[4:41:43] enki1337: greg'd pepeLaugh

[4:41:44] 0x4273: Turn safe mode on in the machine controller
[4:41:51] AGuyHighInTheSky: Gregory

[4:45:53] Portain: I used sugar cane for bronze steam generation @Giantwaffle Unsure how expensive a redstone ticker or w/e it is in gregtech though
[4:46:06] ZephMW: Steam is also SUPER laggy and inefficient. Once you have the capability to move to gas fuels (Naphtha, Light Fuel, etc) you don't need nearly as large of pipes and it's far less liquid amount per EU
[4:46:25] Jibbur: 1 per 2 seconds
[4:46:43] restfulblue: @ZephMW it's not laggy if you do it right
[4:46:48] kenshin2666: go by 35/min to be safe and have a safety net?

[4:50:38] LeBeauTV: 12
[4:50:38] Bored______________: ok thank you Kappa
[4:50:40] SheepsAholy: so 776 eu max
[4:50:41] NetAssetz: guess you need 10-11 of those steam turbines
[4:50:42] Blockmann317: He’s closing it
[4:50:44] usernameNull: 12th,. 13th, and 14th
[4:50:44] Stormflare: its 3 days 12-14
[4:50:46] angberg: Is there a sub server?
[4:50:47] atamala: some for 2 days
[4:50:47] rell3k: i hope for longer than just 1-2 days
[4:50:47] Obliviron: retards on reddit striking LULW like cmon
[4:50:48] Warkless: 12-14 and longer
[4:50:49] OriginalNidge: 12-14
[4:50:57] hisdue: popCatO
[4:50:57] EnigmaUprising: Yeah
[4:50:57] 0x4273: holy fuck
[4:50:58] Marenti: for 48 hours?
[4:51:03] Blockmann317: Check the Apollo app Reddit page
[4:51:04] EnigmaUprising: He's done wow
[4:51:05] enki1337: @Obliviron HUH
[4:51:05] MinusKills: some subs wont become online even after that
[4:51:06] 0x4273: no apollo = no reddit
[4:51:10] lykenew: Apollo was such a good app
[4:51:10] eddie_lover: some are going longer, if they have to fire mods its going to get ugly
[4:51:17] StardustDragon08: @Giantwaffle Yep. Closing June 30th
[4:51:25] KABBL: If I can't use boost a my reddit app, I just won't use that site at all tbh
[4:51:25] Moobot: You can sub to Waffle by clicking this neat link -> twitch.tv/giantwaffle/subscribe SUBprise
[4:51:31] Obliviron: unfortunately reddit probably wont change anything, at the end of the day there are companies who will pay for the API calls and that's all that matters
[4:51:33] Dagmoo: Just always use old.reddit EZ
[4:51:34] aundros: whats apollo?
[4:51:35] MarquesCoding: Wait what's the reason for him closing it?
[4:51:35] Stormflare: will happen to all the apps unless reddit walks it back
[4:51:37] brightcandle: Expected it's what Reddit wants.
[4:51:39] drummernerd: bruh I am legit Sadge
[4:51:43] Dannythebrill13: god damn, Apollo was literally referenced in WWDC23 KEKW
[4:51:43] calebhub514: i can handle 3rd party apps going away, probably... but if old reddit goes away i might actually stop using reddit
[4:51:44] 0x4273: I will actually quit reddit if apollo shuts down
[4:51:46] mainG__: what is apollo?
[4:51:46] StardustDragon08: @MarquesCoding API charges are way too high
[4:51:53] Nexhunter: @MarquesCoding reddit wants to start charging for API usage
[4:51:55] Slender209: blame elon
[4:51:56] brightcandle: I can't see me using Reddit much once the apps are gone
[4:51:58] enki1337: nobody is paying that rate for api calls LULW
[4:52:01] Nexhunter: @Giantwaffle it the amount of data apollo consumes
[4:52:03] Stormflare: @MarquesCoding tldr reddit is going to start charging really high rates for API access and it will cost 3rd party app devs millions a year
[4:52:04] daemonaedryn: ? whats going on
[4:52:05] Allmostdone: reddit  going the way Twitter
[4:52:06] aeadon: that's the point
[4:52:07] JoniSusi: That's their point ;)
[4:52:07] unnoticedx: I thought if it was an accessibility focused third party app you dont have to pay
[4:52:08] HeyAFrozenZebra: that's the point
[4:52:08] TheMeowstardCat: Anyone have a link for apollo ?
[4:52:08] Obliviron: because people pay for it
[4:52:08] daemonaedryn: oh god reddit
[4:52:09] Printer_Man: elon fucking musk
[4:52:09] Eukee: blame AI LuL
[4:52:09] luthal_: Thats the point
[4:52:10] Cmdr_Void: its just to prevent AI scrubbing
[4:52:11] Dagmoo: Cuz Elon is an idiot KEKW
[4:52:12] Bleu_Forge: KEKW 󠀀
[4:52:13] enki1337: @Obliviron you're delusional my dude
[4:52:14] Giantwaffle: https://www.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/144f6xm/apollo_will_close_down_on_june_30th_reddits/
[4:52:15] Sloppy_D: People will pay
[4:52:17] maccabeus: they don't want you to pay it, they want the users to use their official app
[4:52:19] MinusKills: thanks elon KEKW
[4:52:21] Bleu_Forge: We're not even talking about twitter Dagmoo KEKW
[4:52:21] pt0ughneigh: What's gonna be the reddit replacement
[4:52:22] F1berz: That's the point, they don't want 3d party apps
[4:52:22] calebhub514: they don't want people to pay it, they want people to install their own app
[4:52:22] LazloHo: If I start a new reddit will you guys come to it?
[4:52:23] VenomMellow: space mission cost in app KEKW
[4:52:24] LsTheRoberto: .25 for 1000 API calls
[4:52:24] AshhanX: getting a few dumb people to pay for these new prices makes the company more than what theyre making now
[4:52:26] germanmikrowave: @Cmdr_Void they will just scrape from the frontend?
[4:52:30] angberg: Is there a sub server? @Giantwaffle
[4:52:31] Nexhunter: @maccabeus yea cause apollo kills ad revenue
[4:52:31] Sir_Leinad_: Seems reddit were making shit up saying the Apollo dev was blackmailing them
[4:52:32] MeZorZ: Does waffle know there is a spreadsheet for this calculation for steam ect For this modpack?
[4:52:32] atamala: it's a strongarm move by reddit
[4:52:35] brightcandle: The official app is really bad
[4:52:35] LsTheRoberto: A user can do 1000 calls in like no time
[4:52:36] Stormflare: its to force the official app where they get ad revenue and user data
[4:52:40] ZukaZamam3e: apollo is fantastic
[4:52:41] Obliviron: There are companies for whom those api prices will still turn a profit, reddit knows this, so they do it @Giantwaffle
[4:52:41] VanDomand: What is apollo?
[4:52:43] pt0ughneigh: The default app is almost unusable sometimes
[4:52:45] Nexhunter: with the amount of calls Apollo makes
[4:52:45] GamingGoggs: What app did you use to download this mod pack?
[4:52:45] krrynn: I always wanted to use Apollo but it's not on android Sadge
[4:52:47] lykenew: Apple featured Apollo in their WWDC 2023 show too smh
[4:52:47] Nexhunter: it not unreasonable
[4:52:49] BrickDickJr: @Giantwaffle whats apollo?
[4:52:51] That_Lurker: @Giantwaffle And they only gave 30 days notice
[4:52:51] drummernerd: was literally called out in apples presentation LUL
[4:52:53] Dagmoo: @bleu_forge yeah but thats why other execs even consider charging for API calls
[4:52:58] JoniSusi: @Allmostdone imgur charges 166 dollars for the same api callout amount
[4:52:59] unnoticedx: reddits worth was cut wasn't it?
[4:53:06] StardustDragon08: It might not be unreasonable but it is certainly unaffordable
[4:53:08] enki1337: iirc it's like 500x higher than imgur api call rates
[4:53:11] LazloHo: Does anyone know, couldn't an app be developed that just skins reddit but has the user make the calls?
[4:53:17] NetAssetz: The Apollo dev works for Apple
[4:53:18] Stormflare: charging for API calls isnt the issue, thats pretty standard. its the amount they are charging, its like 50x normal rate
[4:53:20] Ekanae: what's their reason for the increase of API cost ?
[4:53:21] brightcandle: Reddit becomes Digg
[4:53:22] Dagmoo: @bleu_forge at least at this high a rate
[4:53:23] Allmostdone: sorry I've handled bigger contract for much smaller software
[4:53:24] Bleu_Forge: Dagmoo nah, I guarantee this was in their plans before Elon pulled the trigger on it
[4:53:35] HeyAFrozenZebra: Interesting that a lot of companies are all making shit business decisions all at the same time
[4:53:36] That_Lurker: @Giantwaffle Theres no way other apps can change the core of the apps in 30 days reddit gave them
[4:53:36] ninopanda: what is apollo?
[4:53:42] angberg: Is there a sub server? @Giantwaffle
[4:53:47] MarquesCoding: Just make your own reddit xD
[4:53:48] StardustDragon08: @ninopanda 3rd party reddit app
[4:53:49] tigerman1983: whats apallo
[4:53:51] Kardiiac: thats the point though, they want to get rid of 3rd party apps
[4:53:52] Stormflare: im ok with that twitter bots are mostly worthless
[4:53:53] ramzie0: but didn't do anything to the spam or porn bots
[4:53:54] ninopanda: oh
[4:53:55] Jibbur: I noticed a massive reduction in the crypto bots on twitter too around then
[4:54:04] daemonaedryn: Ahhh the good ol' slow self destruction all social media-ish apps are taking is weird
[4:54:05] Marenti: @ninopanda paid app on ios
[4:54:12] Obliviron: I wish Apollo showed how much profit they turn per quarter. It's probably not 2 million but it feels dishonest that they hid their profits
[4:54:15] ninopanda: i just use the default reddit app
[4:54:16] usernameNull: apollo makes it usable on iphone, Reddit is Fun makes it usable on andriod
[4:54:26] BaTu016: tbh default is better
[4:54:30] krrynn: hopefully they leave old.reddit alone COPIUM
[4:54:31] Obliviron: Just use old.reddit, it's still usable, don't use the new site
[4:54:33] Chalkstix: I've never used reddit
[4:54:35] snoipa__: any other recommended apps to use instead?
[4:54:37] KuramaTheF0X: yea KEKW
[4:54:39] ContaminationPoint: apollo is the only reason i can use reddit on mobile
[4:54:40] unnoticedx: why would they improve it, if people keep paying LUL
[4:54:41] Marenti: usernameNull there are others on android too :P
[4:54:41] ramzie0: I liked Sync for Reddit on android better that RIF
[4:54:50] Allmostdone: which ultimately that gives raise to better companies
[4:54:53] KuramaTheF0X: netflix did it better OMEGALUL
[4:54:57] Sloppy_D: They dont even separate subs and dubs
[4:54:58] kappathirteen: Yeah, navigating crunchyroll is the worst
[4:55:00] Nexhunter: intro skip isn't good though unless you have humans ensuring the skip isn't gonna actually skip
[4:55:01] daemonaedryn: wtf
[4:55:01] StardustDragon08: @Obliviron why does Apollo's profit matter though? Doesn't change the facts
[4:55:02] The_Outis: They don't do that anymore thankfully
[4:55:03] 0x4273: @Obliviron youre high if you dont think old reddit is getting the axe soon
[4:55:04] Stormflare: lol who decided that
[4:55:04] atamala: does this server have day/night turned off?
[4:55:05] Gh3ttoboy: I have seen a intro skip button on crunchyroll at times
[4:55:05] DareDeFlug: "Skip" really pisses me off the most
[4:55:06] maccabeus: crunchyroll posts spoilers on youtube like 3 days after an episode airs
[4:55:08] ZephMW: crunchyroll definitely does have an intro skip button, I clicked it about 12 min ago
[4:55:09] drummernerd: holy shit, it’s crazy he’s talking about how talks got ugly
[4:55:09] HeyAFrozenZebra: because Japan
[4:55:09] Jibbur: or you will see 1 season for a 10 year long show
[4:55:09] Doomwyte: when you are the king, why change? need some compitition to force change
[4:55:10] hellolilpiggy: they fixed the season thing
[4:55:13] gikei: haven't used crunchyroll since it started and saw how bad their subs were
[4:55:13] punkgeek: They used to mix sub and dub in one season, that was infuriating
[4:55:14] AGuyHighInTheSky: And that's why you don't pay for these services LUL
[4:55:14] MarquesCoding: I think it's because, waffle they'd have to rewrite their whole entire db / api for that
[4:55:15] Dannythebrill13: starting to think Crunchyroll doesn't have any UX designers KEKW
[4:55:20] Bbluess: lmao plex does better metadata management then all of them :D
[4:55:21] OddsTV: PSA: Got my Discord name change, im March 2016.
[4:55:22] MiesterTee: RIGHT
[4:55:23] Atzgee: 9anime
[4:55:24] Elso17: and there owned by sony
[4:55:25] DareDeFlug: There is
[4:55:26] The_Outis: I just use anilist
[4:55:29] Permarin1: @Giantwaffle did you hear that the opening song for Oshi No Ko made word wide top 1 as a song (excluding america) and even including america its top 6. the song is called Idol i do believe.
[4:55:30] BowTieGuy21: PLEX goated
[4:55:31] Eukee: on my anime website never skipped wrong LuL
[4:55:32] Nexhunter: do they even have the rights KEKW
[4:55:33] unnoticedx: @Bbluess plex Pog
[4:55:33] MinusKills: arrrr pirating is better KEKW
[4:55:37] TheEmperor30k: !gtnh
[4:55:37] Moobot: Pati and the crew are restarting GT: New Horizons because they are complete Chads. Waffle is playing until the Despairge sets in | Get the pack at gtnh.miraheze.org/wiki/Main_Page
[4:55:43] Obliviron: @StardustDragon08 it should change the pity people feel towards Apollo. Seems like Apollo left that out on purpose to manipulate the public response
[4:55:44] BlackNocturne: Passion project vs "corporate bottom line"
[4:55:44] MiesterTee: Same with poe @Giantwaffle OMEGALUL
[4:55:46] pwrreset: they bought funimation but most of they did not import subtitles from them
[4:55:50] Stormflare: because they outsource development overseas to shitty devs and designers
[4:55:51] TheRackster: Reddits video player is horrendous
[4:55:57] tristanzer0: They havent even removed the funimation intro from some of the anime they got from them like claymore
[4:55:58] babyaddalyn: greed
[4:55:59] StardustDragon08: @Obliviron It wouldn't at all
[4:56:02] j_bar111: @Giantwaffle are you watching the game fest stuff in 30 min?
[4:56:04] Deyril: crunchyroll "fixed" that in germany by removing the french and spanish language options
[4:56:05] TigerLuv: did something explode?
[4:56:06] MarquesCoding: api's should be free man.
[4:56:06] Obliviron: @0x4273 i dont really care to be honest, my life will improve when they axe old.reddit and i stop using it hopefully lol
[4:56:08] HeyAFrozenZebra: And all the reddit mods use 3rd party apps to moderate because reddit's default modding tolls are shit
[4:56:21] Jovi1246: the calendar is not the schedule? on crunchyroll?
[4:56:24] DemonicHell3: you mean this waffle? https://www.crunchyroll.com/simulcastcalendar
[4:56:27] 0x4273: its called enshitification. the experience is made worse and worse over time to please the investors
[4:56:28] NewFallout: Pushing Users to go back to age of P2P
[4:56:29] Obliviron: @StardustDragon08 maybe you're right, the userbase on reddit is so dumb. They're not even asking these questions and they're trying to host blackouts lmao
[4:56:31] Allmostdone: yep they absorbed Funmation
[4:56:33] Stormflare: i work in manufactureing tech and our major client outsources their ERP software development to india. maybe 10% of their devs are worth anything
[4:56:41] StardustDragon08: @Obliviron Manipulate public response? You can't be serious
[4:56:41] TheWonderLlama: Crunchyroll is obviously designed to get max unique page views. Someones bonus most likely relies on that single metric
[4:56:44] Stormflare: i did not mean to @tech there lol
[4:56:50] Chalkstix: 85% sounds like really high fuel efficiency
[4:57:07] Obliviron: @StardustDragon08 literally everyone does this, from individuals, to small projects, to companies, any public post is perspective
[4:57:07] ピッザダディ: @Giantwaffle 3 minutes before the preshow for summer game fest
[4:57:18] MinusKills: @Giantwaffle last 3mins for game fest btw
[4:57:21] KuramaTheF0X: millibucket yea
[4:57:27] StardustDragon08: @Obliviron Right but in this case they're not out to get you
[4:57:34] KuramaTheF0X: 1000L = 1 bucket
[4:57:36] Allmostdone: Only 10% are worth usign from India? I was expecting /hoping for more
[4:57:43] Nexhunter: wrong thing
[4:57:47] ピッザダディ: preshow has some minor announcements
[4:57:48] enki1337: this guy trying to OneGuy us
[4:57:51] j_bar111: @Giantwaffle are you watching the game fest stuff in 30 min? 󠀀
[4:57:56] フリクリ: small games r cool
[4:58:02] thisisbrad: which one is devolver one? the only good one really
[4:58:03] MiesterTee: name jeff KEKW
[4:58:04] tronb: same LUL
[4:58:07] Eukee: will kojima be there?
[4:58:10] Trawls421: RIP incontrol
[4:58:16] kappathirteen: What was the one game show with the skit from last year?
[4:58:17] SickSniprz: i went to school with a Geoff hahaha
[4:58:23] Nexhunter: @thisisbrad they are independent but usually timed around most of the E3 stuff
[4:58:27] Obliviron: @StardustDragon08 of course, but they don't need to be out to get me to be dishonest and spin a perspective. It's a for-granted in these things, I don't feel offended it's just sad looking at naive people not even be curious about Apollo earnings and think that high prices for API calls is a bad decision on reddit part.
[4:58:33] KuramaTheF0X: you can run 10 of them with that 1 boiler
[4:58:34] Gh3ttoboy: So about 10 steam things
[4:58:38] thisisbrad: @Nexhunter thats later this weekend right?
[4:58:53] StardustDragon08: @Obliviron I'm not curious because it doesn't matter. There is no way they'd be able to afford it
[4:59:00] Blockmann317: Waffle have you done and Swift development? Could be fun a thing to try in Streamvember this year
[4:59:22] StardustDragon08: @Blockmann317 can be tricky without a Mac
[4:59:37] thisisbrad: ok to answer my own question;  June 8 3PT/6ET, the Devolver Direct will be streamed as part of Summer Game Fest
[4:59:38] Moobot: You can find Waffle's Youtube channel here - https://youtube.com/giantwaffle
[4:59:38] kane1941: with cable loss you have like a full amp wasted
[4:59:44] enki1337: dude's calling millions of people idiots, and can't do basic math... ICANT
[4:59:48] Nexhunter: yea you can
[4:59:49] Thee_Buddha: My brother on discord Jan 2016 no nitro got his name change today
[4:59:50] ZephMW: Transfer rate per tick is 1/2 the pipe capacity
[4:59:53] Nexhunter: swift can be compiled on linux
[4:59:56] HeyAFrozenZebra: Complie in Vision Pro
[5:00:02] sleepymisaki: also on windows
[5:00:03] Marenti: 3Head need to have mac to compile swift
[5:00:06] Blockmann317: @StardustDragon08 and? An air would be sick man, you should get one
[5:00:08] Allmostdone: Swift isn't just apple
[5:00:10] Obliviron: @StardustDragon08 it's dishonest to disclude it, but yeah if they could afford it they wouldn't shut down
[5:00:11] Vexedly: Hello
[5:00:13] DemonicHell3: Did you hear Woopi Goldberg is pissed at blizzard because she can't play diablo 4 on her mac lol
[5:00:15] Nexhunter: no
[5:00:16] TheIrishGuy: you do
[5:00:17] Twister1M: no
[5:00:17] Marenti: I thought so too
[5:00:18] Blockmann317: I thought you did as well
[5:00:18] Nexhunter: swift is OOS
[5:00:21] Nexhunter: OSS*
[5:00:26] BeornTheChief: VM
[5:00:27] StardustDragon08: @Blockmann317 Oh for sure. Not hating I use Macs LUL
[5:00:28] sleepymisaki: you need a mac to test apps for iOS etc
[5:00:29] LeBeauTV: PepeLaugh
[5:00:29] Nexhunter: apple isn't locking swift to just macos dev
[5:00:30] Vexedly: Buy a $500 Macbook Pro 15-in off eBay from 2016
[5:00:31] drummernerd: to build an app you need a Mac
[5:00:34] Allmostdone: Nope
[5:00:35] Nexhunter: if you want to make it run on iOS
[5:00:38] EZL1190: There is an ISO image you can run in a VM to you can use
[5:00:39] Nexhunter: or ipad what then yes
[5:00:41] StardustDragon08: @Obliviron It's not though
[5:00:44] Nexhunter: but if just running as a server
[5:00:44] drummernerd: but swift will compile anywhere
[5:00:44] Obliviron: you probably need a mac to have a reasonable dev experience though, so i'm sure you need a mac anyways @Giantwaffle LuL
[5:00:56] Nexhunter: swift can be used as a non apple app
[5:00:56] BADboiz_TV: Math in Gregtech makes me smile and nod like I know what going on daddyd33CHUNGUS
[5:00:58] Tech: No
[5:01:00] Vexedly: It makes it a hell of a lot easier
[5:01:01] Jibbur: I would expect you need a mac to test it on
[5:01:03] Marenti: Hmm true
[5:01:03] sleepymisaki: apple apps yea, swift no
[5:01:04] drummernerd: to make apps, yes. to compile swift, no
[5:01:04] Tech: That's what I said yesterday LUL
[5:01:05] TheIrishGuy: You need apple ID to upload to store
[5:01:10] Obliviron: @StardustDragon08 trust me the majority of relevant info is included or excluded thoughtfully, not absentmindedly, in these kinds of posts
[5:01:12] Sloppy_D: Is Swift even used anymore?
[5:01:12] TheRealGahlfe: @Vexedly backmarket is also good, i got a 2015 macbook pro for like $350
[5:01:13] bensmcc: Swift is a language you can use for whatever. But if you wanna make a mac app or iOS you need a mac. As far as I know
[5:01:17] BilusTheTiny: the debug experience must be pain, why use swift at this point
[5:01:21] MisterRabbitHead: then who coded the first mac hmm
[5:01:23] StardustDragon08: @Obliviron I don't trust you.
[5:01:23] Nexhunter: https://github.com/apple/swift
[5:01:26] Allmostdone: No you can ue windows to publish you ar the developer
[5:01:28] Obliviron: @StardustDragon08 your loss
[5:01:38] daemonaedryn: KEKW
[5:01:42] Tech: You should still get a mac
[5:01:43] Tech: for dev
[5:01:45] MarquesCoding: I'm unsure if hackintosh's can sign mac apps
[5:01:46] Nexhunter: you still do if you want to make iOS apps etc
[5:01:46] drummernerd: you still need one
[5:01:48] LuminescentLlama: swift sucks, theres plenty better options
[5:01:48] Obliviron: macs are actually good
[5:01:49] StardustDragon08: @Obliviron Doesn't seem like much of a loss
[5:01:52] MarquesCoding: or ios apps
[5:01:56] destroyer_ted89: Do the other players in this server also stream on Twitch?
[5:01:56] Tech: For development
[5:01:58] DragonApoc: Macs are still the best to develop with
[5:01:59] aundros: Can't really game much on a mac right?
[5:02:02] Nexhunter: @MarquesCoding they can but it difficult to get anything now of days given the split from arm
[5:02:02] snoipa__: get a beefed out mac studio
[5:02:02] Obliviron: you get ripped off in terms of hardware value, but the build quality is really good
[5:02:03] Tech: Use it for development
[5:02:06] Obliviron: and that's what matters in a laptop
[5:02:08] Dannythebrill13: app development streams? PauseChamp
[5:02:10] Obliviron: what tech is saying
[5:02:12] Nexhunter: also hackintosh are basically dead given the ARM move KEKW
[5:02:14] StardustDragon08: @aundros that might be changing
[5:02:14] thepolaroidbear: MacBook air to develop your stream overlay? Kappa
[5:02:17] Stormflare: why are macs better for development? because of unix?
[5:02:18] aundros: summer game fest just went live with pre-show
[5:02:20] sleepymisaki: just say streaming pc PepoThink
[5:02:22] Obliviron: and the M chips have good battery life
[5:02:22] Marenti: use it as a mouse mat Kappa
[5:02:24] MarquesCoding: @Nexhunter I personally don't see the point of a hackintosh, just buy a mac xD
[5:02:27] SheepsAholy: stream off it for a yeah YEP
[5:02:31] Shroadie: didnt summerfest start?
[5:02:31] SheepsAholy: year*
[5:02:32] Chalkstix: how good a reason do you need to write it off as business expense?
[5:02:33] sosu_pivo228: !gtnh
[5:02:34] Moobot: Pati and the crew are restarting GT: New Horizons because they are complete Chads. Waffle is playing until the Despairge sets in | Get the pack at gtnh.miraheze.org/wiki/Main_Page
[5:02:37] Tech: You don't even need a reason to write it off if you use it for making apps that have anything to do with stream
[5:02:39] GFQPR1882: EZ Mac book fireplace in background YEP @giantwaffle
[5:02:41] Bbluess: @Giantwaffle check the charcoal production
[5:02:41] Nexhunter: @MarquesCoding before when it was intel based it was a way to reduce costs but now well you can't KEKW
[5:02:51] lgamer7: summer game fest starts in 30 minutes: https://store.steampowered.com/sale/summer_announcements_2023
[5:02:52] the_rapley: can pipes move that much steam
[5:03:02] GuardMoony: audio controle laptop? :D
[5:03:02] fanta_x_thomas: 28 minutes  mctcliSmile
[5:03:03] NetAssetz: biiiig problem - tax accountant
[5:03:05] Tech: The only stipulation is you should only use it for business
[5:03:05] DragonApoc: Video editing for YouTube ?
[5:03:06] DaddyDiddy: potin
[5:03:07] NetAssetz: don't give a thread to pull on
[5:03:12] Tech: Which is easy, because it would be your dev machien
[5:03:15] Obliviron: How can they determine it wasn't used for the business if you literally use it to code for stream though?
[5:03:17] ZephMW: pipes can move half of their capacity per tick
[5:03:18] mahoraz: steal pipes? Kappa
[5:03:19] Chalkstix: do streamers actually get audited?
[5:03:21] the_rapley: ive been following you for 10 years in dec
[5:03:28] Neonliquidsentertainments: Looks like ducting
[5:03:30] bobolpwnz: potin pipes are better
[5:03:33] Allmostdone: well Apple is offically movign away from Intel chipset
[5:03:34] 0x4273: Look up potin
[5:03:35] Nexhunter: @Obliviron it has to be used for a majority of your business not for fun
[5:03:38] MarquesCoding: @Nexhunter I just do personal dev work on my work M2 xD
[5:03:42] MisterRabbitHead: stop writing off wheels of cheese and you are good
[5:03:47] ZephMW: You're more than maxing it out already
[5:03:51] razborsek: Thats 9,6 buckets per second?
[5:03:53] Nexhunter: @Allmostdone you a bit late there bud KEKW
[5:03:54] ZephMW: rate is not capacity
[5:03:57] ZephMW: it's half of it
[5:04:05] MarquesCoding: I mean a macbook air is what $1200?
[5:04:07] ZephMW: that's another reason to get off steam
[5:04:14] Neonliquidsentertainments: Bottle necks
[5:04:17] Jibbur: 15000 > 9600
[5:04:30] Allmostdone: @Nexhunter Yea just woke up. Listenning to Waffle thinking he has to have a mac
[5:04:42] Obliviron: @Nexhunter I thought that was only for spaces not for items oh i guess that makes sense then, but probably would be hard for IRS to argue fun when waffle is a streamer and when his personal gaming time would be on a windows
[5:04:49] Nexhunter: @Allmostdone well if he wants to build for iOS yea
[5:04:55] Neonliquidsentertainments: Slowly getting it updated
[5:05:03] ChairmanN8: Treefroggy123 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 8 months, currently on a 3 month streak! 
[5:05:07] Hegberr: @ZephMW it transfers half of that 2 times per sec... so rate is capacity
[5:05:16] Nexhunter: @Obliviron items also account cause of the '18 tax changes the rules are much more stricter for home office deductions
[5:05:43] Nexhunter: @Obliviron which like 90% of home office deduction was killed anyways so only self employed home office stuff is left so it really gets into the is it for business or personal
[5:05:44] Allmostdone: @Nexhunter It's honestly not a big expensive the wife just bought the latest macbook air
[5:06:22] Nexhunter: @Allmostdone my 3k KEKW MBP says otherwise
[5:06:30] Obliviron: @Nexhunter that really sucks, it's hard to even declare anything now
[5:06:32] AleXanDreMau: @Giantwaffle the game awars twitch is Up!
[5:06:37] Nexhunter: @Allmostdone but that also a m1 max with 32gb of ram and a 1tb drive KEKW
[5:06:39] TKM26: yes KEKW
[5:06:40] Mintaz: you can switch orger of teh fluids
[5:06:51] SailorWS: ReallyMad empty the stuff you put in the smeltery
[5:06:55] LuciferSpirt: KEKW time to mine lead
[5:07:02] Apparentthreat: @Nexhunter now remind everyone that you're a dev and not a tax expert
[5:07:10] Allmostdone: @Nexthunter she just needed a laptop and she loves mac's
[5:07:11] Obliviron: yeah my 3k m2 was worth it too, it's expensive but i remember i had an old macbook which lasted like 7 years and windows laptops last like 2 - 3
[5:07:15] LuminescentLlama: 42 stacks
[5:07:22] Nexhunter: @Apparentthreat im  a tax expert on what fucked me over as a remote worker Stare
[5:07:23] mathew2802: Why don't you void the liquids in the semetery
[5:07:24] LuminescentLlama: 42 stacks or uninstall xD
[5:07:24] Neonliquidsentertainments: Stored liquids in a vendor style storage
[5:07:33] Apparentthreat: @Nexhunter Stare
[5:07:42] Nexhunter: @Apparentthreat and that i fucking despise that congress and the congress in the 80s that exempted pros from OT Stare
[5:07:42] Moobot: Come join the Waffle House Discord! <# https://discord.gg/fhGFtMuzdS
[5:07:45] Neonliquidsentertainments: Tanks
[5:07:54] mathew2802: Void liquids in it @giantwaffle
[5:08:05] mathew2802: ?
[5:08:09] Penca53: Did the backup just say 27GB?
[5:08:17] FarmPeaches_FreePalestine: whose watching the le Mans race this weekend lirikHAPPY
[5:08:27] Apparentthreat: @Nexhunter HUH
[5:08:36] zero3juan: last pipe doesn't have an arrow?
[5:08:37] ZephMW: The grinder doesn't use much. the pipe is only transferring about 1/2 the steam you're using
[5:08:38] Neonliquidsentertainments: Can you send liquid in different directions, depending on material
[5:08:54] SailorWS: its per sec not per tick?
[5:08:56] Mintaz: czułem że to wykorzystasz
[5:08:58] SailorWS: does that matter
[5:09:00] ZephMW: Nope can't force it w/ pump
[5:09:15] Hegberr: yes
[5:09:18] cosmicblip: stream starts soon hype
[5:09:18] bobolpwnz: transfer = capacity/2
[5:09:20] Dannythebrill13: yes
[5:09:39] Hegberr: it transfers half of its capasity 2 times per sec... so rate is capacity
[5:09:47] Jibbur: capacity and /sec mean that something weird is going on with that statement...
[5:09:56] razborsek: Are those conduits slower than these steel pipes?
[5:10:29] Blockmann317: my username is so bad man, got it on discord though lmfao. Feel like its so hard to change my username on stuff at this point
[5:10:29] ZephMW: The steel pipes are bottlenecking your steam transfer. You're only transferring 4800/sec to the buffer
[5:10:34] meller127: whats the output rate at the tank?
[5:10:47] biggerginger: upgradeing them orange pipe would be better
[5:10:49] nAZAr1uS: pipe buffer?
[5:10:53] ZephMW: Because the transfer rate of the pipes is half of the capacity per second @Giantwaffle
[5:10:58] Jibbur: @ZephMW 4800 twice per second I thought
[5:11:07] locowaffl3: hi
[5:11:15] Hegberr: Yes thank you Jibbur
[5:11:31] Jibbur: @Giantwaffle the transfer rate is half the capacity but twice per second
[5:11:47] KuramaTheF0X: BRUH
[5:11:48] Hegberr: it transfers half of its capasity 2 times per sec... so rate is capacity

[5:12:06] SailorWS: too long didnt read
[5:12:06] KuramaTheF0X: rather look up a wiki at this point yourself
[5:12:14] Neonliquidsentertainments: Ai it
[5:12:16] ZephMW: The quick solution is switch to potin for now and get off steam and onto gas asap
[5:12:18] KuramaTheF0X: cant trust chat
[5:12:31] GFQPR1882: KEKW
[5:12:36] DoubleOughtNot: Just like the real world.

[5:12:42] jayrickson87: Per sec or per tick?
[5:12:43] Vestitude: YEP
[5:12:45] Apple22: YEP
[5:12:48] Stormflare: this modpack is 8 years old??
[5:12:48] bobolpwnz: gtnh wiki is up-to-date
[5:12:48] Obliviron: yes
[5:12:49] ZephMW: The wiki for this pack is super well maintained fyi
[5:12:54] mdsooter: wouldnt be gregtech if it made sense
[5:12:55] Obliviron: the wiki is probably fine
[5:12:55] AGuyHighInTheSky: That's like trusting a code comment on a 8 year old codebase monkaW
[5:12:59] aundros: a wiki on a modpack under constant development?
[5:13:04] ordinary_osu: this modpack is 1.7.10 lol
[5:13:05] CeeDreamer: SGF starting now?
[5:13:06] Nexhunter: @VivyInTheSky OMEGALUL hey now
[5:13:15] thisisbrad: id expect people that play this shit to also be wiki crusaders
[5:13:15] Printer_Man: which version of the pack?
[5:13:21] KuramaTheF0X: some act like nobody plays this modpack actively
[5:13:24] punkgeek: Updating documentation is not usually a priority for modders
[5:13:26] GFQPR1882: I can
[5:13:28] GFQPR1882: KEKW
[5:13:28] Neonliquidsentertainments: Tune it
[5:13:28] Printer_Man: I can
[5:13:30] Allmostdone: Do the havw some sort of test tool in game?
[5:13:32] zero3juan: missing a down arrow on a generator
[5:13:41] AGuyHighInTheSky: @Nexhunter You know some lazy ass developer didn't bother updating it, after revising the code many times
[5:13:41] MinusKills: progress PeepoClap
[5:14:02] GFQPR1882: PauseChamp
[5:14:03] GamingGoggs: When is the costream meant to happen?
[5:14:03] Neonliquidsentertainments: It’s fun watching you rip it apart to get to the goal gg
[5:14:13] Nexhunter: @VivyInTheSky tbh who hasn't KEKW
[5:14:13] MUHFUGGIN: Blood monkaS
[5:14:17] That_Lurker: anyone got the link to the wiki?
[5:14:21] Seananigans_13: why tf is it 1.7.10
[5:14:25] Jibbur: hasn't this pack been under development for more than half of minecrafts lifespan
[5:14:25] CeeDreamer: Are you gonna watch SGF on stream today?
[5:14:33] Printer_Man: because rendering changed post 1.7.10
[5:14:33] Nexhunter: @Seananigans_13 cause it took that long to develop KEKW
[5:14:36] GFQPR1882: waffleD
[5:14:38] ImmaWizard_: @Neonliquidsentertainments only thing he is ripping apart is his sanity
[5:14:51] ordinary_osu: @Seananigans_13 developer of gregtech didn't want to update past 1.8 because modding changed a lot and he would have to change things around
[5:14:57] NovemberCo: is there any fuel for the smelter that melts quicker?
[5:15:02] CeeDreamer: Oh ok cool. Thank you Waffle you’re a boss man
[5:15:03] Neonliquidsentertainments: Nooo he is 🥰
[5:15:19] xCutie: ngl couldnt find any cool discord usernames so took crossdressed
[5:15:21] KuramaTheF0X: @Seananigans_13 many devs quit around 1.8 and 1.13 cause it just broke too much of their work
[5:15:21] Ryanpete4: What have been your favorite mod packs to play over the years?
[5:15:26] xCutie: Kappa
[5:15:31] DemonicHell3: the second we use the EBF it kills it

[5:15:52] TogglesLore: 15 mins
[5:16:05] ZephMW: FYI *Straight off the GTNH Wiki* "GT Pipes do NOT work on their own. They require a pump or a block that auto-outputs fluids, like Boilers. Fluid pipes can be broken with a Wrench; hold down left-click. The throughput of a pipe is half its capacity. Fluids will slosh back and forth inside pipes."
[5:16:09] officialhunterx: afk
[5:16:16] bballaustin: hes eating
[5:16:21] CowofJustice: Pierogi time
[5:16:24] broseph_larz: letMeCi

[5:16:39] ZephMW: as I stated before chat, fluid transfer rate is 1/2 the pipe capacity. regardless of how often it updates
[5:16:39] Dannythebrill13: Did someone say Peroni?
[5:16:41] cosmicblip: mk1 gameplay will be dope to see today

[5:16:52] LastWarriorKing: waffleHey Chat
[5:17:11] Rhink: Make blocks, break it down?
[5:17:14] AGuyHighInTheSky: can't you pour a block instead of ingots?
[5:17:20] AGuyHighInTheSky: ah
[5:17:24] MisterRabbitHead: I keep getting disconnected from chat HUH @Tech ReallyMad
[5:17:29] Stormflare: churn
[5:17:30] Venamah: you can with a cutting saw

[5:18:05] Cmdr_Void: cutting saw too
[5:18:06] broseph_larz: waffleWave PETPET
[5:18:10] Rampage_eM: To turn to blocks then some other crap to turn into ingots
[5:18:35] ZephMW: Arc furnace is just for recycling blocks. Use an alloy smelter with an ingot mold @Giantwaffle
[5:18:40] biggerginger: how hard is it to make a battery so you can store up power and not just steam ?
[5:18:50] Opalak: @Mandorake Yes, when the event starts in 12 minutes.

[5:22:04] ZephMW: Craft a basic pump and slap it over an oil spout and throw that into a super tank. Take it back to base, distillery it into Light Fuel (a few step process) and use that to power your base and you won't end up using stacks and stacks of ingots on pipes
[5:22:09] Neonliquidsentertainments: Gg

[6:17:10] TogglesLore: So they are like epic was with paragon?
[6:17:10] Nexhunter: cause your previous company will come for your ass quickly
[6:17:10] KuramaTheF0X: their argument was "its impossible to make a game like this in such a short amount of time"
[6:17:12] TheGrumpieGnome: i hope thats like the old shadowrun pvp game
[6:17:12] palagrim_: Think they claimed Dark and Darker is using nexon assets

[6:17:31] MrHashbrowns: what was the response?
[6:17:32] Nibler: to be fair, the game probably was garbage with nexon's name attached

[6:17:46] LongestMoney: DL2 fell off
[6:17:46] arkun_: It’s pretty grey area stuff, like Dark and Darker even torrented their future content in response to the C&D
[6:17:46] Leeroy_LF: when you work for a company like that does the company not own everything you make?
[6:17:49] s_DeXTeR_s: its some of items from Unreal Engine Store
[6:17:49] HumbleMetal: I wish DL2 was better than it is
[6:17:52] Nexhunter: @TrevorVictrus dark and darker devs claim innocence but we gotta wait for court
[6:17:56] ArJacksonn: well we haven't seen anything on it since those initial comments, i'd wager they have something legal wise or we'd be hearing more about it
[6:17:58] Skorpio1: trust me bro ™
[6:17:59] SheepsAholy: the funny thing is, they said they owned all the assets and then the D&D team called them out showing each and every asset was public available
