[3:23:47] ayowhatups: at this point they may delay the rest until tmrw ._.
[3:23:48] zugrwow: @itsMuter 3 at the beginning, 8 at the shooter phase
[3:23:48] SunCat_game: 10 scuffed
[3:23:51] itsMuter: Classic minecraft event
[3:23:53] dait0z: Time to find some impossible jumps on the map FeelsAmazingMan
[3:23:53] OgrehLOL: i would just divide the rivals into  2 or 4 lobbys
[3:23:57] TheRealZimmShady: @itsMuter they are playing twitch_rivals.ppt
[3:24:01] Sylverize_: siesta is wild 😭😭😭
[3:24:02] rickenn: you could easily split the lobbies to 50 ppl each for this minigame
[3:24:03] shahheet85: @SmallAnt 1 million on a server HUH
[3:24:05] kot7k: @itsMuter honestly only the 3rd event was REALLYYY scuffed, the rest was pretty acceptable
[3:24:05] blobserr: @itsMuter rivals standard its a 4 lol
[3:24:05] BlueOrSo: main stream essentially saying "its fucked but atleast its fucked equally for everyone"

[3:24:39] skellicious: the delay between rounds is so bad too
[3:24:40] shahheet85: OMG the combat one after this is going to be super scuffed as well with everyone trying to jump crit
[3:24:45] Dasher_512: @SmallAnt tubbo spent 1mil for the server that no one ever played? thats extremely unfortunate
[3:24:47] feinbergfan12: what if dasnerth got added to block wars
[3:24:47] occobo: and they sent fruit to the gulag
[3:24:49] starlitfires: @Candypat i would take that at this point, give me more AA time

[4:50:23] scrambIedegg6: @KYLIE4EVR CokeShakey
[4:50:25] Dushan__: It's because of the armor trims?

[4:50:55] gamerscore78: @CurtisDN_ its mainly the armor trim advancements
[4:50:57] CurtisDN_: the only thing worse about 1.19+ hdwgh is warden transport

[4:51:17] bigboyeyalkes: did you get back your aa addiction ?
[4:51:41] Jaaxful: they should change rates for 1.20 to be same as 1.16
[4:51:46] Jaaxful: would make running so much more fun
[4:52:03] oll1ewatchesstreams: if we arent talking about the new advancements because they always add that. they have worse piglin trades+brutes, and strongholds generate farther down
[4:52:05] cinderose_: benex just got full netherite armor wr on 1.20 which is pretty dope
[4:52:05] CurtisDN_: as far as versions of AA go post-1.16, 1.19 is prolly the coolest one. but nothings ever gonna be as good as 1.16
[4:52:11] the_mmx: Also adventuring time in aa requires all 53 overworld biomes
[4:52:28] the_yuukster: is there a clip for context what fruit did in rivals 💀

[4:52:54] Jaaxful: 1.16 i mean
[4:52:56] the_yuukster: thanks Lion
[4:53:00] the_yuukster: :3
[4:53:07] oll1ewatchesstreams: they made like deserts more rare in 1.20 it seems but some rare biomes more common
[4:53:10] CurtisDN_: in 1.18+ its like, less total of biomes because they combined birch hills and regular birch and shit like that, but its more kinds of biomes that you need
