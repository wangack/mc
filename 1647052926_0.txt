[2:05:39] DarkJesterProductions: @SymphonicSky Honestly?  Don't know.  Haven't seen enough about it.  I'd suggest trying out 3 Houses first, as it's the most readily available one atm.
[2:06:19] SymphonicSky: @DarkJesterProductions Thanks for the suggestion. kara7
[2:06:49] DarkJesterProductions: Just remember that 3 Houses isn't a "typical" Fire Emblem game; in previous installments, you basically moved around a map, rather than selecting battles, there were also no "intermissions" in the Academy in prior installments.  karaPop
