[0:33:27] Moobot: Try one of these: !mc_modpack ー !factorio ー !bestmod ー !ksp ー !rimworld
[0:33:27] Apparentthreat: !mc_pack
[0:33:27] Moobot: Waffle is playing Nomifactory (GTCEu Port) | https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/nomi-ceu | Already missing one deadline, will the bois be able to beat it by NYE 2023? Tune in to every stream to find out! pepeLaugh
[0:33:34] officialhunterx: i  mean your playing a java game right now
[0:33:37] fbritoferreira: Cobal is the highest paid job btw
[0:33:38] ChromaCym: Yeah there's absolutely no reason for new programmers to go into COBOL
[0:33:39] OrangeW2: yeah my dad used COBOL, he's retired and 67 or some shit
[0:33:43] Glacial_Indifference: And those were the panic devs from the Y2k scare.
[0:33:44] Francisco_Scaramanga: Banks still run it
[0:33:44] xDeadBringerx: @shame625 Pretentious? I choose the terminal because I hate having to learn the user interface for multiple text editors and IDEs. Also doing interactive rebases for fixups, rewords etc are easier from term
[0:33:45] Nexhunter: https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/zos-basic-skills?topic=zos-programming-languages-mainframe here the list of languages the modern IBM mainframes support
[0:33:46] Nexhunter: YEP
[0:33:47] MixOnTwitch: My dad taught me Cobal as a kid because i used to bug him about what he was doing
[0:33:49] Allmostdone: nope VAX machine only
[0:33:55] Nexhunter: it wont
[0:33:59] Glacial_Indifference: Rust peppT
[0:34:03] Francisco_Scaramanga: yep
[0:34:03] Frodosc1: @Giantwaffle what's the plan after this modpack?
[0:34:03] Ghandus: javascript
[0:34:05] fbritoferreira: That’s what rust is doing to must systems
[0:34:06] Helo_KiX: @joe_romania I went to NC State and took the class he was talking about
[0:34:07] Nexhunter: IBM z/OS supports COBOL still and will never drop support
[0:34:07] ChromaCym: It's because all the old people know the codebase and how things are strung together, not that it's hard to know the language
[0:34:09] kinglouisxvii: AI dev will do it
[0:34:09] SimonSez: It will cost billions of dollars
[0:34:12] TelRehiad: widePepeLaugh they have tried that before
[0:34:13] s_DeXTeR_s: is this Secret Sunday Stream?
[0:34:17] officialhunterx: that will be insane cause everything will break
[0:34:17] novicio_: replaced with python
[0:34:25] coolcake2: Good morning
[0:34:30] Allmostdone: best of luck get rid of things like Cobal and fortran
[0:34:32] Nexhunter: @CJS7070 it also optimization with mainframes that cobol has over other languages
[0:34:33] l3lackmoses: they'll replace it with python widePepeLaugh
[0:34:39] mechoriet: widePepeLaugh don't check the inputs
[0:34:39] officialhunterx: polyclay check
[0:34:41] DX_Plates: They'll outsource it to ChatGPT5 and thats how Skynet takes over. LuL
[0:34:41] NevaDaha: oh a sunday stream
[0:34:47] fbritoferreira: They should replace most systems with oss software so it’s maintained by the community
[0:34:47] WestsideGecko: Did you ever use those draconic energy crystals?
[0:34:50] wagad: one is on ender pearls
[0:34:59] frainsbreeze: you will catch up with the lair data till you craft half of the hearts
[0:34:59] ChromaCym: @Nexhunter Yeah I believe that. I just think that people that see "learn COBOL and rake in the cash!" is not really the silver bullet people think it is lol
[0:35:05] karsb23: Its endermans
[0:35:05] wagad: bottom left
[0:35:16] wagad: PAti
[0:35:23] Probni4ek: PAti
[0:35:26] wagad: ME?
[0:35:27] mechoriet: eaten KEKW
[0:35:34] That0neGeye: You need like 5 million pearls
[0:35:35] deandosss: Getting used for things, you need millions of enderpearls
[0:35:39] Looma: ender cookies
[0:35:40] frainsbreeze: drives
[0:35:41] kane1941: you need like 6000k
[0:35:41] mechoriet: KEKW PATI
[0:35:44] ThatOnneGuy: ItIsWhatItIs
[0:35:45] Zintaris: ItIsWhatItIs
[0:35:47] Nexhunter: @CJS7070 oh yea it shouldn't be like that but if you can understand COBOL structure and unique setups then you can easily translate into another language but that costs money KEKW
[0:35:57] Pati: whatd i do again?
[0:35:57] ChromaCym: Trueeee
[0:36:02] JommyBee: never finishing in 3 days KEKW
[0:36:04] DaddyDiddy: but you also need it for LV generators and stuff for tier 1 micro miners to be sent
[0:36:23] Glacial_Indifference: You did need some for other stuff.
[0:36:32] deandosss: @pi
[0:36:32] Moobot: You can sub to Waffle by clicking this neat link -> twitch.tv/giantwaffle/subscribe SUBprise
[0:36:40] frainsbreeze: you don'T need to triple this....till you craft half of the ingots, this will catch up
[0:36:43] xlpants: OnlyDragons
[0:36:45] deandosss: @piratepati tell him why we need this many ender pearls
[0:36:47] Nexhunter: also who the fuck said vax danHuh
[0:36:58] GrumpyEngineer: make it faster first
[0:37:05] Nexhunter: @Allmostdone tobiiiSus why do you bring up DEC tobiiiSus
[0:37:26] officialhunterx: circuits where giving issues last night
[0:37:34] Mandorake: waffle is the manager who asks you to come into work on your day off
[0:37:38] Frodosc1: what's the plan after this modpack waffle
[0:37:44] mechoriet: also dedicated circuit passive making
[0:37:52] DaddyDiddy: lowest it'll go for ender dragon is 2 tick
[0:37:52] TelRehiad: dragon vs enderman
[0:37:52] TheUnrealOculus: more cables
[0:37:54] Purecrew: Did you guys ever resolve your power output from the orb or still using 12 draconic conduit outputs?
[0:38:08] Jaydepps00: java guy is back KEKW
[0:38:27] CoolReal: Where is he
[0:38:39] memothegreat: put one each side pls
[0:38:46] frainsbreeze: maybe first try setting up the system to craft half of the ingots
[0:38:56] ピッザダディ: waffleWave
[0:39:02] thePier: here, get my COPIUM
[0:39:09] mcpsluke: @piratepati waffle is counting on you
[0:39:13] officialhunterx: parrel maybe?
[0:39:13] mechoriet: 4 per 2 ticks ?
[0:39:16] b0rtjedb: TakingNotes hello Giantwaffle, im from COPIUM INC, im here to deliver the tank of Copege. Can you please sign the delivery?
[0:39:17] Sworgn: isn't 300k in less than a day enough?
[0:39:18] CoolReal: 3 a sec
[0:39:20] xlpants: is ass line 16A?
[0:39:25] daZonk: Broke bottom one?
[0:39:27] kayyy: COPIUM
[0:39:35] Yakobro: LUL
[0:39:52] kbigLiar: you are running 33% rate, which goes wonky at the scale you are considering
[0:39:52] Lightning00Blade: I think you will need more of the XP thingy as Pati tried to craft a recipe and it needed like 100k more than you have
[0:39:53] Allmostdone: @Nexhunter Becuase that what I started out with as a freshman in collage punch card too
[0:40:08] Glacial_Indifference: 23 hours and change
[0:40:09] JareBear: little over a day
[0:40:10] mechoriet: YEP too much seconds
[0:40:30] s_DeXTeR_s: YES DO IT
[0:40:34] mechoriet: maybe double it YEP
[0:40:50] mechoriet: yeah circuits for example
[0:40:55] frainsbreeze: you will need to make a rotary hearth today :)
[0:40:56] BMYGRLFRND: like good circuits, for example
[0:40:59] s_DeXTeR_s: 12h faster HMM
[0:41:07] n69ky: do you need something else from DMLs?
[0:41:07] Glacial_Indifference: Dedicated machines is the play.
[0:41:07] TelRehiad: fix your good integrated circuits
[0:41:09] kbigLiar: i think its more like 27 hours, since you did your numbers at 33% rate instead of the actual 30% rate
[0:41:13] daedmissica0: do the good circ and atuo then
[0:41:13] jacklebob: Wires
[0:41:17] Koeckie: @Giantwaffle should you not craft all the time?
[0:41:28] kane1941: just MV
[0:41:45] daedmissica0: ye
[0:41:46] tomey36: First check the interface for good circuits there could be multiple patterns
[0:41:53] Lightning00Blade: You can have a second input with a recipe on it to craft on demand?
[0:41:54] BMYGRLFRND: they jam sometimes
[0:42:01] BMYGRLFRND: afaik not reproducible
[0:42:03] daedmissica0: always the good ones
[0:42:18] DaddyDiddy: for some reason I hate the large circuit assembler, i switched to using APAs because I just think its better personally
[0:42:33] KnightofObv: Is it chunk related?
[0:42:51] TelRehiad: @Knightishift they fixed the chunk issue. its all 1 chunk now
[0:42:54] officialhunterx: good it be a the 256 on the circuts
[0:42:59] kane1941: just disable blocking?
[0:44:00] frainsbreeze: start the crafting on the 16A hatches
[0:44:01] Bagz_69: queue up a bunhc of draconic cfrrafting, keep that running
[0:44:02] mechoriet: susHmm are the circuit interface on blocking that could maybe the issue
[0:44:07] officialhunterx: the end game of this pack is challenging now add a time crunch its pretty dispair
[0:44:28] S1rRogue: waffle live on sunday? We're addicted addicted huh
[0:44:30] jacklebob: Do second machine
[0:44:33] stickman_02: So what dispair is on the agenda today?

[0:45:18] daedmissica0: we can blam ci for 70 hr and nothing to show lol
[0:45:24] Purecrew: Fix input bus for those machines as well
[0:45:32] officialhunterx: do you have the creative source from extra utils autocraft cause im curius how much coal you need
[0:45:33] Purecrew: They are to small
[0:45:33] BMYGRLFRND: @daedmissica0 wdym, ci carried hard
[0:45:39] Dvaina: Also Pati removed Gallium Dust somewhere. Might have broken stuff.
[0:45:48] officialhunterx: cause that system is still very basic
[0:46:07] maccabeus: this factory would be working better if they didn't delete Ci's coffee machine

[0:47:10] DaddyDiddy: waffle you might run into the problem I had where if you have all the machines running at the same time the UHV 16A won't get enough power because they are all running
[0:47:12] Pati: pretty much but with more and more sickness
[0:47:12] 0omkins: ItIsWhatItIs  ItIsWhatItIs

[0:47:58] daedmissica0: @Giantwaffle did you see mick on p2 at ROC
[0:48:01] kbigLiar: dont you want 256 crafts worth instead of 256 outputs?
[0:48:17] Thalmize: yeah the lmp2 finish was .002
[0:48:22] Bernd135: ^Waffle you only make the recipes output 256 items but the recipes are not 256 recipes in total amount!
[0:48:33] Thalmize: yeah it was crazy finish
[0:48:35] RationalLies: COPIUM You got this waffle PETTHECUTIE

[0:49:36] LeKami: there are multiple 24h races
[0:49:42] Thalmize: @LeKami yes there are
[0:49:43] PureSpider: it would be rolex at daytona 🤣
[0:49:44] LeKami: le man is one of the most well lnown
[0:49:48] IronGajeel: yes
[0:49:49] SailorWS: there was

[0:50:33] PureSpider: thats perfect hahahaha
[0:50:35] Bernd135: Waffle please note that 256 item output does not always euqal 256 recipes!
[0:50:36] Bagz_69: queue up a bunhc of draconic cfrrafting, keep that running
[0:50:48] Dylanesp: ItIsWhatItIs
[0:50:48] officialhunterx: pati
[0:50:49] stickman_02: no input should be 256
[0:50:50] Thardox: they do work fine, doesn't have to be 256
[0:50:54] officialhunterx: thats what it is
[0:50:55] Jaydepps00: nonsubs cant link @mechoriet
[0:50:55] DaddyDiddy: no input needs to be 256
[0:50:55] MakerOfThingys: Have you started dreaming about this Minecraft mod yet?
[0:50:56] mechoriet: check my nuked link
[0:50:58] Danishwiz: Why is 256 max?
[0:50:59] kbigLiar: the input should be 256 crafts not a yield of 256 items
[0:50:59] Yakobro: ItIsWhatItIs
[0:51:00] Shadewe: @Giantwaffle Did you start using the Draconic Wireless power pylons?
[0:51:00] n69ky: isn't daytona just a circle? are cars tested to drive to turn to the right at all? xD
[0:51:03] Koeckie: no
[0:51:06] mechoriet: @Jaydepps00 I know I always forgot
[0:51:08] DaddyDiddy: no it's how many recipes
[0:51:08] mechoriet: forgor
[0:51:09] primo_qwe: you want input to be 256
[0:51:11] stickman_02: it can take 256 items
[0:51:17] DaddyDiddy: if you put in 256 recipes then it'll do all of them
[0:51:17] Bagz_69: 256x recipes crafted at the same time.
[0:51:17] kbigLiar: you are doing 256 crafts... not creating 256 items
[0:51:23] stickman_02: and do 256 recipes
[0:51:23] Thalmize: @n69ky they ahve a really good road coarse
[0:51:24] Koeckie: 256 recipe soo input
[0:51:33] Bernd135: Waffle it can do 256 recipes and not 256 items as output!
[0:51:34] frainsbreeze: its a 256 multiprocessor...so it will take 256 input
[0:51:46] DaddyDiddy: the craft you're doing is only doing 64 recipes
[0:51:47] mrlagging: ItIsWhatItIs
[0:51:49] stickman_02: we've been telling you for like a week
[0:52:07] n69ky: @Thalmize oh so it isnt JUST a circle, it's multiple things
[0:52:10] KnightofObv: it'll void it when the output bus is full tho
[0:52:30] Pati: if blocking mode is off you dont need to do this
[0:52:33] mechoriet: maybe that happens to the circuits and the me gets confused
[0:52:33] DaddyDiddy: yeah but a UHV output bus will not fill up if you are pulling fast enough
[0:52:35] Koeckie: you could do >1k so you would x4 it but sure leave it as is
[0:52:35] Moobot: You can find Waffle's Youtube channel here - https://youtube.com/giantwaffle
[0:52:37] Smaleslid: Hey chat! need some help with the Large Chemical Reactor if anyone has a chance to help?
[0:53:00] primo_qwe: ye dont go above 64 input for circuits or they get clogged even in biggest input bus
[0:53:20] Bernd135: @PiratePati The machines are so quick that the interface can not put it quick enough into it so it is a speed up of crafting
[0:53:33] Apparentthreat: do the circ assemblers not allow distinct busses?
[0:53:42] SailorWS: Apparentthreat waffle wants a oneguy emote https://7tv.app/emotes/63affc7cad551e191f8a0c18
[0:53:43] Thalmize: @n69ky correct this 24h race wsa the road course which is 12 turns which also uses all for turns of daytona
[0:53:46] Koeckie: split them?
[0:53:54] primo_qwe: they dınt
[0:53:58] DaddyDiddy: it's the only multiblock that doesn't have distinct
[0:54:01] maccabeus: OneGuy

[1:03:29] mechoriet: chem reactors
[1:03:37] Minelmonia: make like 30k
[1:03:41] Aragnir: why you craft primitive mv circuits, not top one?
[1:03:42] iloveplants: why isn't that all automated to craft those too?
[1:03:44] officialhunterx: multiblock chem rector
[1:03:48] Pati: they are being made in the old HV lines upstairs

[1:06:21] MonteKuchen: its fine
[1:06:24] Aragnir: why not SOC circiuts?!?! i don't understand
[1:06:27] Morlega: You're taking out the patterns, so if you don't have replacements, it breaks YEP
[1:06:29] CoolReal: Why not cut the HV lines from the system and see what goes missing?
[1:06:59] LuciferSpirt: monkaCozy legacy code
[1:06:59] mechoriet: OneGuy pati did
[1:07:06] Morlega: It's a good idea if you're a bit more surgical about the cuts pepeLaugh
[1:07:08] stickman_02: Pati said time for a remodle
[1:07:12] stickman_02: model*
[1:07:14] PureSpider: just gotta rip off the bandaid YEP

[1:20:16] iQuantumFlux: Make sure the DML output is cleared

[1:20:20] thePier: @thePier no, putting the filter on the cable "inputting" on the drawer
[1:20:56] thePier: but since the drawer is locked with an item already, no filters should be needed regardless PepoThink
[1:20:57] stickman_02: so we need like 4 more dmls lmao
[1:21:00] n69ky: 2 more DMLs would be noice

[1:26:43] officialhunterx: for cp
[1:26:47] officialhunterx: xp
[1:26:59] SwiftAffliction: otherwordly matter is not voided, pati remove it
[1:27:05] n69ky: speed up the export ? takles a long time
[1:27:06] roxasivolain90: doesnt seem consistent
[1:27:07] SwiftAffliction: it will clog production
[1:27:10] stickman_02: @SwiftAffliction it is voided
[1:27:14] Morlega: It varies a lot but about 4s
[1:27:17] thecodealive_original: OneGuy
[1:27:25] Morlega: Could speed it up a bit by speeding up the import of the finished product
[1:27:34] Morlega: Soul Binder waits on the output slots being empty
[1:27:39] Flame010: its like 6 seconds from extract to extract
[1:27:40] SwiftAffliction: no it's not, pati removed the void upgrade @stickman_02
[1:27:42] maccabeus: COGGERS
[1:28:01] stickman_02: @SwiftAffliction I literally saw the void thing in the corner a few mins ago
[1:28:07] SwiftAffliction: only hellish matter is voided
[1:28:12] postmanpatte: does tick accelerator thingy work for these?
[1:28:19] officialhunterx: maybe make another for flight controllers
[1:28:22] stickman_02: @SwiftAffliction hmmmm
[1:28:25] SwiftAffliction: ok you're right
[1:28:25] officialhunterx: so its seperated
[1:28:28] chaoskub: Make a requester for P crystals
[1:28:30] Flame010: i dont think you were counting the time it took to load the items in and pull the items out
[1:28:38] TigerLuv: ?? I don't have access to the back of my head ??
[1:28:45] spiwn: You can calculate exact time. JEI shows recipe RF cost. You can also see how much machine uses (just above the capacitor in the machine). Time it total cost/machine usage.
[1:28:47] Ardrago: can you not do anything useful with the matter you are voiding currently?
[1:28:50] stickman_02: Waffle went through and fixed the things pati changed yesterday for the dml
[1:28:53] Koeckie: yes
[1:28:55] kane1941: dont you need 6 million of extraterresteal?
[1:28:57] Morlega: Better to just increase the number of on-demand Soul Binders that can handle all recipes
[1:29:29] KetaKapsalon: why do u need to finish in 2.5 days
[1:29:33] Morlega: If the extraterrestial matter is kind of free, then this recipe is basically free
[1:29:42] WOSNAK: might as well, all the help you can get
[1:29:44] ign0rantlizard: Dont you have matter in the old DML system that wasnt connected to ME ??
[1:29:46] daedmissica0: @KetaKapsalon going on hoilday
[1:29:51] KnightofObv: if you don't void it, it'dve been 500k by now :p
[1:29:53] Morlega: The real issue is scaling tho
[1:30:06] Ardrago: sounds to me like a few hours saved from the loot fabs in total, so why not i guess monkaHmm
[1:30:13] frainsbreeze: PRE
[1:30:16] the_go00se: prescient crystals
[1:30:34] tomey36: Circuits are more important. As they break auto crafting
[1:30:45] Daryl_Kay: it's something so you don't forget
[1:31:02] officialhunterx: upgrades for what you need
[1:31:05] n69ky: request 16 so all 16 are crafting?
[1:31:11] P0tat0killer: set it to crafting only
[1:31:15] Alamose: wont it just loop them?
[1:31:16] thecodealive_original: export bus, craft only
[1:31:19] frainsbreeze: upgrade
[1:31:23] WestsideGecko: You need to activate crafting only
[1:31:53] Morlega: On the Export bus
[1:31:56] Loonyboy34: is the netherportal disabled? i can't seem to get it to light for some reason?
[1:32:07] KnightofObv: craft only, or it'll be a loop?
[1:32:12] Morlega: If you don't put it o ncraft-only, it'll loop iirc
[1:32:31] Thegrinch6: Chat, I missed a day - what did I miss?
[1:32:40] Morlega: Add multiple export busses
[1:32:54] Morlega: You can also add a Drawer Controller and several Controller Slaves for tons of export busses
[1:33:10] DaddyDiddy: you just have to add more onto to the tower if you want to do it faster
[1:33:10] Moobot: You can find Waffle's Youtube channel here - https://youtube.com/giantwaffle
[1:33:23] frainsbreeze: just craft a bunch of soul vials
[1:33:30] zPiiiG: Applied craft 64 items at time with this system, its fine
[1:33:35] splix661: look for a cake for that @Loonyboy34
[1:33:47] officialhunterx: circuits
[1:33:48] Morlega: Why isn't it cycling the soul vials?
[1:34:15] omar_i_: 5Head Clap
[1:34:26] stickman_02: queue up like 2k filled soul vials to use what you have
[1:34:41] Morlega: H H
[1:34:54] stickman_02: fair
[1:34:57] rododendro: @Giantwaffle you have a mod in the pack for building an array of machines at the same time i think its called effortless building
[1:35:12] n3wtpond: Firm but fair
[1:35:19] DaddyDiddy: and one more for machine access interface
[1:35:37] thePier: better automate everything to automate everything better : ItIsWhatItIs
[1:35:51] DaddyDiddy: missing machine access interface
[1:36:00] frainsbreeze: machine thing
[1:37:05] kakiewakie_: ur a carrot
[1:37:16] BMYGRLFRND: HUH

[1:38:01] 1elitkill: You put an export bus on import
[1:38:02] SwiftAffliction: input will be too slow
[1:38:08] 1elitkill: Is that right or?
[1:38:12] SwiftAffliction: with the export bus
[1:38:42] KnightofObv: reactor
[1:38:45] Cadoceus: power
[1:38:53] frainsbreeze: POWAH
[1:38:59] Danishwiz: rubber wood?
[1:39:02] frainsbreeze: maybe no recipe then
[1:39:08] Morlega: Did you insert the machines?
[1:39:10] KnightofObv: nbt KEKW
[1:39:14] officialhunterx: export bus isnt connected
[1:39:17] thePier: LUL
[1:39:22] Nexhunter: PauseChamp oh shit discord is rolling out AV1 support
[1:39:39] Nexhunter: too bad everyone has to support AV1 that is watching Deadge
[1:39:41] officialhunterx: you forgot to ocnnect a cable
[1:39:42] BMYGRLFRND: @Nexhunter for streaming?
[1:39:42] P0tat0killer: wafflemation Pepega KEKW
[1:39:48] Nexhunter: @BMYGRLFRND yea
[1:39:55] BMYGRLFRND: @Nexhunter that's fucking poggers
[1:40:15] Morlega: So if a non-AV1 joins the stream then Discord needs to hotswap back to x256 or VP8 or whatever they use now? monkaHmm
[1:40:17] Nexhunter: @BMYGRLFRND gotta have newest gen gpu only friends though
[1:40:24] Nexhunter: @Morlega yea hot swaps back to 264
[1:40:25] MaryQk: !mc_pack

[1:40:41] MonteKuchen: or centrifuge rubber wood maybe
[1:40:45] BMYGRLFRND: jokes on you, I don't have friends that want to play things with me
[1:40:54] Morlega: Right it's H264 not 256, Nomi influencing me YEP
[1:40:54] DaddyDiddy: isn't there a recipe that doesn't need sticky?
[1:40:55] officialhunterx: yeah your missing a cable
[1:41:10] Nexhunter: @Morlega h265 is expensive to license which is why AV1 came about KEKW
[1:41:20] MonteKuchen: Nexhunter so nvidia 30s series doesnt work with it?
[1:41:20] Moobot: Come join the Waffle House Discord! <# https://discord.gg/fhGFtMuzdS
[1:41:24] Glacial_Indifference: Worth trying
[1:41:24] DaddyDiddy: yeah that works
[1:41:26] Morlega: Yeah I heard that's one of the main reasons, and AV1 just being better
[1:41:27] lampman87: how did you get the sticky resin that you have now? alymewHmm
[1:41:34] n69ky: how get receip in
[1:41:36] Nexhunter: @MonteKuchen only newest cards have AV1 encoder/decoders built in
[1:41:43] Morlega: @Giantwaffle yes Molecular Assemblers work like ME cables
[1:41:43] Bulltank: @lampman87 rubber tree farm
[1:41:43] MonteKuchen: Nexhunter i c
[1:41:43] stickman_02: speed upgrades
[1:41:44] n69ky: oh

[1:41:55] Glacial_Indifference: Crafting Caltrops
[1:42:03] brom321: Acc
[1:42:06] bubblebrainer: fluix cable from the top to make it look good eyy?
[1:42:07] Nexhunter: @MonteKuchen so RTX40, Intel Arc, and AMD RX7000 stuff
[1:42:16] stickman_02: request a lot of boards rn
[1:42:18] Morlega: Isn't there a super fast EnderIO crafter or similar? Would be better to use as dedicated crafter
[1:42:21] ThatOnneGuy: Waffle where did you say your vacation was again? Dalas?
[1:42:35] postmanpatte: just add another bus into hatch
[1:42:36] meller127: parrallel flower?
[1:42:38] Nexhunter: but discord didn't say if Intel and AMD stuff would be baked in on basically their initial rollout or not tobiiiShrug @MonteKuchen
[1:42:40] officialhunterx: what is that bus doing
[1:42:44] kane1941: put interface with filled in slots instead?
[1:42:45] frainsbreeze: you will run out of resin in a couple of hours
[1:43:06] primo_qwe: I'm like a broken record but if you do the last circuit of the tier its just an aSoC and you done KEKW
[1:43:22] officialhunterx: chat whats the bus doing if its not connected
[1:43:30] MrSilverMatch: Did you do a 256 quantity recipe for the craft?
[1:43:32] KICKKJ: its request int 1... shouldnt you up to like a stack?
[1:43:42] MonteKuchen: Nexhunter NOTED
[1:43:47] ThatOnneGuy: There's predictions of wide scale freezing rain going from the middle of texas to kentucky starting wednesday YEP
[1:43:54] Glacial_Indifference: Sammich and water
[1:43:58] MrSilverMatch: Otherwise it’ll be so slow
[1:44:08] SwiftAffliction: crafting card export buses are too slow for this
[1:44:13] Wolfgreg93: isnt there a stak upgrade for me busses?
[1:44:16] biolet8: if you use interface to request craftings can it make 64 request at a time?
[1:44:20] SwiftAffliction: need to perma craft, not on demand
[1:44:21] daedmissica0: go get some food and a soda waffle
[1:44:27] DaddyDiddy: you can make upgrades for your armor
[1:44:27] thePier: you got no backpacks in this mod? soarynThink
[1:44:38] lampman87: Why do you have a compass on your inventory?
[1:44:41] DaddyDiddy: inventory upgrade for your chestplate
[1:44:58] omar_i_: ^
[1:44:59] Zero_Dragon: maybe a couple more flowers for the boards?
[1:45:03] BlackKnight17: @lampman87 Sets priorities for item lasers.
[1:45:05] Morlega: EnderIO crafter (or one of another mod) might be a lot faster than Molecular Assembler but don't remember tbh
[1:45:11] frainsbreeze: 130k
[1:45:11] WoofWoofDude: 130k
[1:45:12] argilrants: wasnt it 130k
[1:45:19] daedmissica0: inport the 50k you have?
[1:45:27] weasard90: weasard90 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 17 months! 
[1:45:30] Knowledge_we: Yeah I think 130k
[1:45:30] blickyglizz: u got inventory cake in this pack?
[1:45:32] TelRehiad: can you condense resin from a fluid?
[1:45:40] lampman87: @BlackKnight17  How?
[1:45:49] Smileynator: how did you get your base so evenly lit?
[1:45:53] daedmissica0: @Giantwaffle you have 50k boards in ae
[1:45:53] KICKKJ: yea
[1:45:53] frainsbreeze: 6 resin makes 3 good boards right?
[1:46:01] Dvaina: DML?
[1:46:03] MonteKuchen: can you not centrifuge rubber wood?
[1:46:10] thePier: slimeball is a liquid too?
[1:46:11] BlackKnight17: @lampman87 You just click with a compass in hand and it cycles priority level on the laser.
[1:46:11] Face_32: no liquid slime?
[1:46:13] Triquarter: you making um upstaiurs
[1:46:16] stickman_02: COPIUM
[1:46:38] pathorium: you already making slime with loot fab
[1:46:40] DareDeFlug: 15-20sec ?
[1:46:47] Smileynator: autocraftable press alt, why do i not have that feature? :P
[1:46:54] lampman87: @BlackKnight17  cool
[1:46:54] daedmissica0: cant you export the 57k boards you have ?
[1:47:02] Morlega: It first spent time crafting the ingredients, the actual craft itself was merely split seconds
[1:47:03] thePier: check if you have liquid slime, it's a common liquid in well known mods
[1:47:16] All_Tech: how long would this modpack take without automation?
[1:47:19] Smileynator: af fast as it can :P
[1:47:24] DareDeFlug: Not even close KEKW
[1:47:32] TheRiehlDeal: Stack upgrade on export?
[1:47:39] Smileynator: missing board crafting
[1:47:53] oohoo3: widePepeLaugh 57k board in the system
[1:48:06] Lightning00Blade: You can put a interface on a new input to add on demand crafting
[1:48:34] Twin5un: pepeLaugh
[1:48:36] primo_qwe: its gone
[1:48:46] 3DExtended: @giantwaffle is it worth to autocraft the infinity thingies with an export bus with levelemittor into a draw? That way you start the crafting process as early as possible
[1:48:50] SlowCookerGreg: BALLS
[1:48:55] argilrants: do you not already have slime?
[1:48:57] tomey36: Are you out of slime?
[1:48:58] MonteKuchen: btw how do you not have a recipe for hoppers this late?
[1:49:08] Thegrinch6: How much slime do you have
[1:49:24] BMYGRLFRND: is there not a liquid for solidifying slime?
[1:49:24] Moobot: You can sub to Waffle by clicking this neat link -> twitch.tv/giantwaffle/subscribe SUBprise
[1:49:24] MrUniversal95: Is there any way you can get slime balls from slime soul vials ??

[1:49:25] thePier: check if you have liquid slime, it's a common liquid in well known mods

[2:01:22] Nexhunter: "An AMD spokesperson told Videocardz in a statement that the February 14 launch date listed on the website was incorrect. While the processors will still launch in February, AMD will confirm the exact date at a later time."
[2:01:23] stickman_02: How much slime do we have now

[2:04:28] Joewiibox: Maybe split people into two teams instead of one big one and make it  a vs type thing (in progression not pvp)
[2:04:31] thethurst_: @Giantwaffle have you thought about pre-queuing things you'll need for the bigger crafts?
[2:04:37] n69ky: additional export interface?
[2:04:41] DareDeFlug: You juste zooming now
[2:04:43] TigerLuv: you have been working with Pati on this one for just over a month, and you sound like a couple that are heading towards a divorce
[2:04:59] ChrisTheBarcode: LUL
[2:05:00] DaddyDiddy: depending on how big the team is, a few months lowkey could get us pretty far
[2:05:02] Jerod5_: GTNH, create a trello board people take tickets to get stuff done LUL
[2:05:07] VikashPindoria: do you need slime for anything else?
[2:05:11] WOSNAK: thats probably enough resin

[2:05:15] bcdmonkey: V.S. Is going to lead to violence and butt hurt people
[2:05:25] TheMatchyman: Yo lemme pick up a GTNH Jira ticket KEKW

[2:06:14] DaddyDiddy: if new people come in when the main team is in HV they'll miss a lot of the early stuff
[2:06:25] s_DeXTeR_s: if i head Minecraft i would play with chat on that modpack but i dont have Minecraft
[2:06:25] Soepballetje: yo waffle have u ever play shapez on steam?

[2:08:09] cmmeth: time to craft those non stop
[2:08:11] Rollingx: 7M exotic matter
[2:08:29] bcdmonkey: Factor in the Ci (add a few)
[2:08:35] daedmissica0: yes
[2:08:36] TheMatchyman: Yes
[2:09:06] spyrayias: aren't there tick accelerators?
[2:09:08] MonteKuchen: tick accelerate maybe?
[2:09:12] spyrayias: world accelerators
[2:09:14] cmmeth: time to quadruple the system
[2:09:22] MonteKuchen: they just need power i think
[2:09:31] s_DeXTeR_s: google it
[2:09:39] frainsbreeze: looks like you are making 1 core per second
[2:09:45] s_DeXTeR_s: tick what?
[2:10:04] mechoriet: the tick thing is at the big ship sender

[2:11:07] burrrst: Autoclave dust
[2:11:08] 3DExtended: Compacting drawer?
[2:11:08] Pati: autoclave the dust i made
[2:11:10] snatchv: @Giantwaffle can you make more microverse thingys or can you only have one per tier?
[2:11:12] frainsbreeze: that is 1.3 m dust there
[2:11:15] frainsbreeze: use the autoclave
[2:11:21] s_DeXTeR_s: Lazy XDD

[2:13:07] cry1p3s: COPIUMTRUCK
[2:13:08] tomey36: Amazing
[2:13:17] MonteKuchen: a lot of wires
[2:13:32] IveBeenWandering: schedule cores because why not
[2:13:35] cmmeth: how many wyvern cores do you have right now??
[2:13:37] frainsbreeze: 200k+ SMDs
[2:13:39] tomey36: What about making all the t1 and t2 drones
[2:14:05] frainsbreeze: are the 1000 wywern cores dones?
[2:14:23] BMYGRLFRND: I think CPU 23 is permalocked because of that recipe

[2:14:29] KnightofObv: 2500k nether stars LUL
[2:14:30] MonteKuchen: 1.3 billion bytes?
[2:14:33] n69ky: 18M coal xD
[2:14:35] Smileynator: those meshes :P
[2:14:39] Wazepas: It's an outdated recipe too, it's harder now
[2:14:39] 1StClassAlcoholic: Imagine missing 46 emerald blocks
[2:14:43] Thegrinch6: 2.5m nether stars
[2:14:44] PureSpider: "hardest" aka most tedious
[2:14:47] Hennrickh: Is that skyfactory?
[2:14:48] Snah__: Despairge
[2:14:48] Caritien: That's not a recipe
[2:14:49] DareDeFlug: WAIT 1 million  catalyst ahaha
[2:14:50] Sanduckchan: but isnt it just time at the ? because you are autocrafting that?
[2:14:50] MonteKuchen: and the ressources in gtnh are harder to get than in this pack
[2:14:52] swuffle1: didn't Gregtech take a team of 30 pros 14 days to beat or something?
[2:14:53] Caritien: that's just a quantity of everything
[2:14:53] s_DeXTeR_s: You need to do it PogO

[2:15:09] Glacial_Indifference: Factory games gonna factory game.
[2:15:12] dollar_cave: hmm, a few things are missing LUL
[2:15:17] TheUnrealOculus: Ngl thats light work
[2:15:22] Joshuapetch: craft it manually
[2:15:23] Joshuapetch: Kappa
[2:15:25] Morlega: That said 49m of some cable YEP
[2:15:32] PureSpider: yea GT packs are factory builders :D
[2:15:39] Mackmora: It is system building
[2:15:43] Smileynator: it's minecraft factorio basically
[2:15:44] Yarrex: its supposed to be tedious so you make a factory so you dont have to
[2:15:48] omar_i_: first time you craft something its super hard, with newly unlocked tech you craft it way faster lateron
[2:15:49] Adricraft16: Gotta explain me how all these ingredients are going physically into one block
[2:15:58] JVM91: I havnt been following all streams, how do you acuire resources here?
[2:15:59] TheMatchyman: Holy crap that is fast
[2:16:00] Brandar711: This all started with a little rotten flesh!
[2:16:08] Face_32: its more about problem solving than it is difficulty
[2:16:10] Trollsamaa: if you were to actually put that many resources into a single block space, you wouldnt be building a stargate, you would be building a black hole LUL
[2:16:11] n69ky: it said a stargate needs 1 pirate_pati_brain
[2:16:14] TheRackster: This is the best part of a modpack. This is why i always keep old machines aswell to go back and look how its evolved
[2:16:24] s_DeXTeR_s: you missed it
[2:16:24] gikei: can you use quatation marks to search for exact?
[2:16:28] cmmeth: btw the current system made like 400 wyvern cores in 7 minutes
[2:16:30] s_DeXTeR_s: at top
[2:16:52] N64_Master: on a Sunday? damn
[2:16:56] Hennrickh: What is this modpack?
[2:17:06] Hennrickh: !mc_pack

[2:17:06] Scopes64: Did you make the wireless energy crystal in the end?
[2:17:19] PureSpider: that's actually okay COPIUMTRUCK
[2:17:21] Joshuapetch: have the system hold like a shit load
[2:17:36] mechoriet: pepeLaugh if it doesn't clog
[2:17:38] spyrayias: maybe give tick acceleration a go lol
[2:17:40] VikashPindoria: if you work out the tickrate machine it could speed it up too
[2:17:46] Dvaina: they will take 3 time longe but fine
[2:17:48] spyrayias: world accelerator
[2:17:50] Morlega: CHAOTIC core needs CHAOTIC injectors? Who would've thought YEP
[2:17:50] daemonaedryn: world something
[2:17:56] 1StClassAlcoholic: Draconic injectors are slower though
[2:17:58] spyrayias: it says in the quest book you can use it for exactly this
[2:17:58] primo_qwe: pati said it doesnt work but idk
[2:17:59] Pati: you dont need to remove the recipe as it wont do it anyways if it cant
[2:18:17] mechoriet: there is a tick accel at the huge ship sender
[2:18:20] mechoriet: @Giantwaffle
[2:18:49] cmmeth: not elite DansGame
[2:18:58] primo_qwe: thats EV
[2:19:01] primo_qwe: you can do better
[2:19:06] tomey36: I think it’s at the large microverse @giantwaffle
[2:19:31] PureSpider: random tick = plant growth etc
[2:19:37] PureSpider: tile entiry would be the animations, probably
[2:20:06] TheWonderLlama: CiGrip
[2:20:10] mechoriet: CiGrip 420
[2:20:22] Morlega: Yes
[2:20:26] PureSpider: yes
[2:20:26] FrogManPepe: Do Nomifactory use quests?
[2:20:33] Morlega: Unless you manually queue the craft
[2:20:44] DarkvirusNZ: The XP is slow into these machines
[2:20:46] mechoriet: takes a bit for the system to retry a failed attempt perhaps
[2:21:00] n69ky: in't there a bug when you take the crafting card out without changing the mode back?
[2:21:08] frainsbreeze: backlog
[2:21:28] Morlega: You had the bug with the old crafting drawer a few days ago too
[2:21:38] PureSpider: put a lever on it and a redstone card in it
[2:21:42] PureSpider: so you can just toggle it off
[2:21:44] mechoriet: no its was 402~
[2:21:48] EpicTitan232: something is wrong
[2:21:51] GGoodGGuy: stop chewing ice!
[2:21:56] frainsbreeze: it might be using the legacy system upstairs
[2:21:58] Morlega: It says it's crafting 392 right now. Probably using the crate upstairs
[2:22:00] mechoriet: @GGoodGGuy KEKW
[2:22:03] GGoodGGuy: :D
[2:22:09] Bernd135: He uses the binder upstars the old one
[2:22:14] PureSpider: might be using upstairs
[2:22:23] TheWonderLlama: Should™
[2:22:23] Moobot: You can find Waffle's Youtube channel here - https://youtube.com/giantwaffle
[2:22:23] Ohjaytee: did anyone clip or have the recipe he was talking about for GT New horizons?
[2:22:25] Morlega: 392 crafts can only fit maybe in the crate upstairs, but even then
[2:22:29] KnightofObv: yes
[2:22:44] Koeckie: crate is the problem
[2:22:46] mechoriet: YEP Issue
[2:22:48] PureSpider: it's not blocking
[2:22:55] Morlega: Yep that's about 392 YEP
[2:22:56] MysticfulX: LUL
[2:23:06] TheWonderLlama: Still using the legacy code KEKW
[2:23:07] StefanGab95: blocking mode?
[2:23:17] Morlega: It's because blocking mode isn't on. That was perfect when this was the only binder, but now it's a problem LUL
[2:23:26] Koeckie: you could just remove the crate :D
[2:23:32] Morlega: The liquid will be a problem here anyway
[2:23:33] mechoriet: YEP cancel probbly
[2:23:48] Sanduckchan: one more time COPIUM
[2:23:52] TheWonderLlama: First try! \o/
[2:24:16] PureSpider: put a redstone card and a lever in/on the crystal export bus so you can just turn it on and off
[2:24:22] kbigLiar: I thought you were going to do all of these chaotic?
[2:24:55] Sanduckchan: just do both.. more stuff and Tick accelerator Kappa
[2:25:00] BMYGRLFRND: n OMEGALUL t distracted
[2:25:05] PureSpider: random tick is for plant growth, you wanna set it to tile entity
[2:25:09] Sanduckchan: didnt you make the lite one?
[2:25:11] Sanduckchan: elite
[2:25:13] ExumeTV: @Giantwaffle  How did you get Phenol Early early game??
[2:25:16] Morlega: You need to put it next to the fusion crafter
[2:25:22] TheGuyJoshua: sheriffNOTES not distracted.....
[2:25:30] Morlega: I don't think the wide area speedup would work for fusion crafters, they don't use random ticks
[2:25:32] MonteKuchen: i think you can use your wrench to change modes
[2:25:32] lazyhot: @ExumeTV Pyrolise overn if i'm correct
[2:25:33] PureSpider: waffle random tick is for plant growth, you wanna set it to tile entity
[2:25:36] frainsbreeze: its 8x8...place it a bit lower?
[2:25:39] mechoriet: need to change mode probbly to Tile entities
[2:25:41] Cadoceus: Screwdriver it
[2:25:48] argilrants: dont you need to conig it to screwdriver
[2:25:50] argilrants: config
[2:25:55] ExumeTV: @lazyhot Pyrolise oven with steam engine on it
[2:25:55] Pati: it needs to touch it in tile entity mode
[2:25:59] Morlega: Because that's not how it works YEP
[2:26:03] Koeckie: should you not put it in the middle? 8x8?
[2:26:07] PureSpider: touch it?!
[2:26:07] Morlega: It has to be in Tile Entity mode and touch the crafter
[2:26:17] Morlega: or next to it
[2:26:25] thomasausen: the arrows have to point to the target block
[2:26:31] MonteKuchen: why does it need to touch if it has 8x8 radius?
[2:26:32] PureSpider: it says 8x8 though?
[2:26:37] sliderspy: phantom faces?
[2:26:40] DemonicHell3: it's not
[2:26:52] mechoriet: NOPERS not working
[2:26:54] n69ky: it stopped
[2:26:58] deadgolfer: wrench
[2:27:00] Morlega: It stopped yeah
[2:27:06] n69ky: laser on oen side?
[2:27:06] Morlega: Need air gaps between the core and injectors hmm
[2:27:12] primo_qwe: there cant be any block on fusion injectors
[2:27:23] Morlega: It might work between the Item Interface and crafter core
[2:27:51] MonteKuchen: Kreygasm
[2:27:52] Snah__: holy shit
[2:27:53] mechoriet: KEKW
[2:27:54] PureSpider: hahahahaha
[2:27:55] Cadoceus: Nice!
[2:27:55] Sanduckchan: LUL
[2:27:55] n69ky: WTF
[2:27:56] argilrants: HOLY SHIT
[2:27:56] cmmeth: Pog
[2:27:58] CantTouchDisNow: Pog
[2:28:02] argilrants: HOLY

[2:28:04] 1StClassAlcoholic: Pog
[2:28:05] Morlega: Pog
[2:28:06] DareDeFlug: oh shit !
[2:28:07] GGoodGGuy: is this mixer?
[2:28:08] the_go00se: Pog
[2:28:08] mechoriet: Pog JESUST
[2:28:10] spyrayias: just do the same for each lol
[2:28:11] MonteKuchen: also injectors have a power limit
[2:28:16] postmanpatte: gaming
[2:28:17] BMYGRLFRND: laser power time!
[2:28:22] lazyhot: Did you check the wireless relays from draconic evo ?
[2:28:24] Snah__: tick accelerate the injectors too
[2:28:27] DareDeFlug: How to just win half crafting time
[2:28:28] Scopes64: wireless energy crystal?
[2:28:35] MonteKuchen: no you cant
[2:28:36] Snah__: no clue KEKW
[2:28:37] 1StClassAlcoholic: wireless draconic crystals?
[2:28:37] Morlega: Time for Draconic Wireless Crystal YEP
[2:28:43] omar_i_: did you make the draconic lazer thingy for power?
[2:28:44] n69ky: this seems lik 5 times faster
[2:28:46] Morlega: That's assuming the injectors aren't the limiting factor
[2:28:53] deadgolfer: wireless crystals
[2:29:00] Moopoop: yeh
[2:29:01] PureSpider: YEP do it
[2:29:01] flamingpaul: could you put a tick accelarator underneath the injectors?
[2:29:02] DemonicHell3: what if you tick accelerated the creative energy source you are using lol
[2:29:03] jajo85: use draconic crystal
[2:29:05] Sandistus: YEP DO IT
[2:29:05] Drazer_: hell ya
[2:29:08] Sanduckchan: and its not even the elite tick accelerater or is it?
[2:29:08] MonteKuchen: and use the uv accelator
[2:29:09] tony_rex666: ofc
[2:29:11] DareDeFlug: oh hell yeah
[2:29:12] flamingpaul: there's a block in-between each injector
[2:29:18] aaaas3: You can build 1 thing full juiced blocks, it will 50x faster
[2:29:29] Minelmonia: Make the Elite one?
[2:29:31] tomey36: Might as well
[2:29:34] EpicTitan232: You have crystals in storage, right?
[2:29:37] Moopoop: lol giving it the juice
[2:29:38] 1StClassAlcoholic: yes
[2:29:41] Tooleb: does the phantomface work with the accelerator block?
[2:29:43] The_SilentGuardian: do you have enough connections on orb output side
[2:29:55] Morlega: Elite won't help here though
[2:29:58] Zucate: if more power is needed for the injectors, do you really need that layer of blocks?
[2:30:01] BlueEnvyNation: Put a creative energy on the corner to see if you can even speed up power delivery any more than it is
[2:30:09] TheUnrealOculus: put an accelerator on each injector LUL
[2:30:20] deadgolfer: leave the extra cables on the faces, would be faster yet for power
[2:30:20] GGoodGGuy: what is this "device" called?
[2:30:22] MonteKuchen: maybe wire down a gregtech cable so you dont need so many converters
[2:30:23] Jerod5_: cant you replace the grey blocks with more power connectors?
[2:30:25] TheRackster: The amount of power beeing consumed when you running all these must be insane, Bless infinite RF
[2:30:25] Moobot: Come join the Waffle House Discord! <# https://discord.gg/fhGFtMuzdS
[2:30:34] mechoriet: Pog Ress
[2:30:35] Ezrion1: you can remove the laboratory blocks
[2:30:59] FireForEffekt: so is this the endgame of the endgame?
[2:31:00] spyrayias: maybe it didnt workfor pati cause they dont work for gt machines i think
[2:31:07] ethannnturnerrr: Do you need the red stone clocks or could you replace those with the accelerators?
[2:31:20] mechoriet: WutFace
[2:31:24] BMYGRLFRND: to be fair, you're getting a lot of bottlenecks undone, which is what would kill you
[2:31:28] ninopanda: Eve converter? no one converts Eve
[2:31:32] B0atyMcBoatface: pre
[2:31:35] the_go00se: prescient
[2:31:55] tony_rex666: time to world accelarate the base
[2:31:59] daedmissica0: can you tick block them?
[2:32:01] PureSpider: @ninopanda the snake did seqInsane
[2:32:11] ninopanda: @PureSpider nope
[2:32:11] cjthedjdolphin: KEKW
[2:32:22] GGoodGGuy: low on rubber
[2:32:25] Morlega: New bottleneck detectd KEKW
[2:32:28] Morlega: detected*
[2:32:33] SeanBirdyman: no rubbers
[2:32:37] frainsbreeze: you have so much resin now
[2:32:41] official_lynical: @giantwaffle how long time have you played the modpack atm?
[2:32:46] Smileynator: why are those compacting drawers?
[2:32:50] Scrounger11: are you still smelting clay dust?
[2:33:05] daedmissica0: check clay waffle
[2:33:24] DemonicHell3: let him forget the clay
[2:33:28] DemonicHell3: it's fine :)
[2:33:37] GGoodGGuy: rip
[2:33:42] official_lynical: how long time have you played the modpack to get where you are now?
[2:33:47] Kwiatkowskiy: hehehe
[2:34:07] cheppard: just fix it
[2:34:07] Smileynator: chunk borders?
[2:34:10] Dr_Alori: chunk borders?
[2:34:11] primo_qwe: input bus full
[2:34:14] Stonan: Did you get an update on Milton?
[2:34:16] frainsbreeze: check the input bus for the machine now
[2:34:34] Smileynator: chunk loaded?
[2:34:41] falzuu: maybe not enough liquid support 256 crafts?
[2:34:41] deadgolfer: waiting it's turn
[2:34:44] TigerLuv: Milton <3
[2:34:49] BMYGRLFRND: it was backed up, nothing more
[2:34:59] GuardMoony: tick accel?
[2:35:02] kbigLiar: it's "jammed" because there ate too many crafts going through there?
[2:35:03] VikashPindoria: the tick thing
[2:35:04] Thegrinch6: @TigerLuv ah... Milton
[2:35:05] Dibbsu: @TigerLuv Susge You mean mittens
[2:35:31] Minelmonia: double that machine? to split the recipes?
[2:35:31] PureSpider: @TigerLuv you mean mert Susge
[2:35:39] frainsbreeze: i think you have to split the processor recipes into multiple machines
[2:35:40] Hooters1234: did pati get the hearts of universe set up?
[2:35:44] SomethingLikeTheVoid: tick accelerate the assemblers?
[2:35:46] Jerod5_: make another chip making machine and spread the recipes?
[2:35:54] tomey36: Maybe make another circuit assembler. Seems like the circuits would go faster if they see split up
[2:35:56] PureSpider: @SomethingLikeTheVoid not the issue
[2:35:57] primo_qwe: put tick accelarator next to circuit assembly, even faster EZ
[2:36:00] TheUnrealOculus: Add more assemblers
[2:36:01] VikashPindoria: can  use the tick rate thing on the assembly for the motors?
[2:36:06] TigerLuv: silly peeps
[2:36:12] headtr1ck: can you tick accelerate the assembly lines?
[2:36:13] WestsideGecko: Are the ass lines on 16A? Last time i remember there had the normal ones
[2:36:15] frainsbreeze: use the SMD assembly machines for a few processsors
[2:36:23] PureSpider: ooooh tick accelerate assembly lines?
[2:36:35] kbigLiar: in your clay machine, make a compacting drawer with balls/blocks?
[2:36:41] KnightofObv: Can we tick accellerate one of the big DML's? to make up for the dml we're missing?
[2:36:50] tomey36: That seems like a good idea
[2:37:06] flamingpaul: tick accelerator for shulker shells?
[2:37:06] WestsideGecko: Soul binder Tick acceleration? waffleLUL
[2:37:15] n69ky: que up infinity ingot to see?
[2:37:35] spyrayias: phantom faces?
[2:37:37] spyrayias: or like lasers
[2:37:40] flamingpaul: tick accelerate everything
[2:37:43] VikashPindoria: maybe tick accelerate the assemblers?
[2:37:50] Morlega: Do you already have acc cards in the import busses?
[2:38:03] urh111: can  you speed it up with the accelerstors to
[2:38:05] daedmissica0: tick acc will pull faster
[2:38:27] BlueEnvyNation: Can you tick accel the ass line block?
[2:38:27] PureSpider: accelerate the assembly lines igaNerd
[2:38:27] Moobot: You can sub to Waffle by clicking this neat link -> twitch.tv/giantwaffle/subscribe SUBprise
[2:38:31] Koeckie: are they running on 16A ? @Giantwaffle
[2:38:59] deadgolfer: you need 70k zpm emitters for the 290 infinity ingots I believe
[2:39:08] Snah__: can it only make 1 at a time? Despairge
[2:39:08] mysts_07: and field gens
[2:39:17] 1elitkill: Why not make it 256?
[2:39:34] Morlega: Time to tick accelerate the assembly lines YEP
[2:39:40] PureSpider: ^
[2:39:44] omar_i_: liquid is fine?
[2:39:48] Glacial_Indifference: 16a upgrades or not worth?
[2:39:49] Morlega: Why wouldn't you be able to?
[2:39:52] DemonicHell3: one way to find out
[2:39:54] 1StClassAlcoholic: pati tried yesterday
[2:39:56] spyrayias: you cant tick accelerate gt machines i think. check the quest book for them
[2:39:57] Minelmonia: check if they have lube in fluid import
[2:40:04] That0neGeye: Pati. Tried yesterday and didn’t work
[2:40:08] Lightning00Blade: Maybe you can? You are doing it for the micro miners should be the same?
[2:40:11] Morlega: FeelsBadMan
[2:40:11] VikashPindoria: might need a higher tier as its only 8x8 but worth a try to accelerate it
[2:40:47] Dallan_exe: 8x8 is only for random tick
[2:40:55] primo_qwe: i mean you need to put it on controller only
[2:40:57] Dallan_exe: not tile entity
[2:41:03] Glacial_Indifference: How much will the power upgrade speed it up?
[2:41:03] Morlega: You'd have to use the accelerator in Tile Entity mode and put it next to the controller, the area size doesn't matter
[2:41:09] thePier: 16x the details? Kappa
[2:41:11] DareDeFlug: 16A ?
[2:41:51] mechoriet: pepeLaugh
[2:41:57] mechoriet: here we go agane
[2:42:00] daedmissica0: liq?
[2:42:01] Morlega: NBT issue YEP
[2:42:04] Bernd135: Only recipes that were there when the craft was startet are used
[2:42:06] frainsbreeze: check the inputs
[2:42:09] PureSpider: @thePier sixteeeeen times the todd howard
[2:42:14] frainsbreeze: might be broken again
[2:42:14] HrVallak: Empty them?
[2:42:15] SlayerOfRealms: interface on a higher priority?
[2:42:18] SebastiaanO: not all of them are 16a
[2:42:19] deadgolfer: take out the one from the current machine to reset it I believe
[2:42:19] Morlega: No it isn't a liquid issue. It isn't even trying to craft them
[2:42:19] prosper0: Didn't it just fix itself randomly last time?
[2:42:39] Moopoop: Is it in the chunk?
[2:42:41] frainsbreeze: check the inputs...could be broken
[2:42:41] TheUnrealOculus: restart the craft
[2:42:41] Smileynator: look into what it is missing then
[2:42:44] omar_i_: chunks issue?
[2:42:48] Askjong: Chunk bounderies?
[2:42:52] Knowledge_we: Crafting card?
[2:42:54] Morlega: Did you restart the craft since you added the patterns?
[2:42:57] Bernd135: Only recipes that are there at the start of craft are used and also look at the amount of co processors the craft has
[2:42:58] WestsideGecko: Nbt issue
[2:42:59] deadgolfer: take it out the current machine and then put it back in?
[2:42:59] LinkHub_Pro: ME might need more co processors
[2:43:17] HolyIceCube: nbt data
[2:43:19] SebastiaanO: are the patterns different
[2:43:24] deadgolfer: 70k emitters
[2:43:27] frainsbreeze: 70k
[2:43:34] lava4o4: for the new amd chips what is 3d v cache?
[2:43:37] kpl4n: Power?
[2:43:38] urh111: crafting card my e
[2:43:42] Morlega: That sounds like an NBT issue though LUL
[2:43:45] urh111: mybe
[2:43:48] mechoriet: crafting card
[2:43:48] jiivey: Do they need crafting cards?
[2:43:48] ExumeTV: why cant i craft Rubber plates anymore the fook
[2:43:50] PureSpider: lava4o4 basically a really large L3 cache
[2:43:52] Smileynator: co-processors allow it to highlight multiple things "green" during crafting, instead of "orange" right? so 2 things in 1 craft task in parallel
[2:43:53] Morlega: Replace all the patterns with a version that stacks
[2:43:53] Jerod5_: are the items going into the item interface?
[2:43:53] chaoskub: Take those patterns out for a min in the one that is working
[2:43:56] Knowledge_we: Crafting cards
[2:43:56] chaoskub: then put back in
[2:43:56] Lightning00Blade: take the patter from the original and replace it?
[2:43:57] meller127: slapp 20 co proccessors on a stack and test
[2:43:57] mechoriet: they don't have crafting cards?
[2:44:00] chaoskub: see if it resets the system
[2:44:01] Unkn0wn_Nam3: Is there liquid in the new Patterns?
[2:44:01] Zero_Dragon: take 'em out of that one and see if the others kick on?
[2:44:02] frainsbreeze: honestly check the inputs...same thing happened last time
[2:44:09] DefCom_: do 4x 128 pieces?
[2:44:11] WhiteBearGaming360: hello how are you today 💖
[2:44:12] HrVallak: Are the machine full whit random stuff?
[2:44:13] xKaldra: do you need a crafting card in them?
[2:44:14] mechoriet: the new ones have crafting cards right?
[2:44:15] argilrants: Doesnt that interface have a crafting card in it ?
[2:44:15] Xythor: Maybe you're using a cpu without enough co-processors
[2:44:19] 1StClassAlcoholic: break the fluix cable and replace it maybe?
[2:44:31] DaFez_: Just add more co processors to all your crafting CPUs
[2:44:32] WonderlandTru: Didn't you fix it by replacing all the patterns at the same time?
[2:44:32] mechoriet: that interface had a crafting card
[2:44:34] Knowledge_we: Missing crafting cards
[2:44:37] mechoriet: no crafting card in those
[2:44:38] Sayiber: @ExumeTV the new update broke them. There is a fix on the GitHub. PM me if you need help'
[2:44:43] WhiteBearGaming360: shidHmmskin
[2:44:45] argilrants: yeah those dont have crafting cards
[2:44:47] DemonicHell3: compare the recipes
[2:44:48] Twin5un: LUL replace all cards ?
[2:44:48] Morlega: So it's definitely an NBT issue
[2:44:48] chaoskub: NBT issue
[2:44:53] nahualz: could it be because the pattern was created in a different version?
[2:44:53] lava4o4: @PureSpider so with the 3d v cache, the cpu should process stuff even faster?
[2:44:58] SebastiaanO: actual nbt issue
[2:44:59] chaoskub: I would make all recipe cards at once for all ass line
[2:45:00] Morlega: @Giantwaffle NBT issue. Replace all the patterns of the same item with a pattern that stacks
[2:45:01] WestsideGecko: I was right then with nbt KEKW
[2:45:04] Lightning00Blade: Can they stack?
[2:45:04] PureSpider: lava4o4 on a very basic level, yes
[2:45:10] SwiftAffliction: if recipes don't stack its nbt issue
[2:45:27] WhiteBearGaming360: waffleHeart
[2:45:34] Morlega: That's the thing about NBT, can't tell the difference unless you use /nbthand or whatever to actually look at the NBT
[2:45:43] omar_i_: KEKW
[2:45:46] Twin5un: NotLikeThis
[2:45:53] deadgolfer: maybe a skill issue
[2:45:56] Wazepas: Cursed chunks
[2:45:57] TheUnrealOculus: Stop the craft, remove the pattern and put them back in
[2:45:59] DaFez_: Try adding more co processors
[2:46:00] TheUnrealOculus: then restart craft
[2:46:11] Morlega: @Giantwaffle Replace all the patterns of the same item with a pattern that stacks, so they're all 100% the same
[2:46:16] Minelmonia: you need to jump start with the OG pattern
[2:46:16] brom321: Co processors?
[2:46:25] boogerbomb01: how many co processors do yall have?
[2:46:28] Unkn0wn_Nam3: maybe each interface take a co processor
[2:46:28] Moobot: You can find Waffle's Youtube channel here - https://youtube.com/giantwaffle
[2:46:31] Yohan460: is there a way of viewing the metadata info on an itme?
[2:46:31] Morlega: No you didn't?
[2:46:33] chaoskub: Probably, yes
[2:46:37] Glacial_Indifference: Worth trying
[2:46:39] boogerbomb01: You need one for each amchine you want to use at the same time
[2:46:43] Zero_Dragon: you didn't replace the front right one
[2:46:44] DemonicHell3: @Morlega yes he did
[2:46:47] chaoskub: Remember, you are used to scaling ME to normal pack numbers... think of the scale
[2:46:48] Zero_Dragon: it's got the one from the stack
[2:46:52] PureSpider: cock processor YEP
[2:46:59] WoofWoofDude: @Giantwaffle Schedule it on a cpu with more co-cpu just to test iut
[2:47:01] Jaydepps00: loss KEKW
[2:47:04] BMYGRLFRND: OH
[2:47:09] Wazepas: Hecking pati NotLikeThis
[2:47:13] lvyEartman: arent co porocessing units needed when you do parallel crafting?
[2:47:14] Morlega: @DemonicHell3 If he inserts pattern A to load it, then inserts pattern B to overwrite it, he loaded B so it's a no-op
[2:47:18] frainsbreeze: try using 19
[2:47:21] Smileynator: WHY kek
[2:47:23] Unkn0wn_Nam3: KEKW
[2:47:26] Danishwiz: KEKW
[2:47:26] Bernd135: Look at top of the roof of how many cpu you have and how many do not have co processors
[2:47:27] PureSpider: you can name a single block of the cpu in an anvil, then when you put it back, it takes the name of that block in the list
[2:47:30] SebastiaanO: look below this floor
[2:47:46] chaoskub: That said 2 coprocs
[2:47:47] PureSpider: it said 2 coprocessors :D
[2:47:48] ExumeTV: i cant craft rubber plates with the 2 Sticky and hammer recipe any more so weird?
[2:47:49] WoofWoofDude: 19 is the wrong one
[2:47:50] Morlega: That said co-processors 2
[2:47:54] Warkless: it said 2
[2:47:55] boogerbomb01: wtf?
[2:47:56] Twin5un: pepeLaugh
[2:47:57] 7logics: 17
[2:47:59] WoofWoofDude: 17 is the 84 co-cpu
[2:47:59] mechoriet: KEKW
[2:48:00] Smileynator: yeah it did not take 19
[2:48:00] Bagz_69: 19 only has 2
[2:48:01] boogerbomb01: You did pick 19 we saw it lol
[2:48:08] Smileynator: WAT
[2:48:12] Morlega: If you don't actually name them, don't trust the names YEP
[2:48:16] mentiz: KEKW

[2:48:28] StOrMy1100: KEKW
[2:48:30] mechoriet: KEKW
[2:48:35] arondayo: KEKW
[2:48:35] Sandistus: KEKW
[2:48:36] Bagz_69: Differnt, numbers, sorted by co-processors.
[2:48:37] Jaydepps00: it was 17
[2:48:37] flamingpaul: it excludes crafters it can't use
[2:48:38] orillion: KEKW
[2:48:39] 1StClassAlcoholic: no, it was 17 before
[2:48:40] Twin5un: OMEGALUL RIP
[2:48:40] n69ky: no it was 17 always
[2:48:42] frainsbreeze: it was 17
[2:48:43] SubbDogg: it was 17
[2:48:45] GGoodGGuy: its called cloud computing :D
[2:48:48] Ezrion1: KEKW
[2:48:49] SubbDogg: but just the list says 0
[2:48:54] fapohogu: KEKW
[2:48:55] Francisco_Scaramanga: Cisco is famous for that start at 0
[2:48:57] boogerbomb01: So no matter what CPU you pick it puts it on 17
[2:49:00] Allmostdone: Index 0 that’s pretty common in an array
[2:49:02] PureSpider: yea the recipe is fucked
[2:49:09] WoofWoofDude: unless the co-cpu are doing other stuff
[2:49:09] PureSpider: if a recipe is exactly the same, it will stack
[2:49:12] omar_i_: it is what it is...
[2:49:13] DaFez_: That's wack as fuck
[2:49:15] 1elitkill: Maybe soft hammer it twice?
[2:49:16] frainsbreeze: maybe break a block in machine and place it again
[2:49:19] Protonmat: NBT probably
[2:49:24] aaaas3: do u use data hatch? xD
[2:49:26] SwiftAffliction: nbt issue with the patterns
[2:49:26] Morlega: Recreate all the patterns of the same item from scratch Despairge
[2:49:31] fapohogu: you should just make specific ass line for each circuit/processor
[2:49:34] Unkn0wn_Nam3: grab the item and place them your self
[2:49:40] 1elitkill: Like a reset turn off and on with soft hammer
[2:49:44] Gingernosol: just toss a crafting card in each for shits and giggles too while we’re at it
[2:49:49] chaoskub: @Giantwaffle replace them ALL, not just a subset
[2:49:53] omar_i_: Waffle are you going to troubleshoot it on Sunday? ItIsWhatItIs
[2:50:18] the_go00se: do they need individual fluix lines to the ae system? craft might go through the line and stop at the 1st machine that can do the craft?
[2:50:21] mechoriet: try crafting card
[2:50:22] Twin5un: ItsWhatIts
[2:50:25] mechoriet: for giggles
[2:50:26] Skorpio1: priority?
[2:50:27] Zenimer: Ditch the lasers   Its the first system to always have problems
[2:50:37] bubblebrainer: AE2 without channels just stops working when the system gets too massive.
[2:50:47] frainsbreeze: place it a machine on the right
[2:50:47] Morlega: You need to replace ALL the patterns of an item with a stack you made at the same time
[2:50:48] BMYGRLFRND: this one is a head-scratcher
[2:50:49] TheIrishGuy: priority isn't we?
[2:50:49] Morlega: NBT is tricky
[2:50:53] TheIrishGuy: set
[2:50:57] PureSpider: yea it's the recipe
[2:51:02] Glacial_Indifference: Any way to investigate NBT data?
[2:51:02] PureSpider: take the working recipe and copy it
[2:51:04] 7logics: SUSSY
[2:51:06] WoofWoofDude: it's obv a pattern issue
[2:51:08] Morlega: Makes sense to me YEP
[2:51:10] zynithtv: zynithtv subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 31 months! 
[2:51:14] lvyEartman: Isnt it always NBT?
[2:51:15] serfless: when you create the card it seems to change the recipe pattern??
[2:51:16] 1StClassAlcoholic: Someone suggested using /nbthand
[2:51:17] TheWonderLlama: Skill issue NOTED
[2:51:24] Bomanski: que it now with the "broken" recpies?
[2:51:26] serfless: like recipe is in defferent order
[2:51:27] Kondarx: can the ae system craft with more than one recipe of the same thing?
[2:51:29] PotatoWielder: goose might be right
[2:51:32] Morlega: If you have multiple NBT versions of a recipe in the system, don't expect AE2 to work properly
[2:51:32] finisher70: hitting something with a hammer always fixes the problem
[2:51:32] Jaydepps00: PauseChamp
[2:51:32] Minelmonia: its obviously a pattern issue
[2:51:36] n3wtpond: But since the problem doesn’t make sense, it makes more sense to try things that don’t make sense. Make sense?
[2:51:36] 3DExtended: Didn’t those rods have some nbt issue?
[2:51:42] chaoskub: Don't you have that pattern in another assline, other than those 4?
[2:51:43] aaaas3: whaaaaaaaaaaaaaat xD
[2:51:43] Sanduckchan: F
[2:51:44] Unkn0wn_Nam3: make 5 so the last is the same
[2:51:44] maccabeus: HUH
[2:51:45] PureSpider: copy the existing, working recipe.
[2:51:46] NightsAngels: F
[2:51:48] EpicTitan232: big board?
[2:51:49] chaoskub: You have 2 pattern sets in the system
[2:51:51] PureSpider: dont make a new one, use the working one
[2:51:52] fapohogu: F
[2:51:53] FireSongs: reset the craft?
[2:51:53] primo_qwe: you need to restart the craft i think
[2:51:56] deadgolfer: cancel craft and restart it now
[2:52:01] PureSpider: no, the working one was in the bus, wasnt it?
[2:52:05] Danishwiz: Try manually inserting all the components?
[2:52:14] SeanBirdyman: maybe if it stacks it breaks?
[2:52:16] chaoskub: You have 5 asslines making the motors. You are replacing 4/5 cards
[2:52:18] Qbertman: nbt?
[2:52:23] Wazepas: ????
[2:52:23] Jaydepps00: KEKW
[2:52:24] PureSpider: huh
[2:52:25] Flamingass: keep replacign the recipes, to see if one of those is still working?
[2:52:25] Jaydepps00: what
[2:52:26] Morlega: @Giantwaffle Did you remove the patterns of that item in ALL assembly lines? If they're all the same (i.e. stack) then restart the craft
[2:52:28] mechoriet: HUH
[2:52:30] PureSpider: ??????????? DansGame
[2:52:37] 1StClassAlcoholic: ??????????
[2:52:37] Twin5un: NotLikeThis HOLY
[2:52:38] Wazepas: Actually cursed KEKW
[2:52:38] Jaydepps00: EZ
[2:52:38] TheUnrealOculus: It works LUL
[2:52:38] le_Pure: HUH
[2:52:39] deadgolfer: the first recipe was the bad one
[2:52:39] PureSpider: what in the everliving fuck
[2:52:39] Orogii: ????????
[2:52:40] stickman_02: bruh
[2:52:40] aaaas3: holy magic!
[2:52:40] xrokic: easy as that
[2:52:41] boogerbomb01: So you did nothing and it fixed itself lol
[2:52:42] Glacial_Indifference: Hidden data
[2:52:42] frainsbreeze: LOL
[2:52:42] Swingeing_Folk: HUH bruh
[2:52:43] Nexhunter: i know that feeling
[2:52:45] FrogManPepe: KEKW
[2:52:46] Allmostdone: They are expellable you just don’t have the answer
[2:52:47] SebastiaanO: EZ Clap
[2:52:48] Skorpio1: which cpu is it using it now? you left it on automatic
[2:52:49] frainsbreeze: HUH
[2:52:49] GGoodGGuy: must be Ci fault
[2:52:50] the_go00se: HUH
[2:52:50] Dr_Alori: chunkborders?
[2:52:51] n69ky: maybe PATI made the firsr recepe
[2:52:52] PepinierD: I guess you cant have 2 recipes with diff NBT
[2:52:52] Minelmonia: the pattern HAS to stack!
[2:52:52] PureSpider: test harness is broken 4Head
[2:52:53] niborkees: So it was de 3x3 terminal ?
[2:52:53] deadgolfer: it had nbt data that the computer was tied too
[2:52:54] Mascolino: Holy gaslighting
[2:52:56] Morlega: That's how AE2 handles similar-but-different recipes YEP
[2:52:58] 1elitkill: Dont question it number one rule
[2:52:59] Moopoop: Pati had this exact same issue and fixed it the exact same way you just did for something in this modpack lol
[2:52:59] Sandiro1: ItsWhatIts
[2:53:03] DemonicHell3: you had used the regular terminal for those instead of the extended one
[2:53:03] Twin5un: probably some voodoo YEP
[2:53:05] brom321: Look coprocessor
[2:53:07] Jaydepps00: ItsWhatIts
[2:53:09] philip0524: Ci's fault for sure Kappa
[2:53:10] Yohan460: maybe the upstream recipe MDT info is bugged so it's not matching the motor recipe?
[2:53:14] deadgolfer: in the future just replace all copies of the recipe
[2:53:21] frainsbreeze: could be that when you start crafting something, it might just be using the recipes that the system currently has
[2:53:29] n69ky: probably because pati made the original patterns
[2:53:39] deadgolfer: replace all copies
[2:54:04] TheMatchyman: Could it be a chunk issue?
[2:54:07] fapohogu: it doesn't make sense
[2:54:08] Danishwiz: Ah the craft is pattern based
[2:54:09] IveBeenWandering: maybe one is large pattern terminal and one was made using smaller
[2:54:09] PureSpider: ???????????
[2:54:09] Morlega: If there are 2 recipes of the same item but with even the slightest difference (including hidden NBT), AE2 will stubbornly only use one of them
[2:54:12] SebastiaanO: we finally figured it out EZ
[2:54:12] derpstone: 2 chunks
[2:54:16] Cadoceus: chuck issue yes
[2:54:20] Swingeing_Folk: so the old patterns are somehow bad?
[2:54:20] DemonicHell3: it's not a chuck issue
[2:54:21] nAZAr1uS: priority?
[2:54:24] n69ky: maybe player generated paterns
[2:54:24] Glacial_Indifference: non-identical patterns?
[2:54:28] Morlega: It's not a chunk issue YEP
[2:54:30] KnightofObv: legacy code Pog
[2:54:31] Moobot: Come join the Waffle House Discord! <# https://discord.gg/fhGFtMuzdS
[2:54:32] DemonicHell3: it's not a priorty issue
[2:54:32] RaeKiyari: interface priority
[2:54:37] Cadoceus: remove the one that is in 2 chucks
[2:54:38] PureSpider: @RaeKiyari no
[2:54:39] boogerbomb01: Were the old recipes in before the update?
[2:54:39] Azureux: ae never looks for multiple patterns for a particular item so if the patterns aren't NBT identical it'll only use a certain one
[2:54:39] Morlega: If there are 2 recipes of the same item but with even the slightest difference (including hidden NBT), AE2 will stubbornly only use one of them. That's what's happening
[2:54:43] Francisco_Scaramanga: AYAYA
[2:54:44] mechoriet: @Giantwaffle maybe it borked with the pack update
[2:54:45] urh111: is it mybe the game update
[2:54:45] Dvaina: Broke in the Server update?
[2:54:46] gikei: was original patterns made by pati and new ones by you, it ques and used the old pattern and doesnt realise the pattersn are the same and cant use them
[2:54:47] deadgolfer: old patterns might have keep nbt data during ur version update
[2:54:48] Swingeing_Folk: pre update maybe?
[2:54:48] ImposterArchitect: oof
[2:54:50] oohoo3: are the machines the same size ?
[2:54:51] sp4wn999: i think it was the update to 1.5
[2:54:57] spac3n3rd: maybe the update?
[2:55:03] diggi_mokit: diggi_mokit subscribed with Prime. 
[2:55:03] Moobot: Thank you for subbing, diggi_mokit! waffleHeart
[2:55:05] tomey36: @giantwaffle that pattern was made before the update right? The update probably broke the recipes
[2:55:08] mechoriet: maybe the pack update borked something
[2:55:09] Minelmonia: Different patterns in different chunks?
[2:55:09] meller127: did you set the old patterns to 256? so it only need to use one?
[2:55:10] TheMatchyman: block updates
[2:55:11] deadgolfer: update to 1.5 tied nbt data to them probably
[2:55:15] Morlega: @Giantwaffle If there are 2 recipes of the same item but with even the slightest difference (including hidden NBT), AE2 will stubbornly only use one of the recipes (even if the other has 10x the amount of machines)
[2:55:17] boogerbomb01: I think the update changed something we cant see
[2:55:22] arondayo: i love how we're having a serious conversation about at thing called the ass line squchaPkek
[2:55:23] Jaydepps00: KEKW
[2:55:27] Morlega: KEKW
[2:55:30] fapohogu: KEKW
[2:55:31] Bernd135: Maybe it does not like normal terminal and th extended terminal as even though both are the same in the background there are not
[2:55:34] Morlega: I forgot if F3+H displays NBT
[2:55:34] Yohan460: wow
[2:55:34] Asellus10: nbt issue smh my head
[2:55:35] Dr_Alori: check it in the terminal
[2:55:36] PureSpider: if it doesnt stack, it's not the same
[2:55:37] Jaydepps00: try /nbthand or whatever the command is
[2:55:37] chaoskub: Update broke all your tools. Makes sense it could break patterns
[2:55:39] ImposterArchitect: noice
[2:55:40] Azureux: i've had an issue where if you set ore-dict it'll still be in the pattern even for processing patterns
[2:55:40] cmmeth: replace all recipes Clap
[2:55:42] Cadoceus: Yes
[2:55:43] DemonicHell3: @Giantwaffle hit F3 + H to look at NBT data
[2:55:45] Allmostdone: Now you know the answer
[2:55:47] PureSpider: yeo
[2:55:48] dewchaz115: Replace the item in the bus
[2:55:49] PureSpider: yep
[2:55:50] Jerod5_: maybe its a difference between using the original pattern terminal or the bigger terminal
[2:55:53] IveBeenWandering: Clap
[2:55:57] cmmeth: new quest acquired Clap
[2:56:00] Brandar711: I blame Ci

[2:56:52] Cadoceus: Fix the recipes now
[2:56:54] mechoriet: probbly fixed by no mitigation for old crafts
[2:56:55] chaoskub: Maybe normal pattern is 1, big pattern maker is 1b
[2:56:57] boogerbomb01: Time for a bug report
[2:56:58] Skorpio1: ItIsWhatItIs

[2:57:10] niborkees: int if created in a 3x3 ?
[2:57:10] oohoo3: ItIsWhatItIs skill issue
[2:57:10] PureSpider: yes
[2:57:11] ImposterArchitect: ItsWhatIts
[2:57:11] Yohan460: omg big pattern matter is bugged?
[2:57:11] fapohogu: ItIsWhatItIs
[2:57:12] CoolReal: yes
[2:57:13] Dvaina: no
[2:57:14] Morlega: ItIsWhatItIs
[2:57:18] KnightofObv: ItisWhatItIs
[2:57:18] EpicTitan232: pattern interface imprint perhaps?
[2:57:19] chaoskub: Big pattern maker may use 1b
[2:57:20] Yohan460: big pattern maker vs normal maker
[2:57:22] Allmostdone: Time to do a diff
[2:57:25] nAZAr1uS: ModPack update?
[2:57:25] TarMonA: wapcRGBEE
[2:57:26] Aripa: ItsWhatIts
[2:57:28] 1killersquirrel: yes ppHop no
[2:57:29] n69ky: NINO time to reload pre update backup *grin
[2:57:33] Swingeing_Folk: Despairge time to redo all patterns in the ass line to be sure
[2:57:42] SimonSez: Could be hex?
[2:57:52] PureSpider: yea they are old recipes then
[2:58:02] TheMarcFM: it just adds more empty slots
[2:58:05] Snah__: there's a ton of {} near the bottom
[2:58:09] Bomanski: bunch of [] in ine of the patterns
[2:58:11] 1killersquirrel: clearly different
[2:58:11] mechoriet: empty item slots
[2:58:12] dewchaz115: Crafting is different
[2:58:13] PureSpider: the big pattern has more empty slots
[2:58:14] Yohan460: cuz of the extra spaces
[2:58:15] Morlega: @Giantwaffle did you perhaps do x2 followed by /2 ?
[2:58:17] Jaydepps00: there's more empty {} coz of the big pattern
[2:58:17] chaoskub: The array is larger
[2:58:22] chaoskub: for big pattern
[2:58:30] BMYGRLFRND: could that be the reason circuits where absolutely fucked? @Giantwaffle
[2:58:30] Moobot: New here? Welcome! You can usually catch Waffle Mon-Sat at ~1400 UTC. Feel free to hang out in chat before the stream and/or join the !discord. waffleEgg | Use !thisweek for any changes.
[2:58:33] chaoskub: But the system may not consider those identical
[2:58:34] Jaydepps00: prob doesn't change anything
[2:58:35] cmmeth: sounds like a dev skill issue
[2:58:39] Morlega: Yeah the extra boxes mean the patterns are still different anywya
[2:58:39] Deamp: null != empty list
[2:58:41] Dvaina: try that big pattern int he ass line
[2:58:43] PureSpider: yes
[2:58:44] 1StClassAlcoholic: close enough yes
[2:58:49] n69ky: so if you "add" new  patterns, also always replace the old ones
[2:58:50] PureSpider: that's json representation, anyway
[2:58:50] mechoriet: its more a array
[2:58:51] Jerod5_: ME picks a recipe and will stick to using that one for the whole craft
[2:58:54] Morlega: That's NBT, that's not strictly Java
[2:58:57] chaoskub: {1,2,3} != {1,2,}
[2:59:02] PureSpider: yes, it will big the system
[2:59:04] NephilimXS: isn't it just a JSON string?
[2:59:06] cybergaming424: Object is an instance of a class, no?
[2:59:12] PureSpider: big and small patterns are different so AE gets confused
[2:59:17] Morlega: As long as ALL the patterns of the same item are created at the same time (and stack), it'll work
[2:59:24] Jaydepps00: test time PauseChamp
[2:59:25] lazyhot: Thats more like JSON format, not JAVA syntax.
[2:59:28] chaoskub: One class has more properties than the other. So the system sees them differently
[2:59:28] Dvaina: Thats it
[2:59:28] Jaydepps00: OMEGALUL
[2:59:30] TheMatchyman: Pog
[2:59:34] PureSpider: yea AE refuses to use patterns that are even a little bit different
[2:59:35] Yohan460: wow
[2:59:36] Cadoceus: wow
[2:59:37] Smileynator: that makes sense though
[2:59:41] Smileynator: can you report that as a bug maybe?
[2:59:41] Swingeing_Folk: Despairge time to redo all patterns in the ass line to be sure
[2:59:43] EpicTitan232: It hits the first patter from one interface, and ignores the rest because of the meta data
[2:59:47] Jaydepps00: @PiratePati you seein this shit
[2:59:48] 1StClassAlcoholic: makes sense, but that is BS
[2:59:48] Dr_Alori: they just have to stack
[2:59:49] SebastiaanO: so dumb
[2:59:49] xrokic: +1 knowledge
[2:59:49] Allmostdone: NBT rules
[2:59:51] IAmJester: ItIsWhatItIs
[2:59:52] PureSpider: yep, so use big terminal for all of them? :D
[2:59:53] mechoriet: YEP that's so scuffed KEKW
[2:59:53] Cadoceus: you found the broke link!
[2:59:55] Smileynator: can you report that as a bug?
[2:59:55] TigerLuv: and request the right one
[2:59:56] StOrMy1100: Damn that's a pain
[2:59:57] ImposterArchitect: Big Pattern Terminal for everything then
[3:00:00] boogerbomb01: You gonna put in a bug report?
[3:00:00] Yohan460: can you view the NBT info in the interface terminal to make sure they match?
[3:00:01] Morlega: Well there are fuzzy recipes, that's the "substitution" flag you saw
[3:00:02] Dvaina: I think you cant use big patterns
[3:00:05] Bowers04: submit that bug to devs
[3:00:05] meller127: NBT vs WAFFLE 0-1
[3:00:07] Snah__: remove all normal pattern terminals?
[3:00:08] oohoo3: so ... a skill issue ItIsWhatItIs
[3:00:08] LeKami: the craft used to automate has to be the same as the ones you put there to request
[3:00:09] stickman_02: so all along it was an NBT issue Kappa
[3:00:10] WoofWoofDude: This should be fixed by AE/ME
[3:00:10] TheMatchyman: Thats an ae2 bug
[3:00:11] the_go00se: so adding a new assy line makes you replace all patterns?
[3:00:17] Flamingass: It just helps your inner Monk KEKW @Giantwaffle
[3:00:17] Topsrek: make a 30s vid clip you can submit
[3:00:17] Cadoceus: ItIsWhatItIs
[3:00:18] n69ky: @meller127 more like 21 - 1
[3:00:20] 1killersquirrel: good we figured this out only 2 days from vacation Sadge
[3:00:24] PureSpider: you'd have to remove the sparse elements from the array
[3:00:34] EpicTitan232: trouble is, you have a lot out there that is from different terminals
[3:00:34] chaoskub: This may be causing a problem other places and you just not realizing it.
[3:00:39] DareDeFlug: Wich means everythings that are jammed, you'll have to check like this
[3:00:43] Morlega: @Giantwaffle as long as you craft all the patterns at the same time (i.e. so they stack), it'll be fine
[3:00:46] chaoskub: I would stop using normal pattern terminals as a safeguard
[3:00:48] Cadoceus: then test it
[3:00:49] PureSpider: yea i think this is a problem in many places
[3:00:57] KnightofObv: swap out 1 motor
[3:00:58] SPRWilson: I’m coming for that 8-bit 4 month badge LUL
[3:01:03] mechoriet: susHmm maybe that's why the good circuits where fucked too
[3:01:05] PureSpider: just use big pattern by convention
[3:01:07] WestsideGecko: Don‘t you wanna wait until you have expanded the ass line?
[3:01:08] primo_qwe: @Giantwaffle its just like this for every craft if there is more than "one" pattern
[3:01:08] TigerLuv: as long as the queue is for the same *exact* pattern?
[3:01:10] 1killersquirrel: always make a lot of patterns
[3:01:10] Dvaina: Make a Note for @PiratePati maybe?
[3:01:13] SebastiaanO: you can still copy them
[3:01:16] Topsrek: can you cheat-copy them?
[3:01:18] PureSpider: @mechoriet they only have one pattern
[3:01:18] noxiiiouse: try it out
[3:01:25] Morlega: @Giantwaffle You can load the pattern (in the same terminal) and it *should* match. You can stack to test
[3:01:26] DareDeFlug: Means you'll have to check when you auto craft stuff ? (NBT info)
[3:01:35] sp4wn999: yea the good circuits are the same problem i guess
[3:01:37] KorbieQt: Time to make a stack of each pattern
[3:01:42] mechoriet: @PureSpider susHmm you have a point there
[3:01:44] boogerbomb01: If you have multiple from the big interface will it work?
[3:01:47] Sanduckchan: missed 1 no?
[3:01:54] MrSneevle: time to go fix the processing chips
[3:01:55] SPRWilson: SPRWilson subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 40 months! I’m coming for that 8bit 4 year badge LUL
[3:01:58] Zero_Dragon: one machine had 2
[3:02:01] Sanduckchan: ^
[3:02:02] Allmostdone: Why would you need a stack?
[3:02:02] PureSpider: @boogerbomb01 yes
[3:02:24] mechoriet: and we have a spare one for future
[3:02:36] Morlega: I'd keep the spares in a chest, as not to pollute the ME system LUL
[3:02:37] Moobot: You can sub to Waffle by clicking this neat link -> twitch.tv/giantwaffle/subscribe SUBprise
[3:02:48] Bomanski: spares for the future in two days
[3:02:49] PureSpider: it makes sense, but weird that it's so picky
[3:02:53] omar_i_: make sure to test it waffle
[3:02:55] b357: Where is Pati?
[3:02:57] Scrubadubrub: !mc_pack

[3:02:58] Dvaina: Better test it again. For sanity.

[3:03:35] Atzgee: -+03
[3:03:37] Sanduckchan: last machine you went through

[3:04:00] Snah__: 16 amp?
[3:04:02] Sanduckchan: oh.. okay :D looked the same to me

[3:04:11] Thegrinch6: 16 amp good idea
[3:04:15] TigerLuv: wait
[3:04:30] mechoriet: day 38 log: we solved the pattern issue
[3:04:34] omar_i_: queue cores while you're working to know if they're still working
[3:04:36] TigerLuv: you pulled out two types of receipes, and only put one type back in
[3:04:46] Bomanski: screwdrive them also
[3:04:51] mechoriet: pepeLaugh
[3:04:51] That0neGeye: The 49rs are on there 5th QB lol
[3:05:06] arondayo: pepeLaugh "i dont think these'll blow up"
[3:05:17] flamingpaul: can you use one converter for every 2 accelerator?
[3:05:20] TigerLuv: one was a skinny looking pump - sorry I don't know the item
[3:05:24] Jaydepps00: PauseChamp
[3:05:27] SebastiaanO: more power

[3:05:53] TigerLuv: you pulled out two types of receipes, and only put one type back in
[3:05:58] Jerod5_: can you replace laboratory blocks with power cables?
[3:05:59] DemonicHell3: since the top one with it
[3:06:01] BMYGRLFRND: try it on one
[3:06:02] SomethingLikeTheVoid: Tick accelerate the controller block for the assemblers
[3:06:05] TigerLuv: one was a skinny looking pump - sorry I don't know the item
[3:06:06] 1StClassAlcoholic: only one way to find out
[3:06:07] Morlega: @Giantwaffle just for testing/giggles, create a crafter with like 30 injectors? PauseChamp
[3:06:10] Kamipulu: I need a dick accelerator too. oh, you meant tick
[3:06:11] VikashPindoria: if you remove the block under them can you not add mnore power?
[3:06:14] CoolReal: Any Draconic pros know if these injectors have a limit?
[3:06:15] The_SilentGuardian: do you have enough cables out of the orb?
[3:06:17] Askjong: Didn't you make 2
[3:06:18] PureSpider: take away extraneous power connections Madge
[3:06:25] Grimstar_: check clay
[3:06:28] Blackdeath911: why not doing the 2nd tower too? @Giantwaffle
[3:06:30] Sanduckchan: tick accelerate that as well? :D
[3:06:36] Grimstar_: oh ok nm me
[3:06:46] Blackdeath911: wasnt that complicated
[3:06:50] TheMatchyman: Tick accelerate the soul binders next
[3:06:54] Blackdeath911: would be 2x speed at least
[3:06:57] Askjong: just do it
[3:06:57] SebastiaanO: kinda need to
[3:06:57] iQuantumFlux: Drop one of those tick accelerates on the crystal crafter
[3:07:08] Blackdeath911: wafflemation
[3:07:29] noxiiiouse: jsut restart craft
[3:07:41] nellydocs: looks around 100 amin

[3:08:36] SebastiaanO: too slow
[3:08:36] IronGajeel: overdrive it
[3:08:38] Blackdeath911: its not
[3:08:40] Blackdeath911: just do it
[3:08:40] TarMonA: over knight caft
[3:08:41] CoolReal: Gotta have them queued up tho
[3:08:42] 1StClassAlcoholic: too slow
[3:08:43] noxiiiouse: to slow
[3:08:45] Joewiibox: Copege not slow
[3:08:46] Scrounger11: don't forget, you pulled all the ZPM emitter recipes out of the crafters
[3:08:47] flamingpaul: you could speed up the second row
[3:08:49] Allmostdone: And that’s only if it doesn’t break
[3:08:49] Blackdeath911: the other cores
[3:08:49] WOSNAK: its so easy to speed it up though
[3:08:51] chaoskub: *if* no errors
[3:08:51] kudaaxd: isnt it 6000 per hour
[3:08:51] Cadoceus: Finsih the last tower
[3:08:53] mechoriet: pepeLaugh if it doesn't brick
[3:08:53] The_Stone_One: Just tick accelerate the tick accelerator... easy
[3:08:55] 1elitkill: Isnt it 6000 per hour
[3:08:56] mysts_07: but the other cores?
[3:08:58] oohoo3: do the second tower ReallyMad
[3:09:01] HolyIceCube: its 6k per h
[3:09:01] HyperDiaperX: thats 6000 an hour no
[3:09:01] Dvaina: Dont you nee other fusion crafting stuff too?
[3:09:02] 1elitkill: Cause its 100 per minute
[3:09:03] DemonicHell3: how hard is it to make the relay crystals?
[3:09:04] CoolReal: @1elitkill he mispoke
[3:09:05] BL0ODSUGAR: isn't it 6000 an hour?
[3:09:06] kudaaxd: 100 per min * 60 min is 6000 / hr
[3:09:06] Dvaina: *need
[3:09:07] Miracleshot: yeah its 6k not 600

[3:09:23] Wilson2566: waffle math KEKW
[3:09:25] kitofmaadnes: accelerate tbe super computer
[3:09:28] n69ky: request via drawer? or could you start them at once?

[3:10:10] Miracleshot: a bunch of vowels that say the same thing as the first letter
[3:10:10] flamingpaul: infinity catalyst?
[3:10:12] owl_guardian: dont you need wyvern to make those 10k other cores
[3:10:16] PureSpider: @Crelan OneGuy
[3:10:16] WestsideGecko: Can you autocraft the cores into a drawer?
[3:10:19] 1killersquirrel: Waffle why aren't you crafting some of the infinity ingots with less resources, so some of you're systems can catch up on materials from buffers?
[3:10:20] GuardMoony: motors pumps?
[3:10:33] frainsbreeze: did you try adding a tick accelerator to the soul machine?
[3:10:37] richiepat: infinity catalust is already auto crafted cause pati did that

[3:11:29] poppyg15: patti has compressed cobble somewhere @giantwaffle
[3:11:32] DarkvirusNZ: Just put it in the wallway
[3:11:33] Koeckie: can you not just add 2 or 3 drawers to your quarz thing?
[3:11:36] omar_i_: KKona who's gonna pay for it?
[3:11:48] mechoriet: NotLikeThis CHAT
[3:11:50] Malicious16216: We're gonna build a wall, and we're gonna make Ci pay for it
[3:11:52] 1killersquirrel: we are already at the 3rd wall KKona I don't believe
[3:11:57] Pati: so more fluid solidifiers
[3:11:59] primo_qwe: just make solidifier with plate mold?
[3:12:06] TigerLuv: isn't that what storage already does?
[3:12:13] Allmostdone: In the same chunk?
[3:12:13] cheppard: just q the thing and it will craft?
[3:12:17] Pati: fluid directly into plates
[3:12:17] Sandistus: KKona hell yeah brother build that wall keep Ci out KKona
[3:12:24] WestsideGecko: @giantwaffle You have not fixed the plate patterns yet
[3:12:26] mysts_07: @PiratePati hes planning to use the existing plate recipe KEKW
[3:12:28] chaoskub: Could you not use an interface with a crafting card and the pattern for an infinity ingot going into drawers? IT would never finish, but it would constantly pull items
[3:12:32] Koeckie: @PiratePati too easy KEKW
[3:12:38] primo_qwe: dude do it on the multiblock solidifier, it will take 1 second to craft 200k
[3:12:50] SebastiaanO: the problem with the wall was that you couldn't craft anything
[3:12:57] 1StClassAlcoholic: yes
[3:13:01] Morlega: It's a x64 recipe iirc
[3:13:23] Mascolino: Wasnt the whole point of not doing liquid into everything where the machines were faster?
[3:13:25] PureSpider: use redstone card and lever to be able to disable it, waffle
[3:13:32] iWALL_E: its been 79 days
[3:13:35] TigerLuv: he is gonna use all his wood to make drawers? LMAO
[3:13:42] PureSpider: yea or that
[3:14:02] flamingpaul: wasn't it the other electrum platessssssss?
[3:14:07] flamingpaul: oops
[3:14:15] TheGravyMan_: what is all this hes built?
[3:14:50] emnitthy: @thegravyman_ that’s one loaded question
[3:14:51] CoolReal: 1.5M red alloy plates
[3:15:04] TheGravyMan_: lol
[3:15:24] CoolReal: Crafting card is slow

[3:15:45] Blackdeath911: whats wrong with on demand crafting these
[3:15:52] Blackdeath911: as 10k is like 5sec?
[3:15:52] lvyEartman: Pati didnt upgrade...
[3:15:52] primo_qwe: autocraft is such a waste when you can just solidify tbh
[3:15:54] DarkvirusNZ: This will use all your CPU's and you cant overnight the wyvern cores
[3:16:02] BMYGRLFRND: just queue crafts one at a time for those bulk materials and let it go, no passive
[3:16:11] s_DeXTeR_s: its 256
[3:16:16] iloveplants: CPU wall to go along wtih hard drive wlal
[3:16:16] tomey36: Why not just request the number of plates you need?
[3:16:21] GameDadel: why 256 output?
[3:16:22] DemonicHell3: @PiratePati you planning on joining waffle today?
[3:16:23] Pati: youre better off fluid solidifying to not clog cpus
[3:16:26] Provision_: @blackdeath911 any item that rhey dont have is time wasted to craft other
[3:16:27] chaoskub: Copy paste them
[3:16:28] PureSpider: many copium processors
[3:16:39] nighttron: Just do plate mold
[3:16:43] SeanBirdyman: better to have more than you need
[3:16:53] Pati: we are already solidifying plates in the hallway
[3:16:55] PureSpider: do it
[3:16:57] primo_qwe: you can just add it on halway
[3:16:57] KnightofObv: Fluid solidifier is the best idea
[3:16:58] bubblebrainer: fluid into plate mold is for sure the best.
[3:17:03] mechoriet: just don't connect to me YEP
[3:17:08] iQuantumFlux: Fluid solidifier is best
[3:17:08] Pati: also ill get on after dinner i think my fevers down
[3:17:11] lvyEartman: you worried you fill up those drives?
[3:17:11] mechoriet: till your ready for the big craft
[3:17:16] Koeckie: again, this would be too easy KEKW
[3:17:18] SebastiaanO: time to expand the hall
[3:17:26] Malicious16216: Pati MVP
[3:17:28] Trsg_craig: can you not just infinity upgrade the drawers waffle
[3:17:30] n69ky: there are already some plates being done in the corridoir
[3:17:31] mysts_07: or u can use interfaces with mulitple plates into a drawer controller with crafting card instead of 1 bus per rplate @Giantwaffle
[3:17:36] tomey36: Or just craft the plates
[3:17:40] WestsideGecko: 1x recepie KEKW
[3:17:40] mechoriet: PiratePati: also ill get on after dinner i think my fevers down
[3:17:46] Morlega: 9x crea tank -> quantum tank -> fluid conduit <- level emitter, then all fluid conduits into liquifier multiblock NODDERS
[3:17:49] Pati: Ill see though
[3:17:52] ItzJord: Nice Pati

[3:39:59] Bagz_69: There is an interface that does what you want waffle.
[3:40:00] boogerbomb01: They do look like they use the exacts ame texture
[3:40:01] mysts_07: waffle try using the interface terminal to put patterns in

[3:40:16] tomey36: This has happened like 5 times in the last 20 min lol
[3:40:27] Vovosunt: @Giantwaffle you can name interfaces with anvils I think
[3:40:32] TarMonA: @pur hey i am staying out of this
[3:40:38] Vovosunt: not worth at this point probably
[3:40:42] Jerod5_: if you named the interfaces it woul be easy but that is more work at this point
[3:40:43] n3wtpond: I think there’s a way to make name tags for the machines to tell what’s what

[3:41:14] ricdesc26: i think you can use the quartz knife or something like that to rename interfaces too
[3:41:14] frainsbreeze: i think you also have to update the coated wire recipes to 256
[3:41:30] 1killersquirrel: so the accelerators can work on the Ass. Lines?
[3:41:35] tomey36: I think you stole the chem reactors from the quint system

[4:42:54] dukeseven: lethimcopium

[4:46:35] Yohan460: Missed the acceleration and crafting card on the vibrant alloy export bus
[4:46:46] Nyborh: it's so fascinating to see how knowledgeable you are with all of this
[4:46:52] Zornd: Do you need those gears available in your storage system?
[4:46:58] primo_qwe: just put Interface directly on machine and use robot arm
[4:47:00] Sui_Ume: increase the limited item filter? in the conduit?
[4:47:09] Bernd135: limited item filter?
[4:47:17] W84M3: the problem also might be the iron gears not crafting afst enough

[4:50:38] Morlega: I don't think you can tick accelerate fire YEP
[4:50:44] rllmartin1986: i know im  late but will we ever see  build guild colab again
[4:50:53] argilrants: you can tick accelerate fire tick so you should be able to
[4:50:54] fapohogu: just tick accelerate them
[4:50:56] kbigLiar: do you need a crafting for the iron gears?
[4:50:57] Morlega: or is fire "killed" by random ticks? monkaHmm
[4:51:02] daedmissica0: bi metal got liquid?
[4:51:03] Zero_Dragon: the other machine is probably fast enough then, you just are waiting for grains
[4:51:04] SebastiaanO: random tick rate should work, no?
[4:51:05] Nexhunter: @rllmartin1986 late by how many fucking years HUH
[4:51:14] Gh3ttoboy: @rllmartin1986 build guild is saddly DEAD

[4:51:39] Maximus439: YEP  spaghet
[4:52:13] Maximus439: connect gear drawers to ME?
[4:52:17] Morlega: When it comes to speed, microminers might be the only way. Fire-on-bedrock sounds painfully slow Despairge
[4:52:27] fapohogu: make a drawer for the infinity gear too?
[4:52:30] VikashPindoria: connect the machones back?
[4:52:30] officialhunterx: what about the iron gears it needs

[5:02:56] Joshuapetch: https://7tv.app/emotes/63cfd10ef4657baa9ed9d265
[5:03:02] Frankenstain: Would the single block mob spawn with tick accelerate be faster than the multi block?
[5:03:14] ThatOnneGuy: Joshuapetch NOPERS
[5:03:25] Joshuapetch: @ThatOnneGuy but but... okay
[5:03:30] Morlega: Why not 5?
[5:03:32] fapohogu: make it like the molecular assemblers...
[5:03:34] flamingpaul: just a heads up, you can use 5
[5:03:46] W84M3: if oyu accelerate a dml machine, is it faster than the super computer?
[5:03:57] kbigLiar: can you tick accellerate the lame/old DML machines to make them comparable to the multiblocks with hearts?
[5:04:07] W84M3: the multiblock dml yes
[5:04:11] chaoskub: Faster than the multiblock DML
[5:04:18] daZonk: Got to Change that middle block to TE right?
[5:04:33] Glacial_Indifference: Shame Patti couldn't accelerate the DML.
[5:04:35] chaoskub: They are saying TA the old DML miner
[5:04:54] Glacial_Indifference: If you can't accelerate a multiblock DML, can you accelerate the single block? peppHmm
[5:04:54] chaoskub: the non multi-block
[5:04:56] Kjoelby: Waffle gonna supercharge the base with tick accelerators LUl
[5:05:00] Kamipulu: @giantwaffle Pati needs help with his sound quality. it's not as crisp as yours

[5:05:11] 1killersquirrel: Waffle remember you can in/out of Loot Fabricators from any side, no need to mine below
[5:05:56] fapohogu: tick accelerate a dml on top of it to produce the pristine stuff
[5:06:09] MrArrig: can you input on the bottom though?
[5:06:09] officialhunterx: can a simulation computer do multiple tsimulation at the same time
[5:06:10] Moobot: You can sub to Waffle by clicking this neat link -> twitch.tv/giantwaffle/subscribe SUBprise
[5:06:44] omar_i_: void upgrade

[5:07:15] 1killersquirrel: good point
[5:07:20] fapohogu: top ten "where does this come from?" - guardian scales
[5:07:34] officialhunterx: priority
[5:08:11] Scrounger11: can you double tick accelerate?
[5:08:19] omar_i_: worst case scale it
[5:08:27] Morlega: It can process a lot more than 3 LUL
[5:08:35] LuciferSpirt: monkaHmm try double tick acceleration
[5:08:45] CommanderUrsus: tick^2
[5:08:50] SumMarbles: Hey waffle what host do you use for this server or do you host it yourself?
[5:08:59] chaoskub: @SumMarbles ovh
[5:09:05] WestsideGecko: Pati said you don't have the best accelerator yet but the middle one , how good is the best one?
[5:09:07] chaoskub: It
[5:09:11] chaoskub: It's bare metal
[5:09:13] Glacial_Indifference: I'm really curious if you can tick accelerate single-block DMLs.
[5:09:15] burrrst: Try to tick accelerate a single block dml
[5:09:18] fapohogu: ItIsWhatItIs
[5:09:24] SumMarbles: @chaoskub thanks!
[5:09:34] flamingpaul: try to tick accelerate those machines

[5:09:53] the_rapley: can tick acc the normal simulation chambers
[5:09:57] BakaPixel: Can you tick accelerate a normal sim chamber to be fastwr than the multi block?
[5:10:03] tomey36: If you accelerate the realm data first you can use the machines for all the other data
[5:10:07] chaoskub: There is a single block DML. Can you accel it?
[5:10:09] SebastiaanO: i feel like you might not need the multiblock if you use accelerators on the 1 block DML's
[5:10:09] MoshiMoshi0: tick accelerate the tick accelerator PepoThink
[5:10:14] cjthedjdolphin: Can you tick accelerate a normal dml though? And how fast would that be
[5:10:22] omar_i_: chat did he miss putting a matter in a drawer?
[5:10:26] flamingpaul: I thought pati was accelerating a multilblock originally
[5:10:26] daedmissica0: @Giantwaffle use the small ones
[5:10:53] Morlega: The basic gears weren't exporting properly iirc
[5:10:55] burrrst: Crafting card for iron

[5:11:58] WestsideGecko: KEKW
[5:11:59] flamingpaul: LUL LUL tick accelerators are broken
[5:12:03] Morlega: Try putting it on top of that accelerator, would make a nice "flower" Pog

[5:12:04] SebastiaanO: yea fuck the multiblocks if this works
[5:12:06] frainsbreeze: another tick accelerator surrounded by sim chambers
[5:12:07] MrArrig: the polymer clay input might be a bottleneck?
[5:12:15] officialhunterx: clay
[5:12:29] Sui_Ume: too fast
[5:12:34] Morlega: Because it's being accelerated?
[5:12:37] Yakobro: LOL
[5:12:37] officialhunterx: connect more sides

[5:16:58] LeKami: @Giantwaffle U broke power
[5:17:00] Glacial_Indifference: Just replace one block in the center with tic accel?
[5:17:00] frainsbreeze: power broke
[5:17:01] Gh3ttoboy: @moshimoshi0 180Grf instead of 10Grf
[5:17:04] masonthicks: tick accelerate the tick accelerate the tick accelerators
[5:17:08] Shadow_Doctor: Power
[5:17:09] daedmissica0: you cut the power

[5:17:31] Enforcer__: rooHappy we have power again!
[5:17:41] MoshiMoshi0: @Gh3ttoboy was just joking didnt think it would work, i guess it makes sense tho
[5:17:42] Nyborh: what do you use to generate power?
[5:17:42] fapohogu: How about tick accelerating the CMM (Cow Murdering Machine)?
[5:18:10] wondox: long stream?

[5:21:29] frainsbreeze: it shows 29k twice

[5:22:49] kbigLiar: void drawer for the infinity dust before we forget?
[5:22:52] Nexhunter: void lag machine at min
[5:22:58] StraightErro: queue up some more wyvern cores?
[5:23:01] frainsbreeze: queue a couple of tick accelerator stacks
[5:23:06] Jerod5_: how are we doing on t7 drones?
[5:23:06] daZonk: 24 hour stream confirmed.
[5:23:09] fapohogu: don't you also need more leather?
[5:23:17] flamingpaul: why doesn't tick accelerating them work?

[5:23:56] snulllefar: Void drawer
[5:24:07] LachtanMC: cant you just tick accelerate ender io spawner in capture mode?
[5:24:26] Shadow_Doctor: Huh?
[5:24:26] fapohogu: place it on the RF creative source it would have enough energy
[5:24:31] Sui_Ume: you only have 1 big machine producing dragon data now
[5:24:34] kbigLiar: you only have one dml block on dragons atm
[5:24:35] Scopes64: slap one on top
[5:24:37] Scopes64: you have space
[5:24:37] Foobaah: simulation chamber on the orb with accelerater is faster then the chamber
[5:24:38] jdogg91288: you removed like 2 of the dragon things from dml
[5:24:48] Morlega: @LachtanMC Playing on peaceful. And you wanna spawn and capture thousands of ghasts? monkaS
[5:25:01] LuciferSpirt: PauseChamp orb tick time
[5:25:03] CommanderRudolph: @CommanderRudolph I just looked in the config and it's a setting - guess I've only played packs where it kept the contents lol, talk about luck
[5:25:11] DrYProtoss: you get scales from drones youre going to be sending no?
[5:25:11] Nekronoth: Try optimal power input and see the tick accellerator
[5:25:11] chaoskub: What about the draconic power dislocator crystal thing?
[5:25:14] DisclosureUS: testing
[5:25:17] MrArrig: Guardian is finished quite soon though
[5:25:25] AlphaWarrior987: use the Max level Data also not a basic
[5:25:27] flamingpaul: he loses 10 Billion RF/t lol
[5:25:35] derTezo: but if you just leave it running for a night you should have enough... so just wait until tomorrow and leave it to tomorrows waffle
[5:25:40] LachtanMC: @LachtanMC doesnt it just generate the vial? at least I thought it did

[5:25:55] Francisco_Scaramanga: Fire
[5:25:55] Morlega: @CommanderRudolph there's a packaging tape that allows you to "lock" a drawer. You can pick it up with contents, and once you put it down it turns back
[5:26:02] CommanderUrsus: how we doin' on potatoes peepoFat
[5:26:06] officialhunterx: put it in between the two for extra power mayb

[5:26:51] CommanderRudolph: @CommanderRudolph Yeah, I know, I've just never - as in ever - used the packing tape because the config has been set to keep content on break. I haven't played nomi tho, so I was wondering - and I found out!
[5:27:13] Sui_Ume: upgrade recipe to 256?
[5:27:15] flamingpaul: tick accelerator for science?

[5:27:45] lava4o4: have u tried pynadon for factorio?
[5:27:49] C_nrad: You honestly need like three or four more of those multi blocks
[5:27:57] Jaydepps00: wait, waffle, what if we tick accelerate the whole base? 5Head
[5:27:58] PrototypeTrousers: install the time in a bottle mod Kappa
[5:27:59] Gh3ttoboy: th3n tick accelerate the small machine 5head
[5:28:01] ricdesc26: might be cause most multiblocks come from gregicality
[5:28:12] fapohogu: I think it's a skill issue on your part if you can't tick accelerate a multiblock
[5:28:26] sevn7th: just make a mod that can tik accelerate multiblocks Kappa
[5:28:29] Dbleliev: tick accelerate a tick accelerator Kappa

[5:30:37] noxiiiouse: casual
[5:30:38] Morlega: OMEGALUL
[5:30:41] kypudo: tick accelerate the block
[5:30:41] 619srt: OMEGALUL
[5:30:43] Danishwiz: I think it might limit the input to the block
[5:30:46] daedmissica0: get a 30% card
[5:30:46] Moobot: You can sub to Waffle by clicking this neat link -> twitch.tv/giantwaffle/subscribe SUBprise
[5:30:47] Morlega: The input rate is probably limited
[5:30:50] Nexhunter: put it on the rf source
[5:30:51] Jerod5_: nah the block can only take in a certain amount per tick
[5:30:52] MrArrig: Power input is limited yeah
[5:30:54] Starmetal_: maybe limited sides for power input
[5:30:58] fapohogu: more energy input
[5:30:59] F1berz: Limited per side
[5:30:59] CoolReal: input is limied
[5:31:02] Morlega: @Giantwaffle check the orb, it's probably limited input rate so not actually using 2 B RF/t
[5:31:03] Kwiatkowskiy: huh
[5:31:11] fapohogu: two sides!
[5:31:17] Joewiibox: when you did multiple sides last time that helped
[5:31:27] Starmetal_: connecting more sides could speed it up
[5:31:31] F1berz: I might be limited per side
[5:31:40] Sui_Ume: try with draconic wireless power maybe?
[5:31:41] omar_i_: ^
[5:31:45] StingrayNine: does the tier matter? it says basic
[5:31:49] chaoskub: powers on all sides?
[5:32:01] Morlega: If you put cables on all sides + several wireless energy crystals, it might keep up, but is it worth it? monkaHmm
[5:32:02] fapohogu: more sides input
[5:32:02] DarkvirusNZ: Tier basic ?
[5:32:02] flamingpaul: that's unfortunate, ItIsWhatItIs
[5:32:06] Nexhunter: are there better tiers?
[5:32:07] DisclosureUS: proof?
[5:32:11] Askjong: multiple sides
[5:32:22] F1berz: it had more buffer when you had power coming in more sides
[5:32:27] Morlega: You can probably force more into it. It should limit the amount of power per operation per side, so just need to do more operations per tick YEP
[5:32:28] Yumzoi: putting power in on multiple sides sped it up earlier
[5:32:36] StingrayNine: again, does the tier of the block matter?
[5:32:39] officialhunterx: rftools does the same thing its like 50j a side
[5:32:54] daedmissica0: try 30% card
[5:32:56] flamingpaul: in between pylons maybe?, although I doubt it would make a difference
[5:33:06] Morlega: You can connect basically unlimited Wireless Energy Crystals to the same block, but effort
[5:33:13] Twin5un: OneGuy
[5:33:13] Nearzy12: Or it is to literally prevent tick accel
[5:33:16] F1berz: Power more sides!

[5:33:44] Morlega: It's a fork by the Nomi team, no?
[5:33:44] DarkvirusNZ: can you make a higher tier block to accept more input?
[5:33:48] BroCreed1: Did you try it on GTNH? :)
[5:33:51] Joewiibox: mod dev did not plan around people making their machine run at 100x speed
[5:34:02] QuesoBad0nga: I do incredible spaghetti code :)
[5:34:03] Twin5un: Surely
[5:34:06] Jerod5_: @giantwaffle you cloud try a dml  that uses less rf/t instead of the dragon one
[5:34:07] CommanderUrsus: SURELY
[5:34:08] RockyMountainHiThere: Do you have a hamster wheel available?

[5:38:07] VikashPindoria: Some needs to work out how to use the tick accelerator on multi blocks
[5:38:42] kecocan: im curious if you tick accel the main computer on the multi block if it will work?
[5:38:42] Morlega: It definitely doesn't work that way
[5:38:44] theflyingamerican74: wth waffle is live at 6PM
[5:38:46] MrArrig: You would need to know which block is the "ticking" block
[5:39:12] flamingpaul: do you think it would improve it if it was in random tick mode vs entity mode?
[5:39:12] Moobot: You can find Waffle's Youtube channel here - https://youtube.com/giantwaffle
[5:39:25] Gh3ttoboy: @mrarrig ussaly the center block of the multiblock
[5:39:29] Morlega: @flamingpaul then it would have no effect on multiblocks
[5:39:35] boogerbomb01: With other mods with multiblocks there is one block usually that you can phantomface because its in the middle and you cant access it directrly
[5:39:39] Razgriz_Actual: Who needs tick accelerators when you can just throw more stuff at the problem. Surely it will fix the issue. Kappa
[5:40:33] Gh3ttoboy: @mrarrig but gregs 3x3x3 blocks have air in the middle
[5:40:35] kjx1: imagine this pack with only greg pipes ReallyMad

[6:11:03] flamingpaul: @Morlega just curious how so? wouldn't you have to pull each individual drive
[6:11:16] trikkilol: does the soulbinder output on its own? can you upgrade that in anyway?
[6:11:40] glitch_Tt: is there going to be a map download when you beat the game?
[6:11:48] Morlega: @Morlega It's likely it's just a very few items you've got millions of. Pulling one drive and inspecting it in the chest should show you that item and make you go "ah, don't have a drawer for that"
[6:11:48] Moobot: Come join the Waffle House Discord! <# https://discord.gg/fhGFtMuzdS
