[1:36:13] Paxton____: @JonBams The phrase is believed to be rooted in the theatre community, which is known to be a bit superstitious. Performers believed saying “good luck” would actually bring bad luck on stage, so they’d tell one another to “break a leg” instead.

[1:36:25] TheExecuter1: In the early days of theater, this is where ensemble actors were queued to perform. If actors were not performing, they had to stay behind the “leg line,” which also meant they wouldn't get paid.

[2:32:35] skeptium: no
[2:32:36] talks_a_lot: Slightly different topic, but in genetics we refer to the majority of individuals as wild type, and the odd balls as mutants. Humans are the only mammal that consistently drink milk past infancy. Our ability to tolerate milk is due to a mutation in the lactase gene. So the majority of us are mutants, and the minority lactose intolerant folks are actually the normal wild type. cheer200

[2:32:54] dw33z1l: Flying them with leads is possible, just very "fragile", can't accelerate too fast or the lead breaks and you have to go find the animal if they didn't die from the fall...not worth it in general

Dolphins continuously spawn as long as their spawn requirements are met, and naturally despawn if no players are near by, similar to squid."

[3:37:57] JTSmith44: There is like a 4% complication rate with Lasik. That's too high to risk it.
[3:38:02] Moldy_Cheese: Need to eat more carrots to see in the dark
