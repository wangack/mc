[4:40:35] Diufool: cause you are trying to go for something circular in a block game in a really small size
[4:40:55] Diufool: unless you chisel every piece you basically cant make it look good

[4:50:31] Gumbowl_: eeeh
[4:51:05] RUFF_DUDE: what happens if you drag it from the top corner of one edge of a slab to the bottom of the other side
[4:51:35] jelmerdriessennl: what if you only put the roof corners in and chisel it to blend
[4:51:44] RUFF_DUDE: like
[4:51:53] RUFF_DUDE: look at the other slab
[4:52:20] RUFF_DUDE: oh i see
[4:52:40] RUFF_DUDE: i thought i saw it trying to round the edge
[4:53:29] VirgoPr1nce: maybe you could add grass blocks on the planks and work your way around until it looks like a grass covered roof? vines could cover the edges
[4:54:12] Nightbot: hewwo dont be toxic or else

[5:04:10] Nightbot: guplin nog me fav vgumiCry
[5:04:22] Diufool: its all too even so its not given a circular shape
[5:04:49] Diufool: look up like minecraft circle diagrams and you can kinda see
[5:05:22] jjaetea: i didn't realise mc required a math degree now monkaH
[5:06:00] RUFF_DUDE: "perfect" circles in minecraft have faces of 2 blocks an 1 block so you dont want it to always increment in 1s
[5:06:10] Nightbot: peepoRun peepoPooPoo
[5:09:12] RUFF_DUDE: its tricky because you want some imperfection but not random imperfection
[5:10:13] Nightbot: hewwo dont be toxic or else
