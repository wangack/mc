[1:16:07] FoxeVR: you will see the items in the crafter when its correct
[1:16:08] Apparentthreat: @orangecreamsicle3 slow yer hoppin
[1:16:14] xDeadBringerx: Pati: "Do we have this <resource>?... Oh wait not passively crafted because Waffle hand crafted everything" Kappa
[1:16:21] orangecreamsicle3: @Apparentthreat I drank coffee
[1:16:22] Morlega: I thought you could only have a 3x3 on the side
[1:16:23] maimvice13: power
[1:16:24] Apparentthreat: does it require a certain tier?
[1:16:25] kbigLiar: too close and I think it only sees a 3x3 around the center
[1:16:26] daedmissica0: @Giantwaffle vr question is a htc vive gen 1 worth picking up in 2023 for lest the $230
[1:16:28] omar_i_: do you need to link them?
[1:16:32] Bernd135: It only sees a 3x3 from each side
[1:16:32] fbritoferreira: No power on the side
[1:16:33] Dylanesp: check the block you are using, is the the right one?
[1:16:34] maimvice13: ther is no power goin to theme

[1:16:44] Arkypoo909: Doesn't it only do a 3x3
[1:16:53] orangecreamsicle3: @maimvice13 thats a bug
[1:16:56] FoxeVR: move it one block closer
[1:17:00] kiwisa41: i thing the nether star ones need to be closer like enchanting table and bookshelf's
[1:17:01] Morlega: It only draws power when needed iirc
[1:17:04] BakaPixel: They charge when they need to not before.
[1:17:06] Apparentthreat: 3x3 then
[1:17:08] DaddyDiddy: They don’t accept power until the craft starts
[1:17:08] hisdue: ppL MonsTime
[1:17:11] Apparentthreat: you have a 4x2
[1:17:12] Morlega: It's the 3x3 thing
[1:17:14] Arkypoo909: there it doesnt see the nether star blocks
[1:17:15] punkgeek: That's the right distance, can only be 3x3
[1:17:15] FoxeVR: one block further away
[1:17:16] fbritoferreira: It says 0rf
[1:17:18] officialhunterx: needs to be a 3x3
[1:17:20] Apparentthreat: move them down
[1:17:21] hisdue: think enchanting table
[1:17:28] Eidokan: your injectors are 4x2 it only sees 3 wide
[1:17:31] Apparentthreat: NotLikeThis
[1:17:32] AlfredTheSalmon: move 2 injectors to another axis centered around the crafter
[1:17:42] Morlega: Why not put them under the other ones?
[1:17:42] braaedy: 3x3, why not just put it on the bottom or top??

[1:19:56] Pati: Gonna head to the store now so I can not cry about all the manual crafting
[1:19:56] fbritoferreira: Time to automate the crafting?
[1:19:57] ImTheDummy: Why don't we just use Draconic solar panels in real life, surely that would be better?
[1:19:59] orangecreamsicle3: @DaddyDiddy what setup PauseChamp
[1:20:16] GracelessDonkey: Waffle does't want to automate it. THa'ts patis job

[1:23:11] orangecreamsicle3: @DaddyDiddy where is it
[1:23:12] FoxeVR: @Salerodis you should keep older machinery around, you can find uses for lower power tier stuff
[1:23:18] SailorWS: has Ci logged in yet?
[1:23:23] Hegberr: pretty sure patti automated that, just need the palladium dust
[1:23:30] DaddyDiddy: Don’t think anybody is that late game to even share an updated screenshot @orangecreamsicle3

[1:24:18] HiroOfTime: that snap sound for connections is so satisfying
[1:24:23] orangecreamsicle3: @DaddyDiddy fuck sake
[1:24:25] TippletonJohn: Thought we didn't have enough power by not using big capacitor.
[1:24:31] FoxeVR: no point to making the draconic reactor
[1:24:32] SailorWS: waffleLily

[1:36:58] DaddyDiddy: Hardmode*
[1:37:00] Apparentthreat: @Giantwaffle Greg may have started looking at finishing GT6 ... pepeLaugh Was looking at his blog/website.
[1:37:01] masonthicks: you can throw it
[1:37:03] ricdesc26: hardmode is balanced but grindier Okayge
[1:37:23] TippletonJohn: autocraft netherstar? seqKEK
[1:37:34] DaddyDiddy: Hardmode gives you stabilized micro miners
[1:37:35] xDeadBringerx: Start in the Stone Age with Steam equipment
[1:37:39] DaddyDiddy: Which is pretty cool
[1:37:48] officialhunterx: @PiratePati do you have the link to that gtnh autocraft image
[1:38:00] SeanTKE: have you heard how long it takes to craft the stargate in GTNH? I saw a video about it a couple days ago
[1:38:10] ih_shevtsov: miners
[1:38:11] Rollingx: It is, what it is... which is pretty cool
[1:38:15] deadgolfer: make 2?
[1:38:22] TheWonderLlama: cohhGasp
[1:38:24] Morlega: Just put it in a corner NODDERS
[1:38:25] lvyEartman: build 2
[1:38:27] thecodealive_original: make 3
[1:38:28] FoxeVR: two for symmetry LOL
[1:38:31] DonMerkuzio: what about 4?
[1:38:33] cjthedjdolphin: Make 8
[1:38:34] Bagz_69: 2 holds 18!
[1:38:35] deadgolfer: for COPIUM
[1:38:35] mechoriet: Madge MAKE 10
[1:38:36] TheWonderLlama: 4 then
[1:38:40] TippletonJohn: 4 sure would look nice.
[1:38:43] CatsRusOfficial: Totally need 64 of them
[1:38:43] Minelmonia: 18 quintillion sounds good
[1:38:44] jdog0616: if you make 2 you can make it look like a dick
[1:38:47] Rollingx: multiply that by 2 and you have twice as much though
[1:38:47] rickthe_punk: dare you to fill it
[1:38:48] her0zer0: would it not be better to put it in space before the dimensional transever?
[1:38:50] jjvanl: true, but one core is off center
[1:38:52] masonthicks: not with that attitude smh my head
[1:38:54] Morph_: ocd overload
[1:38:55] Gh3ttoboy: just make 2 and have 1 unused
[1:38:57] Miniyeti67: Make 2 smaller ?
[1:38:57] lvyEartman: but it looks cool
[1:38:58] DaddyDiddy: Mine still has 80 days left to go to fill all the way
[1:39:06] FoxeVR: I have a tier 8 on E2E and it wont fill for 52 years with power gen of 228 Million Rf/t
[1:39:08] officialhunterx: at 6 trillion per tick it takes like 3 days
[1:39:10] AleXanDreMau: @Giantwaffle make 2 just to be safe in power!
[1:39:20] fbritoferreira: Check the chunks
[1:39:21] maimvice13: Why did you go for the eeven number build
[1:39:29] Purecrew: Is the core considered a multiblock that needs to be in a chunk?
[1:39:46] Morlega: The smallest you can make it is like 13 blocks across or something? Core + shell + 1 air gap + laser

[2:56:38] thexvar1able: some recipes need 10 injectors just make the one extra now so future waffle doesnt rage
[2:56:41] RussianRainbowTV: when was the last time you played with draconic? FTB infinity? cant remember the last pack that had it

[2:57:08] k0nk_: pull the lever, wrong lever!!!!!
[2:57:09] Tasar_: use python
[2:57:09] FoxeVR: Waffle aint about that efficiency rn
[2:57:09] Morlega: I would've used a button YEP
[2:57:17] Larklen: automate this Amogus
[2:57:18] Maliris: use a redstone block and a lever KEKW
[2:57:18] IronGajeel: build a house Madge

[2:57:29] SmokyMtnRed: PepegaCredit
[2:57:31] Apparentthreat: @NevaDaha you can neva yourself in pati's chat now
[2:57:31] deadgolfer: a button and force Ci to stand there to press it
[2:57:38] bugsplatter23: Can u click quieter please
[2:57:38] FoxeVR: draconic core
[2:57:46] msfWEBdude: I am working on my tier 8 core too, lots of awakened draconium
[2:57:49] Morlega: There's a goal? Kappa
[2:57:54] FoxeVR: only one
[2:57:55] KekZwasTaken: but waffle, automation means 1+hour of work for a task you coul.d have done in 30min! efficiency!
[2:57:56] Jim_Pansie: xdd
[2:58:03] FoxeVR: LMAO
[2:58:08] ninopanda: @chochi314 oh haha ment 2018... read the report wrong
[2:58:11] Tetsomina: Stare
[2:58:16] thexvar1able: pfffffft
[2:58:20] Morlega: You can stack the input items here but it'll only do one at a time FeelsBadMan
[2:58:22] msfWEBdude: is it pizza friday waffle?
[2:58:27] Mraav: waffle you could use a redstone clock
[2:58:28] Thalmize: Stare
[2:58:32] sdman12o: sodie pop?
[2:58:33] FoxeVR: its been snowing all day
[2:58:33] RefiixGaming: sodapoppin time
[2:58:42] CommanderUrsus: BBoomer MonsTime
[2:58:48] Morlega: Well yeah but then you do need a redstone clock LUL
[2:58:54] KekZwasTaken: "yet" mean tho you have to in the future so, why not now?
[2:58:56] mechoriet: BBoomer MonsTime
[2:58:56] FoxeVR: I really dislike snow, cleaning it up sucks and I like being warm
[2:58:59] DemonicHell3: waffleLUL MonsTime
[2:59:00] pharohs24: Snow > Sun
[2:59:25] sorefingers: i mean doing 16 at a time sounds exensive but inevitable. Fusion crafting is probably one of the main time consumers in lategame
[2:59:46] FoxeVR: then again though I like being warm cuz I'm always cold.
[2:59:50] thexvar1able: the wyvern core
[2:59:58] msfWEBdude: does waffle have one of those portable pizza ovens?
[3:00:07] Syther1988: i remember when this mod came out back in the day used to use the speed wand on it
[3:00:07] MasterKraft: I think you should relace all your lighting with something that uses power, so if the lights start flickering you know you got issues
[3:00:20] thexvar1able: 8 sir you have 2 extra injectors
[3:00:53] d0t_chandler: i love how the nether star blocks are old emarld block but just in white LUL
[3:00:55] dylan0806: Only 6
[3:01:04] FoxeVR: not true, some recipes can take 10 I think
[3:01:09] canismiminor: you need 6wyvern to go next level
[3:01:12] FoxeVR: or at least 9
[3:01:14] stickman_02: Most is 10 for recipies
[3:01:22] Tetsomina: Most is 1p
[3:01:33] MisterRabbitHead: future recipes take 10 iirc
[3:01:35] Tetsomina: waffleBlind
[3:01:53] CommanderUrsus: you'll probably need quite a few sets of injectors later
[3:02:04] FoxeVR: for later game, if you want to be efficient , you're gonna want multiple fusion crafting setups
[3:02:15] OhYesHumi: when you open a craft in jei, you can click on the machine icon top right of gui to see all the crafts the machine makes @Giantwaffle  (hi from france btw ;) )
[3:02:20] OhYesHumi: top left
[3:02:29] Noamwild: it will be much faster and easier to make the extras when you have all of them at draconic level
[3:02:35] FoxeVR: the playthrough I watched, this guy had 10+ setups for some reason
[3:02:37] dylan0806: Waffle being lazy what a surprise:p
[3:02:39] thexvar1able: no you are makeing one to annoy chat which is respectable LUL LUL PogChamp
[3:02:40] FoxeVR: then again he was speedrunning the pack
[3:02:46] Flobu_: if you do one more now you only need to change them every 2 crafts istead of every craft
[3:03:41] jdog0616: i dont want to do work rn either
[3:03:42] FoxeVR: do the draconic ones
[3:03:42] sorefingers: maybe setup a simple wyvern core with basics and build the higher tier fusion separately, that way you can upgrade easier in the future
[3:03:44] mrsunman: do it!!
[3:03:44] FoxeVR: fuck it
[3:03:46] slyscaz: how close to the draconic storage being complete
[3:03:51] daedmissica0: you have eggs
[3:03:51] Bleu_Forge: Bleu_Forge subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 40 months! waffleAYAYO
[3:03:52] stickman_02: You’re gonna need at least 16 wyvern cores
[3:03:57] Frankenstain: auto craft nether star blocks
[3:04:01] dylan0806: Automate the cores?
[3:04:03] brenner1265: Do you have the wither DML set up yet?
[3:04:05] mechoriet: yep pati send for eggs
[3:04:27] kypudo: when is the spacex starship lauch?
[3:04:31] MrMoneybagMan: do you have wither and enderdragon models in your DML machines?

[3:04:42] dylan0806: Automate the cores?
[3:04:43] Moobot: You can find Waffle's Youtube channel here - https://youtube.com/giantwaffle
[3:04:58] Foobaah: 64
[3:05:03] stickman_02: I said at least to get the 8 injectors but if you wanted 10 you’d need 20
[3:05:20] mechoriet: maybe need to upgrade the black steel thingy
[3:05:30] stickman_02: I meant 20 wyvern cores
[3:05:30] mechoriet: 80~
[3:05:36] Morlega: @stickman_02 don't need a whole separate setup
[3:05:36] turtles844: maybe for future recipe
[3:05:38] Morlega: aah
[3:05:39] stickman_02: If you want the 10 injectors
[3:05:46] kpl4n: change back appetite?
[3:05:55] deadgolfer: turns it into something else

[3:39:13] Morlega: Try a higher tier canning machine?
[3:39:16] MrMoneybagMan: pulling out the vials before they are finished filling
[3:39:21] RexActa: theres only 800 ml when it does the craft
[3:39:23] daedmissica0: low t
[3:39:29] trabadam: maybe liquid is too slow to refill the machine
[3:39:31] zzzDai: It ran out of acid and then only had enough for 800 at some point?
[3:39:32] Smithii: Maybe it fills too fast... i.e. you need to ensure at least 1000 in machine ?
[3:39:35] greggarry: maybe fluid not coming in fast enough when fluid empty it moves to export
[3:39:38] zzzDai: Then it got stuck making only 800 ones

[4:13:13] Morlega: I always build a T7 energy core in every modpack I play that has Draconic Evolution
[4:13:24] FoxeVR: core has been part of draconic evo for a long time
[4:13:24] Venamah: how much power are you making off the fusion reactor?
[4:13:25] TelRehiad: you should build your T2 and T3 fusion rings above and below your draconic core. would look super sick
[4:13:26] Morlega: Well I might start off with a lower tier, but definitely end up at T7
[4:13:30] Lupic: I can confirm I have not seen it, been playing MC since alpha

[4:42:41] Morlega: COPIUM ?
[4:42:44] thecodealive_original: can you not use JEI like you do in item filters for creative tank?
[4:43:02] FoxeVR: dragon mills have diminishing returns
[4:43:14] CoolReal: Check all the mills
[4:43:15] ohbi78: any mill type has diminishing returns
[4:43:16] Smileynator: all mills do
[4:43:30] FoxeVR: dude I've been playing MC for a loooooong time XD
[4:43:48] sorefingers: they are still worth it, even if ghey only make 50gp at the end, the no automation is worth it imo haha
[4:43:50] Gh3ttoboy: the higher tier speed upgrades just stack higher then the basic speed upgrades so you get more speed
[4:44:11] Scerion_TX: been playing modded MC since you and Bacon introduced me to it back during the Breakfast Club
[4:44:18] fapohogu: so skill issue
[4:44:23] thomasausen: you can craft the magical wood in your inventory look at the recipe
[4:44:26] FoxeVR: I have a lot of knowledge simply cuz I watch a ton of lets plays as well as just dump a ton of hours into different packs

[4:45:07] Morlega: I wonder what causes the lag Amogus
[4:45:14] Flobu_: ddint nino said that half of the tick time is just the treee farms at some point
[4:45:15] thexvar1able: in the coal thing
[4:46:40] Gh3ttoboy: yeah 2 dragon mills is max at max efficiency so now you are loosing
[4:46:44] tomey36: Lol
[4:46:46] FoxeVR: thing to not as well, I believe it spreads the efficiency loss between all the existing mills
[4:46:49] sorefingers: dont autoplace the dragon mills or they are not connected to your grid, so no builders wand or building tool @giantwaffle
[4:47:19] sorefingers: i ha to place 400 dragon mills before and found out the hard way
[4:47:19] CoolReal: Can't be yours if you didnt hand place it YEP

[4:50:09] daedmissica0: try put a 16 stack in
[4:50:15] FoxeVR: never touch it again type deal
[4:50:15] Scerion_TX: if it's automating it, it's future proofing. Just as long as you don't manually automate :p
[4:50:16] pinhead_larynx: theres no such thing as future proofing, just future helping

[4:50:46] chaoskub: 80 -> 272
[4:50:51] FoxeVR: you uh may not be able to use a stack lol
[4:51:07] thexvar1able: pati will fall
[4:51:10] sorefingers: it just ads 16 per upgrade i think
[4:51:14] FoxeVR: he lost the egg pepela
[4:51:17] Scerion_TX: need to add different tyoes of mills now
[4:51:31] Marguti: yes you were loosing more efficiency lol
[4:51:31] FoxeVR: water mills/fire mills
[4:51:35] CoolReal: Go full dragon
[4:51:35] Smileynator: it's fine, power is power
[4:51:35] RussianRainbowTV: you could make a watermill flower if you dont have one already
[4:51:36] thexvar1able: other mills
[4:51:37] Scerion_TX: there aren't better, it's just you need a mix of everything
[4:51:38] PragmaticThoth: day 7 COPIUM
[4:51:46] masonthicks: you have to make them all eventually
[4:51:50] drsnaki96: iirc the water mills where inneficciently placed
[4:51:51] CommanderUrsus: didn't you have water mills already?
[4:51:54] RussianRainbowTV: is there power loss for water mills?
[4:51:55] Kuma_Taru: Water Mills are 4gp per water source IIRC. So they can be 16 max
[4:51:57] FoxeVR: I agree
[4:51:58] daedmissica0: 3 will be ok
[4:51:59] Amenophiz: press shift for max nr before diminuishing returns
[4:52:01] Scerion_TX: I think it's 16 fire and water mills
[4:52:10] Generic_Gamer: "sounds like a problem for future waffle"\
[4:52:12] FoxeVR: PogU
[4:52:12] coolcake2: didnt you have like thousands of red coal at some point
[4:52:14] sorefingers: windmills are easy and no automation needed
[4:52:14] Gh3ttoboy: a single water mill can have 32 GP eith good placement
[4:52:22] FoxeVR: ^
[4:52:39] fapohogu: ^
[4:52:44] thecodealive_original: 2*75% = 150% and if you have 3 then 3*58 = 174%, so you still gain some grid power from the third dragon mill,
[4:52:45] IronGajeel: ^
[4:52:46] sorefingers: just high up in ghe sky

[5:15:27] cryptxc00: where are my points!!!!????
[5:15:35] MrHashbrowns: I set a timer for 10 minutes just un cse you forget about them
[5:15:45] Morlega: It is
[5:15:51] PureSpider: max int rf per tick per side
[5:15:55] Morlega: I'm pretty sure the recipes in this guide are generated "live"
[5:16:04] dennixfailalot: fully rgb the fireplace?
[5:16:07] PureSpider: yea max 32 bit :D
[5:16:15] Snah__: right click "the sphere" monkaS sphere
[5:16:20] PureSpider: sometimes it uses bigdecimal as well :D
[5:16:26] PureSpider: depends on the mod, it's all just java
[5:16:34] Morlega: Called it LUL
[5:16:58] PureSpider: phantom faces
[5:16:59] Morlega: Don't have superconductors I assume?
[5:17:01] Shadewe: Phantom Faces
[5:17:03] Gh3ttoboy: the Quantum entengloporter form mekanism
[5:17:16] sorefingers: you could feed the ball with transceivers but wire everything from the ball
[5:17:19] daedmissica0: Phantom Faces do like 1b
[5:17:20] Scerion_TX: could add Flux Networks into the pack, it has recipes for it
[5:17:22] Gh3ttoboy: is there the tesseract
[5:17:25] PureSpider: it's finally the phantom faces' time to shine :D
[5:17:26] Morlega: You can have multiple pylons and multiple solar panels?
[5:17:50] iQuantumFlux: Can those not do trans-dimension?
[5:17:51] daedmissica0: Phantom Faces is best
[5:17:59] SolarisFall: good old thermal dynamics cables that could do infinite transfering
[5:18:01] daedmissica0: is like 1b
[5:18:04] kane1941: Better capacitors?
[5:18:07] DKJensen98: No they are not
[5:18:07] PureSpider: not sure
[5:18:10] Trahir: are there bigger capacitors?
[5:18:14] TheIrishGuy: or make the storage on the space station @Giantwaffle
[5:18:15] Morlega: That sounds unlikely but don't know
[5:18:24] CarriedNeko: run cables all the way from the moon LUL
[5:18:26] jayrickson87: still gated at 500,000 fr per tick. from either the transiver or the draconic energy acceptor
[5:18:26] drsnaki96: phantomfaces have range as well
[5:18:29] PureSpider: not but it's transfer per side, and phantom faces extend the sides
[5:18:39] pinhead_larynx: draconic power pepeLaugh
[5:18:41] hisdue: space elevator Pog
[5:18:49] sorefingers: its funny, i added Flux networks to my pack but there are custom recipes for everything, it needs LUV circuits per connection point iirc
[5:18:49] cryptxc00: followed and still haven't got my points...
[5:18:49] Gh3ttoboy: of the wireless stuff from draconium
[5:18:52] kane1941: Are there Quadruple compressed capacitors?
[5:19:12] Morlega: Wireless Energy Crystal from Draconic Evolution might help for local transportation, but not cross-dimension
[5:19:12] YOUCEP: quantum link is not an option?
[5:19:17] Gh3ttoboy: the wireless system that draconic evolution has could work
[5:19:26] lvyEartman: doesnt draco9nic have a way to transfer energy?
[5:19:26] Scerion_TX: Waffle did ya'll add any of the optional mods to the pack? or is it stock?
[5:19:33] Speedglass: verizon is the best wireless <3 Kappa
[5:19:43] Jimanjim: are the solars the best way to genereate power in the end game?
[5:19:49] SailorWS: just move to the space station already Madge
[5:19:50] cryptxc00: wafffffleee!!!!!!
[5:19:53] Smileynator: Didn't AE2 have something to transfer between dimensions?
[5:20:11] Apparentthreat: yes
[5:20:16] Apparentthreat: for system access
[5:20:17] Morlega: Quantum Bridge with P2P tunnel attuned to energy. Don't know if it has limits
[5:20:20] eurqa: ae2 p2p
[5:20:24] Apparentthreat: but the wireless crafting terminal doesn't require that
[5:20:26] Smileynator: Can't we just change a big ass battery, transfer it, then suck it dry, repeat? :P
[5:20:27] flamingpaul: energy p2p tunnel?
[5:20:27] SailorWS: move the whole base to space Madge
[5:20:33] jayrickson87: technically you cam have have a huge batter with big input output if you make alot of vibrant capacitors together. you get higher transfer rate
[5:20:34] Wazepas: p2p pepeLaugh
[5:20:47] Apparentthreat: @SailorWS our crew is doing that and it kinda slowed us down a little, but probably back to normal now
[5:20:51] mrleonehart: @Giantwaffle is the Advanced Wireless Transceiver in the pack?
[5:20:56] FoxeVR: ME does have P2P
[5:21:01] Apparentthreat: @SailorWS not really a "move" but rebuild with newer things
[5:21:06] Kaninoo: Tesseract?
[5:21:06] YOUCEP: you would only need it once
[5:21:25] Morlega: If it's just a single P2P for energy transfer though
[5:21:30] SailorWS: Apparentthreat the more they build on earth the harder it will be to move
[5:21:34] masonthicks: wait p2p energy with a quantum ring would work well
[5:21:37] Morlega: It's literally left of the singularity
[5:21:44] mrleonehart: @Giantwaffle is the Advanced Wireless Transceiver in the pack?
[5:21:52] jayrickson87: just make 150 vibrant capacitors and place them all together
[5:21:57] Gh3ttoboy: is there a tesserect
[5:22:10] Morlega: Search for "wireless" or "dimension" and see what pops up LUL
[5:22:11] Trahir: what about flux power?
[5:22:21] SailorWS: the solution is to move dimensions :)
[5:22:21] YOUCEP: the ae2 questtab says something about the qunatum bridge and energy if i remember correctly
[5:22:21] sorefingers: i have to say the nomi currency is such a big Quality of life feature. we all have stripmined enough for a whole nation, dont waste our time with mining.
[5:22:24] OrbitalSky210: Advanced cells?
[5:22:25] IronGajeel: no flux in this pack
[5:22:29] Apparentthreat: @SailorWS ya
[5:22:31] Syther1988: tesserect used to be the go to
[5:22:37] jayrickson87: you get hight transfer rate from vibrant capacitors because there is no limit to the amount you can place
[5:22:38] Apparentthreat: flux network?
[5:22:39] Smileynator: Auto placer and auto breaker, huge capacitor, charge it, break it, transfer the item, place it, suck it try KEKW
[5:22:39] Moobot: You can sub to Waffle by clicking this neat link -> twitch.tv/giantwaffle/subscribe SUBprise
[5:22:45] Morlega: Is there Refined Storage in here? RS before 1.7 had a P2P thing for energy too, and is much easier to make cross-dimensional (in vanilla RS)
[5:22:48] MagnesiumOxide: flux is optional in this pack, default not included
[5:22:52] Butterwhales: Dimensional Transveiver :)
[5:22:54] IronGajeel: @Morlega no, only ae
[5:22:55] iQuantumFlux: Are you making draconium? How’s that inventory looking?!
[5:23:02] FoxeVR: unpopular opinion, but I do like channels on Applied Energistics. I like the challenge of having to cable manage and what not
[5:23:08] itzgiorgi: tbh think there's no solution besides the dimensional transceiver
[5:23:10] masonthicks: don’t use your main ME system for p2p energy, make a separate energy network w p2p + quantum ring
[5:23:15] DKJensen98: Greeb
[5:23:16] lvyEartman: if you build a draconic reactor yo0u dont have to corss dimensions KEKW
[5:23:23] Finokas: 3x3 cardinal points
[5:23:24] Morlega: Then we'll just have to transfer Draconic capacitors between dimensions pepeLaugh
[5:23:31] Snah__: Pog
[5:23:32] maccabeus: @FoxeVR I don't think that's unpopular, but in this pack it would be incredibly annoying
[5:23:33] PureSpider: thats correct
[5:23:36] Morlega: At least 1 block away, this is fine
[5:23:38] RussianRainbowTV: ~3 blocks is fine
[5:23:45] Quinnerdude1: PROGRESSION Clap
[5:23:48] FoxeVR: yup thats right
[5:23:49] drsnaki96: further out looks cooler IMO
[5:23:50] IronGajeel: incoming rip widePepeLaugh
[5:23:50] Apparentthreat: I think they can be a *max* distance from the core to allow for the max size

[5:23:54] RussianRainbowTV: Pog
[5:23:54] Wazepas: Circles DansGame
[5:23:54] SolarisFall: it's like 3 to 15 block range or something
[5:23:55] Morlega: Right-click the core
[5:23:55] CoolAcid: Round in the square world!
[5:23:59] FoxeVR: as long as there is a one block space I believe
[5:24:00] Speedglass: did you know the amazon logo is upside down on your shipping boxes to make you look bad if you litter them withut breaking them down first?
[5:24:01] canismiminor: click one to active

[5:26:33] Snah__: done by new years COPIUM
[5:26:34] LaroStar007: 12 sided Volume, Equally sized pentagons as base
[5:26:36] Amenophiz: you got decor !
[5:26:38] Smileynator: This is a geodesic polyhedron?
[5:26:38] LaroStar007: 12 sided Volume, Equally sized pentagons as base @giantwaffle
[5:26:40] PureSpider: dodecahedron = 12 faces
[5:26:41] Slymph: Is it new years soon then? COPIUM
[5:26:45] GSBressan: We got the core... AND IT DIDN'T EXPLODE! uhuuuuuuulllllll!!!
[5:26:46] Yogithebaer: i leave for one class and he has the core
[5:26:53] TuxLafitte: Don't let it go over capacity... danS
[5:26:54] Flobu_: lets charge it
[5:26:56] itzgiorgi: get back to doing what?
[5:26:56] GSBressan: yet...
[5:26:57] d0t_chandler: Will you do walls for the core room??
[5:26:57] Doubletterb: Can you fly into the sphere?
[5:27:00] banshay3: the fuck is that?
[5:27:01] TuxLafitte: lol
[5:27:03] MasterKraft: sweet paper weight bro
[5:27:14] Jimanjim: whats the next energy gen step after solar?
[5:27:17] Gh3ttoboy: @banshay3 its a battery
[5:27:19] Jimanjim: or is it solar till the end?
[5:27:20] FoxeVR: tell Pati to make processing arrays for the machines on the OD-COPIUM
[5:27:26] Morlega: iierc the sphere itself has no physics but the blocks it's made of still have
[5:27:32] kane1941: Stratzenblitz probably can get inside that Sphere
[5:28:00] sorefingers: i think that is a wise decision. that way you can scale up @giantwaffle
[5:28:00] Rozz161: go back to p2p
[5:28:09] Morlega: Glass needs to be at the same Y-level as the core
[5:28:10] RedalousTheRed: always top
[5:28:10] drsnaki96: @kane1941 chuck norris is already in the sphere
[5:28:14] Gh3ttoboy: glass ontop then clikc the orb
[5:28:18] RedalousTheRed: you click the orb to toggle
[5:28:23] mrleonehart: @Giantwaffle you want to put a bunch of transceivers from the solar to the core and then cable the base....future proof waffle dont be pati
[5:28:42] Morlega: Glass at Y-level of core, Pylon right under/above it (doesn't matter). You can click the orb to toggle between input/output
[5:28:51] TuxLafitte: But if it is Tier 8 it is near infinite storage.
[5:29:12] Snah__: Pog
[5:29:17] SubbDogg: its above the center
[5:29:18] Morlega: I thought glass had to be at the same Y-level?
[5:29:22] FoxeVR: pay attention to the texture on the blocks
[5:29:29] Shadewe: It's fine
[5:29:29] canismiminor: its okey
[5:29:32] FoxeVR: if you right click them it will change them
[5:29:36] Gh3ttoboy: click the orb
[5:29:37] Shadewe: Just rightclick the orb to change to output
[5:29:40] Morlega: Right-click the orb for input/output
[5:29:44] FoxeVR: the orb on top
[5:29:45] Snah__: ORB
[5:29:51] FoxeVR: yes
[5:29:55] Morlega: I don't think it's connected to the core. Wrong Y-level
[5:29:57] kane1941: surround a transceiver with them
[5:30:10] sorefingers: I might be a little late for this but you could replace all your base level roofs with darker and darker shades of gray so you know what level you are at
[5:30:13] cmmeth: pepeLaugh
[5:30:14] drissical: Can you rename the channel?
[5:30:16] KnightofObv: Just change the solar grid

[5:30:22] LsTheRoberto: just make a new transefer for storage and rename
[5:30:23] Lightning00Blade: Just change the solor output to a new channel
[5:30:24] GracelessDonkey: "We" More like Waffle KEKW

[5:30:25] FoxeVR: just change the solar panels
[5:30:30] CoolReal: Make a new one for solar
[5:30:31] Dr_Alori: just make a new solar channel
[5:30:31] kypudo: nah you dont, just keep the channel and create a new channel for intake
[5:30:34] knowledge_within: ad a new channel
[5:30:34] TelRehiad: just leave the existing network and make a new for the input
[5:30:35] MagnesiumOxide: "Solar Grid" and "Actually Solar Grid" LUL
[5:30:38] Tholse: change them in space

[5:30:44] Warkless: @Giantwaffle Just get the sencers from the solar panels and put them behind tha ball
[5:30:49] Morlega: @Giantwaffle first test these pylons are connected to the core, might be wrong Y-level
[5:30:53] SolarisFall: solar panel from the orb
[5:31:02] banshay3: that's why you use functions and abstraction. better refactoring
[5:31:02] FoxeVR: this guy waffle not thinking very critically

[5:31:08] omegaura: THE SUN THE SUN THE SUN THE SUN
[5:31:09] PepinierD: naming things is the worst thing ever, it's never correct
[5:31:11] officialhunterx: you still have to configure them
[5:31:14] Amraki: if only you could rename existing channels
[5:31:16] Jimanjim: thats how legacy unmaintanable code is written KEKW
[5:31:19] Warkless: Wokege Morbing time?
[5:31:21] KnightofObv: Gonna drain the base like this
[5:31:22] Blockmann317: so does this fix all the power problems?
[5:31:30] CoolReal: Depends on capacitor
[5:31:39] wagad: Would look much better under the floor agreed
[5:31:52] Purecrew: Is there really no better capacitor?
[5:31:56] SubbDogg: the pylon is above the center so glass should be bottom pretty sure
[5:32:01] Gh3ttoboy: they are in output mode
[5:32:03] Amraki: @Blockmann317 a step in the right direction. this is just a battery so they can store up to 2.1 trillion or something crazy
[5:32:06] Morlega: Pylons are in output mode
[5:32:07] mrleonehart: Turn off input
[5:32:08] wagad: Click the orb?
[5:32:17] Morlega: Look at the animation of the orb
[5:32:19] CoolReal: Orbs might be too high
[5:32:27] FoxeVR: try the glass on the bottom
[5:32:28] DKJensen98: Glass needs to be under
[5:32:30] MasterKraft: i feel a RTFM moment coming, ha
[5:32:31] Morlega: But they're at the wrong Y-level LUL
[5:32:31] sorefingers: It sounds like more cableing than it is @giantwaffle most of the transceivers are in one area like at the ebfs @giantwaffle
[5:32:31] officialhunterx: orange is output
[5:32:34] CoolReal: Swap positions
[5:32:37] d0t_chandler: Maybe a youtube visit will be a lot faster xd

[5:54:22] preparedincanada: Haven't been able to watch much since you were waiting for that big dimension simulation farm thingy to work itself, forgot the name. I'm guessing it'
[5:54:32] preparedincanada: I'm guessing it's working fine now *
[5:54:40] RodneyDawg: Canada is just k-6, 7-9,10-12
[5:54:43] Peeeeeeeeeep: were you ever smacked by nuns with a ruler for misbehaving?
[5:54:55] fbritoferreira: @casual_steve_ is Scotland / wales different then England?
[5:55:01] ManVS1ife: watch out to not bottleneck the conduits themselves
[5:55:01] MaIlchad: @fbritoferreira Rarely you get schools where you can go straight from year 1-13. Nursury then Reception comes before
[5:55:09] Bagz_69: Wouldnt it be easier to toss a tesseract, then wire?
[5:55:10] nellydocs: quick maf
[5:55:14] banshay3: gonny look dope

[5:55:49] fbritoferreira: @mailchad yeah but you have two schools one for 1-6 and another for 7-11
[5:55:51] ChadTBiggums: noice
[5:55:55] Dagmoo: base your*
[5:56:02] sorefingers: coming back to fun boardgames to play with stoned friends, check out temple of horrors for your holidays. its like a simplified version of werewolf in the best way. super compact(2 pokerdecks) and so much fun. most of the game is pure pokerface and lying to everyone haha
[5:56:03] Dagmoo: omg tour*
[5:56:29] preparedincanada: @Dagmoo Sweet thanks
[5:56:40] MaIlchad: @fbritoferreira oh no, rarely they are the same school, they have 2 "schools" but they are the same building and same grounds. those schools are really big...
[5:56:47] fbritoferreira: Move them one down and move the orbs to the top
[5:57:01] Gotizie: 1 too high
[5:57:09] thexvar1able: that is out of core
[5:57:15] Janzert: they won't work there will they?
[5:57:27] aundros: thats output. Input is arrows in towards the core
[5:57:30] SubbDogg: the orbs cant be above the center
[5:57:30] Sevgeni: glass one down, level is too high
[5:57:31] Zonear: Wrong placement
[5:57:42] fbritoferreira: @mailchad yeah normally you have to separate schools but they work together
[5:57:44] wagad: Wouldnt it look better underneath?
[5:57:45] EpicTitan232: Orbs are to high, need to go one level down
[5:57:58] xCutie: waffleBlind waffleBlind waffleBlind
[5:58:01] BlackNocturne: Painting machine for facades, ya
[5:58:10] cmmeth: put them in the ground
[5:58:13] thexvar1able: it will become symmetrical when you place the last one
[5:58:21] wagad: Hide it underneath, would look better
[5:58:27] slamer110: i wil look better with the forth transfer block there
[5:58:47] Gotizie: 1 too high still
[5:58:48] thexvar1able: channel
[5:58:52] cmmeth: orbs have to be in the ground
[5:58:52] iQuantumFlux: To make it look how you want you’d want to drop the floor off of being the center of the core, @giantwaffle
[5:58:57] DarkvirusNZ: wrong y level
[5:59:02] mrleonehart: Wrong Y level
[5:59:02] maccabeus: PauseChamp

[5:59:29] b357: you didnt set the transivers
[5:59:30] aundros: You only need to click the one waffle I think
[5:59:34] DarkvirusNZ: put the block 2 down, under the orb
[5:59:34] kane1941: follow the flow
[5:59:35] BroCreed1: The glass has to be at the same level at the center of the core @giantwaffle
[5:59:37] wagad: You havent done space
[5:59:44] iQuantumFlux: You really should drop the floor
[5:59:45] Nicholasm17: It’s not receiving from the solar farm
[5:59:46] CatsRusOfficial: Set the receivers
[5:59:47] b0ltz12: the cables might need to be set to extract only
[5:59:48] babyaddalyn: you havent set the solars yet?
[5:59:49] Peppermint_Wizard: The glass must be level with core
[5:59:52] Purecrew: You havent put anything on that channel in space
[5:59:53] b357: The space transivers doesnt send
[5:59:54] Feist_: the glass must be even with center of core
[5:59:59] iQuantumFlux: Don’t put the floor at the middle Y level of the core
[6:00:06] fbritoferreira: About to break the base watch
[6:00:06] PxlSauce: does anyone have a recommendation for a 27" 144hz 1440p monitor?
[6:00:19] sp4wn999: if you rename everthing goes down
[6:00:19] Lightning00Blade: Change only one tessaract on the solar farm
[6:00:33] Jaydepps00: casual friday
[6:00:45] TuxLafitte: Maybe move half the transievers over first, then move the other half once the system is setup correctly... danHmm
[6:01:00] GameDadel: 2mil being used
[6:01:03] thexvar1able: you are using the rest
[6:01:06] fbritoferreira: Time to upgrade that conduit
[6:01:15] Snah__: SUSSY
[6:01:22] cmmeth: soyeah
[6:01:53] cmmeth: put the pylons in the ground?
[6:01:58] wagad: click last orb
[6:02:14] fbritoferreira: Why not put the pylons in the ground
[6:02:25] cmmeth: COPIUM
[6:02:27] GameDadel: bounty?
[6:02:30] goldenknight22: all those sapphire ore KEKW
[6:02:36] Snah__: i like seeing them

[6:05:47] xTOT3Nx: @Giantwaffle how long do you think it will take until you finish the pack?
[6:05:49] Bagz_69: Wont all the otehr machines now need crafting cards? since there wont be passive inventory to pull? @Giantwaffle
[6:05:50] Relyte: If you guys want less lag, use interfaces with pipes instead of import/export buses… cuts down a lot
[6:05:57] Danishwiz: Server is fine YEP
[6:06:07] ForgottenTime: i think twitch is taking a poop
[6:06:08] Snah__: monkaHmm

[6:06:14] CurlySC: In that 1h long Nomifactory Video , did they all the stuff you guys are doing ?
[6:06:38] BroCreed1: It’s almost funny how things get bigger bigger bigger because you have to scale horizontally then you get to a point where all those machines can get replaced with one machine
[6:06:41] MaIlchad: yep, it can be much more effecient to have an input line into the same machines instead of individual import/export buses
[6:06:45] Megaghost: Megaghost subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 69 months!

[6:19:50] derwolff85: What about the random transceivers you placed in the next, soo they still work?
[6:19:50] tomey36: It will turn off a bunch of machines

[6:21:35] Variandra: but WHY. is it hurting anything?
[6:21:41] Yogithebaer: you could create a new channel for orb output and start putting any new machines on that channel because im pretty sure the transceivers can do multiple channels

[6:25:09] MaIlchad: oh yeah. Forge Energy is 1-1 with Redstone Flux right?
[6:25:09] BlackNocturne: Doesn't the fusion reactor have extra power output?
[6:25:09] IamtheJK: arent you just pulling from machines on the network?
[6:25:12] CommanderUrsus: reactor?
[6:25:13] PxlSauce: maybe it's looping
[6:25:14] Dvaina: Dynamos?
[6:25:17] CommanderUrsus: err nuclear
[6:25:17] pinhead_larynx: fusion reactor?
[6:25:18] Rozz161: check the core input

[6:25:59] YOUCEP: check transreceivers
[6:26:00] Mraav: MAYBE THE DYNAMOS ?
[6:26:01] lvyEartman: is the fusion reactor giving power??
[6:26:02] Slash_Ignore: looping in space
[6:26:02] drsnaki96: chat wouldn't looping mean input and output at the same rate so it would give extra free power?
[6:26:02] Venamah: disconnet the dynamos, from your power grid and check that number again
[6:26:02] Mraav: sry
[6:26:03] zzzDai: Fusion reactor?
[6:26:04] IlsaGold: The displayed number might be the max and not the mean value
[6:26:04] tomey36: Are the dynamos exporting to the teseracts?
[6:26:10] brainlag: meltdown incoming
[6:26:12] Rozz161: you could be sending from the output back
[6:26:21] CommanderUrsus: @DonGromus All The Mods 8 for the latest greatest kitchen sink pack; StoneBlock 3 was pretty good.

[6:33:28] Gotizie: I would try to add another transceiver in space to see if the RF goes up since each transceiver added more input
[6:33:28] DemonsDawn: Do you have your receivers set to Wumbo?
[6:33:28] A_Wildland_Firefighter: @Giantwaffle Its colder up there so less resistance in the wires. Duh.

[6:35:44] TheWonderLlama: Looping NODDERS
[6:35:45] MDSZilla: You need to change only 1 cable to see if it makes an impact Waffle

[6:35:56] Snah__: is that 37 minutes?
[6:35:59] Smileynator: enderio is pretty notorious for that stuff
[6:36:00] DarkvirusNZ: set them to output oonly

[6:38:48] Jaydepps00: @Giantwaffle try octadic but not compressed
[6:38:49] gikei: getting filled and emptied on the tick
[6:38:50] Wolfieguns: can you move the output ones to input for more input?
[6:38:51] Morlega: EnderIO by default doesn't have level 5 capacitors
[6:38:51] IamtheJK: But if you look at ETA for filling it isnt moving and thats whyit looks like its looping
[6:38:52] pinhead_larynx: So what youre saying is you never needed the orb in the first place

[6:39:28] mrleonehart: Conduit I mean
[6:39:30] Warkless: you could double check with ender io power monitor
[6:39:33] Jaydepps00: @Giantwaffle try octadic but not compressed
[6:39:33] TigerLuv: is that one of the things that the patch fixed?
[6:39:33] KritterIsBack: @Giantwaffle is the ETA time going down?
[6:39:35] MAX_EVIL: test it in a creative world ? to see if the power is fake or real.
[6:39:37] mrleonehart: Conduit import only !!!!!
[6:39:37] Polkich: Don't tesseracts have like internal capacity that is not visible in GUI?
[6:39:40] PxlSauce: could you @you could set up a loop with 2 tesseract systems feeding into each other

[6:40:18] Hatemodsminecraft: can you make triple compressed capacitors to check if this is capacitor issue?
[6:40:20] Morlega: @Giantwaffle EnderIO has a bunch of internal multipliers based on capacitor level that can be quadratic, use weird polynoms that can go negative if wrongly used, ... I blame the level 5 capacitor LUL
[6:40:24] Elfikalio: It iiiis what it iiiis
[6:40:25] Finokas: Deactivate and activate the core

[6:40:27] kypudo: do the same in the tessarcs
[6:40:31] IamtheJK: Duping power lol
[6:40:41] banshay3: hook one up with a single cable and see if it has the same effect?
[6:40:41] Devaray: Devaray subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 6 months! 
[6:40:50] deadgolfer: last cable still in/out, could that do it?
[6:40:55] officialhunterx: see what happens if you disconnect the base
[6:40:56] Jaydepps00: @Giantwaffle try octadic but not compressed, compressed ones are from a addon mod iirc
[6:40:56] Tetsomina: What if some byproduct from some process is outputting RF that is going back into the system
[6:41:02] Tabakhase: turn ff space YEP
[6:41:02] MDSZilla: Waffle someone added a extra 0 at the end of the Capcitor Multiplier and did a Whoopsie
[6:41:09] IronGajeel: capacitors give extra bonuses, just like they give to other machines @Giantwaffle
[6:41:10] Morlega: Like transceivers have a power loss on inter-dimensional transfer. The "loss" might've become negative because of weird unexpected math
[6:41:10] GameDadel: cheating in this pack to get done before KSP2 i see Kappa
[6:41:11] MrMoneybagMan: space power is just better YEP

[6:41:22] Morlega: Yeah level 5 is by Nomifactory

[6:43:09] DemonsDawn: can also be a transceiver internal buffer not validating its ticks properly. so it just creates power
[6:43:17] pinhead_larynx: okay but how much are you sending to the base? are all of the outputs set up?
[6:43:18] TechNaOkami: maybe the code sends it but dosent check the drain before hand

[6:43:44] CommanderUrsus: yeah I thought the transceivers were parasitic, like there was 10% loss or something
[6:43:46] DefCom_: can you build a multiplicative loop than? like a generator?
[6:43:47] Tetsomina: The problem is that the orb is not isolated from the systems to really understand it
[6:43:48] Morlega: I've checked the code, there isn't a weird bug like it overlooking that
[6:43:52] Smileynator: what i find weird, is that input still somehow needs the multiple inputs

[6:43:55] Snah__: pepeLaugh

[6:44:00] stickman_02: It’ll be full in just over a day lmao
[6:44:04] CommanderUrsus: maybe that was the old school tesseracts
[6:44:13] coolcake2: call @soaryn
[6:44:17] C_nrad: The best way to exploit it would be to put one transceiver on send and then receive it from more.
[6:44:21] thecodealive_original: it's limited by capacitor not conduit right?
[6:44:29] Bagz_69: @Giantwaffle Got somthiing to try, can you try just having 1 transever in space?
[6:44:38] Snah__: we haven't even had the orb online for an hour and its 40% full

[6:48:47] Jaydepps00: ???
[6:48:56] Smileynator: It's those capacitors
[6:48:57] PxlSauce: @Giantwaffle you could test this with this: set up a loop with 2 tesseract battery systems feeding into each other
[6:48:58] aundros: lmao
[6:49:01] Smileynator: the input seems largely unrelated

[6:49:20] banshay3: man the dopamine when you solve a bug like this
[6:49:20] Flobu_: you could check the code xD
[6:49:22] fbritoferreira: They probably allocated to small of a integer for this and it’s overflowing it
[6:49:33] LsTheRoberto: And is that the only way to get power across dimensions?
[6:49:40] dariomtc: probably used integer instead of float  monkaMath
[6:49:41] maxxxwinder: Ender IO has been re written like 20 times by different people

[6:49:50] TheShylo: @fbritoferreira i was thinking the same
[6:49:50] monto6: what is going on
[6:49:51] Morlega: Transceiver uses power scaling, cubic scaling, quadratic scaling and some custom scaling internally monkaS
[6:50:00] cmmeth: waffleSTARE MathTime
[6:50:14] Smileynator: It only needs 1 row of cables
[6:50:15] MrMoneybagMan: and got more OMEGALUL
[6:50:18] Smileynator: why are you changign the rest?
[6:50:19] noxiiiouse: not true in your base you using it or no ?
[6:50:19] zzzDai: You using it on the other side
[6:50:27] samsonicus: Don't you still use content tweaker on the recieving side?
[6:50:28] teddytalent: sometimes we just have to accept the reality we can't change. quote my uncle
[6:50:32] mrleonehart: Put another tesserac now
[6:50:37] Smileynator: the cable upgrade made no changes
[6:50:39] noxiiiouse: you sitll using compressed in your base ?
[6:50:41] SubbDogg: what if you change the other side to the smaller ones as well?
[6:50:43] stickman_02: @giantwaffle change all the capacitors in the ones at the base
[6:50:44] LsTheRoberto: more EVFs SMOrc

[6:50:57] mrleonehart: @Giantwaffle your magnet is off!!
[6:50:58] cheppard: can you use normal capacitors instead of octadic?
[6:50:58] Morlega: The weird thing is that we're sending more than the solar should produce
[6:51:19] Jaydepps00: surely pepeLaugh
[6:51:20] CommanderUrsus: it's transceivers all the way down
[6:51:22] Janzert: But every time you added a receiver it went up as well

[6:51:32] biolet8: 60
[6:51:34] TheIrishGuy: 72

[6:51:42] Snah__: LOL
[6:51:44] Jaydepps00: OH SHIT
[6:51:46] Yogithebaer: could it be that the transceiver sees power to pull and takes the power regardless if other transceivers are going to pull the power then multiple transceivers take the power
[6:51:47] Warkless: Looking I'm watching
[6:51:47] MDSZilla: @Giantwaffle Update the Receiving END

[6:52:23] notn3w: @Giantwaffle Buffer overflow
[6:52:23] Smileynator: java is quite old Kappa

[6:52:29] TigerLuv: walls start melting
[6:52:33] MDSZilla: @Giantwaffle Get him to upgrade the Receiving End
[6:52:34] banshay3: if it were an overflow you'd be negative right now you mupped
[6:52:37] n3wtpond: It’s a test. If you steal the power then the ball blows up when it’s full
[6:52:38] bar10dr: Search for "DraconicEvolution.zs" in the nomifactory github
[6:52:41] MDSZilla: It'll literally double as well

[6:53:27] chaoskub: Look at the transceivers. The in/out shows you it's just looping
[6:53:28] PxlSauce: it's the output
[6:53:29] mahoriiii77: it is your solar full outout
[6:53:36] inforv: maybe need more transmittors in the base?
[6:53:36] zzzDai: Maybe the panels are just outputting way more then you though
[6:53:42] BMYGRLFRND: that's x4 the 16M you expected
[6:53:43] MDSZilla: You gotta change the capacitors on the receiving end
[6:53:44] Nicholasm17: You are maxing the cables on the input beacons
[6:53:45] Larsen159: you need more transcievers at the base now
[6:53:45] aundros: Yeah, think maybe you were underdelivering before?
[6:53:54] Morlega: The conduits are limited
[6:53:56] Snah__: more pylons

[6:58:19] tomey36: Nice
[6:58:22] aundros: Second orb time!
[6:58:23] boogerbomb01: Is it not outputting anything?
[6:58:24] TelRehiad: need 2nd orb! Madge
[6:58:24] pinhead_larynx: are you even sending that much to the base though??
[6:58:25] brainlag: contemplating that orb
[6:58:30] GoatXYZ: Does this mean that everything with a buffer will now super fill up?
[6:58:32] officialhunterx: trash can
[6:58:32] Proxyiy: can you stop the input to check how much energy the base is using?
[6:58:36] officialhunterx: real quick
[6:58:40] Jaydepps00: speedrun fillup when?
[6:58:41] Simon04090: Need a tier 8 orb now
[6:58:45] TheIrishGuy: only 4 hours ish
[6:58:53] daedmissica0: switch off solar to see how much yor are using
[6:58:57] cheppard: time to downgrade to normal double layer caps
[6:59:01] hisdue: ApuScience like 7
[6:59:05] DonGromus: more than 5
[6:59:06] SubbDogg: atleast 4
[6:59:07] chromosomeboy54: 13
[6:59:08] InternetPlumber: more than 3
[6:59:08] Fressure: bout tree fiddy
[6:59:08] BlackNocturne: Threeve
[6:59:10] Hatemodsminecraft: build tier 8 send the energy to it and also use this bug, you'll get even more energy @Giantwaffle
[6:59:11] Snah__: ItIsWhatItIs
[6:59:12] Kevincav: I've filled 2 tier 8 batters in 1 day once with an infinite rf glitch
[6:59:12] daemonaedryn: More than one
[6:59:12] notn3w: @Giantwaffle give or take 3
[6:59:13] grid_space: 4.5 days
[6:59:16] Moopoop: 3
[6:59:16] thexvar1able: years
[6:59:16] MDSZilla: Can you say that again?
[6:59:18] Kurbol: twelveteen
[6:59:24] officialhunterx: no
[6:59:25] grid_space: no
[6:59:31] daemonaedryn: try
[6:59:34] DareDeFlug: Can you make it now ?
[6:59:34] MDSZilla: ChatGPT just divided it correctly
[6:59:37] Duvenel: Maybe if you defined what a tick was
[6:59:38] hisdue: CiGrip build another core in space and send power between them
[6:59:38] MDSZilla: And pretty fast
[6:59:43] Morlega: Minecraft ticks were from before 2021
[6:59:45] Cadoceus: 22 and a half bananas
[6:59:46] Warkless: Now start looping it, infinite ower
[6:59:46] LittleAddictions: can you output the core back into the core for free power?
[6:59:47] DeadLiner: just build another orb and build a positive feedback loop
[6:59:51] officialhunterx: it takes 4 trillion a tick to do in 7 days
[6:59:52] inforv: yes
[6:59:52] VikashPindoria: waffle question... would that mean the power being sent out to the base is also increase because of the bug?
[6:59:54] Smileynator: It is
[6:59:57] Jaydepps00: probably
[6:59:57] zzzDai: So could you loop power back and forth between two dimensions for infinite power from 1 T1 solar power?
[6:59:57] Smileynator: it knows
[6:59:58] LinearLayer: Yep
[7:00:00] TOCO__: of course that's easy
[7:00:02] Duvenel: It should know
[7:00:09] Morlega: I would be surprised if it *didn't* know that
[7:00:11] coolcake2: 578704 days
[7:00:12] Duvenel: It has data up to 2021
[7:00:14] mechoriet: "In Minecraft, a tick is the basic unit of game time. One tick is equal to 1/20th of a second, and all game updates, including movement and physics, occur during a tick. A game tick is also the time it takes for a redstone clock to make one full circuit. It is used to measure the duration of events and the delay of certain game mechanics such as redstone contraptions."
[7:00:17] Jaydepps00: ItsWhatIts
[7:00:18] mechoriet: KEKW it knows
[7:00:23] MDSZilla: ChatGPT --> In Minecraft, the game runs at a tick rate of 20 ticks per second. This means that the game updates 20 times per second, and each update is called a tick. The tick rate is the rate at which the game world updates, and it can affect the gameplay, such as the speed at which entities move and animations play.
[7:00:23] banshay3: last time I asked chatGPT a math question it made x^2 into 2x^2
[7:00:26] Sui_Ume: @Giantwaffle it would take 146 years
[7:00:31] saltedCashewz: There's a lots of mentions of minecraft ticks in forums before 2022 so i'm sure
[7:00:37] mechoriet: gpt knows KEKW
[7:00:42] StraightErro: @Giantwaffle Can you create an positive infinite energy loop by sending energy from one powerbank to another and back again?
[7:00:53] Sam_1443: 90 billion

[7:02:00] banshay3: I've watched the reckful video about a billlion
[7:02:02] Jaydepps00: quadrillion or quintillion @Giantwaffle
[7:02:04] mikwitty: A million seconds is 12 days. A billion seconds is 31 years. A trillion seconds is 31,688 years.
[7:02:11] MDSZilla: It gives 6.8

[7:02:32] PMM67899: and the fact that there almost exists trillionairs or maybe it already does
[7:02:34] thexvar1able: slot is an understatement
[7:02:36] thecodealive_original: is a billion = 1000*million or million*million?

[7:04:00] CoolReal: It's 7 years
[7:04:03] CoolReal: Not 142
[7:04:09] TheIrishGuy: your doing 100mil /T so should it be * to get a second
[7:04:10] lvyEartman: its 100 million times 20 tick
[7:04:11] SubbDogg: gtnh is cbt
[7:04:12] Shame625: It produces 100mil per tick, so its 100mil * 20
[7:04:12] Meeerkatzen: I just dont get it
[7:04:12] dam_it_bobby: could do it in a hour if you set it up right
[7:04:15] KritterIsBack: that's just academic cbt
[7:04:17] Meeerkatzen: its not rocket science
[7:04:17] Jaydepps00: i guess we need a power upgrade if we want to fill up the giga orb :) @Giantwaffle
[7:04:19] masonthicks: just ran a chatgpt prompt for writing you a stream script. you're safe (for now)
[7:04:22] TheRiehlDeal: Guess the server becomes a family heirloom you tell your kids to keep paying for so the power orb can be full one day
[7:04:24] MDSZilla: Also unknown physics laws giving us free power
[7:04:26] MDSZilla: LUL
[7:04:29] Sui_Ume: it's like the step by step guide to become a billionaire: STEP 1: earn a million a year. STEP 2: do that for 1000 years

[7:04:57] Elfikalio: bot left
[7:04:57] noxiiiouse: 100*20 for a sec or no ? @Giantwaffle
[7:04:58] CoolReal: Isnt that the pattern?
[7:04:59] hakki1542: X/(100mill *20) is the same as X / 100mill / 20 chat
[7:05:01] TheIrishGuy: @giantwaffle should be * 20 as it per tick to second
[7:05:03] lvyEartman: the recipe is in the system

[7:08:10] thexvar1able: no
[7:08:14] masonthicks: FTB made data packs that implement the features of PC modded minecraft
[7:08:15] LokiRulez: its 2 different minecrafts
[7:08:16] weightmaker: just tested and transcievers and IO IS NOT FOR EACH SIDE
[7:08:18] StoppingRocket: its scuffed but works
[7:08:33] Daanaas: ftb  made stone block 2 and 1 for bedrock
[7:08:33] masonthicks: https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/marketplace/pdp?id=a713375b-c894-4fee-a4bc-e916500cbd29
[7:08:42] weightmaker: per block
[7:09:01] Snah__: wall of transcievers
[7:09:01] Moobot: You can sub to Waffle by clicking this neat link -> twitch.tv/giantwaffle/subscribe SUBprise
[7:09:07] Morlega: No he means that if the UI says the max transfer is 500k, it'll only transfer 500k out of its buffer (which is wrong)
[7:09:08] Daanaas: waffle ftb made strone block for bed rock
[7:09:12] weightmaker: each block can only handle its internal IO no matter which side you connect it to
[7:09:13] markus7cz: @Twin5un that's a great idea, I'm going to get mine, cheers!
[7:09:37] Daanaas: so mod minecraft is coming slowy
[7:09:38] officialhunterx: doesnt matter they dont need it anyways

[7:10:04] Driatin: Driatin subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 41 months! Happy Pizza Friday my dude
[7:10:15] weightmaker: also you should change the condtuit to extract only or input only on the transcievers or else it will loop and flicker the IO numbers
[7:10:19] Twin5un: @Twin5un Nice ! Cheers !
[7:10:20] CommanderUrsus: purple name, purple fire monkaHmm
[7:10:38] MrSlagle: you had to wrap each side with cable because you were limited by the capacity of the cable. Now you have op cable and the capacitors in the transceivers is too small.
[7:10:39] Morlega: Looking at the code, if the UI says a transceiver can send 1M power, and there are 5 receiving transceivers (with an empty enough buffer), it can actually transfer 5M in total (but limited by its buffer)
