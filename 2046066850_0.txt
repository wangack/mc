[1:01:30] MichaelDons: plus it's winter
[1:01:53] Mr_Turtlinator: Welcome to tax land
[1:02:03] snoreterra: @tetarchus that doesn‚Äôt make sense as the moon‚Äôs effect on the ocean are only noticeable because the sea is really big
[1:02:34] BestSecretPhoenix: @snoreterra You need to look at the bigger picture - Sokrates probably
[1:02:57] TheJok3r95: but chat can we appreciate how good mads looked in latest intagram post

[1:09:09] BestSecretPhoenix: I love that when you jump with the Grog Barrel, the music it plays F's up LUL
[1:10:24] BestSecretPhoenix: Probably a good idea.
[1:10:35] Slimothy_Jimbles: probs smart to sell
[1:11:00] South_North: South_North subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 25 months! FLEEF NODDERS
[1:11:08] Adelar_Lerigon: looked away for a moment, was it a reaper 5 or what? lumenWat
[1:11:28] cuddlebudy: I feel like this month's emissary ledger ranks is going to be a challenge up until the final minute with the new season dropping last week
[1:11:29] Adelar_Lerigon: Ah, I see.
[1:11:48] South_North: didnt play this whole last season
[1:11:58] cuddlebudy: Yikes
[1:12:16] Mr_Turtlinator: 60 million...
[1:12:30] South_North: right... but palword
[1:12:36] South_North: palworld*
[1:12:37] Mr_Turtlinator: Ye I know, but still haha
[1:12:56] South_North: unfortunate timing for sot
[1:13:05] South_North: its no pokemon
[1:13:11] RagingPhoenix33: I like enshrouded better
[1:13:16] South_North: plus im playing with guys from work so thats nice
[1:13:24] RagingPhoenix33: yes
[1:13:31] South_North: im opposite
[1:13:41] BestSecretPhoenix: Hopefully Game Freak learns from this and maybe now realize how much the people have been screaming for a pokemon game like Palworld.
[1:13:48] WhiplashBRx: im going to a third phase of  legends of the veil, someone to help me?
[1:13:50] South_North: i dont get the vibes looking at enshrouded
[1:13:53] SirBorkTheThird: I just spent the better part of 10 minutes running from a ship called "The IRS"... They're after my tax evasive tendencies. micromadsHype
[1:14:13] cuddlebudy: micromadsLOL micromadsLOL micromadsLOL
[1:14:33] BestSecretPhoenix: @South_North I agree.. I was abit hyped for Enshrouded.. but now it just reminds me of Mines of Moria so im not feeling it LUL
[1:14:35] topendbuzza: micromadsRave micromadsRave micromadsRave
[1:15:13] RagingPhoenix33: palworld is just a very cheap knockoff of pokemon made by shady individuals
[1:15:25] topendbuzza: P3 Reload micromadsBongo
[1:15:37] South_North: anyway sleep time for me
[1:15:39] BestSecretPhoenix: @RagingPhoenix33 Or a knockoff of Dragon Quest? LUL
[1:15:41] South_North: bye chat
[1:15:58] RagingPhoenix33: @RagingPhoenix33 or ark
[1:15:58] South_North: micromadsPop
[1:16:12] BestSecretPhoenix: @RagingPhoenix33 100% Ark vibe.
[1:16:45] BestSecretPhoenix: Or... not even vibe, its cloned and changed abit to not make it obvious LUL
[1:17:13] topendbuzza: ark meets rimworld meets pokemon
[1:17:33] BestSecretPhoenix: I tried it myself. Had a blast the first 2-3 hours, but its just not hitting the spots.
[1:17:57] SirBorkTheThird: @RagingPhoenix33 Pok√©mon company already declared it intends to investigate and start the legal process for it. I've not had time to play it yet, but that cannot be a great sign. Unsure if I should even purchase it at this point at the risk of it getting a legal bonk.

[1:19:38] garmarlar: micromadsBongo
[1:19:40] Adelar_Lerigon: Ah, right, forgot
[1:19:57] topendbuzza: how long is the day/night in this game?
[1:20:06] BestSecretPhoenix: @SirBorkTheThird They wont have a case tbh. Since pokemons are closely cloned from Dragon Quest. Game Freaks just wants to investigate to see if anything is pokemon so they can shut it down.
[1:20:07] RagingPhoenix33: @SirBorkTheThird fair enough, i bought it, played it and now trying to get my money back lol
[1:20:33] tbende_hun: SeemsGood SeemsGood SeemsGood
[1:20:57] cuddlebudy: Has anybody been watching hazbin hotel now that the show finallllly dropped?  Changing cherrybombs accent to Australian caught me off guard... I was like wait thats not Mads on the tv

[1:23:34] topendbuzza: rammers
[1:23:54] cuddlebudy: But they did get an American VA to do the Australian accent. Amazon couldn't afford a real one micromadsLOL
[1:25:06] Slimothy_Jimbles: yeah not alot of aussies around
[1:25:28] Slimothy_Jimbles: sarcasm
[1:26:13] Rastasmed: Australia is not real
[1:26:14] cuddlebudy: That's fair. The veronicas and Mads and hugh Jackman were all busy that day so they had to get someone from Arizona micromadsLOL
[1:26:39] Sarioah: harpoon moment
[1:26:42] Sarioah: doroUgh

[1:28:04] Slimothy_Jimbles: so did the other 2 just bugger of completely
[1:28:21] Sarioah: literally only exists to shoot at other players yet that skele captain's going for an ocean cruise instead tijkaLol
[1:28:30] cuddlebudy: But yeah I liked hazbin hotel alot (never got into helluva boss) and have been enjoying the new show
[1:28:39] Adelar_Lerigon: peaceballs amirite lumenFine
[1:28:55] mrc_147: Anyone else feel like they increased the amount of curse balls the Skelly ships have been firing?
[1:29:02] amorisongforge: Do you recommend shooting firebombs at skellies to keep the deck clear?
[1:29:07] BestSecretPhoenix: Choppy waters... Hate it lUL
[1:29:47] topendbuzza: going to go lurk, it's time for some sportsball
[1:29:53] mrc_147: That's probably it.
[1:30:03] mrc_147: Less curse balls zooming over my head
[1:30:07] amorisongforge: Thanks, great advice! :D
[1:30:22] BestSecretPhoenix: I feel like the skelly ships fire more Peaceballs than any other cursed ball.
[1:30:31] mrc_147: Unless it's an anchor ball. They hit the first and miss every other one after...
[1:31:40] Sarioah: Jebaited
[1:31:56] Zenzity_01: Ahoy!
[1:32:02] mrc_147: I would agree with the green to purple ratio dropping
[1:32:03] Sarioah: I literally haven't seen a green one for weeks jesscapHmm
[1:32:06] lollipanker: they have removed green from skelly ships
[1:32:10] BestSecretPhoenix: I 100% agree.
[1:32:12] Adelar_Lerigon: If I'm not mistaken, the skelly fleet cannot have green balls anymore since Season 9
[1:32:31] Slimothy_Jimbles: i get anchor balled all the time
[1:33:03] mrc_147: This is super toxic but I do miss hearing the complete moment of defeat in my buddy's voice when getting sleep balled.
[1:33:21] pnpthedea1er: Good Morning, Fine Beautiful People...I hope the sun finds you today and that it finds you well!!! <3
[1:33:41] Zenzity_01: How are you finding Season 11?
[1:33:46] mrc_147: @slimothy_jimbles oh I get an anchor ball and they miss every shot until I give up and raise the anchor and then they magically hit the next one
[1:34:12] Sarioah: guess I'll sink then doroLost
[1:34:59] Sarioah: LUL
[1:35:00] Zenzity_01: End 'o Season 8
[1:35:04] mrc_147: Cannon ball demast from Skelly ships
[1:35:20] mrc_147: Rare had their toxic PvE pants on that day apparently
[1:35:46] Sarioah: when I first started playing I spent ages trying to de-mast skele ships for practice, trying to work out why my aim was so bad since they weren't dropping tijkaSip
[1:35:56] cuddlebudy: I needed to button up my free drops yesterday. I watched/lurked cliff the story guy for a bit and he randomly mentioned the skull hunt that you 2 went on and had nice things to say about you and us micromadsHeart
[1:36:17] mrc_147: Well that's wholesome
[1:36:29] Sarioah: naww

[1:41:15] iceman0587: 3 raiders from iceman0587 have joined! 
[1:42:52] Knackers_98: is there a way to see what each item sold for individually after you've deposited? the banners didn't work haha
[1:43:09] Rastasmed: does hardway still play SoT tho ? im glad he is more happy now <3
[1:43:34] Rastasmed: :)
[1:43:55] shmoopsie: What are the banners even for. I haven't tested yet
[1:44:20] cuddlebudy: The other day I snagged tickets for the avril Lavigne and simple plan tour. Was excited about that.
[1:45:47] mrc_147: Lol flash backs to middle school
[1:46:18] mrc_147: Avril Lavigne might have been high school
[1:47:09] cuddlebudy: @mrc_147 for me complicated and sk8er Boy was middle but the rest was highschool
[1:47:10] Moly187: hullo whats up micromadsWave
[1:47:20] warbringer159: @shmoopsie its a trophy/trinket so you put it on your ship what else would you do with it lol
[1:48:12] Sarioah: micromadsGrump
[1:48:21] jenji_mccool: micromadsCozy
[1:48:27] Moly187: wait...do i not get the drops if i linked my accounts after i received them?
[1:48:48] deinaxxx: where do supplies spawn when you buy them for the ship?
[1:48:57] Sarioah: @deinaxxx in your barrels
[1:49:12] Sarioah: if they're crates you grab them off the merchant
[1:49:21] northenvikinggod: @Moly187 did you claim them?
[1:49:50] Insta_Leaf: @Moly187 It took almost half a day for the drops to come up ingame for me
[1:50:05] mrc_147: @cuddlebudy they weren't my go to music genre but definitely that era. I can appreciate the nostalgic factor now that I'm old and would probably go if I was offered tickets or someone I knew wanted to go
[1:50:12] Moly187: @Moly187 ye i meant ingame
[1:50:14] Slimothy_Jimbles: thses guys are stubborn
[1:50:18] Moly187: @Insta_Leaf okay ty
[1:50:19] tetarchus: @Moly187 If you did claim them, you should get them even if you link afterwards, but it can take up to 72 hours for them to show up.
[1:50:50] lollipanker: guys I have connected my sot account to twitch but for some reason it still says connection required in my inventory
[1:50:57] lollipanker: has anybody had that problem before?
[1:51:14] Pwn_Ragnarr: Which guild lvl are you ?
[1:51:22] cuddlebudy: @mrc_147 I'm going on a emo/pop punk cruise in less than a month to the Bahamas. Like 15 bands from that time and like 1600 fans on a week long crusie
[1:51:27] lollipanker: I linked it via sot not via twich
[1:51:36] tetarchus: @lollipanker Yeah, mine shows the 'link' button still, even though they're linked - all other connections show that they're linked with a tick, but SoT doesn't for some reason.
[1:51:48] Slimothy_Jimbles: just gonna keep doing drive buy sells?
[1:52:05] lollipanker: @tetarchus and u also didn‚Äôt receive stuff ingame?
[1:52:23] lollipanker: im still waiting for the next last drops ingame
[1:52:30] mrc_147: @cuddlebudy oh god. I would do the pop punk but never really got into emo. But would absolutely rock out on that cruise
[1:52:38] tetarchus: @lollipanker I get it all in game - it's been that way for the last few yras and I still get the drops (I think, I don't go on and check each time)
[1:52:49] NightMyth: Shots!
[1:53:05] mrc_147: Hahaha is that the emo's not dead cruise?
[1:53:42] Slimothy_Jimbles: would of loved to see their reaction to the island cannon
[1:53:46] Sarioah: jesscapHehe pest mode
[1:54:07] Pwn_Ragnarr: you die on purpose just to dodge the sea fort Kappa
[1:54:08] NightMyth: Perfect calculated return from the ferry
[1:54:30] Slimothy_Jimbles: probs got time to seel at sanctuary
[1:54:36] Slimothy_Jimbles: *sell
[1:54:37] pnpthedea1er: They kind of deserve pest mode, they were obvs only after the CoF which you've obvs sold by now and they're still chasing...
[1:55:07] tetarchus: Was it the Seasoned Sailor trumpet that was the new drop in this latest set?
[1:55:22] Adelar_Lerigon: @tetarchus yes
[1:55:36] Insta_Leaf: "Shut up Meg!" has never been so fitting
[1:55:39] Sarioah: 2v1 and the shrouded pops up nicktaKek
[1:55:55] mrc_147: @cuddlebudy please tell me you are going on a cruise with bless the fall. I went to high school with them
[1:55:56] tetarchus: @Adelar_Lerigon Thanks. In that case @lollipanker I did get the latest set of drops, even with it still showing the 'connect' button under the drops.
[1:56:03] Slimothy_Jimbles: time to team with meg
[1:56:29] Pwn_Ragnarr: Meg go help her !
