[0:31:45] Harmar: the coolers are massive but the card itself is tiny
[0:31:46] Orin_The_Sly: You can almost drive them KEKW
[0:31:47] Mandorake: line must go up
[0:31:47] UnholyLP: no one buys them, i havent seen so many available gpus
[0:31:48] PureSpider: have you LOOKED at the 4090 founders edition?!
[0:31:48] AshhanX: 1080 gamers
[0:31:49] ItzJord: I'm buying a 40 series and a 7950x3D build ASAP 😆 🤣
[0:31:52] tcRunaway: Die size is important because nvidia pays per wafer. And smaller die means they get more chips on every wafer meaning the price for the chip is less
[0:31:53] PureSpider: fuck me, small size
[0:31:53] UnholyLP: in a long time
[0:31:56] officialhunterx: dye size prob
[0:31:59] Thr0h: it's mostly heat sink
[0:32:14] PureSpider: tcRunaway and yet, they charge MORE
[0:32:16] Flobu_: the card is really tin, the cooler is just a huge chunk of metal
[0:32:20] BuLLeT_LV: I am considering now smth like RX 6600 :D
[0:32:25] Harmar: @tcRunaway that, and it should be cheaper because but isnt LUL
[0:32:26] aundros: i'm pretty happy with my 580
[0:32:26] SmokyMtnRed: Just buy a separate case for your video card and longer cables.
[0:32:29] ValueTown: nvidia is pricing these so high because they over made the 3000 series and didn't sell them all
[0:32:32] ItzJord: I haven't had a  decent PC in 2 years lol so it's go big or go home time
[0:32:41] BobTaco21: I want to add more ram to my pc
[0:32:42] glove_17: smaller gpu, the burning it will do, so need huge fan
[0:32:44] sytar023: prices are whatever, personnaly, investing 5k for a hobby you do everyday is perfectly reasonnable
[0:32:52] sytar023: hell make it 10k
[0:32:58] jambag00: look at the size of a cpu cooler than chip size
[0:33:00] nick43087: Trueee. @ValueTown
[0:33:06] hydoto: The only thing i do not understand is why a normal person needs so much GPU power, like how many games use that much?
[0:33:08] Harmar: im been looking at 3090's when and if i can get my new computer built because the price was stupid
[0:33:13] Moopoop: I was going to upgrade my PC b/c I've still got a 1080 but these prices are what stopping right now. Just an empty pc case looking at me lol
[0:33:18] aundros: imagine the pressure they have to deliver the next big thing. Maybe the 4080 wasn't really ment to be
[0:33:24] jmm548: yeah it basicly the 3080 12 gb model but 100 bucks cheaper
[0:33:27] WDForty: every single tech-tuber had the same thing to say about the 4070ti
[0:33:29] jmm548: 4080*
[0:33:30] BobTaco21: What Reddit page is that
[0:33:35] djSimSi: @Giantwaffle watch linus' newest vid

[0:33:47] BobTaco21: Ohh ok
[0:33:51] MasterKraft: I bought a 3060 10 months ago, im sad :(
[0:33:55] hbboia: same @itmeTB

[0:34:55] Wazepas: AMD themselves said it was a problem
[0:34:56] saltedCashewz: jays talked about it
[0:34:56] BuLLeT_LV: I read smth about it :D
[0:34:57] sytar023: yea., something to do with the vapour chamber not working properly
[0:35:03] WDForty: i think someone said it comes down to their vapor chamber?
[0:35:04] UnholyLP: atleast intel is trying to get into gpus, so more competition
[0:35:07] ValueTown: debaur figured it out. the cooler's vapor chamber is broken. it most likely doesn't have enough coolant inside
[0:35:08] arkun_: It’s a flaw in the reference design for the cooler causing the thermal issues
[0:35:13] jayp_84: no lol
[0:35:13] dennixfailalot: @DaemonSzyman waffle just said it 's done
[0:35:16] WDForty: AIB non-ref cards don't have the issue i think
[0:35:17] Rollingx: how do you fuck up a design... they MUST know that its flawed its tested a million time before release isnt it?
[0:35:18] jmm548: of course not
[0:35:22] Urgval: if they drop 4070ti to 499 Im gonna insta buy it since i run on 2070 super still

[0:46:41] PureSpider: wowee
[0:46:47] Harmar: or the last or 2nd last EE it was found by accident because someone smacked a wall instead of shooting a spot

[1:47:53] Sentinel1_9: @Giantwaffle whats the fors and against for upgrading to win11?

[1:59:40] thomasausen: can you set the me terminals number of items again
[2:00:08] loaded57: you can use oak trim to connect each line of drawers
[2:00:15] DarkbuilderX: Trim acts like a drawer for connecting around corners and stuff
[2:00:17] lilgangstagoth1: u can use trim to link drawers together but dont think that will help with what ur doing
[2:00:17] loaded57: 1 drawer control can go 12 in every direction
[2:00:20] DaddyDiddy: automation KEKW
[2:00:26] IAmJester: Trim is U G L Y.
[2:00:45] Immp: So a drawer controller on reads 12 blocks away, but it you link rows of drawers with Drawer Trim, you can link them together. But yes, unless you hide them , they are ugly
[2:00:46] jmm548: i like the dark oak
[2:00:51] korderoi: are they backwards? since you're going to come in the room from the other way

[2:10:07] DragonApoc: Is that cable any better or just works better with other cables ?
[2:10:13] Saishu_: to remove only one wire in the junction you need the yeta wrench
[2:10:20] DragonApoc: Word
[2:10:37] EndenPayne: This would be impossible without unlimited channels
[2:10:48] Vaarel: also they can be used with facades which is big
[2:11:12] Larklen: there is one not locked I think? the one was that attached weird, right?
[2:11:15] Larklen: or am I giga Pepega

[2:13:18] Vaarel: I've always reserved autocrafting for things that get used a lot not things I'll build once and never again
[2:13:33] GOLD_EXPO: Did you lock the last one?
[2:13:39] loaded57: didnt lock the last one

[2:17:00] Littleme02: i'm not worried about whats going to be for dinner lets just say
[2:17:11] DaddyDiddy: oh waffle my certificate finally finished crafting it only took 9 days
[2:17:17] Smithii: It's not about the quantity of fish, but the smell they emit SNIFFA

[2:18:33] Pvtsjoerd: why nothing on demand?
[2:18:58] Allmostdone: Couldn’t you increase the size of the crafters and computers
[2:19:06] PureSpider: @Pvtsjoerd because this pack is meant to passively craft stock of most things
[2:19:09] Saytos1: KEKW
[2:19:09] Smithii: KEKW
[2:19:10] Saishu_: arent you using a drawer with a 1stack downgrade as limit?
[2:19:13] AleXanDreMau: KEKW
[2:19:13] Sentinel1_9: KEKW
[2:19:16] Madarion: didnt you limit the mainframe etc to only 1 stack?
[2:19:18] DragonApoc: See ya C
[2:19:20] InternetPlumber: on demand is too slow and crafting cards are too server intensive at massive scale
[2:19:29] 0omkins: Ci-ya....

[2:19:53] Yakobro: @Saishu_ depends how many they want
[2:19:56] Pvtsjoerd: @PureSpider I mean I get that you want to passively craft most things but nothing

[2:27:21] PureSpider: and you not once stop to think "hold up, this shit kinda weird"?! not once?
[2:27:27] SailorWS: PureSpider isekais have a tendency to kill their MC's with trucks at the start
[2:27:28] IronGajeel: chat someone saw My Life as Inukai-san’s Dog yesterday? KEKW
[2:27:28] All_Tech: or it shows the person hit having this crazy adventure while the driver's life spirals down hill
[2:27:33] SkywardDev: This is the best MC song
[2:27:34] PureSpider: SailorWS bless you
[2:27:46] TheWonderLlama: and those monsters and bandits are isekai'd back to earth... booom
[2:27:47] Allmostdone: But that would make the truck a hero. He isn’t a hero
[2:27:51] LidlFrog: Prayge this one needs saving
[2:27:55] SailorWS: so Truck-kun is a meme that its all the same truck
[2:28:03] PureSpider: oh

[2:28:07] Sentinel1_9: iirc you can wipe them by putting them in the crafting grid
[2:28:10] scssquatch: Do you have unlimited AE2 channels?
[2:28:11] Helegal07: there is kinda like that. The Darkness Was Comfortable for Me. killer gets isekaiéd after the MC @Giantwaffle

[2:28:38] scssquatch: @PureSpider dang EZ mode
[2:29:03] SailorWS: except for KoNoSuBa, he dies bc he had a heart attack in front of the truck
[2:29:06] SeverinMat: Or summoned
[2:29:07] PureSpider: scssquatch you'd go insane if you also had to deal with channels in this, but you can enable them if you're masochistic like that
[2:29:24] Larklen: Someone should take away that guys license KEKW
[2:29:26] PureSpider: wait what's the story then if the main character dies right away
[2:29:26] Vaarel: it is less often the truck then most other methods
[2:29:27] scssquatch: @PureSpider haha fair. I'm going insane dealing with channels in E2E
[2:29:27] All_Tech: but what happens to the driver of the truck, i wanna know their life dealing with that
[2:29:31] mahoriiii77: its meme

[3:19:16] DespiseTheirLies: it had a nose LUL

[3:19:49] Tro95: Battery extension packs make you look like a french tank
[3:19:52] DespiseTheirLies: 1,440 x 1,600 resolution index
[3:19:54] OrangeW2: every modern headset does 120 now
[3:19:55] That_Lurker: https://clips.twitch.tv/DreamyBigRatCoolCat-dU1wUaotJxOYVwSk
[3:19:56] OrangeW2: 90 is definitely a downgrade
[3:19:57] SmartDoll: index can do 144 if you really want
[3:20:04] Apparentthreat: CiVR just get that thing on the back to counterbalance
[3:20:09] Littleme02: it depends on how close you can get the lences to your eyes
[3:20:17] silv: dont need to se real games, just show VR chat
[3:20:28] Nexhunter: so interference up the asshole
[3:20:42] Thegrinch6: Up to probably depends on your own eyes
[3:20:42] DarkbuilderX: Because of spectrum shenanigans
[3:20:44] HeyAFrozenZebra: Field is going to vary from person to person
[3:20:44] Nexhunter: also not really
[3:20:55] Nexhunter: most of the ISPs are shipping Wifi 6 router/modems now
[3:20:57] cmmeth: just a new-ish router
[3:21:01] xGENIXx: There is a cable option
[3:21:06] ImEightBall: arent verizon fios default routers now wifi 6
[3:21:10] Nexhunter: @ImEightBall yes
[3:21:11] AIex_0: nothing about this would really make me want to pick it over the quest
[3:21:16] Nexhunter: which is why it gonna be intereference up the asshole
[3:21:21] mkam225: They can do a few fingers with those
[3:21:22] Pticrix: Oh wait that's going to stream from our routers? Man, most people have shitty networks because people aren't network engineers.
[3:21:25] stickman_02: My index will randomly go grey screen after like an hour of using it anyone know what be happening I’ve tried solutions online and haven’t had good results yet
[3:21:35] Askjong: Isn't this the step up from quest?
[3:21:47] Nexhunter: @stickman_02 contact valve support
[3:21:50] Casual_Steve_: does it have Foveated rendering or eye tracking
[3:21:52] SmartDoll: @stickman_02 should talk to valve support
[3:21:53] Nexhunter: it the same hardware
[3:21:53] DarkbuilderX: These don't have a visible strap, so index/thumb only?
[3:21:54] iloveplants: what if im missing fingers tho
[3:22:01] Nexhunter: just better screens
[3:22:05] Askjong: less then the quest pro tho
[3:22:08] Alamose: I hate the index controllers, but I play pretty much only beatsaber so I use my vive controllers
[3:22:08] stickman_02: Ight I reach out to them thanks guys

[3:22:42] stickman_02: You have an index you don’t need it lol
[3:22:43] YoFunkey: @giantwaffle can u compare the index side by side now?
[3:22:45] baconburgerfries: bingPog
[3:22:45] sleepymisaki: but will still use the index controller
[3:22:45] Harmar: to me only thing that that is a plus seams to be how the lenses work other than that seams like a index
[3:22:57] SmartDoll: @Shounanek that's the max, min is 1.5m by 1.5m
[3:23:05] Nexhunter: @Giantwaffle per HTC they have a spare battery in the main headset so you can hotswap the main battery that is on the back of the strap
[3:23:16] Spirevipp: wasnt it inside out tracking?
[3:23:21] michaelmichaelTV: Curious if passthrough is good enough to make VRDJ much easier
[3:23:24] poop_nukem: Even the quest 2 can do 120hz OC on the screen and it has wireless at 400$ moon2PAIN
[3:23:44] farcryer2: "+Add to comparison" big button on the screen Kappa

[3:26:28] Miracleshot: 2h KEKW
[3:26:29] mechoriet: without the battery pack
[3:26:29] Askjong: It uses the same chip as in the quest 2. Good luck getting more then 50fps in vrc
[3:26:29] madman66666: might be bone conducting speakers
[3:26:30] Apparentthreat: Nexhunter does wifi 6 go as far tho? some people may be able to turn down the power on their APs too (if they're already close to the AP)
[3:26:31] Thr0h: "up to"
[3:26:32] stickman_02: They should do like the bone conduction headphones

[3:26:55] MrArrig: Why not use belt batteries? Are they that problematic?
[3:26:58] spac3n3rd: LUL

[3:27:07] Moopoop: so it dosen't get pulled out or trip I assume
[3:27:08] DarkbuilderX: KEKW So many snapped USB C connectors
[3:27:09] HM_Diamonds: i imagine you can rotate
[3:27:10] Apparentthreat: right angle adapter
[3:27:10] isot0nic: Just build an external battery pack that can hold thechange you need for 12 hrs
[3:27:11] AIex_0: so you can mount the cable to the ceiling
[3:27:12] TheWonderLlama: A lot of people use hangers, or have it attached above
[3:27:14] Askjong: So you can break it and buy another one
[3:27:15] Zett121: pully system
[3:27:16] MasterKraft: so they can sell the 90 degree addon for 50 bucks
[3:27:19] MetalBBA: because fuck your cable integrity
[3:27:19] Nexhunter: @Giantwaffle so the internal battery will only last 10 minutes on a full charge when hot swapping
[3:27:23] Littleme02: what happends when you look up waffle?
[3:27:24] DrHax_: I bet its on purpose peepoSip
[3:27:24] Hardatyou: For the photo, so they can show it
[3:27:27] HeyAFrozenZebra: It's at the top there so they can show it
[3:27:34] Cephalospor1n: you could use a magnetic right angle to route it facing back
[3:27:34] Bizmarty: it would interfere with your beak!
[3:27:36] Saishu_: i use the oculus link attached to a spring hanging from the ceiling
[3:27:40] Apparentthreat: what was that other nose looking thing?
[3:27:41] YOUCEP: it would pinch your neck maybe
[3:27:42] 0x000000: feb 15
[3:27:42] Psyclone____: i wonder if it has issues with the cable falling off
[3:27:44] mechoriet: no shot the battery pack is only for 2 hours
[3:27:48] TheIrishGuy: 80 euro more
[3:27:48] Marguti: the one with the cable plug downwards is 50 bucks more expensive
[3:27:53] LinearLayer: 80 for a cable....
[3:27:54] Nexhunter: Q1 2023 HTC says @Giantwaffle
[3:27:58] Goldps1: 80 bucks for a acable dam
[3:28:05] Kellorian: $80 for a damn cable?
[3:28:06] warmwalrus: 80 cable...

[3:28:32] Nexhunter: yes chat
[3:28:32] DareDeFlug: It has to
[3:28:35] Vaarel: is there something special about the cable?
[3:28:42] navbryn: is the cable atleast long
[3:28:42] DX_Plates: @poop_nukem And lasted 3 days...
[3:28:43] Nexhunter: very long USB-C cables that are built to proper spec are expensive
[3:28:45] MrArrig: Rich people toys man...
[3:28:45] NemesisXKL: @Tabakhase not long enough for sure
[3:28:47] satyasann: you know people don't really use VR when they suprised about the cables lol
[3:29:00] OrangeW2: buy the index wireless adapter
[3:29:03] HostileLogOut: it's a pretty bad headset. low resolution no mention of PPI? etc
[3:29:04] moustwanted: buy it so we can have deckard KEKW
[3:29:04] Nexhunter: just get a quest 2 KEKW
[3:29:07] SmartDoll: why buy it... index is fine until a more substantial upgrade just gotta be patient COPIUM
[3:29:08] mechoriet: @Giantwaffle no shot the battery pack only lasts 2 hours
[3:29:08] poop_nukem: @poop_nukem No its still going about 6 months in =)
[3:29:08] Askjong: The one for Index is comming out Q1 isn't it?
[3:29:08] PellyPlays: release the what ?
[3:29:13] navbryn: just buy it
[3:29:16] farcryer2: @Giantwaffle If you buy it the Index 2 is released 2 months later KEKW
[3:29:18] OrangeW2: just buy the prototype
[3:29:20] Nexhunter: march is better than just Q1 of 23
[3:29:22] maccabeus: Madge just buy it
[3:29:23] Nexhunter: OMEGALUL
[3:29:23] bcdmonkey: but do you want only 2 hours of wireless
[3:29:35] Nexhunter: it HTC
[3:29:37] DespiseTheirLies: every 2 hours ... "battery low" pepeLaugh
[3:29:40] Casual_Steve_: up to 2 hours
[3:29:41] Nexhunter: so they are gonna be lying about it KEKW
[3:29:47] navbryn: trying to convince him self to buy something he already wants
[3:29:48] Apparentthreat: what's the wrist tracker doing?
[3:29:50] banshay3: 2hr in idle
[3:29:52] wonly: omg still on break?
[3:29:54] Apparentthreat: besides the obvious
[3:29:55] HostileLogOut: i wonder how the PPI is on it. cause its only 1920x1920 per eye lol
[3:30:06] Kyogerfan: what if you just turn the back upside down
[3:30:09] DarkbuilderX: I don't see why not, just get one of those mini backpacks
[3:30:11] isot0nic: see ? wworks
[3:30:25] Obliviron: lmao "strapped bomb" is literally making a suicide vest of batteries OMEGALUL
[3:30:25] Andy_975: peepee?
[3:30:31] HostileLogOut: if the PPI or PPD is not higher then the quest 2 or index. then eh. not worth it
[3:30:32] Cephalospor1n: PPD is pupilary Distance
[3:30:33] satyasann: pp big = better
[3:30:33] InternetPlumber: PeterPanDam?
[3:30:35] Nexhunter: as long as the power connector connecting the battery and the headset isn't some proprietary trash they should be able to create pass throughs
[3:30:43] PureSpider: big PP YEP
[3:30:50] Askjong: compare it to the Pico 4
[3:30:51] farcryer2: math it
[3:30:54] Ted_Raw: Ted_Raw subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 52 months! 
[3:31:12] piiixxx: it says will ship around 25th feb

[3:31:29] baconburgerfries: bingComfy
[3:31:32] jdog0616: @deadgolfer savings
[3:31:33] HostileLogOut: also i wonder if they actually did any upgrade on the microphone.
[3:31:34] Fufcia: Time for some sponsorship stream
[3:31:37] Puffmou5e: Puffmou5e subscribed with Prime. 
[3:31:37] Moobot: Welcome Puffmou5e! waffleH waffleHeart
[3:31:40] HostileLogOut: cause the vive always had crappy microphones.
[3:31:48] Lemures322: JUST tuned in; Been considering a better VR headset (looking for wireless) than my Pimax 5k.  How does this new thing look?
[3:31:49] KrunkleDunk: you can buy it for me and I'll test it for you
[3:31:58] Asneakyninja1: they are def trying to take on the quest pro with this it seems
[3:31:58] GFQPR1882: Waffle do u know if the psvr2 is any gd compared with them ?
[3:31:59] iWALL_E: kinda having a mind-trip over power of chatgpt and dall-e 2 rn
[3:32:02] Asneakyninja1: asneak9Hmm
[3:32:10] Askjong: The Pico 4 is so much cheaper and have good specs
[3:32:13] rauko_64: that hand control stuff is old tech tho
[3:32:18] HostileLogOut: @Lemures322 dont buy pimax. they got god awful support and has a ton of issues.
[3:32:19] GFQPR1882: I’ve ordered it but don’t know KEKW
[3:32:21] DespiseTheirLies: I still use my og vive lol
[3:32:25] haydcarney: It has hand tracking but not sure good it will be
[3:32:26] Mick_: it does not look that much better than the current offerings out there
[3:32:26] farcryer2: KSP free on Epic btw chat
[3:32:35] HostileLogOut: going from 144 > 90 hz is rough AF @Giantwaffle it looks slow and blurry
[3:32:36] Vargh: my original vive has 90hz
[3:32:37] Vargh: LUL
[3:32:42] Asneakyninja1: @Askjong but you can't really get outside of Asia unless you go through some roundabout ways right? or did that change finally?
[3:32:49] brenner1265: @Giantwaffle what price do you think they should be asking?
[3:32:54] Vaarel: yea I've pretty consistently heard for VR 120hz or better is the only way
[3:32:55] Askjong: @Asneakyninja1 I can get in in EU
[3:32:57] DespiseTheirLies: hot dogs horse shoes hand grenades NODDERS hmm
[3:33:08] LidlFrog: NODDERS
[3:33:18] GuardMoony: depends if the battery is included
[3:33:21] Lemures322: @HostileLogOut Ya, I bought the Pimax 5k through kickstarter YEARS ago.  It sucks, support sucks, etc, I want something better for PC gaming, preferably wireless, but I dont' know what to get.
[3:33:22] HostileLogOut: the Index is worth more in my opinion. a full set is what 1079$ or so right
[3:33:40] HostileLogOut: and 2 stations
[3:33:51] PureSpider: but the quest 2 has hand tracking
[3:33:58] AIex_0: might aswell get a quest and use your controllers
[3:34:00] HostileLogOut: @Lemures322 ehm then you have to go quest 2. or wait for valve to get something wireless
[3:34:01] Askjong: Finger tracking with cameras?
[3:34:01] DespiseTheirLies: big gats NODDERS big stim NODDERS big boom NODDERS no danger NOPERS big nice NODDERS
[3:34:06] CanadianHealthCare: can you compare the Vive with the Quest Pro
[3:34:13] Asneakyninja1: @Giantwaffle having used nothing but Airlink with my Quest 2 for wireless PC VR i can say that its worth it to get a device more dedicated to wireless vr. i have to have a battery on the back of my head to be able to play for more than an hour and a half
[3:34:18] Math354e: Are they not trying to compete with the quest pro?
[3:34:26] Lemures322: I already have stations and index controllers; I'm strongly considering the Vive Pro 2 w/ wireless adapter.  I was hoping Vive would announce something new in that realm but apparently not.
[3:34:55] OrangeW2: so $1100 + $400 in batteries KEKW
[3:34:56] Moobot: Come join the Waffle House Discord! <# https://discord.gg/fhGFtMuzdS
[3:34:57] Asneakyninja1: yeah i have 2 batteries that i swap between
[3:34:59] RefiixGaming: Design wise it looks so dope dude
[3:35:00] Obliviron: is the VR experience worth it if you dont like vrchat? @Giantwaffle
[3:35:02] OrangeW2: this looks like a terrible offer, actually
[3:35:03] PureSpider: using an external battery on the quest 2 funnily makes it more comfortable, because then you have similar weights on the front and back of your head :D
[3:35:07] Nexhunter: @Giantwaffle they have a sunglasses mode
[3:35:15] Nexhunter: so you can bypass the battery
[3:35:16] HostileLogOut: pretty sure they are targetting Businesses with this headset
[3:35:17] GuardMoony: I got the rift S on 80hz. And it ain't too bad with the refresh
[3:35:18] CanadianHealthCare: I think the XR is competing with the Quest Pro
[3:35:20] Askjong: But with the quest you do never get high FPS, you get around 30-60 fps. Only small games you can get 120
[3:35:33] Askjong: cable
[3:35:37] HeyAFrozenZebra: Is there information on the optics?
[3:35:37] Askjong: PC VR
[3:35:38] RedDirtSK: how about the pico 4?
[3:35:51] PureSpider: Askjong sounds like you got a shitty cable danHmm
[3:35:54] HeyAFrozenZebra: Oh I meant the lenses
[3:36:12] HostileLogOut: @Askjong do you have the official oculus cable? or some 3rd party one
[3:36:12] Askjong: @PureSpider i get 3.6 GBs
[3:36:23] Asneakyninja1: the cable is more stable, but that said airlink has gotten pretty damn good. only downside is the SLIGHT latency i have which is more notable when im hanging with people in VRC krisuSmile
[3:36:33] Nexhunter: @Giantwaffle "USB-C connecting port on the right-hand side allows users to plug into a power source for 30-watt fast charging"
[3:36:36] Saishu_: i use the oculus link cable and battery never runs out
[3:36:44] Lemures322: So what's the go-to wireless VR gaming from your PC headset right now then?  Or is the whole problem that there isn't one without significant issues?
[3:36:54] Askjong: @HostileLogOut 3rd party. But i get highter FPS then all my other friends using quest 2
[3:36:55] haydcarney: What do you think about the Pico? @giantwaffle
[3:36:57] HostileLogOut: @Lemures322 Quest 2. sadly
[3:36:58] PureSpider: Askjong should be 5GBB/s++
[3:37:00] Nexhunter: cause cheap
[3:37:02] PureSpider: GB*
[3:37:07] OrangeW2: Pico is owned by Bytedance who owns TikTok so that's an immediate no
[3:37:19] Asneakyninja1: the HTC is going to be more for those who have wanted wireless vr that don't want to deal with facebook/meta
[3:37:23] HostileLogOut: @Askjong you possibly just got a better pc then them. but thats also the issue 3rd party cables are not guranteed to work.
[3:37:23] Mick_: it is a good entry device if you are curious on VR
[3:37:25] Lemures322: Quest 2?  I have the original Vive, and a Pimax 5k... seems like a downgrade, even if it adds wireless :(
[3:37:26] Sander20011: Minecraft?
[3:37:28] FinnYellowbelly: you only have to sell your soul to facebook for it
[3:37:33] leadtooth: whats the best headset onthe market?
[3:37:40] brenner1265: I dont want to drop a grand on a GPU let alone a headset
[3:37:41] HostileLogOut: @Lemures322 side upgrade.
[3:37:44] PureSpider: Askjong which means, at least USB 3.2 Gen 1
[3:37:46] Fhuey: $1100 to be surrounded by traps... nty
[3:37:47] AkitaTau: Quest 2 is just soo good

[3:38:00] AIex_0: nah not even
[3:38:02] Allmostdone: Nope
[3:38:03] Saishu_: 6 or 6e?

[3:38:05] Math354e: Nah you can get one cheap
[3:38:07] SirNickGaming: Ubiquiti access points are like 150$
[3:38:11] orillion: Kappa wifi 7 now old news
[3:38:11] ImNotDonut_: like $120
[3:38:13] Cephalospor1n: you can get them for 150
[3:38:14] Tabakhase: "need" is relative
[3:38:15] GFQPR1882: KEKW
[3:38:16] Nexhunter: they can do 6 or 6E
[3:38:18] Purecrew: Free from your ISP lol
[3:38:18] JimmyHuren: nno way
[3:38:23] Goodgive: $150 for asus router
[3:38:26] PureSpider: tplink makes reasonably priced wifi 6 routers, as an example
[3:38:27] JimmyHuren: 150 for sure
[3:38:29] Nexhunter: all of verizon routers for fios are wifi 6 now @Giantwaffle
[3:38:29] Apparentthreat: just get one that can cover a small area and stay close to it
[3:38:30] Frecked: my 100$ asus router is wifi 6
[3:38:32] ImposterArchitect: you can get them as cheap as 150

[3:39:01] RockyMountainHiThere: 2 grand lol
[3:39:02] Cephalospor1n: I use Unifi eco-system their high end wireless AP's are 150 bucks
[3:39:03] ImposterArchitect: If you aren't looking at a mesh
[3:39:03] GuardMoony: Don't go for a router. go for an access point
[3:39:04] Saishu_: ubiquiti or cisco
[3:39:06] TheResinger: a good quality wifi6 is like 500-600 lol
[3:39:06] CanadianHealthCare: I think the Deco is 300
[3:39:08] The_Holas: you knoww most of them are made in china Kappa
[3:39:09] suicidebolt: You can do an access point that will do it no need to get a router just plug the router into the access point
[3:39:10] sogerr: you can build your own router, its not hard
[3:39:12] R1Rider01: Meraki Wifi 6   $175
[3:39:12] Lemures322: I guess I could get the Quest 2 for wireless games like beat saber and stuff, but if I want higher quality gaming I'll just have to accept no wireless, and stick with my Pimax 5k for now. *sigh*
[3:39:15] bird404: ubiquiti
[3:39:17] Asneakyninja1: i can confirm the router makes the difference as well. the old router my family had was bleh with airlink when i wasn't the only one int he house. we upgraded due to other reasons and its been smooth sailing ever since
[3:39:18] mooseysnoosey: you can find good quality for like 200
[3:39:19] Littleme02: Linksys Hydra Pro 6 MR5500 seems decent 160 here
[3:39:19] PureSpider: Askjong if you want those sweet fps, yea :D those cables are somtimes marketed as quest 2 cables, but just make sure it's USB 3.2 gen 1 or newer
[3:39:20] SirNickGaming: ~100$ for an access point https://store.ui.com/products/u6-lite-us
[3:39:21] bcdmonkey: google nest is 6e and 150
[3:39:25] Tro95: Nice ubiquiti APs are only $100
[3:39:27] Koeckie: Ubiquiti?
[3:39:28] Cephalospor1n: Ubiquiti is cheap but it gets expensive to won the whole eco-system
[3:39:30] Goodgive: ASUS RT-AX82U
[3:39:32] Nexhunter: my mesh network devices with 6E cost me about $1k but it is 3 devices
[3:39:34] Druckis: when will you play some other games waffle ?
[3:39:37] McFlannel: im doing the factorio  lazy bastard achievement and its killin me
[3:39:38] GFQPR1882: I don’t get why u need a gd router when ur pc is plugged into the internet @giantwaffle ?
[3:39:40] arkun_: @guardmoony that, an access point
[3:39:40] DX_Plates: I want WiFi 6e, chat continues to quote WiFi 6 prices
[3:39:49] Janzert: Ubiquiti Unifi U6 $310
[3:39:50] Askjong: @PureSpider I have usb 3.2 gen 2x2
[3:40:01] Nexhunter: @DX_Plates you don't want 6E unless you need mesh backhaul KEKW
[3:40:02] Derdrom_TJM: a 3 pack of 6E Eero devices is only $699
[3:40:05] TheShaddo13: he finished your gold wires
[3:40:11] 93Imagine: @GFQPR1882 connection to the headset is wireless over ethernet
[3:40:19] GuardMoony: Just get a access point. It's a bit cheaper  and you place it in the same room you game with and ethernet cable. This will give the best result
[3:40:24] lukasalbert: faster passive system ?
[3:40:27] Thenoot: been away for a bit. What's the deal with the boat?
[3:40:28] Saytos1: KEKW
[3:40:31] Hardatyou: Yesterday I remember you having 23 bars of gold LUL
[3:40:31] Pticrix: MONSTER cable factory simulator
[3:40:32] UnCrazed: "we dont need to limit it"
[3:40:35] R1Rider01: you said you wanted 2k coated wire
[3:40:35] PureSpider: Askjong then you should be good - does your mainboard also support it?
[3:40:38] HostileLogOut: @GuardMoony false lol.
[3:40:48] GFQPR1882: @93imagine Oh got ya waffleLove
[3:40:53] TheShaddo13: not sure if he put downgrade in big gold cable drawer
[3:41:03] jinkleft: I'm going index2 for sure
[3:41:13] HostileLogOut: announced this year somewhere summer.
[3:41:15] MonkeyOnDonkey: Using the Quest 2 over Wifi and its fun for way less Money... Is the Index so much better?
[3:41:22] Littleme02: i'm thinking there is going to be index price drop first
[3:41:28] TheShaddo13: and he needs rubber coated aluminium cables
[3:41:30] HostileLogOut: @MonkeyOnDonkey yes. index is vastly superior.
[3:41:32] stickman_02: Index 2 electric boogaloo
[3:41:33] reconnaisshaw: UniFi supports WiFi 6. You can get into that stack at a pretty affordable price point.
[3:41:35] Gaber0510: what are you talking about valve dropping?
[3:41:42] OrangeW2: omfg it's actually £1300 in the UK
[3:41:45] MonkeyOnDonkey: @HostileLogOut in what way? The last one was as good as the quest 2
[3:41:50] Nexhunter: chat aint no one needing to go into a unifi stack for consumer
[3:41:51] OrangeW2: a downgrade for more price than the Index
[3:41:54] deadgolfer: and 16x restone
[3:41:59] Askjong: @PureSpider Yes. But i see that the advertising for my cable is 3.5 GBps usb 3.2 gen 2x2. Something doesn't add up
[3:42:01] PureSpider: @OrangeW2 ah yes, accurate currency conversion... not
[3:42:05] TheShaddo13: check if he downgraded big rubber coated gold cables drawer
[3:42:12] HostileLogOut: @MonkeyOnDonkey better microphone. better experience in general. better audio. and 144 hz.
[3:42:12] OrangeW2: @OrangeW2 luv me some companies that are too lazy to currency convert
[3:42:15] n3wtpond: @OrangeW2 the days of 2USD per GBP are over my friend
[3:42:17] Tro95: Having APs installed in my new flat was the best investment I could have made
[3:42:19] DarkbuilderX: Looking around seems 6E is minimum like $350, 6 can be as low as like $100
[3:42:22] PureSpider: Askjong yea, weird, that seems wrong :D look for 5GBps or faster
[3:42:23] n3wtpond: @OrangeW2 kinda scary
[3:42:24] Sui_Ume: @Giantwaffle automate like 1 stack of hulls?
[3:42:35] bcdmonkey: TP link has a wifi 6 router for 95
[3:42:35] OrangeW2: @n3wtpond you realise that is 1.2 gbp to 1 usd there, right?
[3:43:04] PureSpider: OrangeW2 eeeeh just copy the number and then slap some on top of it danYes good enough
[3:43:04] Moobot: You can sub to Waffle by clicking this neat link -> twitch.tv/giantwaffle/subscribe SUBprise
[3:43:05] mainG__: where is your wireless access point for the ME system?
[3:43:15] n3wtpond: @OrangeW2 theyre just future proofing their pricing?
[3:43:23] Gaber0510: @Giantwaffle what were you saying valve is going to release?
[3:43:25] HostileLogOut: @Askjong oculus them self says you need a 5Gbps cable otherwise it wont work well
[3:43:30] Nexhunter: @Giantwaffle also on the Cadi and Andretti deal, Cadi announced will be using a third party supplier if they get accepted until they can finish building out a manufacturing division estimate of '26 season peepoHmm
[3:43:32] TheShaddo13: oh it was tin, srry my bad
[3:43:56] Pe4enie: is pati playing from his new pc already?
[3:44:15] MonkeyOnDonkey: @HostileLogOut lol. 500€? I am using my usual headset in addition to the vr headset. 144hz instead of 120 ist not worth for DOUBLE the price...
[3:44:17] arkun_: @gaber0510 the deckard
[3:44:22] 0omkins: If I'm going to dabble in GT, should I start with this modpack? GT: New Horizons or Omni? Yolo into this modpack?
[3:44:32] Asneakyninja1: arguments?
[3:44:38] deadgolfer: store more than 1 in the item filter
[3:44:43] boogerbomb01: 2000 isnt enough
[3:44:47] Asneakyninja1: not augments
[3:44:51] Gaber0510: @arkun_ ah, cool! thanks, joined right as he finished that thought
[3:44:52] kane1941: increase tin to 4?
[3:44:56] Asneakyninja1: arguments? what arguments did pati have to do?
[3:45:00] HostileLogOut: @MonkeyOnDonkey the index is 500 euros and its well worth it lol
[3:45:02] Daanaas: wen Ksp today ?
[3:45:21] stickman_02: We already made 2x silver
[3:45:22] Qbertman: dont you already have 2x silver?
[3:45:25] tomey36: Already doing silver
[3:45:33] PureSpider: @Daanaas it's already live
[3:45:59] Askjong: @PureSpider Yep, the cable is shit. I just found bunch of reviews of it. but it says on the page that it only supports speed up to 2.5. Thank for the help waffleLove

[3:48:23] Nexhunter: chat guess what time it is
[3:48:30] commander_scheppert: @hostilelogout Well, i think a lot of people don't know that, yet. They had to drop the price massively to still compete with the Pico 4. Imho, Valve should do a bit more on the marketing side.
[3:48:32] GracelessDonkey: If you had a $1 you could get the new headset
[3:48:37] Pe4enie: @Nexhunter 19:34 GMT+!

[3:49:38] gregcee: what headset is it
[3:49:59] Asneakyninja1: yeah that needs to be an angled connector
[3:49:59] HostileLogOut: @MonkeyOnDonkey plus to  get a good experience you need a strong computer regardless for the quest 2. the onboard is bad AF. you never get more then 45 fps.
[3:50:00] Jaydepps00: then you just buy it again :)
[3:50:04] Nexhunter: pepeLaugh
[3:50:05] Pe4enie: oh my god

[3:50:17] kinglouisxvii: now THAT was innovation
[3:50:20] Jaydepps00: designer*
[3:50:20] lange__: Why not just have it at the bottom??
[3:50:21] Maddax290: i wont lie, i miss buildguild series! i used to love watching that
[3:50:25] InternetPlumber: or how apple just tells you to plug your pencil into the ipad and it just sticks out from the side
[3:50:26] PureSpider: constant strain on a cable 👌
[3:50:27] Exo0De: @Giantwaffle i think its suppose to go with pulley system
[3:50:28] jdog0616: apple said officaially the charger is on the bottom to prevent wired mouse use
[3:50:28] Koeckie: no they did not it's just bc it's $$$$$
[3:50:29] MaroLupus: big brain moment
[3:50:30] iloveplants: clearly they designed it upside down
[3:50:30] R1Rider01: all these is $$$
[3:50:31] atamala: not an engineer probably a product owner
[3:50:32] Jaydepps00: 5Head
[3:50:32] The_Holas: run cable to the cealing
[3:50:33] Sui_Ume: @Giantwaffle so gravity doesn't unplug it?
[3:50:35] Druks: must be patented KEKW
[3:50:38] Surge43: They dont want you to use it while using it.
[3:50:41] Netfreq: Since that back price pops off, you can turn it I believe
[3:50:41] MonkeyOnDonkey: @HostileLogOut yes thats true. You need one for both. Quest 2 can already do wifi...
[3:50:42] Asneakyninja1: there has to be a weird reason for it
[3:50:45] Nexhunter: @Giantwaffle it is USB-C
[3:50:45] Dagmoo: yeah ceiling hook?
[3:50:47] Sir_Leinad_: Some people install pullys on their ceiling for VR cables but it seems way too big of a niche for them to do that
[3:50:48] All_Tech: same people that put headphone jacks at bottoms of phones
[3:50:48] NephilimXS: probably thinking people will use some type of pully system
[3:50:49] Dmw882: also how good would pulling on it go LUL
[3:50:50] lange__: I'll apply right away! LUL
[3:50:52] jdog0616: they have an official statement why
[3:50:54] Littleme02: You can't have it on the bottom since its gunna hit your back when you look directly up
[3:50:56] The_Holas: its for cealing hooks Kappa
[3:50:57] InternetPlumber: ov everyone has an overhead cable management gantry
[3:50:57] Mongo_Smash: I'd prefer to have it straight out the back.
[3:51:01] Jaydepps00: @Sui_Ume gravity's not that strong
[3:51:01] lazyhot: Rather an engineer and product owner argued for months, the PO won :p
[3:51:04] podwe: I use that mouse daily and charge it at weekend. Stupid design still
[3:51:05] Asneakyninja1: what is the official statement @jdog0616 ?
[3:51:05] Moobot: You can find Waffle's Youtube channel here - https://youtube.com/giantwaffle
[3:51:06] whyyoutrying: ceiling hooks makes sense
[3:51:06] Wallytreats: get an adapter that clips down the back and then it pulgs in the bottom LUL
[3:51:07] ImFluffies: Extra extention incoming for better cable managementr
[3:51:12] MasterKraft: @Littleme02 that makes sense
[3:51:13] iamforever27: Did they think it would easily fall out if on the bottom vs top?
[3:51:17] Stragmol: sounds like a designer assertion more than an engineer... "it doesn't look good with the cord at the top or back, put it under"
[3:51:22] Nexhunter: @ImFluffies yes
[3:51:28] Tro95: hv hulls first
[3:51:29] jdog0616: @Asneakyninja1 to prevent useing the mouse while charging, so it can not be used as a wired mouse
[3:51:34] Fufcia: quickly buy a factory in China to start producing angled USB-C cables for the headset. guaranteed success LUL
[3:51:35] itsIffy: I'm in need of a new mctile video.

[3:51:58] lukasalbert: Mc Tile is my fave
[3:52:02] Nexhunter: @jdog0616 for apple it more likely there wasn't a good spot to put the connector on the front side given the giant glass

[3:52:36] commander_scheppert: @hostilelogout They did, until now. VR support from them is kinda half-assed, i hoped they would do a bit more, since we barely got some good games since Alyx and other companies mostly put out mobile looking shit.
[3:53:20] HostileLogOut: @commander_scheppert huh? the support is excellent lol. it dominates the market. along side quest 2

[5:14:49] PureSpider: @DragonApoc if the machine power matches the cable power, that's 1A... i think
[5:14:57] PureSpider: so an EV machine on EV power uses 1A
[5:14:58] deadgolfer: look at that amount of gold now, back to fish!
[5:15:07] Sui_Ume: 1 A = 1024 EU

[5:49:39] Hurtwolf: I like the resource websites they make for games like PoE
[5:49:43] Purecrew: Thats why you would need a seperate Drawer system for biproducts. If you void the 2x2 it will void the primary product as well and never stop making it.
[5:49:46] Stormflare: there is a banner ad at the bottom but its unobtrusive
[5:49:49] FraKo23: only dark mode missing ;]

[5:54:51] Bulltank: @Vovosunt better to just make a new machine. Because at some point, they can make a craft that requires hundreds or thousands of specific items, and if the machines are shared, it'll take double the time
[5:54:55] charlie_the_snowman: NEONEAST BABY

[5:57:44] CameIMilk: number of iron dust is wrong in interafce
[5:57:49] Neroner: Bedge
[5:57:56] pinhead_larynx: oh macerator does have a visual effect when its off. the "jaws" are open when its off
[5:58:03] BobaF377: What is generating the base material? Is there a drill or mining going on that is then feeding in to the next level of fabrication?

[6:02:24] frainsbreeze: yoink a macerator
[6:02:49] Koeckie: remove the interface?
[6:02:56] Bulltank: 1 stack is probably enough lol
[6:03:11] daemonaedryn: I mean advanced processing arrays can do 64 recipes at a time, and need 64 machines in them
[6:03:21] stickman_02: it will all fill up over night
[6:03:27] Bulltank: compactor isnt in this pack
[6:03:28] lilgangstagoth1: its from thermal yea
[6:03:31] Gashlex: if you do 1 stack in the drawer the machine will backup with a stack so technically its 2 right?
[6:03:33] Dagmoo: depleting too many mats to be worth making 4 stacks for now
[6:03:35] frainsbreeze: thats actually 256 in the drawer and another 64 in the machine

[7:02:25] Sentinel1_9: chat i hope you have a good next 8 hours :)
[7:02:26] boogerbomb01: yes
[7:02:26] Bernd135: The reason for it to have nbt is for calculating the efficiency bonus for its fuel time
[7:02:33] OrangeW2: diminshing returns or not, that's still 2x over not having 3d cache at minimum
[7:02:33] Nexhunter: yea points of diminishing return comes into play KEKW

[7:02:47] Smileynator: why even bother with RAM anymore, just toss it all in L3
[7:02:47] Nexhunter: we dont know the pricing
[7:02:49] shnakee: I'd still rather 13700k
[7:02:50] BiJay0: whats the cache good for?
[7:02:54] Nexhunter: that one thing they didnt announce KEKW
[7:02:55] 1killersquirrel: Well be able to play Tarkov's Streets with that CPU LUL KEKW
[7:02:57] gikei: Yes it will be great, paying +300 for 4% increase in few selected games
[7:02:58] Koeckie: well I think i switch next year to team RED
[7:03:01] DX_Plates: @CoolReal They always make those 'claims'
[7:03:05] sogerr: i just ignore anything nex says about amd
[7:03:14] 0066: amd 5800 with ddr5 5200mhz ram is insane with overclocks
[7:03:19] deadgolfer: fix the level emitter on the red coal
[7:03:19] OrangeW2: @gikei if you only play those games (we do), then it has massive value
[7:03:29] Koeckie: he did
[7:03:30] OrangeW2: and it isn't 4%, it's >75% lol
[7:03:30] Flobu_: for huge algorythm data
[7:03:38] OMICRON: yeah i mean the 3d is only 100$ more
[7:03:44] kypudo: i know see the reason why u will purchase :D vr chat
[7:03:47] Smileynator: Cache is FASTER data access than RAM, so when the CPU needs data from RAM, it catches as much as it can at once, into L3/L2/L1 cache, so it can then access the next bytes so much faster (iterating lists and arrays go brrr)
[7:03:48] Orin_The_Sly: Chat, stop it
[7:03:53] Math354e: But you don't get efficiency cores, so bye power efficiency
[7:04:07] Nexhunter: @Smileynator until diminishing return comes into play due to the way modern OS works widePepeLaugh
[7:04:07] FinnYellowbelly: its memory that is REALLY close to the CPU, so its waaay faster, it doesnt have to go through another bridge to get to the memory, so the latency is much less

[7:05:00] YungSchmuel_: @Giantwaffle i am a personal believer in the fact that PCs are more of an investment. they're meant to last for years so it buys itself like 5x by the time you upgrade

[7:14:30] plattnotpratt: It's a pigment of your imagination
[7:14:32] GFQPR1882: Who u trying to fool it brown KEKW
[7:14:33] lgamer7: idk those drawers look more "beige" to me.. is that a real color??
[7:14:34] ryan_wellence: well, when we define colors via hue, saturation, and brightness, we say brown, but that is specified by a hue we would refer to as organge, and darken it and desaturate it as well. When someone says, "it isn't real" we mean we wouldn't define it as a hue.
[7:14:37] Sui_Ume: poor @OrangeW2 getting bullied here
[7:14:39] OMICRON: brown is def brown Kappa
[7:14:39] OrangeW2: brown is fake on a computer screen, pink is fake to our brains
[7:14:40] omar_i_: waffleEE MathTime
[7:14:41] BakaPixel: @Giantwaffle Purple is super fake as it doesn't even fall in the normal spectrum, that why it gets so weird with black lights.
[7:14:47] SailorWS: first it was ThatOnneGuy now its OrangeW2 Waffle is just killing off people in chat

[7:16:01] kane1941: does it autosmelt these dusts?
[7:16:03] deadgolfer: why use a level emitter on those?
[7:16:04] WARHERO322: Wait why do you want the powder? And not the ingot
[7:16:07] NodBabe: @Giantwaffle Do you think the GT New Horizons pack will be fun? Thinking about starting it
[7:16:20] frainsbreeze: waffle check the level emitters
[7:16:25] kaasrondje: How will it make vibrant if there is enough energetic ?!
[7:16:26] Daryl_Kay: @boogerbomb01 Did you run into the quests not showing up?
[7:16:30] GFQPR1882: FUN KEKW
[7:16:30] 0x4273: just now automating vibrant KEKW
[7:16:34] Saishu_: gtnh is pure pain
[7:16:36] The_Holas: waffleEE  CiYouLater What a great emotes LUL
[7:16:41] Caldarr: fun is relative, its... challenging
[7:16:41] omar_i_: @lgamer7 not all of them, they all produced from mixing blue red green. The one color which is fake is brown, because its just a dark orange. Check out this video:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4aWZRtTwU
[7:16:47] pinhead_larynx: what happens when you have 1000 energetic bars but no vibrant?
[7:16:54] BuLLeT_LV: waffleEE :D
[7:17:07] deadgolfer: yeah, just let it build up 256 dust
[7:17:08] W84M3: you could limit it with the 1 stack on the drawer
[7:17:10] kakiewakie_: mistakes were made
[7:17:15] GFQPR1882: waffleHmm waffleD

[7:17:25] Bernd135: The smelting of dust should be the limiter
[7:17:30] lukasalbert: why use level emitters at all ?
[7:17:30] pinhead_larynx: maybe just look for dust?
[7:17:31] Citriz: GT New horizon is insane compared to nomifactory.  It is a much much longer playthrough and way more grindy
[7:17:34] boogerbomb01: @Daryl_Kay there is acommand you can try
[7:17:35] Koeckie: tell us the problem mayby you come up with an idea?
[7:17:36] OrangeW2: catJAM
[7:17:42] KICKKJ: future pati problems

[7:18:21] The_Holas: @Dagmoo i think i know what happend there LUL
[7:18:27] Frankenstain: won’t it stop making the dust into the ingots once the ingots drawer is full?
[7:18:31] rickthe_punk: Émîtes signal from drawer until full Than stop and the smelter will limit the number you have
[7:18:40] Koeckie: waffleEE What?

[7:21:21] Smileynator: Ok, i had to uninstall BTTV so i could make FFZ do 7TV. This is worse than minecraft mods.
[7:21:24] 1killersquirrel: Waffle, I don't understand, why not just put a level emitter in each step, so it continually makes from each product on each step?
[7:21:24] boogerbomb01: @Daryl_Kay im not running a server just connecting to one
[7:21:34] b0ltz12: what fluid does kanthal need in the EBF?

[7:23:48] SmartDoll: @Smileynator all you have to do is just get FFZ extensions and none other, then enable BTTV and 7TV as plugins in FFZ
[7:23:49] boltzmanC: someone told you yesterday aboutthe ruby machine XD
[7:24:01] kaaniimani: @SmartDoll How do you enable that?
[7:24:03] Reelys: I take full responsibility
[7:24:20] TigerLuv: isn't Kanthal closer to the end?
[7:24:21] SmartDoll: @Theyvel_ FFZ control panel -> Add-ons
[7:24:24] Smileynator: @SmartDoll yes well, my addon installs are from a decade ago. So... i never changed that until now
[7:24:25] Bulltank: Are you writing that note to yourself?
[7:24:27] deadgolfer: do the same for energetic now
[7:24:35] Flobu_: wasnt that the wrong one?
[7:24:51] Vaarel: just looking at the DSP patch and it's got some nice QoL stuff like automatic conveyor raising over other conveyors
[7:25:10] Smileynator: how even do i add a recipe to the crafting station
[7:25:18] TigerLuv: Flobu_ I thought it was the second from the end for the Kanthal
[7:25:20] Sui_Ume: D: Magic

[7:27:54] Flobu_: TigerLuv its just the sign so it shouldnt break anything
[7:28:06] sorefingers: might not need a drawer for Fluids🦧
[7:28:39] Yakobro: I have partitioned drives, one for each fluidd
[7:28:43] InternetPlumber: if only there was a tank system like storage drawers
[7:28:45] TigerLuv: @Flobu_ yeah
