[0:16:37] Venxuri: weapon is always lowest
[0:16:46] drewzerTV: hows this game vs Path of Exile?
[0:17:02] Venxuri: you need at least 700 great honors from 1400 to 1415 I think KEKW
[0:17:07] TheWonderLlama: WICKED 💳 Weapon first?
[0:17:30] Xev_00: Infinite chaos was good a month ago, not really any more
[0:17:34] ChrisHimself: besides the isometric camera this game is not compareable to PoE
[0:17:48] ChrisHimself: It's an MMO
[0:18:02] Venxuri: you used to love it right?
[0:18:29] gnomeseleven: pepeLaugh
[0:18:38] drewzerTV: I guess I meant how does it compare fun-wise and game-loop, etc.
[0:18:42] ldvemonl: i think diablo4 would be more closer to lost ark than poe
[0:18:52] celadriel23: lately it seems like poe is causing their own problems and then fixing them and offering that as evidence they have improved
[0:18:58] THEFAMOUS: are we not going to talk about that book?

[0:22:49] ChrisHimself: Or you do Argos the 3rd week.. or the 4th week.. :) it doesn't really matter since you're going to do him hundrets of times anyways
[0:22:51] Venxuri: well, its on korea

[0:23:45] iMelon: i thought it was grudge>keen>mass
[0:24:00] st3x_: D: how dare you
[0:24:13] Venxuri: probably eu will come up with their own build since grudge is not that popular here
[0:24:14] iMelon: either way, legendary mass books have been free money lol
[0:24:14] Moobot: You can find Waffle's Youtube channel here - https://youtube.com/giantwaffle

[0:25:22] Venxuri: if lance is good I'll literally delete my scrapper, I've not been enjoying her lately
[0:25:35] Xev_00: Just don't get hit 4Head

[0:33:05] contravize: are you doing event raids on alts?
[0:33:05] warmwalrus: the daily tracker is so huge
[0:33:43] HeyItsADK: what is the importance of the front/back markers?
[0:33:44] st3x_: i dont get that either, we could have gotten the KR client and just deactivate the Raids etc
[0:33:46] warmwalrus: theyre probably so forked since day one KEKW

[0:39:18] hisdue: COGGERS
[0:40:03] ThatOnneGuy: TheLimitlessOne he had to get a dayjob so his quest was put on hold. Typical american life.
[0:40:04] thunderdan11: @TheLimitlessOne its cause he isnt looking, he just keeps killing the same bosses and going to the same spots over and over again
[0:40:04] resku89: what are you actually breaking on Yoho, the tails? And whats the effect of actually breaking them
[0:40:37] Venxuri: if you break the tail she loses dmg reduction
[0:40:40] dumplingator: You do less damage on Yoho until you break the tail
[0:41:45] NexX_____: just had a really toxic dud in argos with 1371 who thought hes the godking of lost ark with his payed gear
[0:41:46] Moobot: Come join the Waffle House Discord! <# https://discord.gg/fhGFtMuzdS
[0:41:55] samuraijac: destruction is rough becuase if its a destruction lvl check anything below the lvl wont do squat... so grenades over all for vital point damage
[0:42:29] Houghdini: More Index basestations in stock. If anyone needs it, grab it now.
[0:43:12] hotdove911: just be a scrapper, half my kit is destruction and half is stagger haha

[0:44:58] Coulby: loa on
[0:46:01] zombietaint: if it says 'destruction' you hit the weak point
[0:46:33] Dibbsu: Just need a gunlancer to ult so you can DPS during it
[0:46:38] thunderdan11: @DewDragon half the time when i go to throw it just auto attacks
[0:47:01] Hurtwolf: whats your crit record
[0:47:08] warmwalrus: @zombietaint not always, like chromium and levanos dont have "weak points" but you still need to use destruction to destory their shells
[0:48:01] Draiv_: So we are getting those in 2 years?
[0:48:08] Hurtwolf: Latex pants or something
[0:48:09] resku89: hot is what you call them

[1:10:42] Draiv_: He only had to learn his lines though and the pronounciation
[1:10:44] kenshin2666: my biggest complaint with the Una stuff, is that the areas are listed by their zone vs the continent, and i dont feel like looking at "this task is over here, this one is over there". id rather it tell me which continent its on (provided its not obviously an island)

[1:31:54] Turneetup: it's 17 17 8 8 17 11 for 1415, idk why 1400 should be going higher on some of the pieces
[1:31:56] Sydefarr: Get paying to lose!!!
[1:31:57] Draiv_: chest is the worst for dps
[1:32:18] even__odds: need moar hones

[1:34:24] KrunkleDunk: no content in the game nowadays is based on a single piece of gear, it goes on your total ilvl now.
[1:34:27] thunderdan11: @contravize on this server at least for the lower t3 fusion its cheaper to just buy them off the house instead of making them in stronghold

[2:19:57] NexX_____: just had an update too
[2:19:59] johnnymac17: you should make the destruction gadget for clearing out areas like this
[2:19:59] NexX_____: yes
[2:20:04] DemonicHell3: yesterday i believe
[2:20:04] Zapper_777: the beta is fun
[2:20:05] Cnomesta: 0.5.0 yeah
[2:20:06] hackett33: I think there has also been updates to Green Hell
[2:20:09] DemonicHell3: new heros and what not
[2:20:10] NexX_____: 0.5.0
[2:20:14] 감자타인: lol can't even use the OW2 website, too much lag...

[2:20:19] H3adass_: Hey @giantwaffle ever tried getting into nopixel 3.0 like the old days
[2:20:23] daemonaedryn: Slay the spire had a fan made free expansion on steam
[2:20:25] tripwires: they buffed garlic?
[2:20:29] ba_nanananananana: Garlic sucks tho.
[2:20:42] ba_nanananananana: I have 110 hours in Vampire Survivors. Garlic is low tier
[2:20:43] DemonicHell3: the no move runs are insane
[2:20:44] Venxuri: @ba_nanananananana how dare you
[2:20:49] hackett33: Ever play Escape Simulator? would also be a good filler game
[2:20:51] DrHax_: garlic is great for trash mobs tho
[2:20:52] pt0ughneigh: dont you talk about garlic like that
[2:20:53] premalonetv: Axes is where its at tbh
[2:21:02] johnnymac17: branch mining
[2:21:03] OishiisDelicious: branch mining
[2:21:12] kenshin2666: theres a lot of clothes on here for all this strip mining going on
[2:21:13] Chernobyl26: I thought strip mining was every time you hit an ore, you take a piece of clothing off
[2:21:21] GoRilla2015: garlic is good till lvl 20 then its deep garbo expect the knockback effect
[2:21:21] Face_32: i thought the point of vampire hunter was to get to the point that you didnt have to move, ore even play the game for that matter
[2:21:28] ba_nanananananana: Venxuri even optimal, evolved garlic is like 1.5kDPS, that's nothing when the average evolved  weapon is at least 4-5k and can go >10k
[2:21:45] GoRilla2015: yap true iam a garlic enjoyer
[2:21:58] theknightpaco: that is called a branch mine
[2:22:03] scoutsoldier_pr: Hi Waffle! Do you remember what was the end game energy generation in FTB infinity evolved?
[2:22:05] ba_nanananananana: grinding for the current beta content is rough tho LUL
[2:22:11] ohbi78: quill18?
[2:22:11] KnightsTrinity: Infinite Dopamine Generator
[2:22:25] Face_32: you mean idle games?
[2:22:27] Zapper_777: KISS classic implementation
[2:22:38] GoRilla2015: it is
[2:23:02] NexX_____: 34 min is my max
[2:23:03] kenshin2666: its simple and fun, mechanics are straight forward and you never feel like the game was unfair, simply that you personally fucked up and want to do better
[2:23:17] GoRilla2015: Hurry mode is 15min for quicker games
[2:23:20] rykk3r1: y'all remember floppy bird
[2:23:26] ba_nanananananana: I haven't done money grinds in ages. I have all powerups except curse and still 500k gold to spare LUL
[2:23:30] SkylaSilver: Hello!!
[2:23:37] johnnymac17: idk if you are looking for these materials but the destruction gadget can clear out areas like this super fast
[2:23:42] johnnymac17: i dont think its hard to make
[2:23:49] TheMeowstardCat: I have floppy dong on my iphone.. .
[2:23:54] DemonicHell3: max curse makes runs super fun
[2:23:57] JoxerTheM1ghty: The game never makes you feel bad if you are not doing well
[2:24:04] kenshin2666: the rng can be unfair, but the game itself doesnt throw like, 1 shot fail mechanics
[2:24:10] SirKaelan: Oof KEKW
[2:24:17] Face_32: lolol
[2:24:18] verysleepyexe: just got here, what game are we talking about?
[2:24:22] ba_nanananananana: DemonicHell3 grinding the beta content right now, some of the weaker chars don't survive max curse LUL
[2:24:33] tripwires: the fixed half an hour is genius
[2:24:47] EmotePerMessage: and the game handle alot of entities pretty good
[2:24:48] Face_32: i miss that blizzard polish
[2:24:52] DewDragon: same with 7dtd
[2:25:06] Zapper_777: true
[2:25:12] Ghandus: if they would have enabled modding in dayz from the beginning, the community would have fixed that game right up
[2:25:17] meanhattermeanderer: Noita is best of both worlds
[2:25:20] DemonicHell3: How bad is it to make the mining laser from building gadgets?
[2:25:42] Face_32: but those patches dont earn money
[2:25:51] Kenanja293: gaming was redundant in that sentence LUL
[2:26:00] nick43087: LUL
[2:26:04] 4729_zex: KEKW
[2:26:07] TelRehiad: twitter in general is a dumpster fire.
[2:26:15] kenshin2666: twitter in general is just shite
[2:26:16] Face_32: why make a good patch when a store mount makes the same profit if not more?
[2:26:18] Zapper_777: Funny... the "content" vs "bugs" is the meta in the SOME atm...
[2:26:19] ohbi78: ggg/DE tell us that we cant have bugfix patches
[2:26:26] theknightpaco: Icuras needs to have enough skill points to by all the perks
[2:26:27] P05erThe: just dont do twitter lol ez
[2:26:30] 4729_zex: just don't use twitter 4Head
[2:26:32] Stoten: you pay someone else to do it and call them a community manager LUL
[2:26:37] Venxuri: Wasn't it R6S that did like a whole series of patches focused only on making the game bugfree?
[2:26:48] lurking_2: @ohbi78 PoE players would go apeshit if there was only a bugfix patch
[2:26:49] nick43087: All it is.  "my plastic box is better than yours"  blah blah
[2:26:54] ba_nanananananana: the main problem with garlic is it lacks synergy. Even the beta health upgrade doesn't give it much. Most of my builds are largely projectile based
[2:27:02] P05erThe: for who, if you just keep getting flamed by twittards, better to skip it
[2:27:02] obscure_13: @Venxuri operation health KEKW
[2:27:03] daemonaedryn: Isnt R6S dead?
[2:27:05] GenericFutureMan: the key to twitter is just stikcing to the poeple you choose to follow. once you wade into the comments, it's a shitshow
[2:27:22] The_kid_as_a_teen: YEP UWU soft
[2:27:23] ohbi78: quartz :/
[2:27:38] daemonaedryn: wtf
[2:27:41] kenshin2666: was so happy when i left ubisoft, zero regrets KEKW
[2:27:42] daemonaedryn: whats the point of the gas mask
[2:27:44] PolarSlime: they reversed that
[2:27:50] Venxuri: Ubisoft did that, I think you confused it with tarkov because I recently said that I'd love tarkov to do it because its riddled with so many bugs an fps shouldn't have
[2:27:51] Moobot: You can find Waffle's Youtube channel here - https://youtube.com/giantwaffle
[2:28:07] Dagmoo: yeah because its actual Pepega
[2:28:12] Speedglass: every division 2 update chugs worse than the last
[2:28:14] Driitzz: we don't get it KEKW
[2:28:23] tripwires: Ubisoft is a deaftone company
[2:28:24] Pati: Out of touch
[2:28:25] theknightpaco: they got a terminal case of the investers driving the company and not the Devs
[2:28:26] Face_32: they are just testing how much they can get away with, similar to a child testing his boundaries
[2:28:29] DemonicHell3: no one wants NFT's in games. Loot boxes are bad enough as is
[2:28:46] SquishSonOfSquish: !mod
[2:28:48] Face_32: @DemonicHell3 no one want loot boxes either, but here we are
[2:28:50] hisdue: !e6e
[2:28:51] Kipe33: you should definitely build the destruction tool

[2:28:59] Venxuri: you used to be so bad at fps games KEKW
[2:29:00] MushuTushu: #carried
[2:29:09] tripwires: the weird thing is that it is still the same CEO
[2:29:15] SeanSn0w: the south park games they made were amazing
[2:29:22] DemonicHell3: @Face_32 i agree but it's the lesser of 2 evils atm
[2:29:24] DKJensen98: Wait did you play with shroud when you played seige?
[2:29:24] Lemon__peel: Money lmao KEKW
[2:29:28] MushuTushu: drank the nft koolaid

[2:29:50] 0sem0: I hate NFTS
[2:30:01] imTymp: yea give me the waffle nft
[2:30:06] Venxuri: I think this is what happens to game when investors push. I belive there reason Cyberpunk was such a disaster because investors pushed them
[2:30:12] Spirevipp: any COPIUM for the next assasins creed game?
[2:30:12] imTymp: i will hold the waffle nft for ever
[2:30:13] DrHax_: F1 NFTs KEKW
[2:30:20] complexprotein: I have a lot more useless NFTs than a Waffle one, let's have it
[2:30:21] kinglouisxvii: people are dumb. nfts are awesome. only lazy scams suck
[2:30:23] 감자타인: web3 is a chesspool of opportunists and scammers...
[2:30:32] Tamerlain: even 1 % of NFT pursheses will get them a lot of money even if people hate it
[2:30:42] Face_32: just dont sell it
[2:30:55] Warkless: atleast you can wear the shirt KEKW
[2:30:57] Mandorake: t-shirts aren't rug pulls usually
[2:30:57] MushuTushu: LRC mints are cheap
[2:31:01] meanhattermeanderer: NFT's is like if they made Woppers just for the rich.
[2:31:03] dadish: @Giantwaffle one is a physical item the other is not
[2:31:06] DemonicHell3: I remember reading a story where developers didn't want NFTs but the execs were all wanting NFTs
[2:31:09] KamiSkript: T-shirt real NFT absolut not real
[2:31:12] Chan_Tv: @Giantwaffle love you dad
[2:31:15] dadish: you buy your tshirt and its yours
[2:31:16] thepolaroidbear: They make sense for selling. Not for buying.
[2:31:21] Chan_Tv: been following since 2015
[2:31:24] dadish: no its not fair
[2:31:28] Face_32: consumerism
[2:31:31] Mandorake: @Giantwaffle what if it was a union made organic shirt?
[2:31:36] DrHax_: the quality of most streamer tshirts are also shit
[2:31:45] Tamerlain: and u lose that t shirt in 1 year
[2:31:48] Nuuf: just do child labor Kappa
[2:31:49] KamiSkript: yes and it' help for the streamer and a real object
[2:31:50] Morelyn: the issues with investors pushing, is you get the opposite if they dont push, games that spend so long in development hell they forget what they were making and you end up with dnf or daikatana
[2:31:51] IcedYoshi: uh mods?  What did I do?
[2:31:56] IcedYoshi: whisper me please
[2:31:56] SolarisFall: late-stage capitalism
[2:31:59] Face_32: oh yeah, streamer apparel is insanely marked up and low quality
[2:32:00] Kenanja293: still better than the 80$ "eat the rich" shirts from a certain someone
[2:32:03] sogerr: @IcedYoshi probably wall of text automod
[2:32:10] Spirevipp: @IcedYoshi wall of text
[2:32:12] MushuTushu: could you just sell it cheaper? for accessability vs profit margin
[2:32:13] Mandorake: @Kenanja293 his are ethical and he doesn't take profit though
[2:32:13] IcedYoshi: Thanks
[2:32:20] Speedglass: Rob Drydek made $1.25 per pair of shoes sold when he was desiging for DC shoes
[2:32:27] Face_32: gimme good embroidery on hanes or FotL
[2:32:28] dadish: Ill still pick the tshirt over some NFT any day
[2:32:37] tripwires: I have to admit that some streamer-orgs do market their merch really well. Making the people think those things are worth the money.
[2:32:43] Speedglass: at one point he had 33 diff design shoes for sale LUL
[2:32:43] LokiRulez: @Giantwaffle yeah the waffle  plate and syrup shirt i have of yours, it looks like its 30 yeras old, the ink didnt hold up

[2:32:56] bcdmonkey: Waffle knockout shirt still hanging on, faded a little bit still 👍🏼
[2:33:15] kenshin2666: people tend to prefer tangible items
[2:33:16] 4729_zex: thoughts on NFT games?
[2:33:17] meanhattermeanderer: They are manufactured supply and demand
[2:33:18] KamiSkript: What is the use for a NFT?
[2:33:25] OfficerMilkshake: what about f1 merch? its so expensive
[2:33:30] Face_32: make the 9 year sub badge an NFT
[2:33:30] Mandorake: @Giantwaffle i dont buy a streamer shirt to try and become a millionaire cause i bought in early
[2:33:35] TheResinger: @KamiSkript at this point, money laundering LUL
[2:33:38] dadish: Pogs
[2:33:38] brenner1265: Beer glass merch PauseChamp
[2:33:39] Bleu_Forge: the only NFTs that are nice are the actual digital art pieces, not the randomly generated monkey images

[2:34:09] Face_32: so a beany baby?
[2:34:09] hisdue: nfts are useless, magic rotation happens on arena pepeLaugh
[2:34:15] DemonicHell3: There was a F1 game that just ended that had NFTs
[2:34:17] turtleonrocketfuel: hey waffle! have you ever tried blood and bones mod for minecraft?
[2:34:19] daemonaedryn: Isnt drdisrespect making an NFT shooter?
[2:34:22] CalebTriesStuff: Some NFTs allow you to get into special events and things like that
[2:34:22] Mandorake: @SkywardDev i love the juxtoposition between REAL and VIRTUAL
[2:34:25] 감자타인: when is sponsored steram starting?
[2:34:26] DrHax_: no you dont get it, the nfts from that dead F1 game are gonna be worth much soon COPIUM
[2:34:27] Malinax: why do you need an NFT for an ingame character? what does that add
[2:34:27] meanhattermeanderer: NEW MERCH: Waffle maker with @Giantwaffle's face
[2:34:28] Tamerlain: munchkin unique NFT game with cards
[2:34:32] imTymp: yea like imagine vrchat but to have avatars and stuff it was NFTs people would eat that shit up
[2:34:32] EmotePerMessage: audience for nft is not there yet
[2:34:35] SkywardDev: That about sums it up for me too @Mandorake
[2:34:39] Kenanja293: and then they still ban you from the game, so you have no access to use it LUL
[2:34:47] fisering1: The [#] Logo on a shirt would be Pog !
[2:34:47] ba_nanananananana: but why use blockchain when it's just in a game that wouldn't work without the game servers anyway. At that point just use a normal database.
[2:35:06] Malinax: ????
[2:35:09] ba_nanananananana: the technology for databases is also there
[2:35:25] ba_nanananananana: except more complicated yes LUL
[2:35:27] Goldenlion5648: would vein mine work to make this room?
[2:35:42] Bleu_Forge: NFTs for games will only be a good tech when you can take your character between all web3 games and not be limited to a single game
[2:35:45] ba_nanananananana: you can show what's in a database openly. Steam does it LUL
[2:35:45] kenshin2666: why worry about the future of technology when the future of humanity is already doomed Kappa
[2:35:55] tripwires: I do think that NFT's have a nice implementation for chain of ownership
[2:35:55] Moobot: You can sub to Waffle by clicking this neat link -> twitch.tv/giantwaffle/subscribe
[2:35:59] P05erThe: just let em paypal at that point KEKW

[2:36:15] dadish: And if that market place just poofs
[2:36:19] Face_32: i thought you coundt buy and sell game items
[2:36:22] Kenanja293: you can't restore anyone that got scammed
[2:36:26] ba_nanananananana: it's as secure as that other marketplace, which you don't control LUL
[2:36:31] TheResinger: nfts are not secure though? you can just drop smart contracts in peoples wallets and if they touch it you can just steal everything from their wallet
[2:36:32] Wylduck: They make a second life/sim like game and NFT be the currency/ depending on what the NFT is it’s used to buy that type item, example: a NFT of a skin shirt or so, be decent type game for a while til someone exploits it.
[2:36:34] Allmostdone: You didn't just say it can't be scammed
[2:36:36] aeadon: that's just steam marketplace, someone has to own/manage it and it may as well be a regular DB
[2:36:42] ba_nanananananana: if you run it on your own database you can actually help your customers
[2:36:43] alef9j: whats the best way to host a server with this mod with like 1 friend? local host it?
[2:36:45] Face_32: no i mean in game eula
[2:36:58] Face_32: you cant sell something you dont own
[2:37:02] stressprsso: Vitalik literally made thereum fuz his wow server decided to shutdown and he lost his items
[2:37:02] Kenanja293: if someone gets scammed and can prove it, you can only help them if you own the database
[2:37:18] Bleu_Forge: ba_nanananananana or you can skip customer support costs and not help your customers by using NFTs 5Head
[2:37:21] h00k__: whats the ore locator you use?
[2:37:29] Samwl: shat LUL
[2:37:31] SirKaelan: Shat down KEKW
[2:37:32] imTymp: it would make the ingame market the same fluxuation as the irl market to some extent then too which could be neat
[2:37:33] Larklen: KEKW
[2:37:34] ba_nanananananana: Bleu_Forge sure LUL
[2:37:38] MisterZero_: dopped trou
[2:37:44] MushuTushu: cause of WoW? thats a wild backstory
[2:37:50] Bleu_Forge: @ba_nanananananana pepeLaugh
[2:37:51] daemonaedryn: I feel like EFT proved thats a bad idea
[2:37:51] KamiSkript: but you only own some text in the blockchaine. the nft is not stored in the blockchaine
[2:37:58] Dannythebrill13: NFTs in general are a bad idea
[2:38:03] Venxuri: im not sure if this is correct, but I'm getting ready player one vibes from it
[2:38:12] MisterZero_: "good intentions"
[2:38:13] stressprsso: There are really good nft games right now. I never payed for cs go knives or more tn
[2:38:15] MisterZero_: meaning money
[2:38:27] Bleu_Forge: Good intentions, aka greed KEKW
[2:38:29] MushuTushu: Being the first to push the envelope always gets hate tho. People just hate change @Giantwaffle
[2:38:32] Klorell: would that work to sell a nft that looks different depending in the context? like it'd be a gun in a shooter and a sword in another game of the same company
[2:38:32] ba_nanananananana: look we've had a lot of time on blockchain and NFT with lots of smart people thinking how they could be used, and the best and only use case they've come up is scamming boomers. There's nothing in it. LUL
[2:38:39] Samwl: I still dont fully understand what a NFT is KEKW
[2:38:39] ragnar_25_: To me NFTs just seem like money laundering
[2:38:42] Kenanja293: until you get scammed and the customer service says "sucks for you, we can't touch it"
[2:38:43] Wylduck: Shat down ;) urban dictionary - the Waffle language defined as shutdown :p
[2:38:46] Mandorake: @Giantwaffle if there is no difference then why use the blockchain?
[2:38:48] alef9j: whats the best way to host a server with this mod with like 1 friend? local host it?
[2:38:52] imTymp: quantity will be the only difference if they decide to limit supply of certain items
[2:38:53] So_Stormy: CSGO was NFTs before NFTs
[2:38:54] Face_32: i cant sell those skins for real money tho
[2:38:59] Dannythebrill13: @Samwl literally just purchasing a link to a jpg
[2:39:13] MushuTushu: with hookers and blackjack
[2:39:18] ragnar_25_: @Samwl same KEKW
[2:39:19] MisterZero_: money
[2:39:20] ba_nanananananana: it's not a decentralized system though. NFT marketplaces are centralized and have huge security problems. LUL
[2:39:21] kenshin2666: the only way the whole NFT thing could work in the gaming space, is if all major companies worked together for its combined implementation. not each doing their own
[2:39:28] Allmostdone: They don't come up with their own because its not legal
[2:39:37] Tomatokekk: banks need authenticators. blows my mind my video games have them but banks dont
[2:39:44] TheResinger: i mean, they would be useless if they were nfts too though no?
[2:39:46] stressprsso: Because u own that thing in blockchain games and ingame items are a scammmmmm
[2:39:50] Gliderman: chat very angry lol
[2:39:52] kaos4666: LOL skins KEKW
[2:39:54] VaultPls: but those rule34's will live on forever
[2:39:54] matey1116: @Atomic_tomato11 banks do have them
[2:39:59] Kenanja293: if league shuts down tomorrow, and the skins are on a blockchain, they're still unusable
[2:40:02] DewDragon: i wish i could sell my league account
[2:40:03] ba_nanananananana: yeah but then you create a game with secondary market you don't control that relies on other people LUL
[2:40:13] hackett33: If steam shut down tommarow everyone would lose all there games
[2:40:18] MushuTushu: Imagine you bought the spectral tiger in wow. if it was an NFT you could sell it when you quit wow
[2:40:25] Tomatokekk: @matey1116 really? not aware of any large banks that use them
[2:40:26] ragnar_25_: I don't have a side because I don't understand how they work KEKW
[2:40:34] ba_nanananananana: yes but steam isn't based on scamming boomers, NFT marketplaces are. LUL
[2:40:35] kkotoro: did we finally get digital storage boys
[2:40:38] matey1116: @Atomic_tomato11 most UK banks have them
[2:40:41] Face_32: wouldnt it lead to a monopoly on the market if we all use the same check out system for NFTs? @Giantwaffle
[2:40:41] Wylduck: Yea imagine if ppl went and made their own store system. Shopify/ Etsy would be out of business.  NFTs are the new crocs of the internet lol
[2:40:45] Cnomesta: GoG
[2:40:46] Mandorake: @Giantwaffle If steam goes down that means all of civilization is dead monkaS
[2:40:46] Allmostdone: steam is DRM that's so true
[2:40:50] dadish: @MushuTushu only if some one wants to buy it
[2:40:53] imTymp: So the blockchain is like Sword art online when he switches games but keeps his stuff?
[2:40:57] DX_Plates: Uh I'm pushing 500 games...
[2:40:59] kaos4666: 4k
[2:40:59] Tomatokekk: @matey1116 well that must be why. Im US :P
[2:41:02] kenshin2666: if steam shut down, id just go and pirate the games online and play them anyways
[2:41:03] dadish: its useless until some actually push out some money
[2:41:04] MatthewTV: what modpack?
[2:41:05] Strikedogg: pretty close to the same im sure.. been buying games daily almost since steam came out lol
[2:41:05] sogerr: @imTymp yes
[2:41:06] matey1116: @Atomic_tomato11 KEKW F
[2:41:06] Slymph: games are attached to cd keys which is universal no?
[2:41:09] MinnesotaLG: I have 3 games I play lol
[2:41:12] Mandorake: @Slymph no
[2:41:24] MisterZero_: I still have an orange box lying around
[2:41:25] alef9j: lost 4k in bdo and now the game is uninstalled
[2:41:29] Slymph: well shit KEKW
[2:41:31] Speedglass: no mans sky has a 7 gig update tosay #steam
[2:41:38] SirAlexFrost: buying a game on steam is buying permission to play the game LUL
[2:41:38] Strikedogg: the game keys youre thinking about isnt a cd key its a steam key
[2:41:43] ba_nanananananana: steam disappearing isn't the same category as opensea going down LUL
[2:41:43] matey1116: waffle, what are you working on toay?
[2:41:43] Mandorake: @Giantwaffle Im going to find out how to gift my account to my children.  Going to pioneer it.
[2:41:55] DX_Plates: Steam Key =/= CD Key
[2:41:58] DemonicHell3: You also don't own your wow acct either same concept
[2:42:12] Kodish: Just went to check how much my steam account value would be and I see "504 games unplayed" yikes :D
[2:42:15] iTents: Out of my library of 700 games I think the only game that offers an "Out of Steam" CD Key is GTA 5
[2:42:20] StOrMy1100: @Mandorake Change the email and password and done?
[2:42:24] Strikedogg: anything you access online basically
[2:42:27] Allmostdone: you are renting your games
[2:42:28] Flobu_: stadia KEKW
[2:42:31] aorta12: aorta12 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 11 months! still waiting for another birthday throw up stream pog
[2:42:34] Azure_Storm: @Speedglass NMS will continue to update until the heat death of the universe it seems like. Gotta hand it to them.
[2:42:36] Mandorake: @StOrMy1100 lol good idea.
[2:42:44] ba_nanananananana: but people sure will be glad when the content for a game is detached from the game so when the game shuts down they can trade their worthless tokens on a" decentralized" platform yup yup LUL
[2:42:53] So_Stormy: @Speedglass The new update is pretty PogBones too
[2:42:54] Gliderman: Same with EVE and planetside
[2:42:55] Face_32: thats why we cant sell anything from games, cause we tech dont own anything from it. thats why i have a hard time why NFTs are trying to be a thing in games
[2:43:00] meanhattermeanderer: Turn your badge into an NFT
[2:43:02] rykk3r1: launcher over launcher over launcher ResidentSleeper let's just go back to physical discs
[2:43:03] Mandorake: @ba_nanananananana haha ya exactly.  its like yay you still "own" something but its digital and pointless
[2:43:05] Venxuri: when is your sponsored stream?
[2:43:08] alef9j: I love watching this stream, I'm gaining iq everytime
[2:43:16] Gliderman: I think cities: skylines are the same
[2:43:20] hotdove911: same thing for your bank account. if you lose your info, you lose your money
[2:43:24] iTents: Thats what I meant about GTA 5, I purchased it from steam, but since they have their own licensing and key system I own it, but all my other games are restricted by steam.
[2:43:27] DX_Plates: @rykk3r1 Gotta have a Drive for a Disc
[2:43:28] Raxpox: Owning an NFT is kinda like owning a theme park ticket, they can still invalidate if they want but they can't take it away from you.
[2:43:39] omennn32: @alef9j same man lol
[2:43:46] Allmostdone: will you also signed a agreement about not re selling or reusing any of their content
[2:43:54] alef9j: @alef9j ahahah
[2:44:00] ba_nanananananana: NOBODY would want to trade for csgo skins without CSGO also being a thing LUL
[2:44:00] Moobot: Come join the Waffle House Discord! <# https://discord.gg/fhGFtMuzdS
[2:44:04] hackett33: Thats why people pushed back on disgital only consoles and everyone wants a physical disc
[2:44:14] Face_32: but if there is not scgo anymore your skins would be worthless right?
[2:44:27] Kodish: It's like Diablo 3's real money auction house that got removed
[2:44:32] Strikedogg: why do people think nfts are far off from crypto.. youre paying for a digital number/id..
[2:44:32] celadriel23: but does that thing even need to be an nft at that point then?
[2:44:38] mainG__: nfts right now are CS skins without CS to use them
[2:44:38] MushuTushu: those are def scams
[2:44:41] Kenanja293: the value is that you can transfer from your banned account to your new one LUL
[2:44:45] Mandorake: @Giantwaffle they're just scams imo.  None of them have proven to actually be something of value.
[2:44:49] luthal_: this NFT is worth $500 because I said so :)
[2:44:55] kenshin2666: it would take some sort of cataclysmic event for valve/steam to shut down
[2:45:00] ManneehFresh: talking about pixelmon?
[2:45:10] ba_nanananananana: Guss__Bus yes and their "value" is based on scams and insider trading
[2:45:18] wollevanhard: And then 1 month after release each of them is like 50 bucks
[2:45:21] DX_Plates: "Whales Only"
[2:45:24] ItsANoBrainer: Isnt with that logic original pokemon kinda NFT, each pokemon has unique stats LUL
[2:45:27] DrHax_: bUt MaKiNg GaMeS iS eXpEnSiVe PepegaChat

[2:45:35] Stoten: nfts just gonna be a place for people with too much money to fuck around cuz they can
[2:45:37] Mandorake: @Giantwaffle the more you play this mod the more i want to play satisfactory
[2:45:43] Venxuri: lol
[2:45:46] Crossed_legion: you can get 2 pokemon w/ same stats tho
[2:45:49] highvltge: please cover the scoria!
[2:45:59] Pigero: So the solution is “decentralized”? So who pay for the storage? Who pay for the bandwidth? The admins?
[2:46:01] imTymp: each csgo skin has its own float so they are all nfts Kappa
[2:46:02] ItsANoBrainer: LUL
[2:46:04] Purecrew: I am an NFT!?
[2:46:08] Blackdeath911: yes lets sell humans via NFTS

[2:46:13] FreeZze__: fingerprint iss basically NFT KEKW

[2:49:04] DX_Plates: TheSecretOne5 That is why you need himtachi or whatever that is, it creates a local server so someone from outside your network can connect.
[2:49:10] ba_nanananananana: I played CSGO for 30 hours according to steam and made $70 LUL
[2:49:11] imTymp: if you never sell you can never go negative because u dont have net gains yet

[3:15:37] Kenanja293: you use another card on this building
