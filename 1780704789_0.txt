[0:34:32] Agilebacon: That is pretty weird, but to each their own.
[0:34:36] darth_baggins: Would it be better to sit clothed in an empty tub??
[0:34:37] AlexWojtak: @RufusOmega That's why we have soap!
[0:34:38] HauntingBird: I can relate to what Briony means completely LUL

[0:34:43] ButterflyGhost: hryM
[0:34:43] scRUNGKUS: i think that's only a little weird
[0:34:49] Making_Tangles: It's not weird, it allows you to get used to the water temperature better, in stead of it just being too hot when stepping in
[0:34:50] tesmike: I'm to tall to take baths :(
[0:34:50] ButterflyGhost: wideKermit
[0:34:54] Moztastic: The tears help fill the tub

[0:35:00] NikoSpud: Briony wont understand the reference Kirsty
[0:35:03] wil_co: hryLaf
[0:35:05] Sharkdog58: Rythian is weird *noted*
[0:35:06] voltsurfer037: Surely it depends how big the tub is

[0:36:32] SpecialK_852: st0nky bri0ny
[0:36:32] voltsurfer037: Here's an odd one, do you get out the bath then take the plug out, or do you let it all drain then get out?

[0:37:04] TheOgTSM: I take the shower before the bath LUL
[0:37:06] RufusTheHairyCatWrangler: Baths are also very inefficient. A shower uses much less water than a bath
[0:37:07] HauntingBird: Bath's are unhinged behaviou in every wayr, is what I am learning
[0:37:08] Mzyra: Ew cold showers
[0:37:09] AlexWojtak: @RufusOmega Yes, in the water, not on your body. That's what cleaning is.
[0:37:12] Stefnos: or take shower.. then bath

[0:44:00] Kokomatic10: hi Azull, how are you?
[0:44:01] Pancrace: Care Bears always hunt in packs
[0:44:06] AlexWojtak: Turns out they couldn't bear him
[0:44:08] voltsurfer037: Fun fact: polar bears are having to move further down to search for food, so they now meet and make crossbreed with grizzly bears

[0:45:43] scRUNGKUS: a little thing called morals
[0:45:53] Kynet1c: imposing human laws on animals is downright stupid and insane
[0:45:59] RufusTheHairyCatWrangler: c'mon Kirsty, thousands of years of recorded history show that we are not able to control our nature
[0:46:16] voltsurfer037: At what point do we take a bear to court for eating a people?
[0:46:17] Mzyra: brionyGiggle
[0:46:49] Ledel526: I've heard of kangaroo courts...
[0:47:00] AlexWojtak: Should he have the right to bear arms?
[0:47:01] Faaafv: the bears didn't ask for a roommate so if they kill him it's his fault
[0:47:07] ButterflyGhost: The bear leaves court and whispers 'I wish you well'
[0:47:09] Arnhawl: murder is a bit naughty NOTED
[0:47:14] scRUNGKUS: but the person was an idiot who went and lived with a wild animal
[0:47:21] Kokomatic10: the bear would get some good meals while eating other prisoners
[0:47:45] Stefnos: the bear would have gotten taste for human flesh, wich makes it ALOT more dangerous
[0:47:51] scRUNGKUS: we should kill sharks because sometimes they kill people
[0:47:51] voltsurfer037: The bear gonna bear, you can't judge him for that
[0:47:55] 3v1lc0w: not the bear's fault if someone delivered food to his door
[0:48:09] HauntingBird: I feel like I need more context to this to hear if the killing of said bear is fair enough or not
[0:48:10] Ashmalech: If you go and live among the bears and then die to the bears I feel like you're experiencing the *Consequences of Your own Actions*. And it's quite different than if the bear comes into a town hunting people.
[0:48:12] zettabyte__: if bears made laws i think that would be a bit polarizing

[0:48:48] Limewood_: @Kirsty, if you let Zoeff sit on the end of the bed he might bring you a gift after sleeping. kirstUnless
[0:48:54] Nilesy: keep it light joey
[0:48:55] RufusTheHairyCatWrangler: Humans kill humans all the time, and mostly get pathetic prison sentences, of which they generally only serve half. But a bear kills a human and it's execution? I'm with Briony on this one
[0:49:08] NikoSpud: Yes that is the sound of human flesh being rended from bone
[0:49:11] AlexWojtak: What was that leonardo di caprio film? Getting eaten by a bear didn't seem super fun
[0:49:16] MrAzullMoro: @Purple_Chewbacca @Ashmalech kirstJammies brionyAww

[0:49:36] wil_co: glassk
[0:49:39] lookimapengu1: i think what you dont want to have happen is for the bear to think that person == food... its like how they put down alligators if they get fed by people too much because they start associating people with food
[0:49:54] Purple_Chewbacca: Azull brionyTap
[0:49:57] voltsurfer037: I keep making the briony reference "but recently " but my friends don't know it 😔

[0:53:13] Arnhawl: It's been 2 days without Alex and Briony is considering pissing on the floors
[0:53:13] HauntingBird: That's just called being on a festival. I don't see the significance
[0:53:14] 39SaltyCookies: I can't wait for someone to clip that out of context pcGiggle
[0:53:22] voltsurfer037: Basically briony wants to mark her territory
[0:53:27] Mizzuru: Briony's Husband just furiously stapling plastic sheets to every surface in the house having just tuned in

[0:55:05] zettabyte__: never a dull moment here
[0:55:11] Ledel526: "Indoor plumbing was a mistake" -Briony (probably)
[0:55:17] Mizzuru: Briony people that piss everywhere have a name and that name is 'A huge fucking problem' or 'Simon'

[0:59:33] voltsurfer037: Billionaires ?
[0:59:40] ShyBees: Not having to make eyecontact with people
[0:59:44] ButterflyGhost: I'd get rid of gendered clothes, it's just weird we have these 'rules' about clothing
[0:59:47] hanniebeckie: eye contact and small talk
[0:59:57] Mizzuru: Why do I feel like Briony is abut to say 'You know what I think we shouldnt have to bother with? Wiping, its a mess down there for me and thats how I like it!'
[1:00:07] ginjninj: cursorLUL
[1:00:20] Purple_Chewbacca: the rules around what counts as 'professional'

[1:00:51] silentp13426: hanniebeckie definitely sounds daft
[1:00:51] ButterflyGhost: I buy a lot of makeup and hardly ever use it hnyHmmm

[1:01:39] meauwer: Ask mango?
[1:01:43] ButterflyGhost: I'm good at makeup except for eyeliner, I'm shite at eyeliner Sadge
[1:01:59] Ledel526: I thought you filled a pie-tin with the makeup and how you wanted it to look, then slapped it onto your face.
[1:02:12] EnigmaticFeeling: look up bearded drag queens rythian
[1:02:18] Ashmalech: I've recently started teaching myself how to do some eye makeup (I'm a man with a beard) and I like it but it's hard.
[1:02:21] Sharkdog58: well thread-shape  your eyebrows first.
[1:02:22] ButterflyGhost: You could glitter your beard peepoHappy
[1:02:25] HauntingBird: Go old school Rythian, and put a lot of powder in your beard to make it white, and go full face makeup
[1:02:32] Mizzuru: @EnigmaticFeeling I mean thats kind of going from 0-11 immediately
[1:02:37] lesand_bard: Briony you too can look like a victorian era gamer with too many pikachu just watch this vlog on the kirsty channel
[1:02:38] hansanpaints: CRIMP the beard

[1:03:35] lesand_bard: I have done the pink glitter in beard for pride... it took a long long long time to get rid of it all. my partner said i looked like i had done naughty things to a fairy
[1:03:35] AlexWojtak: I used strawberry beard oil before. That was really lovely and just smelled nice all the time.
[1:03:40] Ashmalech: Just a bit of eyeliner is nice to do and the beard doesn't come into that. I'm sure eyeshadow is equally like that but that' a lot harder and I haven't worked it out yet.
[1:03:49] silentp13426: sand_bard LUL

[1:07:26] meauwer: But raccoons are trash pandas and pandas are and a bears. Transitive property
[1:07:29] Ashmalech: Does a Binturong count as a bear?
[1:07:30] HauntingBird: Like, a black bears temperement, strength and so on makes it actually possible to play with them without serious injury. Still not advisable, but possible
[1:07:40] ShyBees: I thought briony said chimps KEKW as in chimpanzes
[1:08:08] HauntingBird: Could you burn the trees?

[1:08:18] Idunyken: peepoArrive
[1:08:19] HauntingBird: I don't know how fire works in this version of Minecraft
[1:08:34] Ashmalech: Binturongs are called bearcats but I think they're more closely related to weasels and stuff like that than actual bears.
[1:08:39] NathGayThey: Do you have dirt in your pockets or is it just diarrhoea?
[1:08:44] ButterflyGhost: They might have fire spreading turned off
[1:08:45] PhoticSneezeReflex: duny yogLove
[1:09:04] RufusTheHairyCatWrangler: @HauntingBird Spectacled bears are small (for bears), generally not aggressive and only eat fruit. If there's one type of bear you could feel safe playing with it's a spectacled bear

[1:13:32] Idunyken: yogHands
[1:13:37] JPcursed: he saw a juicier grass block
[1:13:37] voltsurfer037: Maybe you've got to right click his face, try putting a pumpkin on your head so he doesn't get angy
[1:13:40] EnigmaticFeeling: pedWhy
[1:13:40] AlexWojtak: I think the two block tall flowers count differently from the one block high flowers
