[2:24:57] thatcrazycrabs: Yeah, but Sean bean shouldn't be in it. he could do better
[2:25:03] FirebirdCAW: It is pronounced "Shawn Bawn" or "Seen Been"
[2:25:04] Laimubot: reminds me of the outfit
[2:25:09] MatSmith83: VHS? Did you also buy the soundtrack on gramophone, grandpa? SwiftRage

[2:25:13] thatcrazycrabs: Wait, they mandated it?
[2:25:14] berbils: Yeah, studio demanded there be a man in it
[2:25:14] kirby23590: qtsCozy
[2:25:18] theguitarlos: oh yeah I heard that the studio didn't like it was an all women cast
[2:25:21] Sir_Xurr: At least he doesn't die in a movie.
[2:25:28] LinkR1987: I want a Jack Black Silent Hill
[2:25:28] theguitarlos: so they added Sean Bean and detective for the male portion
[2:25:28] fandang027: The director thought Harry was acting too feminine
[2:25:30] Diego35SHs: The director could have made that movie so much better if it was just a retelling 1:1 of the first game instead of whatever that was
[2:25:30] theguitarlos: apparently
[2:25:33] thatcrazycrabs: Why sean bean...in Silent Hill
[2:25:33] ArjunM: call laurie
[2:25:33] kabii_sama: the director apparently wanted only women on his set because he dislikes working with other men
[2:25:35] quantras6: I swear I saw somewhere they replaced Harry with a woman because the director felt the story suited a woman better?

[2:25:45] Chatterbox1991: @Limealicious  the first movie had Rose instead of Harry because they thought Harry was too effeminate cus he passes out and faints all the time
[2:25:48] AdrianBauer: sean bean checking google was valuable footage
[2:25:51] KuRixd_: my dad has the first silent hill movie on DVD
[2:25:55] Diego35SHs: I mean Revelation 3D
[2:25:58] WYSTIKUS: limesLost
[2:26:03] lammjamm: yeah the director though Harry should be Rose because he thought dad's should worry about their kid or something
