[3:12:41] Stragmol: bitcoin -> dollars
[3:12:41] redgreenup: you can sell across state lines
[3:12:47] Nexhunter: no you cannot
[3:12:55] Kevinsback: It also allows the companies who sell in states where it’s legal to use bank accounts and stuff
[3:12:56] RamseyRinehaus: absolutely cannot sell across state lines
[3:12:57] Nexhunter: that is federally regulated
[3:13:00] Stragmol: intrastate is fed
[3:13:00] Taizun: Sounds very American to do something so archaic in modern time
[3:13:03] Nexhunter: that is highly fucking illegal
[3:13:03] DX_Plates: Puts all those business at a much higher risk of robbery as well because of that.
[3:13:06] BeolSae__: you "CAN" *cough*
[3:13:07] TheWonderLlama: Depends on the laws in the state
[3:13:14] Berrog: some are using debit type termials that act as an ATM its realy strange

[3:13:24] peppery_pinniped: Technically with alcohol too. You can't carry it across state lines
[3:13:25] Nexhunter: you cannot
[3:13:27] Mandorake: it is completely illegal to do anything across state lines
[3:13:31] dobie: @Zuiuzz prettypipes
[3:13:33] MCas86: wouldnt that be considered trafficking though?
[3:13:33] samuraijac: anything across state lines it federal so no
[3:13:36] RamseyRinehaus: in WA state, their law says you cannot leave the state with the weed
[3:13:39] justanotherneb: youju definitely can NOT cross state on that. as soon as you cross a state line you enter federal jurisdiction. They control all interstate commerce.
[3:13:39] Zuiuzz: thanks @dobie
[3:13:44] TTV_TFBmac: I got a store that I can use my card to buy weed
[3:13:45] QuesoBad0nga: Just reading on Twitch channel KEKW
[3:13:45] Nexhunter: it not even state laws that matter
[3:13:50] SoFloLuna: joe smokes on the podcast everyday
[3:13:53] Kevinsback: It would be up to the commerce department to determine across state line sales if the government fully decriminalizes it
[3:13:58] Mandorake: crossing state lines is illegal
[3:14:03] ajman225: just grow weed if you wnt it. it is so easy just takes time
[3:14:06] Apparentthreat: so many resources go to it
[3:14:14] Doomwyte: good luck, I saw a lets go brandon flag truck yesterday where I live

[3:14:19] DewDragon: but mei prisons!
[3:14:20] BeolSae__: I'd love to see psychedelics decriminalized 😊
[3:14:20] philip0524: Which state will be the last to legalize in your opinion?
[3:14:20] Moobot: You can sub to Waffle by clicking this neat link -> twitch.tv/giantwaffle/subscribe
[3:14:21] skinee: @Giantwaffle New mexico just passed recreational. So Texas officially has recreational weed on its border. Just gotta present an id stating you are 21.
[3:14:27] RamseyRinehaus: amen waffle, at least reschedule it from schedule 1
[3:14:31] Kenanja293: let's ban alcohol then PartyTime
[3:14:32] WebDeveloperGuy: I remember texas giving a guy life in prison because he had a vial of testosterone and they counted the weight of the whole vial as if it were testosterone which nailed him for intent to distribute.
[3:14:33] n8level: its only in recent times that broad cultivation and use of hemp products was decriminalized (Farm Bill)
[3:14:40] Nexhunter: @skinee except for they probably wont sell to Texas license holders to avoid the selling issue
[3:14:43] Silver_Skeeter: but alcohol is culture so it's fine :)
[3:14:43] redgreenup: why doesnt amazon sell weed
[3:14:44] HQuinnch_tv: @Giantwaffle  if they make weed legal then what do they do about everyone whos been sentenced because of possession? is their life just wasted for no reason?
[3:14:47] Stragmol: they tried that once
[3:14:50] matey1116: KEKW

[3:16:11] justanotherneb: larger punishment would mean nothing when the states i've lived in are strangely lenient on DUI's. when i was in Oklahoma i'd hear of people who had several dui's and just had an ignition interlock, not a lost license...
[3:16:14] Zyie: Twitch is streaming "Silent Reading", lol. Just a girl reading manga, in silence
