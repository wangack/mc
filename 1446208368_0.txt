[1:08:21] Askjong: It got sensored
[1:08:23] MisterRabbitHead: a nice idea to consider before the thing goes boom
[1:08:25] Immp: A basic compression dynamo has a maximum power output of 40 RF/t.
[1:08:34] dobie: all of the powah gens are p good, the thermo is what iv been using its insane for how cheap/passive it is
[1:08:42] jayrickson87: Powah is gated off till later on
[1:08:45] daemonaedryn: The thermogenerator does 390rf/t i believe
[1:08:47] TheBonBon_: solar panels are good

[1:10:40] Crossed_legion: @Giantwaffle any thoughts on Elon buying 10% of twitter?
[1:10:46] maccabeus: mekanism jetpack takes compressed gas as fuel
[1:10:51] dobie: which si kinda weird, but power did feel way too easy in e2e
[1:10:55] Kenanja293: to be fair, this modpack seems centered around bees with clockwork bees just transmuting some blocks that you need full magic for
[1:10:55] bcollinstex: bread blocked KEKW
[1:10:58] hockeygoaliechris: can you press the seeds for oil

[1:31:49] Jibbur: scanner is cheap
[1:31:50] daemonaedryn: You can make a scanner, but the upgrades are a bit annoying
[1:31:54] dobie: @jayrickson87 its jus plastic hes missing i think?

[1:32:34] Jibbur: @Giantwaffle look into travel anchors, they are cheap and let you teleport decent distances for free
[1:32:37] RedDiablos: Good morning! Finally got my blood altar setup in my E6E playthrough. God that was a journey lol

[1:35:26] itzSimondr98: pepeSmoke
[1:35:32] stormblaz: MAAAAYBE if they dint require gem 8th cpus
[1:35:38] stormblaz: a 7700k cant upgrade
[1:35:42] stormblaz: Lol
[1:35:57] stormblaz: i think tehy afraid of being vulnerable to older gen cpus for safety
[1:36:06] obscure_13: @stormblaz kind of their own fault its so hard to convert with the hoops in bios you have to run thought
[1:36:15] Cmdr_Void: @stormblaz pog i have one of those! so Im save from the autoupgrade
[1:36:26] Atzgee: just buy better PCs SeemsGood
[1:36:28] LordDusk: a 7700k can certainly upgrade to W11, you just need a TPM chip, which you can buy separately.
[1:36:37] ninopanda: @stormblaz win 11 is easy to break into :)
[1:36:50] Apparentthreat: Streamer is gone. Contemplate the meaning of life
[1:36:55] BloodPainting: depending on the mod you can teleport on way point? @Giantwaffle
[1:36:57] 0sem0: is he still working on the ME system my dudes?

[1:37:24] emofelinesad: you what?
[1:37:25] stormblaz: in bios
[1:37:38] FraKo23: Im running W11 on 7700k
[1:37:43] stormblaz: oh nice
[1:37:44] Pointern: might need to upgrade bios first
[1:37:46] Winner5001: you need tpm 2.0, not every mobo has it
[1:37:48] Idlebob_: TPM*
[1:37:51] stormblaz: ah
[1:37:53] Cmdr_Void: waht is TPM?
[1:37:53] 0sem0: What you working on
[1:37:56] itsKev73: the lack of ability to turn off combined taskbar buttons was enough for me to revert back to win10
[1:37:56] dobie: keep 1 ore for scanner
[1:38:05] itzSimondr98: Save 1 YEP
[1:38:08] maccabeus: trusted platform module?
[1:38:10] stormblaz: Tits per minute
[1:38:12] Swiftkix: Trusted Platform Module
[1:38:12] ZyianDev: Trusted Platform Module
[1:38:18] CPU_Pirate: TPM - Trusted Platform Module
[1:38:21] Chhissan: hey waffle
[1:38:24] TheMooStr: it's been on motherboars for years...
[1:38:25] pr0gz: !modpack
[1:38:25] Moobot: Waffle is playing Enigmatica 6 Expert mode! You can get it at curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/enigmatica6expert
[1:38:28] Tabakhase: this whole tpm thing is very odd... and complicated... in itself, M$ is doing a good thing there... only way to get manufactures to put em in is require em, they cost like nothing - and without that they rly cant "elevate" the general security of windows (as in, "secure defaults") --- sa making a "hard cut" with a windows-version was kinda the best they could do...
[1:38:28] Chronoes: @itsKev73 I use ExplorerPatcher to fix that in W11, works nicely for me. I agree on the same thing
[1:38:29] stormblaz: how do we know its trusted
[1:38:29] Pointern: tpm is security related yes.. every business laptop is usually required to have them
[1:38:30] TopT3k: Some mobos you enable secure boot to enable TPM
[1:38:43] OhWhale: or i just be lazy and stay on windows 10
[1:38:45] unnoticedx: just a building block for security related stuff as far as i know
[1:38:47] runtime_terror: it'd be much better if those grinder wheels killed you if you get too close ;)
[1:38:53] stormblaz: im glad Win10 fixed DDLS issues
[1:38:56] LordDusk: I found kitten slippers... They scare creepers, and make a miauw sound if you take fall damage...
[1:38:57] Joshuapetch: Refined storage drives when? PauseChamp
[1:39:01] stormblaz: i hated having ddl crashes
[1:39:19] Joshuapetch: Everyone buying TWTR

[1:39:37] DroidBoy: ze end of crypto iz near, sir.
[1:39:49] ninopanda: that bug is a chrome bug waffle
[1:39:54] Sentinel1_9: what was the chrome bug @Giantwaffle ?
[1:39:54] itsIffy: w11 often has my taskbar disappear
[1:39:59] stormblaz: i heard chrome had issues
[1:40:04] daemonaedryn: Ohhh... crystal glass
[1:40:06] stormblaz: apparently edge is kind of bette4
[1:40:21] LokiRulez: ive run into audio issues with my mic on win11, but i have a more complicated setup than most
[1:40:32] stormblaz: some reports say windows slowing chrome on purpose
[1:40:38] TheEndMyFriend: EU wants to band crypto
[1:40:38] stormblaz: so people stick with edge in w11
[1:40:41] MrLorenthal: man i can't get this modpack to work, doesn't matter how much ram i give it, it just won't load the world.
[1:40:49] Joshuapetch: gloslyglass
[1:40:50] Zapper_777: is this for the Scanner?
[1:40:54] daemonaedryn: Your going to want to adventure for the corundum

[1:44:42] BloodPainting: women pol vault ;)
[1:44:46] daemonaedryn: I believe you can yeah
[1:44:55] Venxuri: I guess you playing dayz will settle my concerns because i'm quite torn if i wanna play it or not
[1:44:56] daemonaedryn: Then after you get one of those blocks you can grow em YEP
[1:44:56] Vovosunt: @Giantwaffle you also need scanner upgrades/modules
[1:45:10] stormblaz: lmaoooo
[1:45:16] PiitchFk: hey @Giantwaffle is there a quarry system in this pack?
[1:45:20] Winner5001: not every mobo has tpm 2.0
[1:45:28] InTheLittlePro: port forwarding was BY FAR the hardest part of setting up a MC server
[1:45:35] Kamipulu: why do I want tpm enabled? @giantwaffle
[1:45:44] InTheLittlePro: Forget teaching people how to do windows shit
[1:45:49] unnoticedx: best videos are the low quality guy who barely speaks English but tells you EXACTLY how to fix it perfectly
[1:45:56] InTheLittlePro: @Kamipulu its required for windows 11 upgrade
[1:45:58] FernandoA: You can't upgrade if your processor isn't 8th gen or newer
[1:46:02] Allmostdone: You don't Windows 11 whants it on
[1:46:03] SimonSez: @stormblaz Windows 11 neds 8th gen Intel CPU or never

[2:55:27] emanymanheman: @rykane1 yeah I just checked and season 2 is coming out in summer
[2:55:29] daemonaedryn: See heres the thing... I think terraforged fucks with stone spawn locations
[2:55:30] Vovosunt: deepslate is not a thing in1.16
[2:55:32] saini311088: where the rock crystals were
[2:55:41] emanymanheman: season 3 was also confirmed and will go all the way through year one of high school
[2:55:45] HQuinnch_tv: you found deep slate when you were looking for frost steel, i think @Giantwaffle

[2:56:08] Borlaq: @Giantwaffle Maybe check that massive lavalake you have there?
[2:56:13] awesomefreak72: they spawn but they are rare
[2:56:14] Face_32: you havent seen any around yet? ive ran into them all over
[2:56:16] SeanTKE: scan the block for big patches of slate?
[2:56:25] UnforkableOnion: i found them close to the surface
[2:56:27] Andersxa: maybe there is a cave on the deep slate level so it is easier to find?
[2:56:28] Vovosunt: deepslate in this is not deepslate in 1.18
[2:56:30] johnnymac17: I think "above deepslate" is referring to the 1.18.2 y level where deep slate starts to spawn
[2:56:36] drebisdavid: i can be wrong but i think there is a small chance to get the crystals in quest rewards
[2:56:46] DimensionalShadow: Sounds like they're everywhere lol

[2:57:16] Klorell: what are those pillars?
[2:57:17] Jman1185: lake of fire

[2:57:26] Sentinel1_9: glowing from what?
[2:57:43] orangecreamsicle3: wafflePog
[2:57:49] officialzip: quark site defaults to the 1.18 documentation. You have to select 1.16 since that is what the modpack uses
[2:57:53] DrHax_: no fortune DansGame
[2:58:39] daemonaedryn: The nature compass doesnt see a corundum biome weirdly enough
[2:58:41] DimensionalShadow: So vague
[2:58:41] Andersxa: so anywhere underground?
[2:58:45] officialzip: can you natures compass it?
[2:58:49] YOUCEP: can you search it with natures compass?
[2:58:50] dobie: all u need is a single block and it will self replicate

[2:58:54] orangecreamsicle3: 5Head
[2:58:55] dobie: i found mine in an atum pyramid
[2:59:12] dobie: in the boss loot chest
[2:59:17] DrHax_: this looks like some area from those old super hard minecraft maps
[2:59:36] Face_32: you can see what block it is on the map
[2:59:37] potatoforever: you might have better luck in a vanilla biome that isnt an ocean? purely speculative idk
[2:59:43] zebadrabbit: waffle got a haircut? lookin nice

[3:00:28] 00_Falcon_00: if you look up the actual ore block, it will show you the world spawn settings
[3:00:29] Vovosunt: look for caves
[3:00:29] CorSPACE: all? waffleLewd
[3:00:29] Chronoes: all your hair? hmm
[3:00:32] johnnymac17: If it actually changes the biome like it says you might be able to use the map like your saying
[3:00:40] daemonaedryn: But above deepslate monkaHmm
[3:00:45] Ataiu: Such a dad joke lol
[3:00:52] Dizz1227: does the nature compass exist?
[3:01:04] dobie: what was the name of the biome
[3:01:05] Vovosunt: try nature compass?
[3:01:10] johnnymac17: you might be right. It might only show surface biome
[3:01:10] CorSPACE: they added 3d biomes in 1.16 soooo probably not
[3:01:10] Myekos: alternate worlds?
[3:01:21] SeanTKE: looks like there are 11 issues on the enigmatica 6 github repo about corundum and the recommendation there is atum pyramid chests @Giantwaffle
[3:01:23] johnnymac17: @CorSPACE BibleThump
[3:01:24] PiitchFk: isnt' the wki referring to an actual biome tho? so maybe like caves under any biome?
[3:01:25] CorSPACE: for the nether

[3:03:05] AndyHayes: how long has he spent on this modpack so far?
[3:03:25] Alamose: digital storage will skyrocket productivity

[3:23:28] GreenLeaf7898: Argos?
[3:23:31] HostileLogOut: @soddi that is kinda what makes Poe amazing. your not forced to play the game.
[3:23:42] LordDusk: Lost Ark players are whining babies. It will never be ok, there is always something to complain.
[3:23:46] Kadotettu_: BobTaco21 Not as bad of a grind as PoE every league, imo
[3:23:57] HostileLogOut: @Giantwaffle what breaks the game for me atm is that if i want to play another character i have to redo all story if i dont want to spend 5k + gold to skip etc.

[3:25:24] samuraijac: alts
[3:25:28] celadriel23: cuz of the bots being banned

[3:25:32] iKyuute: How's the expert going lirikCAPPY
[3:25:35] itzSimondr98: alts, bots, events
[3:25:37] Dumpified: more people who have alts in t3
[3:25:37] BobTaco21: @Kadotettu_ It is overwhelming to begin tbh
[3:25:39] Tiggaboo: so little gold coming into the markets due to bot bans
[3:25:40] HostileLogOut: markets crashed cause bots are getting to T3 and events etc.
[3:25:43] AIex_0: @HostileLogOut i just do my msq gradually on all my characters its no big deal
[3:25:45] badmanydoc: Bot banning
[3:25:55] Draiv_: All the mats gonna be 1 gold sooner or later anyways if it follow Korea market

[3:26:15] babyaddalyn: right now in EU t3 mats is 9gold :p
[3:26:15] LordDusk: Market crashed because of the influx of materials due to the events.
[3:26:16] Kadotettu_: @Giantwaffle Theres also some market manipulation too
[3:26:18] celadriel23: yeah cuz theres no way to get lots of gold quickly
[3:26:23] Amefis: @Giantwaffle market crash bacause 100k gold earlier cost  80 dollars and now 270 dollar
[3:26:24] LordDusk: Everybody i selling their tradables, and buying it from events

[3:26:25] Andersxa: isnt that good tho? I hate inflation in games
[3:26:30] HostileLogOut: @AIex_0 oh yea. i get that but its kinda boring :D the story isnt that great.
[3:26:31] itzSimondr98: Milexna drops to 8 from time to time YEP
[3:26:47] Kersenka: Gold is more valuable, that is why items cost less to buy as less gold in the game compared to when bots flooded the servers

[3:31:02] HostileLogOut: @Kadotettu_ correct. since the big chest is 1200 gold guranteed or so but has that 10k chance. but the chance is to low. and the medium chest gives 500 but u also got 5x chances of getting 1000s of gold bars

[5:24:31] kelleymcches: what would you say the ratio between tech and magic is in this mod? i feel like most modpacks have too much magic
[5:24:38] daemonaedryn: weird
[5:25:15] merathyu1: I love the 02 emotes
[5:25:16] baehll: @KelleyMcChes definitely a lot of magic, lots of later tech is gated behind magic mods
[5:25:30] coolcake2: @JayBelzz enigmatica 6 non expert?
[5:25:34] dobie: its 8 major tech mods, 8 magic mods and they are very much intertwined
[5:25:43] dobie: end up needing to go deep in all the magic mods
[5:25:43] Vucko33: Vucko33 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 45 months!

[5:26:17] daemonaedryn: 2 to 2 to 1
[5:26:18] anonymouserawr: @JayBelzz seconded
[5:26:41] RedDiablos: Did you have a hard time find your heart of the oceans? Some of my treasure chests were close to bedrock
[5:26:43] HannesIsTaken: wait you have 2 blocks or?
[5:26:44] dobie: @Teathie i dnt think the regular version has changed recipes so would be much more sandboxy not too much in the way of progression
[5:26:55] FlammAlpha: PauseChamp pressure?
[5:27:02] JayBelzz: @coolcake2 @anonymouserawr thanks! tomorrow im gonna dive in. Need something to relax with after work

[5:31:03] dobie: i was in a stream with one of the devs the other day, and he was saying that its really hard to make exploration rewarding
[5:31:07] Apparentthreat: odd are you'll need the system to make an item more than once
[5:31:08] dobie: and this is how they do it
[5:31:16] IronGajeel: @Giantwaffle also u can get shit ton of compressed iron blocks from pneumaticraft villager

[5:39:11] Frankenstain: I've heard 7pm EST
[5:39:14] Frankenstain: no one knows
[5:39:17] CommanderRudolph: Hopper the concrete powder into the basin and hopper out? Should be fast enough no?
[5:39:34] Astrolus: i think its random cause they dont want people to go ruin other stuff before the end
[5:39:36] kelleymcches: i think so too
[5:39:46] chopchoi: nice belgian flag :)
[5:40:00] drsnaki96: there's 2 massive wars atm so i don't think it's anytime soon

[5:40:07] Larklen: they banned you pepeLaugh
[5:40:08] MrChurchh: They want it to look organic, you can't do that by not closing it randomly.
[5:40:11] ReubenlI: the mods can nuke anything they wont like anway

[5:41:40] Nilau: Germany also bots, I saw their github
[5:41:41] StOrMy1100: The 2 paintings made the Dutch news actually
[5:41:47] MegaSpyAssassin: It's so dumb how botted it all is, kinda ruins the spirit
[5:42:01] calebhub514: pretty sure the original /r/place had bot extensions as well. it's basically the only way things get done and stay unfortunetly
[5:42:02] EddieAcefire: like whats up with so many my little pony ones?
[5:42:06] Sentinel1_9: finlands flag is under attack Sadge
[5:42:07] Nilau: Germans bot their pixelart on the flag, the flag itself is protected by randoms
[5:42:11] BilusTheTiny: there is one on github that every discord use
[5:42:12] rauko_64: the bronies have admitted to botting as well
[5:42:17] inorganic: BTS vs france KEKW
[5:42:18] Larklen: any thing fairly larger or complex is almost guaranteed to being botted in some fashion
[5:42:31] kelleymcches: reddit doesn't care, more accounts being made looks good for advertisers
[5:42:33] Nexhunter: ya know what fuck this Kadan quest rooBlank i just destroyed a whole island rooBlank
[5:42:34] x1xamen: wrong terminal

[5:42:44] Kardiiac: reddit wants more users, doesnt matter if their bots
[5:42:47] Silver_Skeeter: wrong terminal dood
[5:42:50] xSG90x: for reddit it's about site traffic isn't it
[5:42:53] Sentinel1_9: @Giantwaffle what if they keep it "open" so some of the things done already could actually be null bc its already closed
[5:42:54] StOrMy1100: Aren't you able to work around captchas with bots?
[5:42:54] Saisino: Farming clicks and new accoutns before going public :)
[5:42:58] deathfurr: 69
[5:43:11] Face_32: some people where saying they arent banning 1 day accounts cause they are trying to inflate account numbers for publix
[5:43:17] Kardiiac: @StOrMy1100 yeah, theres tons of libraries for getting through them
[5:43:23] Face_32: yeah its working
[5:43:27] kelleymcches: it's the only reason why it would be 4 whole days long i feel
[5:43:33] StOrMy1100: Wait Reddit is going public?
[5:43:35] Nickonil: wait reddit is going public?
[5:43:42] ReubenlI: cant wait for them trying to sell this stuff as nft that will be some pure chaos oh god
[5:43:42] xSG90x: google searches will ramp up the site and make it more visible also
[5:43:42] deathfurr: what's reddit?
[5:43:44] StOrMy1100: monkaGun Nickonil
[5:43:47] CommanderUrsus: There are two things I canтАЩt stand in this world, people who are intolerant of other peopleтАЩs culture, and the Dutch
[5:43:47] hoffs: you really think 5 days of activity changes anything? Its the stupidest take that has been repeated in lsf
[5:43:51] Nickonil: rooD
[5:44:01] xSG90x: reddit gives me a headache
[5:44:09] DjinN_SS: apparently if your account isnt verified it's a 20m cooldown instead of 5m
[5:44:30] Goodboy34: !Pack
[5:44:41] Larklen: Then just make 4 bots instead of 1 and thats now a non issue, dont even need to verify Kappa
[5:44:41] Moobot: You can find Waffle's Youtube channel here - https://youtube.com/giantwaffle
[5:44:41] DjinN_SS: oh yeah I agree, just the only thing I've seen that's different
[5:45:00] boogerbomb01: Screw it make it so that you had to havbe an account before it started
[5:45:11] Nexhunter: no it isnt
[5:45:14] Larklen: what if the cooldown was on the actual pixel itself and not the users :)
[5:45:22] Littleme02: Only allow 1 month old accounts to place with postive karma
[5:45:22] HeyItsADK: can get a twilio phone number for a few $
[5:45:25] ReubenlI: just think of some of the osrs bot software that spam make emails or what they used for amazon prime farm what they did awhile back for twitch account stuff
[5:45:26] kelleymcches: why not a 4 day cooldown?
[5:45:28] GummiKu: Have you seen the template extension?
[5:45:30] kelleymcches: 4 day age*
[5:45:30] Ataiu: it would be cool to see a image appear in one second if like a bunch of people plan their stuff ahead
[5:45:31] Tomthegamer: @Larklen Too many users.
[5:45:34] kemal1132: Add a captcha for every 10 pixels you place
[5:45:34] x1xamen: nah too much spam
[5:45:35] Tasar_: Brilliant
[5:45:37] Pointern: all twitch accounts should have been 2FA really so ppl didnt make troll accounts
[5:45:38] Tomthegamer: It would kill place
[5:45:46] hoffs: @Larklen then anyone with lowest latency wins
[5:45:46] xSG90x: virtual identity verification like most datings apps now do where you take a photo of yourself and its sent to a physical user to verify...?
[5:45:50] Larklen: Its literally the same traffic as it is now OMEGALUL
[5:45:52] deathfurr: what is spam? what is spam? what is spam?
[5:45:55] daemonaedryn: No that would remove the chaotic element inherent to it
[5:45:58] woops30: someone would paint everything black and nobody would be able to change it
[5:45:59] Tomthegamer: @Larklen No.
[5:46:00] Alamose: each pixel is a vote then? every five minutes?
[5:46:06] Saisino: If you had a CD on a pixel you would just bot so your account spams the pixel every 5 min
[5:46:17] TigerLuv: or pay for each pixel LUL
[5:46:20] daemonaedryn: PogChamp
[5:46:22] kelleymcches: each pixel is now an NFT pepeLaugh
[5:46:30] Tapeman83: monkaS

[5:47:05] TelRehiad: do not give them those type of ideas
[5:47:06] sogerr: after the first r/place there was an ethereum r/place version that worked like that
[5:47:11] Blahcookies: if it was an nft it would definitely sell out but only owned by resellers
[5:47:19] Frankenstain: France kept stealing our Phish donuts and finally backed off
[5:47:21] kelleymcches: they thought they could take it over like the german/belgian flags
[5:47:24] Tomthegamer: France F's up everywhere they go. ;p
