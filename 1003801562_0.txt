[0:12:43] Tech: Variety streaming
[0:12:52] aorta12: do you grow the starting room or do you open up new rooms?
[0:13:02] DomStuff: you should stream yourself modding

[0:13:20] Moobot: Support Waffle by using his Epic creator code: Giantwaffle

[0:14:43] Invalidm_: hmm okay
[0:15:22] Tech: this modpack is such a neat concept
[0:15:25] mechoriet: they probbly want a day inbetween to go over the data in super detail i guess
[0:15:51] mechoriet: yeah no engine swap this time
[0:16:07] mechoriet: or the new mounting bracked
[0:16:07] Wetware: These new engines more durable maybe?
[0:16:16] mechoriet: giving them less issues
[0:16:27] loafabreadly: The new engines have a different forming process too

[0:37:51] Mrbumblebeebot: create is on forge
[0:37:53] Valentin_PV: Don't you need forge to use the Create mod?
[0:37:55] Silver_Skeeter: like a seperate mini bag in your inventory for tools
[0:37:57] Marksmen31: Create is forge

[0:54:49] gurekam74: @Wetware Source is the game engine Gmod, CSGO, and HL2 run on. Source 2 is it's successor.
[0:54:50] CommanderUrsus: stockAck
[0:54:51] Allmostdone: They don’t want growth. Most want stability when new thing are forced introduced
[0:54:58] dogma802: @Wetware The source engine was made to make Gmod + CS source + TF2; source 2 is the next engine
[0:55:01] akaCube: Smear it all over blocks :)
[0:55:04] GTLugo: @Wetware sequel to the Source Engine by Valve. Source engine is the base engine of a lot of Valve's games.
[0:55:18] gurekam74: S&Box is the spiritual successor to Gmod if we wanna talk in technicalities.
[0:55:20] BurnedAether: Like Terraria being 2d Minecraft.

[3:15:11] DigitallyAdmiringHumanity: whats rsi?

[3:15:14] Akyro: do you have your main skill on right click?
[3:15:19] punkgeek: Starcraft 1/2?
[3:15:19] Xenotics: saw that Kripp has a little robot arm thing grabbing his desk, to rest his elbow on, probably helps alot
[3:15:30] Appz: Pedal thieving ardy knights ^^
[3:15:32] MrHashbrowns: no builders wands?

[3:16:00] MiraPacku: peepoHappy music
[3:16:08] BobPatience: rsi = Runescape infection
[3:16:14] grimmn: repetitive strain injury
[3:16:16] Madarion: problem with poe is that it grows, only a little every league, but man that game is old now. so the devs cant do much about the amount of clicks nowadays
[3:16:58] DigitallyAdmiringHumanity: whats poe?
[3:17:05] MiraPacku: can you put the field projectors under the ceiling? monkaS
[3:17:12] punkgeek: @dpmarag0ni Path of Exile
[3:17:13] Madarion: path of exile, an action rpg, @dpmarag0ni
[3:17:26] n8level: tried to make a low clock poe build this league, still have to click at least once and hold it down
[3:17:26] Tenkaichi500: i was told apparently  hand warmers help with rsi. not sure how accurate that it
[3:17:33] Tenkaichi500: *is
[3:17:40] Driitzz: poe stands for PLains of Eidolon Kappa
[3:17:43] punkgeek: Hand warmers definitely help with tendinitis/carpal tunnel
[3:17:56] TarMonA: icy hot
[3:18:32] Duvenel: Chris said that it's not a thing about the game, which is bs
[3:18:34] Allmostdone: or is the mouse design
[3:18:37] Xenotics: auto picking up currency would be massive for that
[3:18:42] n8level: @Tenkaichi500 wrist/sweat bands have worked for me in the past, keeps blood vessels open through the colder wrist
[3:18:52] Driitzz: like spending 45 mins of constant clicking after completing a juiced up map
[3:19:06] Tenkaichi500: @n8level hmm interesting
[3:19:06] KilerStarr: A lot of people use keys to move instead of clicking Giantwaffle it's a somewhat of a small solution
[3:19:15] punkgeek: Would flasks working as self aura help, so you're not spamming 1-5 all night?
[3:19:29] MrHashbrowns: diablo 3 made it so all nearby gems pick up when you pick up 1
[3:19:32] Frecked: Hmm just tried Redbull cactus its actually kinda good didnt think it would be when i saw it at the store.
[3:19:34] Helo_KiX: or like in D3, when you pick up a gem/crafting materiall it auto picks up all nearby
[3:19:35] Nexhunter: just use a single 1-5 key cap KEKW
[3:19:35] holypt: why not have a QOL that just auto pickups currency?
[3:19:36] MrHashbrowns: same with mats
[3:19:36] capmarty: lets just agree that POE needs a lot of QOL
[3:19:38] Driitzz: also making a macro for flask to reduce RSI , is bannable , thanks ggg
[3:19:41] omar_i_: and you'd get banned for a flask macro LUL
[3:19:42] babyaddalyn: can't you just drop the blocks and explode them @Giantwaffle ?
[3:19:48] Nexhunter: there is a key cap for that
[3:19:49] Xenotics: what if you could make a filter to which currency get picked up auto, would like that
[3:20:02] n8level: flask triggers would be interesting - I got flashbacks of PSI programming this league for some reason
[3:20:20] freecandyrpd: remapping isn't tho
[3:20:25] TarMonA: flask jug mix.. bas on the 5 flask you put in it Kappa
[3:20:27] Nexhunter: or just make a single key cap to press all of that at once dwjft5head
[3:20:42] Larklen: There is your project for your rPi, little actuators to cycle through all 5 flasks pepeLaugh
[3:20:45] KilerStarr: Nexhunter LUL

[3:22:02] Rydoes: @duvenel, Did they get banned?
[3:22:09] Frecked: watch demon slayer movie
[3:22:09] n8level: poe2 changes gem usage right? gems on skills not items? still not clear to me how it works
[3:22:14] freecandyrpd: make a invar pick so when you smack the wall you dont get resources
[3:22:19] TuxLafitte: Movie night danHmm
[3:22:25] KilerStarr: Have you watch the new serie on netflix Shadow and Bone ?
[3:22:27] Larklen: you watch Mortal Kombat yet?
[3:22:41] Duvenel: @rydoes not sure, didn't follow up with it but they made a keycap that covered 1-5
[3:22:46] Xenotics: waffle have you watched sunshine? amazing movie. imagine its for you
[3:22:47] Larklen: For a MK movie, its pretty fun
[3:22:52] MrHashbrowns: It was decent IMO
[3:23:02] doomserr: it was better than I thought it would be
[3:23:04] Tenkaichi500: it gets super cheesy tbh
[3:23:08] TuxLafitte: I watch so many D&D/tabletop RPG strims  I am always behind on the movie strims.
[3:23:10] TinyBicycleTom: Kano was great in the new MK film
[3:23:11] leewickert: Amazon's Patriot
[3:23:23] Allmostdone: Mortal Remake!
[3:23:29] Frecked: What are you building waffle?
[3:23:29] TarMonA: it ok flim.. if they had 30 more min of film time to flash it out.. it could be Alot better
[3:23:33] x_slayer2000: dont like the game but the movie is rly good
[3:23:33] Helo_KiX: @tenkaichi500 have you seenn the other movie? KEKW
[3:23:45] freecandyrpd: watching you not set up the auto crafting for this hurts

[3:35:46] Duvenel: gonna need some flowcharts to figure this out

[3:38:30] Tenkaichi500: regular mental exhaustion?
[3:38:36] akaCube: I've been wondering why so little games let you start at a negative (like animal crossing) in debt or something like that. Are there modpacks based around getting out of the negative instead of getting to infinity?
[3:38:37] rogert9000: take an afternoon nap

[5:35:59] Nilau: idk why its so hard to just do that tbh
[5:36:14] Ragabosh: It's way more legally isulating to just ban without giving a specific reason, that way you can't get litigated against anything in particular
[5:36:50] Orin_The_Sly: Its cool to not nake it public but the person who is being punished MUST know.
[5:36:54] DemonicHell3: I'm cool with the public not knowing but the broadcaster should know exactly why they were banned.
[5:37:03] SuperbaeRS: ^
[5:37:14] Archelonde: thats what everyone wants atm
[5:37:16] Wetware: Streamers just want to know what not to do so they don't get banned too, is it really that hard for these muppets to realize that?

[5:45:19] AsHackDM: BOP
[5:45:20] ThePatKing: @bonbonnie13 ok :)
[5:45:22] RodriCraft93: instead of addressing the actual problem, they just want people to fill forms so you dont see in it your browse section
[5:45:25] Mapleton: Ducks are too sexy fro twitch :(
[5:45:28] UECNSNemesis: I'm an idiot D:
[5:45:28] Official_Hype: right naked ducks should be banned
[5:45:28] Orin_The_Sly: KEKW
[5:45:30] Celioxis: What about Swans
[5:45:40] DemonicHell3: it's the biggest dodge of all time
[5:45:40] BONBONNIE13: Dude I'd watch a pool full of cute animals like ducks, that sounds great.
[5:45:42] DigitallyAdmiringHumanity: what do u mean we are fucking idiots
[5:45:43] TarMonA: when the last 25 of 30 stream is hot tub..  there something wrong
[5:45:44] Nilau: These weird naked cats in hottubs
[5:45:46] n8level: no idiots watching twitch?! Kappa

[5:46:00] SuperbaeRS: do people really have a problem with this?
[5:46:04] ChromaCym: I think people were pissed because there wasn't a tag
[5:46:05] omar_i_: they want a Tag chat
[5:46:11] Orin_The_Sly: This seems like a Non-Issue
[5:46:13] sankhazo: I thought there IS a tag?
[5:46:17] Orin_The_Sly: Oh!
[5:46:19] Celioxis: Not yet
[5:46:19] daemonaedryn: Oh that makes more sense KEKW
[5:46:20] BONBONNIE13: @Smoothvodka007 that's TOO META! That'd break the system! MONKERS
[5:46:26] mechoriet: its like 2 minutes max
[5:46:27] Orin_The_Sly: LMAO! RIGHT! KEKW
[5:46:28] Scojan: They are probably worried about the misuse of it
[5:46:30] MoonChocolates: @BONBONNIE13 LUL
[5:46:31] Kuroiorb: oh woops
[5:46:32] ThePatKing: @bonbonnie13 you made a joke I am going with it as joke
[5:46:37] dasmako: lmfao
[5:46:38] Celioxis: Well you could make a tag for literally everything...
[5:46:43] Mapleton: i want to be upset >:(
[5:46:46] Kuroiorb: how hard can it be to make a tag??
[5:46:48] RodriCraft93: i thought the problem was people using twitch to sell other things in different platforms, not the actual hot tubs or shit
[5:46:50] RafaLorenzo: they need Minecraft diamonds to make new tags
[5:46:53] just_cro: i like ducks with out feathers and a nice crust ofter some time in the oven braeNom
[5:46:59] Kuroiorb: just do it
[5:47:00] Nilau: Hottub tag when peepoHmm
[5:47:00] isfil: add a Row in the Tags Table
[5:47:03] omar_i_: it takes alot of work and effort to make "Trans" tag, its like 5 letters com'on! Kappa
[5:47:06] The_SilentGuardian: How dare you put them all under one tag......
[5:47:10] Ragabosh: can we get a ducks in swimsuits tag?
[5:47:13] tjsutton: having a tag could make it easier to harass streamers and open Twitch to enabling harassment maybe?
[5:47:14] celadriel23: hot tub time machine
[5:47:15] daemonaedryn: @RodriCraft93 Yeah theyve not even addressed people being spammed with onlyfans links
[5:47:17] Orin_The_Sly: "A pth forward"? WTF does that mean? Just make a damned Trans Tag WTF?
[5:47:20] Scojan: I wouldn't be surprised if they are worried about misuse of the tag or targeted harassment because of the tag
[5:47:20] mechoriet: YEP
[5:47:20] daemonaedryn: It is KEKW
[5:47:21] sankhazo: @Giantwaffle I think it goes beyond the tag, maybe it has to do with forms and stuff like that?
[5:47:22] mechoriet: its a mess
[5:47:25] Paydrig: can i just finally be able to filter streamers by their sexuality?
[5:47:28] SuperbaeRS: emote only mode probably KEKW

[5:47:30] BrokenBlade15: What is this about?
[5:47:37] Celioxis: @Kuroiorb well it's not about the tag, its about the discussion about it. Having a Trans tag Twitch 'has' te maken BLM tag etc. etc. that's why :p
[5:47:43] UECNSNemesis: guarantee someone has already spammed the amogus penis
[5:47:48] daemonaedryn: @BrokenBlade15 That twitch doesnt have a trans tag
[5:47:50] Wetware: So many words, so little content... guy should be in Washington
[5:47:55] sankhazo: If they are giving non answer, why do the stream? Just a clown show
[5:47:57] Driitzz: if they add tags for lgbt do you think they will add tags for straight people aswell ?
[5:48:01] RodriCraft93: @DaemonSzyman  some literally have they patreaon, mipriv or of link on their title, like come on. They promote this type of content
[5:48:02] Kuroiorb: don't think that's it @Celioxis
[5:48:03] 11_343: bruh he just wont stop talking KEKW

[5:48:29] ThePatKing: Yeah some ppl just take it too seriously and end up fucking their own health
[5:48:38] Chronoes: the chat was awful
[5:48:44] Celioxis: @Kuroiorb well it could be in these times :p I mean making a tag is ez, they made tags before :p
[5:48:48] Wetware: "We're really concerned about getting your feedback, so we can summarily ignore it"
[5:48:50] BONBONNIE13: wait so what even are Twitch Tags? I don't think I've seen this stuff?
[5:48:50] n8level: "I don't care" nation
[5:49:00] BeagleCypher: I'm always down with less restrictive terms of service, hope Twitch won't bow to the outrage.
[5:49:00] Moobot: You can sub to Waffle by clicking this neat link -> twitch.tv/giantwaffle/subscribe

[5:58:02] TarMonA: you donated your veiw time KEKW
[5:58:02] DigitallyAdmiringHumanity: Ill comeback and give this show the finger
[5:58:03] Nilau: @Giantwaffle haha, used the reply function on you
[5:58:07] babyaddalyn: is he now explaining why it was bad? :p
[5:58:09] Lands8142: that was a non-answer lol
[5:58:09] MiraPacku: pepeLaugh come back later
[5:58:22] Wetware: Tackle what, it's so nebulous LUL
[5:58:23] SuperbaeRS: this guy is a dj?
[5:58:24] Ragabosh: stalling to fill the last few minutes
[5:58:25] Bleu_Forge: tackle this "together" KEKW
[5:58:29] complexprotein: BOP
[5:58:31] Wazix11: :)
[5:58:31] Watertoad: im never coming back peepoLeave
[5:58:31] sankhazo: What a circus
[5:58:39] ChromaCym: they talked about literally bans and hot tubs and nothing else
[5:58:43] Orin_The_Sly: Complete waste of time
[5:58:43] BloodBlight: All fluff.
[5:58:50] fat_larz: why are people's chats getting deleted for saying fake donations
[5:58:52] Ynno: yo Waffle i know its random, but i love your streamvember month you do, take care!
[5:58:54] daemonaedryn: Did they pretty much say, we wont do anything, and fuck what you want?
[5:58:55] Wetware: Rarely has so much been said that conveyed so little
[5:59:02] richie385: Is it just me or can’t you paste on mobile anymore
[5:59:04] AshtenD: I can see it abused by honophobic people but eh.
[5:59:08] Jedidude77: how hard can it be to add it
[5:59:08] isfil: Well spaguetti code make simple things harder!
[5:59:13] Miky0_o: what are the trying to tackle?
[5:59:14] mechoriet: maybe there system in very staticlly writting ?
[5:59:16] daemonaedryn: @Wetware I see you dont listen to politicians KEKW
[5:59:18] Fimbululfr: ooh god, the steam tags MONKERS
[5:59:19] SuperbaeRS: they basically said, filter out your own stuff, we won't change anything
[5:59:26] UI20: Chat is moving so fast no one will notice I am gray Kappa
[5:59:28] Frankenstain: I missed the first part, did they talk about DMCA with music streamers playing covers?
[5:59:36] Askjong: no
[5:59:40] BONBONNIE13: @DaemonSzyman they basically said "we'll add a trans tag/work on that in the coming weeks" - because adding a handful of tags I guess takes multiple weeks 🤷
[5:59:42] QuesoBad0nga: They slapped the fingers and Banned doc, and they cant ban Tubbers?
[5:59:43] DrHax_: @UI20 how do I use GreyFace ?
[5:59:47] Official_Hype: they should allow porn then
[5:59:48] ThePatKing: @superbaers did they say they won’t change anything or look into it?
[5:59:50] mechoriet: @Frankenstain ofc not KEKW
[5:59:57] daemonaedryn: @BONBONNIE13 I bet the programmers get payed by the hour YEP
[6:00:00] DrNucleotides: OnlyTwitchFans
[6:00:02] mechoriet: or i havent heard it
[6:00:03] BONBONNIE13: YEP
[6:00:06] willcj: @QuesoBad0nga well doc probably broke TOS and theyre not
[6:00:06] BloodBlight: Handle it like broadcast, impose fines, not bans.
[6:00:08] richie385: I can’t paste on chat anymore on mobile is that only me anybody
[6:00:18] Wetware: That was 30 minutes to convey what would have been better in a tweet LUL
[6:00:19] n8level: I wouldnt want my kid watching hot tub streams
[6:00:24] Frankenstain: @mechoriet ugh... thanks for the answer though
[6:00:26] SuperbaeRS: @ThePatKing they said they were gonna check the reports, so yeah 'look into it'
[6:00:32] Kuroiorb: fines only make things allowed for the rich @BloodBlight they do nothing
[6:00:36] Sanduckchan: yeah but naked yoga woman showing EVERYTHING is educational Kappa
[6:00:42] daemonaedryn: There isnt really a way to block out all hot tub streams, theres new ones popping up constantly
[6:00:50] BeagleCypher: YouTube is hosting some really sketchy content though.
[6:00:54] BloodBlight: @Kuroiorb Base it on the channels revenue.
[6:00:55] richie385: Waffle watched qt I don’t know why I’m surprised
[6:00:57] Nilau: They normalize the grey area and make it less grey that way in some sense
[6:00:59] NerdKensel: Thought we were trying to let people be happy and do their thing Kappa
[6:01:01] Orin_The_Sly: SOmeone is buying a living room hot tube RIGHT now
[6:01:02] UI20: Kappa grey face no space ofc
[6:01:04] ThePatKing: @superbaers ohh ok thank god. I got scared with misinfo
[6:01:08] RoninStorm: Like many of my meetings at work.. that would have been better as an email.
[6:01:09] Woogyface: @Giantwaffle i'm glad they banned butt emotes. hot tub is much more family friendly
[6:01:15] DrHax_: just sift through the ENTIRE just chatting section and MANUALLY set streamers to "not interested". works especially great if you dont have an account YEP
[6:01:17] burritothenoodledragon: @Giantwaffle bakinises are over kill  but full peice or  move cover baithing suit  a kos
[6:01:20] Celioxis: Remember Twitch has age restriction set to 13, do these 'hot tub streamers' have the mature filter on?
[6:01:20] mechoriet: @DaemonSzyman scan thumbnaills for x percent of kind and then mark that for review ?
[6:01:22] burritothenoodledragon: ok
[6:01:24] BONBONNIE13: That's why I'm saying Daemon - they outta just make a Hot Tub category like how they have Science, Art, and Music - then you can block out the whole category instead of manually going through every stream 5Head
[6:01:26] mechoriet: skin*
[6:01:28] mugge___: They're not even in the hot tub anymore, but on a big inflated animal that's in the water. It's so much about bending the rules.
[6:01:30] Kuroiorb: still a tricky system @BloodBlight revenue is also hard to calculate since some people have sponsorships
[6:01:33] wahakiller: Theres nothing inherently wrong with it I dont think Twitch really wants to go do that road
[6:01:38] SuperbaeRS: no just chatting yeah
[6:01:47] BloodBlight: @Kuroiorb True.
[6:02:02] wahakiller: exactly
[6:02:02] mechoriet: welp i guess time to block just chatting i guess
[6:02:03] daemonaedryn: @mechoriet I meant more for the customer, people dont want to scroll through just chatting to block hot tub streamers only to do it again a week later
[6:02:07] ThePatKing: Hopefully just like things improve over time
[6:02:13] WGG25: upcoming category: erotic
[6:02:17] FalleNM3rC: @Giantwaffle have you seen the whole naked yoga stuff on yt? wonder how thats allowed
[6:02:26] wahakiller: you dont have to watch it if you dont want to
[6:02:28] Nilau: Just stay in the bubble you are in right now :p
[6:02:28] ThePatKing: True
[6:02:30] Wazix11: The problem in my mind is that the site is open to kids and kids should have to go to sketchy sites to get that content like I did :P
[6:02:33] toclosebutfar2: I agree
[6:02:34] DigitallyAdmiringHumanity: oh god
[6:02:36] DrHax_: @FalleNM3rC simple, educational tag KEKW
[6:02:39] babyaddalyn: RIP
[6:02:40] Celioxis: 13 and in a hot tub?
[6:02:41] Orin_The_Sly: Yup! monkaS
[6:02:44] BONBONNIE13: Hot Tub in the living room? susHmm
[6:02:44] Celioxis: YIKES
[6:02:45] FalleNM3rC: @DrHax_ KEKW
[6:02:49] Butterwhales: MONKERS
[6:02:55] mechoriet: @Giantwaffle imagine a 13 year guy going to twitch frontpage and sees those hot tub girls ?
[6:02:59] RoninStorm: I feel like this wasn't an issue until Wubby did a hot-tub stream.....
[6:02:59] OfficerMilkshake: big yikes
[6:03:01] SuperbaeRS: will be a messy situation
[6:03:07] burritothenoodledragon: @Giantwaffle bakinises are over kill  but full peice or  move cover baithing suit  a ok
[6:03:08] DrHax_: @FalleNM3rC but then again serious animal abuse is also fine for youtube, and actually growing, so who knows rooShrug
[6:03:09] Bbane1028: I came in and waffle dropping straight facts
[6:03:09] omar_i_: then hot tub will be banned KEKW
[6:03:14] smoggas: sadKEK
[6:03:21] Askjong: that just happend
[6:03:24] mechoriet: its gonna get messy i feel
[6:03:26] Askjong: it's on LSF
[6:03:27] wahakiller: I give the hot tub thing till the end of the year before it gets too erotic and therfore banned
[6:03:36] mechoriet: @Askjong wait
[6:03:36] UECNSNemesis: who are you, who is so wise in the ways of Twitch
[6:03:40] SuperbaeRS: first letting it roll, then full banhammer
[6:03:40] FalleNM3rC: @DrHax_ yet they ban someone for reacting to hottub streams
[6:03:46] daemonaedryn: I love how he kept saying the moderators are closely watching the hot tub streams KEKW
[6:03:46] Press_Escape: someone gets electrocuted
[6:03:48] BONBONNIE13: PepeHands no Waffle HotTub Steam PepeHands
[6:03:49] BIRDFRUIT: FeelsGoodMan Clap minequaf
[6:03:51] ThePatKing: In the end twitch has the raw data
[6:03:57] toclosebutfar2: @Giantwaffle Hot tub minecraft stream PauseChamp
[6:03:59] SuperbaeRS: so no hot tub stream peepoSad
[6:04:00] omar_i_: Bbane1028 we just watched twitch giving feedback on hot tubs, and other topics
[6:04:01] complexprotein: Gotta get that hot tub stream in asap before the ban
[6:04:06] complexprotein: Kappa
[6:04:10] Invalidm_: what do you think would happen if twitch started giving the bikini like few day bans or fun bans mehdiHMM
[6:04:11] Kuroiorb: what kind of dumbass comment was that
[6:04:14] UI20: human skin monkaW
[6:04:20] wahakiller: My question is, why arent more male streamers like you doing hot tub streams as a joke lol
[6:04:23] Rubinix: I remember that!
[6:04:24] dancarrol0710: Waffle gonna get a hotter in his living room
[6:04:24] UI20: fail
[6:04:25] Celioxis: @BONBONNIE13 his cycling streams were already a hot tub :p
[6:04:27] Orin_The_Sly: Thank you who ever banned that weirdo
[6:04:29] daemonaedryn: KEKW
[6:04:29] dasmako: that was great LOL
[6:04:33] ThatOnneGuy: Good times

[6:04:39] Butterwhales: YEP
[6:04:39] rykk3r1: KEKW
[6:04:40] ThyTellurian: the guys doing the parody streams are hilarious
[6:04:42] daemonaedryn: Clip Kappa
[6:04:42] SuperbaeRS: i find that funny when they write it on a board or on themselves even KEKW
[6:04:42] QuesoBad0nga: hahahaha
[6:04:42] Stillglade: it was hilarious
[6:04:47] ThatOnneGuy: Totally didn't pay to see dat ass
[6:04:50] throat_pump: i wish blocking content actually blocked it.... the option literally does nothing and the people you're not trying to see still pop up
[6:04:50] produkteriswf: someone clip
[6:04:55] willcj: i remember
[6:04:57] Celioxis: I'm KEKW
[6:04:58] FinnYellowbelly: D: nobody wants to see that....your beard is glorious tho
[6:04:59] MoonChocolates: Im from the jtv days

[6:05:04] verysleepyexe: i remember
[6:05:04] bcdmonkey: I forgot about that LUL
[6:05:06] ninopanda: @Giantwaffle oh i was here KEKW
[6:05:08] OfficerMilkshake: them hot tub chats are something else
[6:05:11] Deadfox74: How much to change your bikini Kappa
[6:05:12] Moobot: Come join the Waffle House discord https://discord.gg/G5FeeveP3c and chat with the community! Remember to link your Twitch account in the Settings (gear) > Connections for subscriber channels.
[6:05:13] The_SilentGuardian: Except you have more streaming experience than most of the twitch managers running the platform..... so your opinion is worthy.
[6:05:14] Comis19: They need to create a M for mature section for hot tub streams
[6:05:15] Celioxis: Been here for over 6 years, man I'm old
[6:05:17] RoninStorm: The amount of money I would pay to see @Giantwaffle in a pikachu onesie, sitting in a hot tub, and getting shit faced drunk while playing minecraft...
[6:05:27] willcj: ^
[6:05:28] just_cro: wait what? is just chatting 18+ ? or don't you see the preview if it is marked 18+? i don't think so.
[6:05:31] Official_Hype: so, hot ub when?
[6:05:41] BeastboySAW: Now we have to pay extra for all dat ass on OnlyWaffles.
[6:05:41] BONBONNIE13: What I want to know, are male nipples still banned on Twitch? Because if a dude does a hot-tub stream, the male bathing suit doesn't cover the chest. What's the play for that? "Just wear a t-shirt."?
[6:05:42] Kuroiorb: FeelsWeirdMan
[6:05:44] WGG25: @throat_pump if you are actually interested in blocking channels and/or categories, you can get an extension for it
[6:05:55] mephium: I don't think male nipples are not bannable
[6:05:59] mephium: anymore at elast
[6:06:01] BONBONNIE13: I thought they were
[6:06:04] mephium: least*
[6:06:04] Archelonde: they arent anymore
[6:06:09] Nilau: Just wear a bikini 4Head
[6:06:09] Celioxis: It's the context again :)
[6:06:13] BeastboySAW: I wish they were. :p
[6:06:20] dancarrol0710: waffle getting a hot tub
[6:06:21] BONBONNIE13: wait fr not anymore? because I remember them being banned at one point
[6:06:28] willcj: male nipple not sexy
[6:06:28] Orin_The_Sly: Shirtless dudes were banned for a minute but they undid that LUL
[6:06:31] Official_Hype: :D
[6:06:33] Riddixdan: LUL
[6:06:35] JoxerTheM1ghty: Andy does sauna streams all the time. No ban. Nipples and all.
[6:06:35] wahakiller: ugh i hate this world
[6:06:36] BeagleCypher: LUL
[6:06:41] MiraPacku: susHmm
[6:06:44] daemonaedryn: FeelsWeirdMan
[6:06:44] Celioxis: Welcome to the world KEKW
[6:06:45] dasmako: >_>
[6:06:46] grimmn: just shows how arbitrary that distinction is
[6:06:47] Chronoes: that sounds hilariously stupid
[6:06:47] Nilau: Here in Germany they just straight up show breasts if they are the main subject. Even at 3pm tv @Giantwaffle
[6:06:52] Rubinix: Call in the nipple expert!
[6:06:55] BONBONNIE13: the dude sitting in the board room - looking at nipples all day like susHmm
[6:06:59] Orin_The_Sly: #FrreTheNips
[6:07:01] Enconi: imagine if it got blurred slowly
[6:07:05] Nilau: Yea totally
[6:07:08] KABBL: @Giantwaffle youtube is also inconsistent with nudity, look up nude yoga on yt
[6:07:10] MoonChocolates: @BONBONNIE13 LOL
[6:07:19] Nilau: I don't think its bad when they are talking about for example breast cancer
[6:07:27] Orin_The_Sly: Twitch is like PG-13 or some shit tho
[6:07:29] toclosebutfar2: If it educational of some sorts its probably ok to no blur it
[6:07:31] SuperbaeRS: still better to see that then what's in my search history KEKW
[6:07:38] richie385: In the uk we have a watershed at 10 pm on tv
[6:07:41] Archelonde: I remember watching Big Brother uncut as a kid at like 11pm KEKW
[6:07:43] MiraPacku: what doy ou mean? they saw their parent's chests too?? susHmm
[6:07:45] nAZAr1uS: why are you bending to Christian censure that was hammered into your head?
[6:07:47] ChromaCym: I think that goes along with the inherent sexualization though right? Who cares if they show boobs, it's the sexualization that makes it bad
[6:07:49] mephium: the yoga, people are using the education category as a loop hole aren't they?
[6:07:56] FalleNM3rC: @Giantwaffle like naked yoga on yt?
[6:08:08] Celioxis: Exactly.
[6:08:12] MoonChocolates: Hmmmm
[6:08:14] toclosebutfar2: ohh I forgot about that loop hole KEKW
[6:08:18] ThatOnneGuy: I learn a lot from those videos
[6:08:19] throat_pump: hot topic... if someone identifies as a male but still has breasts, what happens if they go topless?
[6:08:20] RodriCraft93: naked yoga on yt, they showed the D and everything, not only nipples
[6:08:24] mephisto__ttv: and anti -vaxxer?
[6:08:31] FalleNM3rC: no thanks
[6:08:32] complexprotein: That's a great idea, I wasn't watching porn, it was group naked yoga KEKW
[6:08:32] DrHax_: soon one youtube: educational gangbangs KEKW
[6:08:34] FalleNM3rC: KEKW
[6:08:36] UltraScientism: I watched a sex transition surgery on youtube.

[6:09:02] Celioxis: @MrHashbrowns on the YouTubes :p
[6:09:02] omar_i_: its amazing the variety of topics we cover on Waffle Streams, from nipples to failed reactor cores
[6:09:03] SuperbaeRS: @DaemonSzyman was that the octopus yeah?
[6:09:09] daemonaedryn: @SuperbaeRS Think so

[6:10:18] BONBONNIE13: I think the only way I'd eat like lungs or liver is if you could dry it into jerky because anything jerky tastes good.
[6:10:20] Tenkaichi500: i had cow blood soup in thailand
[6:10:24] daemonaedryn: @itzSimondr98 YEP
[6:10:25] DrHax_: I dont understand why people eat liver, it literally filters shit out of your blood, why would you want to eat that DansGame
[6:10:30] QuesoBad0nga: YEP chinchulines

[6:14:28] dasmako: sleep deficits are real
[6:14:30] grimmn: that sounds awful
[6:14:32] Silver_Skeeter: pizza making streams were awesome waffleH
[6:14:35] dasmako: you start to microsleep
[6:14:36] Celioxis: You were soooooo in sleep on day 28 I remember LUL
[6:14:36] daemonaedryn: Yeah the last few days were rough
[6:14:43] ThatOnneGuy: he was hallucinating and shit
[6:14:43] Nilau: Sitting in your bed right after waking up must have been rough
[6:14:44] Kuroiorb: you saw the floor move a lot @Giantwaffle
[6:14:44] officialhunterx: micro sleep
[6:14:49] Driitzz: was it worst than 10h of ayaya ?

[6:14:56] richie385: We want cooking streams daily
[6:15:06] Orin_The_Sly: That was 100% self harm
[6:15:08] Celioxis: Like MrNoSleep who didnt sleep for over 100 hours, that's crazy
[6:15:10] SuperbaeRS: does mental state count?
[6:15:15] Kuroiorb: yes
[6:15:18] Lands8142: I would consider that harmful tbh
[6:15:21] Deepcast: mental harm?
[6:15:29] pengeg: yes, extreme mental harm
[6:15:29] Driitzz: you got ptsd from 10h AYAYA
[6:15:30] just_cro: well in some ways you can be glad that twitch didn't ban you back then
[6:15:36] pengeg: no sleep is a bitch to the brain
[6:15:43] daemonaedryn: I mean sleep deprivation is a form of torture so I would count it as self harm
[6:15:46] WGG25: koibu is the man when it comes to marathons, he did 144 or more at once, no sleep, no bs
[6:15:51] officialhunterx: what about the ayaya 10 hours
[6:15:57] ConorSK: I stayed awake one day for 3 days 72~ ish for work and I started literally shutting down, I fainted walking home out of the elevator and cracked my tooth
[6:16:00] BONBONNIE13: idk if you can die from lack of sleep per se, but I'd say that it still counts as self-harm because of the damage it can do to your organs and mental state
[6:16:02] UltraScientism: There is probably a physiological harm, for example f-ed up circadian rythms on the tissue level or something like that.
[6:16:05] AshleyUK: we need 24 hours of ayaya
[6:16:06] pengeg: i did that today driving....
[6:16:16] toclosebutfar2: What about loosing that bet and had to watch the ayaya vid for 10h was that self harm KEKW
[6:16:16] uberhox: oh god

[6:17:25] FroZenThai: I don't quite remember, but sev regulary slept like 4 hours or something
[6:17:33] MrPeabodyLive: you set the record for the longest continual stream @Giantwaffle
[6:17:36] bcdmonkey: Most time spent conscious on a stream*
[6:17:40] pengeg: @thatonneguy why buy tesla autopilot when humans have it built in Kappa
[6:17:41] theflyingamerican74: Wait wheres the hot tub girls KEKW
[6:17:41] bballaustin: Someone always there to ruin it

[6:17:44] Stillglade: its your maturity that has increased, not just your age
[6:17:46] BONBONNIE13: Now Subathons and Streamvember are going to need Categories like Speedrunning. "WORLD RECORD STREAMVEMBER?! (sleeping%)"
[6:17:53] SpiderQueen7202: Yet twitch is inconsistent
[6:18:04] Kuroiorb: agreed
[6:18:09] mephisto__ttv: it wasnt the most. dont you remeber that crazy german guy? same month as you? Giantwaffle
[6:18:14] Celioxis: It's not going to be consistent like ever
[6:18:18] ThatOnneGuy: pengeg fuckin right? At least if I spontaneously combust the fire department could put me out
[6:18:19] Kuroiorb: people are so angry, who has the energy to keep that up
[6:18:23] SuperbaeRS: only thing that matters is how much the legal stuff is gonna cost KEKW
[6:18:23] MoonChocolates: I think they a Hot Tub event where all the streamers for a day stream in a hot tub.
[6:18:33] richie385: They have them set at 18+ so they can’t complain about kids
[6:18:47] pengeg: @thatonneguy KEKW
[6:18:54] just_cro: well bannable offences have been banned... it is not that they did nothing to be fair.
[6:19:01] Trucker_Torpedo: what are you working towards?
[6:19:02] Celioxis: YEP
[6:19:03] FroZenThai: I think just the fact that it's a big company with many people, inconsistencies is a given
[6:19:05] ThyTellurian: man i just scrolled through just chatting and there’s two streamers that have chat links to the hub and onlyfans in the title
[6:19:08] FoxeVR: Hey Waffle, much love my guy, hope you doing well
[6:19:09] That0neGeye: The real question is when is @giantwaffle doing a hot tube stream
[6:19:16] MiraPacku: imagine sleeping on stream and thinking you broke the world record pepeLaugh

[6:19:41] BeastboySAW: Saw a woman on Chaturbait who streams less than you but she sure works harder than you.
[6:20:05] Trucker_Torpedo: you get 64 as a quest reward tho @Giantwaffle

[6:20:51] BONBONNIE13: well yeah but they don't stay in them for multiple hours do they?
[6:20:52] mechoriet: block or whatever its called
[6:21:10] MoonChocolates: Ice bath, each sub adds a minute to you staying in the ice. Kappa

[7:09:16] RegnumXD: if its tied in crypto, he pays less tax, right?
[7:09:21] Balafore: rich are famous for hoarding their wealth. Bitcoin is just another asset to hoard
[7:09:44] MrMoneybagMan: 2azse4szse3424eqDAZXd fuiop[
[7:09:45] wpprrz: @RegnumXD troooo. can only buy so mucha rt and donate so much money.
[7:09:45] StraightErro: He likes money. And what's better than having money? Having even MORE money.
[7:09:45] krakenayyy: @RegnumXD he does not do it to evade taxes lol, plus with the fluctuation of crypto it wouldnt be safe anyway
[7:09:46] Troupster: the real answer is inflation, $50,000 cash in 1910 would look insane... today it's your annual paycheck

[7:10:15] フリクリ: it looks like Hoskinson got thru with the africa deal
[7:10:15] Wetware: Wants to keep score in another medium
[7:10:16] celadriel23: he could spend $2b a year every year
[7:10:29] Troupster: if I had 100 billion i would hodl
[7:10:32] robocahp: I think he does it to help the little guy and to add to his allure
[7:10:36] ChetSteadman_: he's certainly competing with Bezos and the other wealthiest
[7:10:39] krakenayyy: Nah its literally just something fun for him literally, i highly doubt he holds it to actually make money off of it
[7:10:48] ChetSteadman_: like you know they all have a scoreboard they track
[7:10:53] daemonaedryn: Probably a dick measuring contest for the top 10 wealthiest
[7:10:53] whoisrez: WhoIsRez subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 4 months! 
[7:10:59] RegnumXD: i read that musk is actually the poorest billionaire because everything is actually in Telsa, SpaceX and Neuralink
[7:11:01] Butterwhales: the thing is his money isn't liquid
[7:11:01] ShinyVids: waffleAngry
[7:11:02] ChetSteadman_: yeah he just hit two  more tranches and got an $11b payout
[7:11:04] FinnYellowbelly: elon might buy at the top and sell at the bottom for us.  The anti-whale
[7:11:06] daemonaedryn: a billion
[7:11:13] ChetSteadman_: partly fueled by Tesla's sale of bitcoin in Q1
[7:11:14] SuperbaeRS: random number generator KEKW
[7:11:17] krakenayyy: Didnt he give money to mrbeast tree charity?
[7:11:18] Orin_The_Sly: I bet Elon Mines too.
[7:11:21] orillion: 69 bitcoins
[7:11:25] Troupster: Ok but truthfully he has spent more of his money on companies than probably anyone, how much did he spend of his personal money on tesla/spacex ?
[7:11:27] krakenayyy: i dont think he actually has much money that he can actually use
[7:11:35] hallis21: his fun time activity is making green towers by himself
[7:11:43] Duvenel: Probably less as some of his assets might lose value if he tried to sell everything at once?
[7:11:47] Aurielli: he said he doesn't have much liquid assets
[7:11:58] krakenayyy: yeah if you liquidate your stocks as a ceo you wouldnt be ceo anymore because you wouldnt be a majority holder
[7:11:59] FinnYellowbelly: thats exactly what the coinbase people did
[7:12:02] Silver_Skeeter: just sell the company :)
[7:12:06] Larklen: Remember, he's getting rid of all his possessions KEKW
[7:12:32] BeastboySAW: He keeps it well hidden so Grimes won’t get it when she inevitably leaves him.
[7:13:00] krakenayyy: i feel bad for elon kid though with that name, jeez
[7:13:00] ericnivek: I'm waiting for him to get kidnapped and build a suit to escape his prison
[7:13:01] Troupster: so in May 2002 musk put $100m of his OWN MONEY to start SpaceX, thats a pretty good reason for large sums of money no?
[7:13:13] OfficerMilkshake: bless you
[7:13:13] daemonaedryn: susHmm waffle just got possesed
[7:13:16] SuperbaeRS: manly sneeze Kappa

[7:13:33] DimensionalShadow: KEKW
[7:13:36] Dracos555: owns*
[7:13:45] krakenayyy: @Troupster theres legitimely no actual way to know the amount of spending money he has
[7:13:55] Troupster: what?
[7:14:11] DimensionalShadow: All them ingots used it up
[7:14:17] Troupster: I remember in 2002 he basically spent nearly everything he had to start spacex
[7:14:29] krakenayyy: I meant theres no way to know how much spending money elon has
[7:14:36] MoonChocolates: What if....Elon does a Hot Tub stream with Doge.
[7:14:44] ChetSteadman_: yeah and Elon getting those two additional tranches where his option to buy TSLA at $70/sh just diluted TSLA a bit too. that's part of why it dipped after the good earnings
[7:14:47] Troupster: then you buy DOGE
[7:14:58] krakenayyy: net worth

[7:19:07] Alamose: Yeah I just bought a house too and it was weird seeing my bank account shift so much
[7:19:11] ChetSteadman_: so from 2010 - jan 2020 the personal savings rate in america was like 7.5%. and  that INCLUDES real estate investment if you own a home.
[7:19:15] daemonaedryn: Youre first big payment hurts so much

[7:20:40] Troupster: it makes it hard to work
[7:20:56] Scorchius: what do you do for crypto?
[7:20:57] KernlBurner: crypto = high risk; Work = lower risk
