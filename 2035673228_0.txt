[0:05:16] notekatha: @TheOneAndOnlyShad A game made by youtuber TangoTek (entirely in survival by hand!) that's basically a dungeon crawl adventure. You have to sneak through in order to avoid the Ravangers and find an artifact. There's a ton of more complex mechanics that are really best seen in action to put together!

[0:22:58] eternal_destiny: yeah, it‚Äôs best to just make a new world copy and give yourself the deck you had if needed
[0:23:08] notekatha: that area where you got your starter deck had duplicates
