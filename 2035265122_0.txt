[0:48:23] Barzonius: It looks blue to me
[0:48:28] MrSelenix: infxmhc2 i only think that because i recall hearing something about it regarding why some tarffic lights still use blue lights, because of the translations of names of blue and green being the same
[0:48:29] NotTodayFedBoy: "Its a mineral, not a rock"
[0:48:46] Barzonius: @DeePick Uh oh, I guess you're right
[0:48:50] Denbrew: he stole the dog bluey and painted his room with the color

[0:58:23] RealWickedBrew: Cheer200 Morning Jong. Morning fellow chat morons. Did you hear the Tampa press conference where the reporter asked their coach about getting his team ready for the extreme cold that comes with playing in Detroit? The coach looked at the reporter like they had a dented head and asked it they knew Detroit played in a dome. It was perfect.
[0:58:28] CreamyDemon: @PureSpider in my experience german don't talk about ww2
[0:58:32] Thedarkvet53: Cheer100 Cheer100 Streaming platforms are dieing boys.  Disney announced today that it will not have a second season of she hulk.  Thank god cause the first sucked, but the point is they revealed the budget for the first season was 250 million dollars.  Like what phucking executive green lit that.  Horrible decision.
[0:58:45] ChainedStingray: Cheer100 Cheer100  as a history major on his way to get a phd. the massive decline and shift into a downward cycle of society has always been around because of new advancements that make the next generation "lazier" in a way and the only reason its not as prevalent in ancient history was because the slower advancements developed
[0:58:45] PureSpider: @CreamyDemon that was really not my point
[0:58:52] genericvillain: I would bet the majority of people in this chat weren't even alive when 9/11 happened
[0:58:55] DeePick: she's not a sports reporter
[0:58:59] StardustDragon08: @Thedarkvet53 Can't believe they butchered She Hulk so bad

[1:00:14] Thedarkvet53: Book of Eli
[1:00:17] skeptium: what criteria are we using to determine a generation is worse than the one before it?
[1:00:21] RealWickedBrew: Eye Kant Reed
[1:00:30] TheMulkeyway: coffee aquired peepoCoffee
[1:00:33] Omistian: "History repeats itself" is a saying for a reason.
[1:00:42] genericvillain: @KingofJankTV Every generation has something to blame for the degradation of society, and it's different for every generation.
[1:00:43] KingofJankTV: Jon...Just like your college days--chasing pussy.
[1:00:47] MrLanny: @KingofJankTV i disagree
[1:00:56] scappa_1986: did you see that welsh rugby player Louise rees zammbit is moving to NFL, 22 year old, do you remember Christian Wade (ex English Rugby player) made the move to bills, was he any good?
[1:01:05] flyingQtip: I grow weeds in 2 months
[1:01:17] jedemu: 60 seconds, bamsy
[1:01:28] Barzonius: Technology is making people antisocial IMO.
[1:01:36] brawlin_mando: I remember having to go cut my own switch to get spsnked
[1:01:41] Stragmol: so which is better?
[1:01:44] KingofJankTV: @MrLanny Everyone has an opinion.  Most suck.
[1:01:45] flyingQtip: Pelvis makes kids born
[1:01:48] SqueezeME666: B R E A K T I M E
[1:01:48] Thedarkvet53: Cheer100 Cheer100 History always repeats its self.  There are 18 year olds still calling their doctors asking if you can get pregnant from swallowing something
[1:01:54] PureSpider: @Barzonius ah yes, just like the radio, the newspaper, books, ...
[1:02:03] ChainedStingray: @Stragmol in terms of what?
[1:02:08] n1tro188: Loving the streams
[1:02:09] Dadiominecrafter: tom jones was a red hot item
[1:02:20] PureSpider: yea it also never gets taught in school because murricans are afraid of sex and talking about it lol
[1:02:24] MrLanny: @KingofJankTV yeah. and if you wanna share your opinion, be prepared for someone else to share theirs.
[1:02:28] flyingQtip: Elvis the Pelvis makes kids being born
[1:02:31] slackertron: kids being raised by tic tok will have it rough
[1:02:45] Stragmol: @ChainedStingray was it better when they wouldn't show elvis from hips down, or skimpy outfits of today
[1:02:46] KingofJankTV: @MrLanny Absolutely agree!  Great point.
[1:02:53] flyingQtip: horny sex hormones
[1:03:00] brawlin_mando: I never learned that you could still get a girl pregnant from pulling out. They don't tell you about pre goo
[1:03:01] Barzonius: @PureSpider Yeah but the digital technologies are exponentially worse, you can do everything without even leaving your house
[1:03:04] RealWickedBrew: TikTok is absolutely a weapon
[1:03:05] Stragmol: @ChainedStingray basically the ideology
[1:03:12] OverHugs: That's called Bias of Information - the assumption that other people know what you know.
[1:03:19] iamtehnub: tiktok and the vapes are a dangerous combo
[1:03:19] Dadiominecrafter: great balls of fir jerry lewis
[1:03:27] Denbrew: break time
[1:03:38] PureSpider: @Barzonius literally, do some research seqKEK this is the exact shit every generation ever has said about a thing the next generation enjoyed and spent a lot of time doing
[1:03:39] cocomaii: the thing with Tiktok is that someone can make a video with a ton of false facts and say it convincing enough and people will believe it without fact checking.
[1:03:43] DeePick: Cheer200 can you imagine a woman showing her ankles and wrists on television?  just thinking of it is giving me the vapors!
[1:03:48] Thedarkvet53: Cheer100 Cheer100 When I was 18 and got my yearly physical for sports in high school my doctor told me that its okay to have a yank instead of having intercourse.  I don't think doctors will say that today just because of the woke mob
[1:04:10] PureSpider: "the woke mob" okay dude OMEGALUL
[1:04:17] PureSpider: ther woke mob is not a fucking thing
[1:04:20] StardustDragon08: T R U E bamKEK

[1:04:23] PrincessVanellope: @DeePick can you imagine showing those people in that time GOT?
[1:04:23] ChainedStingray: @Stragmol yea but better in terms of what? better for modesty? better for entertainment? better for what? whats its being better for. yea its better for entertainment maybe but is it better for entertainment for everyone? its an undefinable question
[1:04:23] flyingQtip: Experience comes with the years
[1:04:24] ChiefShake: It's similar to the Bills Mafia
[1:04:25] Stragmol: you have to shovel snow at the stadium
[1:04:27] talks_a_lot: Dumb take
[1:04:29] mrbuffalosauce: target children as audience but thats sus
[1:04:41] brawlin_mando: Most people are scared to share info. They don't want to be called racist or offend anyone
[1:04:41] nuttybark3: #Triggered lol
[1:04:43] RealWickedBrew: Woke mob colors: blue hair and a furry suit
[1:04:47] Stragmol: @ChainedStingray better for society

[1:04:59] thatwentBTE: Yeah, luckily the dark get works with animals instead of humans
[1:05:05] Barzonius: @PureSpider So you dont think cellphones and internet are worse? I can respect that, and you do make a point with successive generations making similar claims
[1:05:08] flyingQtip: selling asses

[2:15:47] JTSmith44: @martinsable3235 not liquid water, no. pressure boils water that low
[2:15:49] Rodimus_Supreme: KEKW
[2:15:49] Jakestaley20: i can see the moon
[2:15:49] connor_assassin5: depends on air quality, light, and elevation change
[2:15:50] RIVAL1977: to the horizon
[2:15:50] Swaggadactyl: like 10
[2:15:51] ktorn_: millions of light years, if we talking stars
[2:15:52] MartinSable3235: I feel like water flowing could easily make large caverns like that over hundreds of thousands of years
[2:15:52] ChiefShake: Well I can see stars, so about 2 miles?
[2:15:53] Kaladas_: I can see galaxy millions of lightyears away
[2:15:57] b_r_a_y: you can see into space.. sooo yeah
[2:15:57] OmIAm: Jonbams: The furthest visible thing to the naked eye is the andromeda galaxy.

[2:16:08] MartinSable3235: @JTSmith44 Ah interesting. I hadnt though of that.
[2:16:14] RIVAL1977: 10 miles
[2:16:22] Harlando: my irl render distance is cranked down to 10 chunks
[2:16:22] KingDragile: if the view ended at the horizan we couldn't see the nighttime starts
[2:16:23] tarrantking289: technically infinite, but depends on whats inthe atmophere clouding the view
[2:16:23] slackertron: not far enough to see the ice wall at the edge of the flat earth

[2:16:43] BubbleGuts32: is your dump area of storage full?
[2:16:44] robocahp: no
[2:16:50] notgingervitus: no
[2:16:50] OmIAm: Jonbams: No.  Under very dark skys, it's the furthest light your eyes can detect.
[2:16:53] skeptium: bruh
[2:16:55] b_r_a_y: exactly
[2:16:55] DBKynd: Without light or visual distance would be zero
[2:17:02] Spoono3D: according to optical academy its millions of miles
[2:17:03] KingDragile: seeing a star vs seeing through a telescope are 2 different things
[2:17:05] Stragmol: if there is a bright enough object, yes
[2:17:08] ktorn_: yup, no limit
[2:17:08] slackertron: @BubbleGuts32 full of empty chests
[2:17:09] jdwalte3: but think about going deep in the ocean. you cant see the top
[2:17:12] RIVAL1977: no it can see us
[2:17:13] Blimesh: Cheer100 Cheer100 The son doong cave in Asia is large enough to support its own rainforest. So it is possible for large caves to have their own ecosystems. No telling what someone could find.
[2:17:27] OmIAm: If there was something bright enough to see with the naked eye further away, that would change.  Currently it is the farthest you can see.
[2:17:37] connor_assassin5: we must have 20 4090tis for the render distances humans have
[2:17:39] toosrimpeldoos: without glasses i can see 3 inches
[2:17:47] Saulted: forest without light? uhhhh

[2:17:58] klorkenixoriginal: agartha?
[2:17:59] slug09: I'm in on that theory
[2:18:11] 4tw0ne: I thought the Lizard-people were living inside the earth bamThink
[2:18:17] talks_a_lot: There are interesting experiments that have been done to test human vision. Stars are incredibly bright and the light reaches us through the vacuum of space. But on earth, a human can see a candle in relatively complete darkness about 1.5 miles away. cheer200
[2:18:18] KenRenJr: speaking of penetrating
[2:18:23] notgingervitus: water filters out the light
[2:18:27] KingDragile: @4tw0ne they are :)
[2:18:28] aceamanda: Go to space then we can decide
[2:18:32] RollyPinder: caves smell like farts though. no thanks.

[2:19:12] slackertron: too floral
[2:19:24] manute154: grab a new lead
[2:19:25] tommygun22948: Because the source of light is really slow, but still impressive for sure

[2:20:03] DeePick: we have Light blue, Light grey, but when it comes to Light red we call it Pink... why?
[2:20:13] Anullmentor: @JonBams isn't it also true that depending on size objects are visible from a greater distance? if so can bams be seen from orbit?
[2:20:50] KingDragile: @talks_a_lot Yea I was gonna say something like, duh it's a sun. ofc we can see it far away those things are stupid bright (just , well, don't look at ours). It just depends on how much light said object gives off and ofc the distance
[2:21:05] RollyPinder: I actually explored a cave one time on a self tour with me and this girl I was with.

[2:41:24] talks_a_lot: there are so many examples of modern day evolution that have been witnessed in real time. My favorite example is the following. The evolution of the peppered moth is an evolutionary instance of directional colour change in the moth population as a consequence of air pollution during the Industrial Revolution. The frequency of dark-coloured moths increased at that time, an example of industrial melanism. cheer200
