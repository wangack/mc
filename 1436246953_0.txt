[0:11:24] drsnaki96: i saw red bands on his wheels but still wasn;t sure
[0:11:26] imTymp: this week i should hit it 100%
[0:11:50] Houghdini: It was very windy so time may vary to driver to driver.
[0:11:50] imTymp: 8 yea
[0:11:52] sam1390: sectors are still messed up, leclerc set three yellow sectors and still went fastest
[0:11:58] Triz08: nope just do mechanics
[0:11:58] imTymp: guild team 1 and pug team 2 KEKW
[0:12:10] SlyPoooper: xev put an announcement for those who want to run it this week

[0:12:35] erer566: idk why they let us cheese the boss mechanics

[0:14:32] GFQPR1882: Sadge
[0:14:33] w1mon: Id rather have a small chance on a drop on an item than the honing system where u can fail, it feels so bad
[0:14:39] sam1390: passing 4 hones out of 30 is still 15%
[0:14:39] RevArsh: and still have one to go
[0:14:43] ITSJUSTM1TCH: i legit also did 30 hones and also failed 26 times damn rip
[0:14:53] Venxuri: yea I'm already in the /care state of mind, but I get crazy mad when I fail 90%s KEKW
[0:15:16] はるき_ボブバーク: YEP
[0:15:20] imTymp: I got lucky af through t2 and t3 is just ruining me
[0:15:22] nxusr: the honing system is carefully designed to hit the same parts of your brain as lootboxes and gambling
[0:15:43] stormblaz: I wish someone told me not to drink my potions early casually
[0:15:50] stormblaz: i dint know how rough making them was
[0:15:50] Xeroxbeta: i got my weapon t14 in 1 shot and then t15 in 2 shot, bu then the law of averages hit me hard for my chest and legs
[0:15:58] samuraijac: wait until the new classes come out
[0:16:03] Venxuri: you'll get there this week anyway
[0:16:04] stormblaz: potions are just crucial late gane
[0:16:07] GFQPR1882: can i ask ? do u have to catch up
[0:16:12] Dagmoo: its a perception though its just as bad for most people
[0:16:24] imTymp: i have 8k gold rn and i keep having to tell myself no spendy to hone
[0:16:25] Dagmoo: and its even worse for a good chunk of people
[0:16:33] stormblaz: Or be asmon and get everything given to you like charity
[0:16:36] Racerboy108: how many failures are you up to?
[0:17:12] Akaihon: i am 1395 now .... 100% f2p and no alts t3. (all thx to mats injection yesterday
[0:17:14] stormblaz: When the bard has more stats than the main
[0:17:14] Nexhunter: let not talk about failures
[0:17:14] imTymp: im 169 right now so im right there with u
[0:17:15] Venxuri: 247 @ 1385
[0:17:18] stormblaz: u know u got bad luck
[0:17:21] Nexhunter: .... 1370 and I am at 231...
[0:17:27] SlyPoooper: pepeLaugh
[0:17:36] Dagmoo: well are those people lucky and you are comparing yourself to a sample that is unrealistic
[0:17:41] imTymp: NEX did u push 1370 last night
[0:17:43] SlyPoooper: hows your silver now nex
[0:17:44] imTymp: wth
[0:17:47] imTymp: dont leave me in the dust
[0:17:47] Moobot: You can find Waffle's Youtube channel here - https://youtube.com/giantwaffle
[0:17:50] Nexhunter: @SlyPoooper 72k rooBlank
[0:17:53] SlyPoooper: pepeLaugh
[0:18:00] Venxuri: how close are you alts?
[0:18:04] Nexhunter: @SlyPoooper i had to do some gem fixing danBlank
[0:18:12] boltzmanC: what does he mean by reset?
[0:18:16] SlyPoooper: im not doing those for awhile
[0:18:31] Nexhunter: @SlyPoooper i mean 64k cause I just had to repair my gear after moake
[0:18:32] DeadlyBrother: use the 1400 method imo
[0:18:42] stormblaz: theres nothin to do
[0:18:57] SlyPoooper: susHmm I need to fight moake today
[0:19:06] erer566: the+16 gloves method is better apparently
[0:19:08] Venxuri: 13/12/12/12/12/11weapon -> 17/17/13/12/12/11weapon thats the method
[0:19:28] DeadlyBrother: at 1415 it's more dmg with that method than 15 all
[0:20:18] Arimil: depends if you plan to farm or skip argos
[0:20:26] GFQPR1882: waffleD
[0:20:32] DeadlyBrother: 16/11/11/11/11/10 is what im doing for 1400
[0:20:37] stormblaz: Are you saying the game doesnt have a good roadmap for 1400+?
[0:20:42] AustinNF: yea but u rly dont need to worry about weapon power at 1400 anyways p3 argos is a joke
[0:20:48] Purecrew: Honestly just going to level up what I can when I can
[0:20:50] BurnedAether: this outfit is wonderful
[0:20:51] Dagmoo: keeping weapon at 11 for so long seems pointless. you will inevitably get plenty of weapon crystals while you go from 13/12 helm/shoulder to 17
[0:20:52] imTymp: worth for bard KEKW i dont need the damage
[0:21:05] stormblaz: how far is Korea
[0:21:10] DeadlyBrother: wish they didn't delay it anymore imo
[0:21:11] stormblaz: it feels like we are catching up
[0:21:43] stormblaz: game balance is weird
[0:21:45] DeadlyBrother: the mats we get each week now is crazy
[0:21:48] stormblaz: i struggled a lot in T2
[0:22:03] daemonaedryn: overall fall off is probably massive just because its f2p
[0:22:16] obscure_13: the pvp vendor gives so much mats
[0:22:18] DeadlyBrother: We are missing methods but compared to kr events this is a lot of mats
[0:22:18] imTymp: the weekly mats gave me 3-4 hones
[0:22:19] Venxuri: What's bridge?
[0:22:20] imTymp: its not that wild
[0:22:20] stormblaz: the Race was great though
[0:22:23] mrchadiuss: COPIUM
[0:22:31] stormblaz: # Buff race

[0:23:36] AustinNF: they balance around endgame not mid tier stuff
[0:23:40] Purecrew: Its not
[0:23:47] stormblaz: I blame the honings
[0:23:49] Venxuri: My scrapper does decent dmg, just sucks at chaos - just difference in skillset
[0:24:12] Venxuri: Gunslinger is lit 🔥
[0:24:14] Purecrew: Scrapper is just a lot of little constant damage, Sorc is big booms
[0:24:16] stormblaz: is scrapper good ?
[0:24:36] stormblaz: Are u doing the lightning build,m
[0:24:41] stormblaz: i heard its not bad

[0:27:06] Deviant_Imp: qualy starts in 2 hours right?
[0:27:17] imTymp: yea u got buffs rn
[0:27:29] DexxonGaming: every time you break the shell, turtle will disapear, just rotate to another boss
[0:27:38] imTymp: @Deviant_Imp practice 2 for f1 is in 1 hour 30 mins if that is what u mean
[0:27:38] DexxonGaming: want to break shell 3x
[0:27:38] DriftSage: Break Turtle for Buff then go for other 2 monsters, turtle is last to kill
[0:28:12] DexxonGaming: keep breaking shell everytime turtle pops up, you can stack the buff 3x
[0:28:20] sam1390: i hit a 19 earlier

[0:37:51] erer566: excavation is also decent gold

[0:40:01] stormblaz: f1 memes are gr3at tho
[0:40:15] Arimil: PvP ranking rewards are useless unless you get top 100.
[0:40:16] haitham506: The amount of Racism in F1 subreddit/all reddit is too much it makes me sad and angry at the same time, they believe every fake news they hear
[0:40:39] JoxerTheM1ghty: No, the copyright holder has the right to ignore your use. So you are not braking it untill they decide to enforce it.

[1:11:08] Nari06tu: not enough gold in the market as simple as that
[1:11:10] Hraesvaelgr: the crystals thing is a lack of gold generation
[1:11:12] Xeroxbeta: are you gonna log into GT7 to get your credits?
[1:11:14] Melfcin: Because u used to buy crystakls for mari shop and now the mats are so cheap that its not worth it

[1:11:33] Strykes5: why people call igrxion erection

[1:11:51] SlyPoooper: pepeLaugh
[1:12:22] Mandorake: @HostileLogOut im not sure i would say 'alot'.  I think its mostly just the lack of RMT gold
[1:12:23] HostileLogOut: Honor leap and greater dropped 150% in price lol
[1:12:36] HostileLogOut: since yesterday
[1:13:01] madrugan: Did you watch FP1 today? Sorry, just tuning in

[1:13:47] Gliderman: waffleHOMIE
[1:13:51] Blasian__: its the bots... all that liquid gold is gone or locked behind trusted steam account status. so huge deflation
[1:13:53] Kenji_QQ: but prices are less as well
[1:14:17] Hraesvaelgr: Bots arent generating gold so less gold injected into the game compared to gold sinks that exist.

[1:20:13] ninopanda: i need to change out 3 pieces of accessories for Tier 3 but may wait till i get to 1370
[1:20:38] jb1gly: @Giantwaffle - how high is your surge? i just wasted a ton of gold picking up legendary books for surge
[1:20:59] Kenji_QQ: bard doesn't give crit
[1:21:07] ScottyJake: no wardancer
[1:21:13] kurblet: its just flat damage and attack speed
[1:21:15] Kenji_QQ: gives attack power and increased damage
[1:21:25] DeMayon: @Giantwaffle are you playing MC today
[1:21:29] kurblet: crit doesn't scale crit damage, its just crit chance

[1:23:00] kurblet: its great
[1:23:02] Dumpified: the middle of your char is the hitbox
[1:23:05] Arimil: yep it's like a shmup
[1:23:13] Ashurian83: yes ffxiv works great with that
[1:23:19] Arimil: er I meant bullet hell
[1:23:21] kurblet: lost ark hitboxes are huge it feels like
[1:23:24] Kenji_QQ: all characters have same hitbox i'm pretty sure, so you are the same size as a warrior
[1:23:34] pixelmonkey: i dislike when you know you are outside the red circle but there's bleed over from the dmg and it still hits you
[1:23:39] Akaihon: i dont know if i heard u correctly but bleed dont give u stacks and maelstron only gives u 1 stack rn @Giantwaffle also polestar gives almost the same dmg as earth cleaver ( 0 crit)
[1:23:56] WDForty: ffxiv also resolves hit/miss when the circle disappears, not on the atk animation
[1:24:01] imTymp: is the AOE the circle u see around u when u move?
[1:24:07] Balafore: to jebait the greedy players

[1:45:07] derwolff85: @Milexna its happened at the North Jeddah Bulk Plant. Verstappen could smell it, as he mentioned it on the radio (if his car was causing the smell)
[1:45:18] babyaddalyn: ic
[1:45:44] derwolff85: and the smoke was visible during the F2 quali ;)

[1:46:46] sumthinclevr: is there a wrong way to do the event?
[1:47:08] NexX_____: i spend almost 1mio silver on refacing a LVL5 gem

[1:47:12] Triz08: i wish we had these buffs all the time
[1:47:13] DexxonGaming: yea buff stacks 3x, you get stupid dmg
[1:47:18] StOrMy1100: @Milexna The attack was about 10km away from the circuit
[1:47:30] Balafore: Whichever the invader boss is, is the one you want to stagger/break to get the buffs
[1:47:34] Chyrion: my group killed the turtle last KEKW urnil took a good while
[1:47:50] NexX_____: only got 2k gold gotta save thta

[1:48:49] Solitude411: does anyone else have an irrational disliking towards george russel
[1:49:46] Larklen: HACKERMANS
[1:49:47] miracore: bro f1 weekend might be cancelled cause of this big explosion/fire south of jeddah
[1:49:49] Arimil: My soulfist alt NODDERS
[1:49:55] staccatone: @Giantwaffle Did you see the new KSP2 Show and tell about radiators?
[1:49:56] ImpulseDriven: I'm glad he is getting his shot in a car that will compete
[1:49:57] inVINCEble__: @giantwaffle what engravings are you going for on your main? Surge grudge +1? Or are you waiting until later to switch to grudge?
[1:50:05] jordan2185: Russell Is my home drive live like 10 minutes from the town he’s from
[1:50:09] Mandorake: go to legoros first
[1:50:15] DX_Plates: Never Split the Party!
[1:50:27] HostileLogOut: either Ur nil or Legoros.
[1:50:37] Mandorake: turtle will spawn later
[1:50:44] Venxuri: turtle comes to you
[1:50:45] Blasian__: turtle is an invader. yo uhave to start fighting 1
[1:50:48] Xev_00: Oh sweet, the guardians rotate daily
[1:51:03] imTymp: Love how bard has destruction damage built into its hkit
[1:51:17] derwolff85: unclear if FP2 will start. All drivers & team bosses have been called to down to F1 (meeting i presume)
[1:51:40] punishhha: these change each day cool.
[1:51:52] punishhha: which one gives buff this time?
[1:51:56] miracore: did you hear about the big explosion/fire south of jeddah? @Giantwaffle
[1:51:56] Balafore: The turtle should now spawn at the other boss if you want the optimal way to do it
[1:52:11] NexX_____: i did the bear just for fun and dropped it in under 60sec the 3teammates where very happy
[1:52:20] Sacrier53: it comes back in around 30 sec I just wait im
[1:52:31] celadriel23: All drivers and team bosses seem to have been called down to Formula 1 just before FP2 is due to start. Unclear why at this point #F1 #SaudiArabianGP
[1:52:51] samxk: wait are you 1370 yet? @giantwaffle
[1:53:17] rezv: this event is actually fun
[1:53:22] RDLG21: that event
[1:53:24] warmwalrus: damn bought out every weekly expect pvp Sadge
[1:53:28] Balafore: I low key wonder if this event is meant to teach people to do boss mechanics instead of just trying to brute force everything
[1:53:29] rezv: I solo'd todays on my zerker today
[1:53:33] HKRage: NICE I'm 4 successful hones away from 1370 too
[1:53:49] HKRage: I can smell argos/abyssal hard mode
[1:54:00] Dagmoo: its kind of annoying the bosses rotate each day so casuals who arent constantly checking reddit dont know what boss to focus first
[1:54:27] Solitude411: fp2 starting now on espn2
[1:54:36] samxk: I one tapped my +15 weapon thanks to the new books
[1:54:37] HKRage: @Dagmoo It seems like has long as you do destruction mechanics right, itll do the buff so I'm guessing it will stay consistent with armor breaks
[1:54:41] punishhha: Just tell them LUL i always ping the boss to cofus
[1:54:45] Blasian__: @Dagmoo 2 bosses are up at the start. the buff always invades when you start fighting one
