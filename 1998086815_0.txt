[1:36:25] Pinoybear: i think it's from the triforce podcast a while back
[1:36:40] rapter29: @RadicalLynx its a triforce podcast thing.
[1:37:03] rapter29: Basically a simple phrase to say if you ever meet Lewis, Pyrion or Sip to instantly communicate that you are a fan
[1:37:44] RadicalLynx: haha something tells me they didn't fully think that through
[1:38:04] Pinoybear: i thought the female version was to tell them you have a huge vageen
[1:38:16] Pinoybear: or was "gaping" the adjective
[1:38:26] glore_: gaping
[1:38:36] RadicalLynx: @Pinoybear the clitoris is the closest counterpart
[1:38:49] RadicalLynx: which is essentially a tiny penis
[1:39:00] RadicalLynx: don't need to gender that phrase at all
[1:39:19] glore_: that's why it was gaping vagina because it needed to be the opposite of "i have a tiny peen"
[1:42:35] jlprice3: I think Sips is one of those people that would never consume the product he produces lol
