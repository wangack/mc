[0:26:06] Neonnimbus: I find it funny they say solo Velganos for KR citizenship but it's way easier to do solo or duo than 4
[0:26:12] Dagmoo: why do you need to solo Velganos for some quest?
[0:26:47] Dagmoo: oh just for epeen ok
[0:27:00] imTymp: time to solo it on bard to flex
[0:27:04] warmwalrus: he's actually easier to solo/duo cause you dont share buffs with others

[1:45:53] GenericFutureMan: what is the benefit of beheading?
[1:46:12] peetur_: @GenericFutureMan zombie heads for recipies
[1:46:16] hackett33: If it works
[1:46:23] GenericFutureMan: @peetur_ ty
[1:46:26] Cannonboot: @Giantwaffle yea u probably right, but might be worth to try something new no? after the tens of thousands of hours u have in mc
[1:46:32] 3ven: Tinkers is probably my favorite mod for minecraft even tho it is kinda smal
[1:46:33] RedDiablos: Tinkers seems too strong for the effort, I dont know lol. I agree its good though.

[2:01:15] Askjong: Spa contract is due
[2:01:20] tripwires: If Spa goes I might just stopping watching out right
[2:01:20] iivu1canii: TOO MANY ? BRUH WE JUST GOT RID OF ONE ?
[2:01:23] Armanicx: Get rid of Jeddah, get it out. shit track imo
[2:01:24] babyaddalyn: no leave ours alone!
[2:01:24] Switcharoo: how do they get rid of Spa its a icon
[2:01:26] MisterWuff: just don;t do vegas
[2:01:36] peachpearr: Jeddah needs to go, too explosive...
[2:01:39] Klorell: nobody like the french circuit it seems
[2:01:41] 3ven: even WRC have been using Spa the last years
[2:01:42] MonkeyOnDonkey: F1 in  Nordschleife when?
[2:01:47] ShayeBlackwood: Just give Spa a 50 year contract right now
[2:01:51] Evstrala: maaaybe get rid of one of the middle east races
[2:01:53] imTymp: so many races id be in heaven
[2:01:55] J0hanAndersson: they should remove monte carlo curvyeSmile
[2:01:57] Armanicx: Id be pogging
[2:01:57] K4ZZIK: 30 is way too much
[2:01:57] Evstrala: we don't need that many
[2:01:58] guy_named_sean: 30 races not gonna hapen
[2:02:19] tripwires: that is not accurate, they have 30 events they could shedule. They're not going to plan 30 races in a year.
[2:02:21] imTymp: they would change rules for sure especially with parts changes and such
[2:02:23] 3ven: F1 is easy to milk tho more races = more money LuL
[2:02:33] matey1116: DHL gonna make billions from 30 races calendar KEKW
[2:02:40] peachpearr: 30 races would be cool if they could do one track for two weekends/two races.

[2:03:20] Swordyou: they been rebuilding SPA too so idk why they wouldnt renew it
[2:03:31] FinalRoach: CLANG!
[2:03:33] Evstrala: they could add 2 more teams to the grid imo, rather than an extra fixture
[2:03:50] DonGromus: Thats why they force teams to race with missile flying over their heads
[2:03:55] tripwires: they have created runoffs for safety and prepped it for moto gp
[2:03:55] imTymp: im interested to see how it goes
[2:03:56] J0hanAndersson: it got curves. looks good NODDERS
[2:03:57] Strider1515: 2 detection zones
[2:03:58] ThatExcitedViewer: but did they really LOSE that money? or just not make it
[2:03:59] snurre: only 2 detection zones
[2:04:02] K4ZZIK: its gonna be way faster for sure
[2:04:02] The1_TS: problem in listening to those figures is its high for tax write off usually and includes lost revenue rather than just costs.
[2:04:17] Armanicx: With the new car its ALL gonna be different. Like Jeddah was better this year but still..
[2:04:53] Armanicx: It was better than 2021. IT was SO bad last year.
[2:05:00] DX_Plates: Modified track = new or * record?
[2:05:08] ausHenry: they made the hill climb wider at the top so hopefully they dont crash going up and bounce back onto the racing line
[2:05:10] celadriel23: rb still faster on straights
[2:05:16] Mortimmer: 4DRS = more overtakes = more fun imo
[2:05:16] DonGromus: Ye but RB has better straigh line speed
[2:05:53] Armanicx: Now Mercedes is just not good in the straights or the corners KEKW
[2:06:07] Strider1515: Merc bringing big upgrades this weekend
[2:06:17] YoungRiles: What do you think about the 4 DRS zones?

[2:13:50] thomasausen: maby enderium blade ?
[2:13:57] ShionSinX: which makes no sense as obsidian is glass
[2:14:10] 3ven: Cobalt is a good "edge"
[2:14:17] daemonaedryn: Maybe a blaze rod rod?
[2:14:20] Venxuri: You could probably find a ton of Cobalt with the scanner, right?

[2:14:38] Cannonboot: 8 usually for big parts
[2:14:43] wolfwarriordemon: energized glowstone?
[2:14:48] Winner5001: just search broad blade in jei and see attack damage
[2:14:53] Venxuri: How much of a hassle is Manyullyn or w/e its called
[2:15:18] Borlaq: Can you do Manyulum? Or however its spelled
[2:15:22] imTymp: Is paper still important for writable or is that not a thing anymore
[2:15:29] TelRehiad: manyullyn has one of the highest dmg
[2:15:32] Armanicx: make it YEP
[2:15:38] daemonaedryn: Blazing blood isnt the absolute worst thing to make
[2:15:39] RamseyRinehaus: dont get side-tracked, just do cobalt
[2:15:46] Winner5001: KEKW
[2:16:02] daemonaedryn: Thats easy with the scanner
[2:16:06] Immp: If you mouse over below the temp, it will show which liquids give that level heat
[2:16:15] Venxuri: Scanner and you have it in 5 minutes, ideal sidetrack project

[2:17:36] Venxuri: kingslime? PepoThink
[2:17:37] daemonaedryn: Attack speed maybe?
[2:17:44] Borlaq: manyullym blade and plate, an embossed prismarine blade, a cobalt handle and a paper tough tool rod as an extra. Next add 100 Redstone to achieve better attack speed and then 144 quartz to get to over 20 attack damage. Prismarine's jagged trait will increase damage as you loose durability.
[2:17:47] TelRehiad: check lead
[2:17:56] daemonaedryn: Also take a look at the affixes, could be good or bad
[2:18:02] SirKaelan: YEP lead

[2:19:12] Moobot: Come join the Waffle House Discord! <# https://discord.gg/fhGFtMuzdS
[2:19:17] RamseyRinehaus: cobalt handle seems low effort for good value
[2:19:21] Venxuri: Thats tetra tho
[2:19:26] Kenanja293: tbh, i tried tetra and it felt like this but simplified
[2:19:27] TelRehiad: I don't mean for tetra. I meant for tinkers
[2:19:28] Venxuri: its weird
[2:19:37] daemonaedryn: Make the Puny Smelting book, it shows tier 2 materials
[2:19:45] Borlaq: Do 1 cobalt and 1 paper tough
[2:19:46] daemonaedryn: And it explains the affixes
[2:19:46] Naxorian: i have spredsheet for tinkers if u let me link
[2:19:48] Brewcrew8788: @giantwaffle get materials and me it’ll tell you what all alloys do for weapons

[2:23:54] DrHax_: what does the "short sighted" mod on the ref. obsidian plates do?
[2:24:18] Jibbur: fair enough
[2:24:33] tipsybruh: just make everything cobalt... its the easiest
[2:24:42] TelRehiad: short sighted is reduced distance

[2:25:58] DKJensen98: 360
[2:25:59] Jibbur: They changed the way the modifiers are done
[2:26:07] Armanicx: U use the blade material to repair.
[2:26:07] Borlaq: Need 144 quartz i think
[2:26:09] EmotePerMessage: cobalt
[2:26:09] daemonaedryn: Probably cobalt
[2:26:10] dobie: its diff now, its like a specific recipe for each stage
[2:26:12] lennon7770: Look in tinkers book
