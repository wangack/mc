[0:10:44] starlitfires: @the_mmx i think drip's run just barely was before paceman got dropped publicly but i could be wrong, people just ping pacepals in general regardless

[0:14:20] ssythh_: Bridge is better than treasure fo r aa right
[0:14:28] waffleeat: how did he have 9 rods?
[0:14:31] AwaDeFructus: I agree that like with paceman "why do i watch someone stream" now is a valid thought, but i kinda feel like I've noticed that people that get pacepaled very often with good paces tend to get more people watching their streams on the normal
[0:14:39] the_mmx: bridge is good as first bastion and then its better be all treasures
[0:14:44] CurtisDN_: bridge is faster during the any% portion of the run than treasure is, and is pretty consistent for getting the trades you need
[0:14:45] ssythh_: @the_mmx k ty
[0:14:59] nemirg17: crazy how I’ve been playing the game casually for 10 years and still learn so much every time I watch these streams

[0:17:42] emilyjpeg: this sh is silly
[0:17:48] starlitfires: what are the odds of a portal room less stronghold
[0:17:53] blobserr: 0
[0:17:56] the_mmx: OMEGALUL
[0:17:56] blobserr: for java

[0:18:23] ZenoSprout: normal stronghold moment
[0:18:38] eponumos: @eponumos Hmmm
[0:18:45] CurtisDN_: @BurperFish depends on how you define a speedrun trick. also reverse uneasy has existed for years
[0:18:45] tattedweelamb: I hate it’s so broken up
[0:18:47] arinaconfetti: as much as 1.20 is cool i miss the old terrain generation and silly ravines cutting through structures
[0:18:52] zxchjohnson: Okayge
[0:18:53] Dfanm: portal room always generates but it can still be overwritten by stuff (atleast in 1.16)
[0:18:55] Blurse1652: this stronghold is disgusting lmao

[0:18:57] isabelcoolaf: minimum stronghold is starter staircase, entry 4way and portal room right?
[0:19:04] skyward_14: I think that people should legalise seed injection
[0:19:07] blobserr: i think so
[0:19:07] the_mmx: most normal sh evre

[3:02:48] Destetra: Clueless
[3:02:50] PacManMVC: towers are a 1/2 to have a bridge and a bridge is a 1/8  to have a ship
[3:02:52] recycledtrsh: @POJOGA3 just pull 5 ingots from bottom treasure
[3:02:53] slinkyboi__: what version mc u on rn?

[3:07:48] CurtisDN_: who knew that balls made a feature in edamame and the aa tas
[3:07:51] nikitaprivet: where do you run the sample pac
[3:07:55] lion4202: pac could you also do that sample for the 8 diamonds?
[3:08:01] TheBattleOfThermopylae: Yuh
[3:08:08] The_Goobanator: or you could find the chance using math
[3:08:13] sh4dle: im getting reeeal close to 24 points EZ
[3:08:14] The_Goobanator: for fun
[3:08:25] PacManMVC: @The_Goobanator that's just way harder and also just not really possible
[3:08:30] rachel__red: VibePls
[3:08:37] The_Goobanator: I mean it is but
[3:08:42] The_Goobanator: yeah harder
[3:08:42] PacManMVC: because it's structure generation you can't calculate it
[3:08:47] CurtisDN_: goob we had just discussed how its not possible to manually calculate ship odds
[3:08:52] PacManMVC: @lion4202 i did
[3:08:59] PacManMVC: its about 1 in 10k

[3:09:47] PacManMVC: @The_Goobanator loot tables have discrete values that you can use to calculate, but structures use terrain and other weird stuff and terrain is pure random noise and just impossible to calculate
[3:09:50] RelcPunch: Mob in boat theme for this stream?
[3:09:50] sh4dle: catPunch shulker

[5:02:35] voxelpioneer: I'm curious, what are the benefits/reasons that so many speedrunners, including feinberg, use third person camera so much? I mean I get that you can see behind you but it seems so much harder to place blocks that I feel like the uses of it are not as often as people use it. Am I missing something or is really just about seeing more of the terrain?

[5:18:12] blobserr: jorgambler wasnt puttin up top 5 in the league stats when he was 38

[5:18:21] FanboyEintfan12: Guys the right take: feinberge is the true goat no matter the game
[5:18:23] ItzzMatt84: @POJOGA3 LeFraud is actually 0-74 in the Finals 46-83: Too lazy to even be born 84-03: Too lazy to even show up 03-05: Missed playoffs 06-11: Lost 12: Baby Thunder 13: Ray Allen 14/15: Lost 16: Injured Warriors 17/18: Lost 19: Missed playoffs 20: Mickey Mouse Summer League Ring

[5:19:11] KiltedandBeardedGuy: He's only the king of flopping
[5:19:14] penguinsandstuff: pog
[5:19:20] voxelpioneer: @novamb conversation...what else happens in chat?
[5:19:24] PacManMVC: @KiltedandBeardedGuy you talking about embiid?

[5:20:07] penguinsandstuff: @KiltedandBeardedGuy nod
[5:20:08] voxelpioneer: Absketball is pretty dope
[5:20:16] POJOGA3: LeBron, in a vacuum, is probably better at basketball and will have sustained his performance in terms of statistics for an unfathomable period of time. Look at LeBron and MJ’s age 21 seasons and age 38 seasons. MJ’s 28-6.5-6 rookie season gets lauded, LeBron at the same age was 31–7-6.5. @ItzzMatt84
[5:20:39] MaJoHu27: i love lebum
[5:20:39] froggy__mode: i tabbed out for a bit but I have nothing to contribute to this basketball conversation :)
[5:20:45] penguinsandstuff: LEBUM LMAOOO
[5:20:52] ItzzMatt84: @POJOGA3 Yapping
[5:20:54] KiltedandBeardedGuy: Give Bird or Jordan 20 years....they would've made Lebitch cry like one. The only reason he still performs at the level he does is the extracurricular activites.
[5:20:54] Azurki: !today

[5:23:11] XKon23: What if he's like the biggest minecraft nerd with his son
[5:23:11] Fossabot: yo fein DonoWall

[5:25:48] KiltedandBeardedGuy: @jamen___ dude...that would pop off. But it'd be better just to teach him to speedrun. AA is a bit much.
[5:25:50] froggy__mode: Sadge no gateway
