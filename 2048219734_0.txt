[2:46:10] superdude097: @TXC2 Per wikipedia: "Tuff is a type of rock made of volcanic ash ejected from a vent during a volcanic eruption. Following ejection and deposition, the ash is lithified into a solid rock. Rock that contains greater than 75% ash is considered tuff, while rock containing 25% to 75% ash is described as tuffaceous."

[2:48:06] Tandtroll_OG: I mean I would say dont eat candles in general, the shape is not the problem
[2:48:25] TXC2: you could make an edible candle no?
