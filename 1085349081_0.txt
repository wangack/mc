[2:11:09] RyanEmeraldLive2: omg
[2:11:10] SunburnOrk: @Z0eff NODDERS Spotify is blocked as well because for some reason it just eats all the bandwidth. Even Twitch doesn't take as much as Spotify. And no one knows why.
[2:11:16] RyanEmeraldLive2: I used to watch you when I was little
[2:11:19] Imperator_Benny: it is bad for you as it's largely composed of mercury i think
[2:11:21] Mizzuru: @SunburnOrk you mean you think they wouldnt appreciate you streaming simon singing to 'Don;t want to miss a thing' as a rabbit lady whilst a seperate buxom bunny lady dances in the corner? they wouldnt like that a lot?

[2:18:10] Mizzuru: @georgehh16 you asked for the next time out to be shorter than 5 mins, so I did one for 4 : )
[2:18:11] MrTaiganBond: vanilla iron farm

[2:18:22] Z0eff: iron golum farms are finicky as fuck
[2:18:23] neebit: i recommend giving yourself some vauilt xp
[2:18:24] TheTurtleOhPower: there is a auto iron farm. from a villager mod I think
[2:18:25] macserv: Mining != farming
[2:18:27] SunburnOrk: georgehh16 getting boolied by mods again NODDERS Everything's normal hryYep
[2:18:28] soph_tea: think of it as a mindfulness exercise
[2:18:28] First_Mesmer: You get people to donate to you and get stuff to auto-generate resources for you. LUL
[2:18:30] danathedaisy: they need to get that guy to give them the twitch integration

[2:18:38] GoatusEponymous: I hate building iron golem farms
[2:18:39] smello_vision: can get 2000 iron overnight easy
[2:18:43] Ziul090: ask sips
[2:18:44] IcarusNodus: it's ONLY like a chest full of iron....
[2:18:45] Fxate: this was made by one of those korean mmo makers that requires you to kill 10,000,000 mobs to get the xp for one level
[2:18:45] BurnoodTakedown: So should we start eco? pedLaugh
[2:18:49] fruit_of_doom: ravsPride
[2:18:51] Imperator_Benny: this is where i spawn in the stuff, at least for the first dungeon or two
[2:18:51] hexed_coyote: you can make iron farms purely with the create mod, fully automated
[2:18:52] Fares_4: you might as well just cheat if you are going to leave the server on for an entire week
[2:18:57] neebit: this pack was left really unbalanced with twitch itegration
[2:19:02] starlitesparkl3: find a village
[2:19:03] georgehehheh: @mizzuru hryLeddit I never said "next one" I said "couldn't you have" fml
[2:19:04] brainrottica: This is wild
[2:19:04] Sappho_Artemis: I could not even deal with that bs, I would just spawn the shit in
[2:19:06] InfectedRaven_: They're super easy. it's like 8 villagers and 1 zombie. It takes like an hour to build aha
[2:19:07] Ziul090: just play colony survival
[2:19:09] Z0eff: @neebit ah is that the reason?
[2:19:10] EB4EnderBlaze: @neebit without, you mean?
[2:19:10] MrTaiganBond: spawn a red matter bomb to find some iron
[2:19:10] AutoRefresher2: they're like the most chill farms to build, since you're so high in the air nothing spawns except maybe phantoms
[2:19:10] macserv: Might be easier with a mod
[2:19:11] Jaranon: i definitely remember you guys importing a bunch of iron and gravel from the bee pack
[2:19:13] Dohlo: Do-hio? lol... <3 you Ravs. Embrace the grind!
[2:19:14] skunkdog25: and to do that you need 24 nether stars
[2:19:14] JaffaMod: Join our Discord to chat and talk with other members of the community! https://discord.gg/yogscast

[2:19:19] smello_vision: spawn 👏 it 👏 in 👏
[2:19:19] surrealcarrot: what about the pigs
[2:19:20] EsotericFish: Just spawn for the first vault
[2:19:24] GoatusEponymous: @hexed_coyote We might not be able to DO all of create's stuff, a lot of items are gated behind Twitch integration and Vaults
[2:19:31] neebit: it only really ever worked for the orignial streamers
[2:19:37] First_Mesmer: Check Ravs' prison pocket?
[2:19:42] PixieDruid: how you build the iron farm also depends on what version of minecraft you're in
[2:19:46] Kaykira: gated behind twitch integration what
[2:19:47] First_Mesmer: He didn't know he had the crystal, maybe he's got iron too?
[2:19:49] hexed_coyote: @Skelecorn ah, yeah, the digital miner recipe should have tipped me off
[2:19:50] Sappho_Artemis: well this series will never finish
[2:19:52] LuLewLuke: Looting and Fortune enchantments!
[2:19:54] Dohlo: Do other vault rocks require less shit?
[2:19:56] Purplecrown: put the zombie in a minecart
[2:19:58] throwbackadactyl: lol find a tutorial, it's not bad once you get I think 4 villagers
[2:19:59] EB4EnderBlaze: @Skelecorn the devs made sure that pretty much all of the stuff that is integration locked isnt required for anything
[2:20:01] starlitesparkl3: duncan look at the tool tips, it says "Requires Research"
[2:20:02] TheTurtleOhPower: check out the easy villagers mod.
[2:20:03] Z0eff: @Kaykira I'm assuming the gated behind twitch integration is different in this public version
[2:20:10] macserv: Ended quarry, guys
[2:20:12] Ziul090: "kind of fun to do " duncan 2021
[2:20:14] kedamono1st: Bet you need to go to the vault to make those.
[2:20:16] Dohlo: EASY VILLAGERS MOD
[2:20:17] macserv: Ender*
[2:20:18] philipov: !schedule
[2:20:18] JaffaMod: Here's the schedule! - https://schedule.yogscast.com/
[2:20:22] deltas14: I like Duncan reassuring everyone by saying ‘it’s fun’
[2:20:24] GoatusEponymous: The whole pack REALLY RELIES on twitch integration. @Z0eff It's all still gated.
[2:20:24] EB4EnderBlaze: @Z0eff it isnt - rather, the items dont exist in the public version.
[2:20:32] GoatusEponymous: I couldn't make a sleeping bag because I needed Twitch boy money points
[2:20:32] Z0eff: Got 30 mins to get the farms up and running so it can run in the coming week yogP
[2:20:37] Dohlo: Apparently the EASY VILLAGERS MOD is key!
[2:20:41] hgfhdhss: LUL
[2:20:42] SunburnOrk: Chat, stop suggesting cheating to them. Yogscast never cheat. I am disgusted at the idea Kappa
[2:20:43] starlitesparkl3: duncan look at the tool tips for the modded items, it says "Requires Research"
[2:20:45] Absolly: @starlitesparkl3 is there even a way to use any of the mods before you get into the dungeon?
[2:20:48] lord_of_burgers: i think the rancher only feeds animals, so the baby separator would be needed and a grinder to kill the grown-up babies
[2:21:02] philipov: @deltas14 Is he reassuring us, or trying to convince himself? Kappa
[2:21:07] Mizzuru: can we have someone go round Ravs' and check he's ok, maybe make him a brew and give him a hug
[2:21:14] Dohlo: Apparently the EASY VILLAGERS MOD is key!
[2:21:20] kedamono1st: "Fun" he says, let's go a play in a dungeon he says...
[2:21:20] NoReturnGaming_: dont you need to resrarch to use the stuff
[2:21:20] georgehehheh: yogH it's fun
[2:21:31] EB4EnderBlaze: ohhhh boy, Research is a whole other deal... basically, you need to "research" mods to be able to craft anything from them.
[2:21:33] Mizzuru: @Dohlo easy with the spam
[2:21:35] InfectedRaven_: You could also use crusher and purification chambers to get thr Iron
[2:21:36] EB4EnderBlaze: i wont say how.
[2:21:39] deltas14: @philipov at this stage it’s a free for all of self deceiving
[2:21:43] Aadam78692: Why are so many of these mod packs grinds for the sake of being grinds
[2:21:45] GoatusEponymous: Research is in the twitch integration menu I think.
[2:21:46] kedamono1st: need a carrot farm

[2:23:40] dummiekid: viztee 21 - 13 according to UEFA
[2:23:40] TheTurtleOhPower: actually scratch the easy villagers thing. needs research I think. without research it's pretty hard to do any of the mods
[2:23:40] Purplecrown: 90 days wow
[2:23:40] malirsty12: italy were dirty af
[2:23:50] Z0eff: football? Yeah thats the thing where you throw egg shaped balls right? YEPPERS

[2:24:45] starlitesparkl3: the original release event challenge was on a multiplayer server with 7 streamers I think

[2:24:51] AutoRefresher2: imagine listening to faaafv hryFlex
[2:24:56] NoReturnGaming_: its vanilla until you research

[2:25:08] EB4EnderBlaze: @hexed_coyote nope - randomly chosen
[2:25:08] GoatusEponymous: @EB4EnderBlaze The only way for them to unlock any mods is research which requires the vault.
[2:25:08] georgehehheh: @mykyx True, but nowhere near Italy, who have been doing it consistently throughout LUL
[2:25:12] tilaron: @moobinski osieROY
[2:25:13] kostalott: just cheat for the first one to see if its even worth it
[2:25:13] TheTurtleOhPower: once one person steps into the vault the portal breaks so only one person can enter
[2:25:14] GinWilly: just add a condenser mod
[2:25:17] SquidDruid: moobinski breehHey
[2:25:22] Zotatoch1p: Faaafv is my source of the most truest of facts
[2:25:22] moobinski: Couldn't be you @Faaafv moobinLaugh
[2:25:36] EsotericFish: You really should just spawn stuff for the first one, they might be garbage

[2:26:50] dummiekid: see if you can find a boat

[2:28:46] First_Mesmer: Harry probably had people donating to him Kappa
[2:28:48] starlitesparkl3: if you were a streamer on the original release event, you got a free vault entry for your first vault run

[2:28:51] nemo_jk97: yes pls
[2:28:56] Imperator_Benny: is this a giant harry barry gappa
[2:29:01] EB4EnderBlaze: @Faaafv bit of a spoiler, but the research points are made by crafting a "knowledge star", you find the stuff to craft it inside the vault
[2:29:02] Faaafv: nice ravs hryLaf
[2:29:10] TheTurtleOhPower: the twitch integration is definitely needed tbh. helps a lot

[2:29:36] Viztee: This is the public release version though, it should be doable without twitch intergration.
[2:29:37] First_Mesmer: need some vanilla redstone magic to shorten that to a pulse
[2:29:45] Z0eff: Yeah what viztee said ^
[2:29:48] Imperator_Benny: even cheating in 2000 iron is kind of a pain in the ass lol
[2:29:52] EB4EnderBlaze: @viztee its possible but pretty difficult

[2:30:37] neebit: do they know that in the vault it is hardcore (lose stuff) and no natural healing?
[2:30:45] mykyx: this modpack was made to last long, like how eveeryone else plays it

[2:35:11] JVteam: Ravs has gotten a lot of chests
[2:35:12] neebit: you need star essence for reasearch
[2:35:17] EB4EnderBlaze: @TheTurtleOhPower whats the completion requirement again? obelisk fragments, or what was the item called?
[2:35:18] orflekth3butcher: Are these vaults timed?
[2:35:35] EB4EnderBlaze: @orflekth3butcher yeah. if the timer expires, EVERYONE in the vault dies
[2:35:43] Faaafv: only ravs can see the loot hryLafExceptInPain
[2:35:45] mightyapricot: does it only generate for the player who opens it?

[2:41:10] JVteam: You use those to spawn the boss NODDERS
[2:41:10] EB4EnderBlaze: obelisks are used to spawn the vault boss, which is the completion requirement
[2:41:21] TheTurtleOhPower: you use that to summon the boss with inscriptions

[2:42:04] mykyx: oh well

[2:42:41] simply_dave_: at least dunc is getting all the iron back that they spawned in :P
[2:42:47] TheTurtleOhPower: yeah you definitely shouldn't be in there together. cause once you die in the vault it basically stops it but since people are still in it's messed it up
[2:42:49] EB4EnderBlaze: @Upyursh it did yeah
[2:43:01] Dohlo: This vault only needed a Ton of resources, probably, because it was a RARE vault!
[2:43:15] JaffaMod: Want to support the streamer and the Yogscast? 75% of donations go directly to the streamer! https://twitch.streamlabs.com/yogscast
[2:43:19] EB4EnderBlaze: @Dohlo incorrect - the vault rarity is randomized when you power it
[2:43:31] Dohlo: ah... well
[2:43:49] EB4EnderBlaze: you can get either common, rare, epic, or omega vault crystals. omega are by FAR the most valuable, and the most rare
[2:43:51] totoporoto: what do you do in the vaults
[2:44:00] orflekth3butcher: You guys shouldn’t leave anything because you have to pay for future vaults
[2:44:04] EB4EnderBlaze: look for Obelisk Inscriptions
[2:44:14] EB4EnderBlaze: you use inscriptions on the obelisks
[2:44:17] TheTurtleOhPower: if it's the coloured doors you need a key of the same name as the door
[2:44:18] EB4EnderBlaze: and that spawns the boss
[2:44:23] EB4EnderBlaze: kill the boss, complete the vault
[2:44:23] JVteam: Duncan found the upper floor Pog

[2:46:08] starlitesparkl3: its an SMP but its meant to have each streamer interact with their own audience
[2:46:09] TheTurtleOhPower: yeah they did seperate vaults
[2:46:09] Zotatoch1p: It seems interesting just poorly made
[2:46:11] mykyx: you can randomize the altar cost
[2:46:15] neebit: there is a new enigmatica 6 pack out
[2:46:17] KingWill84: @Yogscast Awakening: Sky of Diamonds is a fun pack speeds up early game
[2:46:18] simply_dave_: @not_really_here099 that isn't publicly available though
[2:46:23] InfectedRaven_: Galatic craft modpack!!!
[2:46:24] First_Mesmer: more of a friendly competition server than a coop server
[2:46:27] ToastyJackss: Play Enigmatica
[2:46:31] orflekth3butcher: There are machines to grind things
[2:46:38] Barca0Five: you could automate the iron bit
[2:46:39] Dohlo: play more!
[2:46:40] TheTurtleOhPower: with twitch integration it definitely helps. without it's a grind
[2:46:41] tENUOUSlIGHT: Duncan used to LIVE for grindy modpacks, now he's lost his taste for them
[2:46:46] Z0eff: LUL
[2:46:47] mightyapricot: hryPog
[2:46:48] Dohlo: easy solution, play way more
[2:46:49] Scaedura: orflekth3butcher that they can't make without the vaults LUL
[2:46:49] not_really_here099: @simply_dave_ that sucks
[2:46:53] Upyursh: its a risk vs reward pack. you build up your infra to get crystals etc and the best loot is in the vaults.
[2:46:55] surguchevgleb: Maybe try modpacks by Direwol20?
[2:46:57] mykyx: play 1.17 vanilla
[2:47:02] First_Mesmer: LUL was Z0eff trying to do something?
[2:47:09] First_Mesmer: sneaky Z0eff!
[2:47:10] GoatusEponymous: @TenuousLight At least those usually let you set up actual automation, this pack doesn't let you do JACK ALL
[2:47:17] georgehehheh: 1.17 vanilla hardcore NODDERS
[2:47:17] mykyx: with the caves datapack
[2:47:19] EB4EnderBlaze: vaults are meant to be high risk high reward
[2:47:20] Aadam78692: Guys to super loot of netherite wow
[2:47:21] Z0eff: @First_Mesmer oh no I just went to the timelapse position I recorded earlier
[2:47:22] starlitesparkl3: the SMP had a different version of the modpack where the audience could pay the streamer to give them free stuff
[2:47:24] Aadam78692: Its really not worth it
[2:47:29] totoporoto: vaults feels like endgame
[2:47:36] totoporoto: when you havce nothing else to do
[2:47:37] EB4EnderBlaze: @starlitesparkl3 SORT OF free, i suppose.
[2:47:41] Dohlo: Have you tried "Escape from 2020" it's a darkosto pack like skyfactory 4 and sevtech?
[2:47:41] NoReturnGaming_: what about the mode pack tnp limitless 3
[2:47:44] First_Mesmer: oh, I thought you were responsible for the command block silliness Ravs stumbled on LUL
[2:47:45] Nokken_nz: its going rome
[2:47:45] Upyursh: yeah but as you level up you get powerful too
[2:47:51] Krandel: None of that loot was even interesting
[2:47:56] alienaura1: Ravs POV? modCheck
[2:47:57] Zotatoch1p: Yea the fact that you lose everything including your gear makes this pack literal garbago
[2:47:59] Aadam78692: What even was the end game loot apart from stuff you can normally build?
[2:48:01] AutoRefresher2: the thing is, grinding to unlock the best part of mods is fine, but grinding twice as long JUST TO UNLOCK said mods is just wank, since you then still have to grind for the same parts of the mods
[2:48:03] MrTaiganBond: do sevtech skies lol
[2:48:05] KingWill84: @Yogscast Awakening: Sky of Diamonds have a look
[2:48:06] First_Mesmer: but Ravs is still in the vault, isn't he?
[2:48:07] GoatusEponymous: @EB4EnderBlaze those ingots aren't high reward, neither are the enchanting books.
[2:48:08] neebit: didnt even level up lol

[2:48:28] mykyx: were you supposed to losee everything in thee vault?
[2:48:31] jupiterthewizard: Yoglabs Blacksite
[2:48:43] EB4EnderBlaze: @Skelecorn thats because youre looking in the wrong location. the treasure rooms are OVERPOWERED, plus the loot scales with vault level
[2:48:46] ryans_tryin: Isn't meow meow Thors Hammer?
[2:48:48] tENUOUSlIGHT: Don't make coffee machine jokes, only Boba will get them
[2:48:51] TheRealSerenityGaming: SPC Vault

[2:49:15] philipov: Minecraft IS the jail Kappa
[2:49:19] Scaedura: so, how do you get out of a vault?
[2:49:37] JVteam: @Scaedura either go back through the first portal, or kill the boss
[2:49:38] joeblowman: it's a spoopy vault pedLaugh look at the minimap on the right
[2:49:42] EB4EnderBlaze: @Scaedura either you exit out of the portal you spawn at, or you fight the vault boss and succeed
[2:49:51] MrTaiganBond: just spawn in a mech suit
[2:49:55] The3rdFist: @scaedura to get out you either wait til the timer runs out or kill the boss iirc
[2:50:03] VyolitVy: boba KEKW
[2:50:06] Sappho_Artemis: decided to test out the modpack, and wanted to look at the whole requirement and i needed to get 418 diamonds
[2:50:09] Lucy402: OOOO Boba's in creative OOOO
[2:50:10] EB4EnderBlaze: @joeblowman the vaults are made in a different dimension, thats just the biome name
[2:50:11] The3rdFist: what EB4 said
[2:50:17] ryans_tryin: @dummiekid or is it jonathon?
[2:50:24] Shipopi_: cheating POGGERS
[2:50:30] GoatusEponymous: I think the ladder Dunc went up was the right-ish way?
[2:50:34] dummiekid: @true_scotsman no no, thats duncan Kappa
[2:50:37] EB4EnderBlaze: @Sappho_Artemis yeah, the vault crystal requirements are pretty badly imbalanced in VH
[2:50:42] skunkdog25: when did they start doing yoglabs again?
[2:50:46] EB4EnderBlaze: they are better scaled in VH2 though
[2:51:01] MrTaiganBond: someone just make an updated yogscast complete pack for the guys
[2:51:16] TheAlexlotl: What is going on? xD whc
[2:51:25] Dan_SB: knobolisk?
[2:51:29] Ref_D: theres maybe a config option, that makes you need less items
[2:51:42] EB4EnderBlaze: @The_Mining_Alex they broke the rare vault by forcing multiplayer teleportation into the vault
[2:51:48] GoatusEponymous: Duncan you can't use machines
[2:51:55] TheTurtleOhPower: now you need inscriptions. four to spawn the boss
[2:51:56] neebit: vault rock requirements are per person
[2:51:57] starlitesparkl3: vault key?
[2:52:01] TheAlexlotl: oh no..
[2:52:05] EB4EnderBlaze: you need to right click on it with obelisk inscriptions
[2:52:18] TheTurtleOhPower: obelisk inscriptions
[2:52:19] Nokken_nz: press alt + f4 on it
[2:52:22] Zotatoch1p: Yea fuck that so literally every vault is maybe 5 to 10+ hours of grinding before each vault
[2:52:25] JVteam: inscriptions is the name of the item
[2:52:27] EB4EnderBlaze: you find inscriptions in chests normally
[2:52:33] TheRealSerenityGaming: @Nokken_NZ no
[2:52:44] EB4EnderBlaze: keys are a completely different thing
[2:52:56] wildhogs2011: When was the first week of this mod pack?
[2:52:57] EB4EnderBlaze: oh
[2:52:59] TheAlexlotl: is this what starting without any knowledge feels like?
[2:53:01] Faaafv: wow
[2:53:06] TheTurtleOhPower: it's broken cause the vault is broken
