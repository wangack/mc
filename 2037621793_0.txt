[0:56:58] clueless440: LUCK IS FUCKING LUCKING
[0:57:03] sexy_peach_on_twitch: this is the run
[0:57:09] PacManMVC: id rather get 1 notch and a channeling book
[0:57:15] sexy_peach_on_twitch: only a few more lucky situations
[0:57:20] clueless440: @PacManMVC two is better then one???
[0:57:21] ItzzMatt84: @clueless440 NOWAYING
[0:57:24] grifferthrydwy: yeah ppl glaze notches so hard
[0:57:28] PacManMVC: i mean
[0:57:28] Polatyetim: just joined, god apple already is wild. good luck!
[0:57:45] FlaiFlai: @Polatyetim It's like a 10% chance to get a notch in the first temple
[0:57:45] PacManMVC: so many chatters think that egap in first temple is so crazy
[0:57:47] sexy_peach_on_twitch: eat one now
[0:57:49] CurtisDN_: notch in the any% temple is just -1 inventory slot for the whole run
[0:57:52] PacManMVC: but like its just like getting first try flint
[0:58:04] clueless440: @ItzzMatt84 its in my name
[0:58:08] PacManMVC: and it doesn't really matter you're gonna visit 20 more temples later anyways
[0:58:11] kc5803: @clueless440 0 notch apples to 1 god apple is far better than 1 to 2
[0:58:17] JaboZAnator: @PacManMVC yeah i go wild for first try flint
[0:58:19] sexy_peach_on_twitch: u ever troll during wr runs? Would be a flex to still wr
[0:58:21] FlaiFlai: @PacManMVC you've said this so often chat pogs at 1st try flint
[0:58:35] FlaiFlai: as they should
[0:58:40] PacManMVC: that's just
[0:58:43] quartabort: piglin oinked on beat 🔥
[0:58:44] grifferthrydwy: @black_and_red_flag fein trolls every run one way or another
[0:58:46] CurtisDN_: he is trolling right now
[0:58:58] PacManMVC: i love treasure
[0:58:59] lion4202: :tf:
[0:59:00] sexy_peach_on_twitch: by not finding any shells

[0:59:09] grifferthrydwy: pac can tell you all about that YEP
[0:59:14] CurtisDN_: well thats not feinberg-exclusive trolling

[0:59:15] JaboZAnator: bro trued himslef?
[0:59:21] CurtisDN_: that happens to players of every skill level
[0:59:21] Murtgah: stables is the anti-wr bastion right

[1:00:30] ItzzMatt84: @clueless440 yeah hes a fuckin loser who only watches twitch
[1:00:31] the_mmx: i dont speedrun mc myself but after all that time watching the runs i still cant tell stables and housing apart. Bridge and treasure i usually guess on first block.
[1:00:42] PacManMVC: couldn't have said it better myself matt

[1:03:57] PacManMVC: i wonder if there's a more efficient way to type PeepiRoseEat
[1:04:02] CurtisDN_: fishing for shell enthusiasts rejoicing right now
[1:04:04] PacManMVC: like with a tab in the middle instead of just at the end
[1:04:07] matikss321: naughty shell
[1:04:27] CurtisDN_: peepirose, but with 2 e's at the end, then tab
[1:04:34] the_mmx: shell fished! pog this run is blessed with good shell luck
[1:04:41] froggy__mode: nod
[1:04:42] CurtisDN_: 1 key stroke saved
[1:04:48] PacManMVC: well you can do peepirosee tab or peepir tab delete e tab
[1:04:57] tattedweelamb: distPls RaveTime
[1:05:00] Murtgah: pe -> tab -> backspace, p -> tab -> backspace, r -> tab
[1:05:17] Murtgah: sorry r and p not p and r
[1:05:25] FlaiFlai: i wonder how algorithmically hard it is to find the minimum keystrokes to get it
[1:05:36] FlaiFlai: for an arbitrary emote
[1:05:50] the_yuukster: good mornin 🌞
[1:06:03] CurtisDN_: you could prolly write a program for that
[1:06:19] worthless_animal: worthless_animal subscribed at Tier 1. 
[1:06:23] CurtisDN_: like, given a set of emotes, and an emote you want to get, whats the minimum keystrokes
[1:06:35] carp_catcher_pro: catJAM
[1:06:38] kc5803: it's actually pretty elementary coding
[1:06:39] de_dopstra: is the FOV at 31 to line up crosshair width?
[1:06:43] grifferthrydwy: shouldnt be hard to code yea
[1:06:46] FlaiFlai: CurtisDN_ yeah, but like, how hard is finding the optimal strategy? might be np, might be linear, idk
[1:06:55] grifferthrydwy: its probably just a tree
[1:06:59] Murtgah: i guess for PeepiRoseEat its just type "pe" then hit tab 4 times
[1:07:12] FlaiFlai: grifferthrydwy sure, but trees can be quadritic and exponential
[1:07:27] CurtisDN_: oh the order of magnitude for how long it can run might be kinda long, yea
[1:07:30] grifferthrydwy: yeah but the logic doesnt seem too hard here
[1:07:43] grifferthrydwy: runtime i have no clue
[1:07:50] thewantedprince: hiii
[1:07:50] FlaiFlai: i mean i suck at algodat
[1:07:53] CurtisDN_: like it prolly wouldnt be hard to write a working program, but writing the most efficient one is a hard question
[1:07:53] FlaiFlai: so idk
[1:08:02] grifferthrydwy: shouldnt be larger than o(n^2) tho
[1:08:05] Switchpalacecorner: what even defines the order of tabbing
[1:08:08] Switchpalacecorner: its not alphabetical
[1:08:13] PacManMVC: it is
[1:08:17] matikss321: nice
[1:08:26] PacManMVC: with terminating words having priority
[1:08:27] Switchpalacecorner: oh i guess the ffz tab extension is different?
[1:08:32] PacManMVC: oh maybe
[1:08:41] PacManMVC: 7tv is alphabetical
[1:08:41] Switchpalacecorner: if I type pe the first tab I get is ResidentSleeper which is wild
[1:08:45] grifferthrydwy: yea i just had widepeepo before peeposomething
[1:08:54] PacManMVC: @Switchpalacecorner probably alphabetical matching the substring
[1:08:57] PacManMVC: which is stupid
[1:08:59] TheRealZimmShady: I get Peepi
[1:09:25] TheRealZimmShady: smolhold

[1:09:36] de_dopstra: @the_mmx lmao lucky problems
[1:10:23] carp_catcher_pro: why did you take off the armor?
[1:10:31] CurtisDN_: cause hes gonna get new armor
[1:10:32] TheRealZimmShady: @carp_catcher_pro gonna get better armor in the outer end
[1:10:33] PacManMVC: he's gonna get armor in the cities
[1:10:36] CurtisDN_: and this is pure waiting and downtime
[1:10:42] PacManMVC: i love waiting
[1:10:44] PacManMVC: and downtime
[1:10:50] TheRealZimmShady: HOLD
[1:10:51] PacManMVC: that's why they call me pacmanDMV
[1:10:51] ItzzMatt84: Drake

[1:11:00] matikss321: woah
[1:11:00] FlaiFlai: PacManMVC you watch mc speedruns, we know
[1:11:00] CurtisDN_: well after the halfbow, to be more precise. then its downtime
[1:11:05] TheRealZimmShady: Drake
[1:11:05] carp_catcher_pro: ok so just that he does something while waiting anyways?

[1:11:28] CurtisDN_: @carp_catcher_pro yea he wants to take it off before getting armor from end cities, so might as well do it while he cant speed anything up
[1:11:31] FlaiFlai: carp_catcher_pro something he'd have to do later
[1:11:32] katian1551: hi
[1:11:36] the_mmx: catRave

[1:16:36] wrymonster: shulker% complete
[1:16:40] Arxij: pog
[1:16:44] CurtisDN_: ik the tas uses the same seed and the tas uses home gateway
[1:16:52] PacManMVC: home gateway nod
[1:16:52] fudge1: the current seed has some tech to speed up shit so you cant really be faster in rsg
[1:16:58] TommyYeahTwitch: pog
[1:17:06] PacManMVC: unless you rip the 1/20 and insta city spawn fudge
[1:17:10] the_mmx: if only end obby platform wasnt enclosed Sadge
[1:17:12] fudge1: so true
[1:17:16] PacManMVC: but that's a bit rare
[1:17:20] fudge1: but no rsg runners no the tech anyway :p
[1:17:31] DuolingoTM: perfect chestplate
[1:17:31] GrungySatsuma: pog
[1:17:36] CurtisDN_: btw pac something i was curious about is unease said in their 1.11 aa tas explained that usually they find their own seeds for their tas's
[1:17:38] PacManMVC: @fudge1 Sadge
[1:17:42] CurtisDN_: but was it just easier to take the ssg seed
[1:17:43] candedgarcia9: why he doesnt pick things w mending?
[1:17:44] fudge1: know* wtf
[1:17:47] CurtisDN_: or is it just by far the best seed
[1:17:49] PapaSparta_: decent start lol
[1:18:00] PacManMVC: yeah
[1:18:00] fudge1: yeah
[1:18:17] PacManMVC: it thinks the bobber is still in the outer end and because its the 1/20 the alignment works out
[1:18:22] CurtisDN_: @candedgarcia9 mending = less levels to roll for channeling later, and his armor is not gonna break by the end of the run
[1:18:23] PacManMVC: it has to be the correct gateway
[1:18:24] TommyYeahTwitch: idk
[1:18:33] PacManMVC: and you have to use the home gateway in the outer end
[1:18:40] candedgarcia9: NOTED thanks curtis
[1:18:40] PacManMVC: so you need insta city and 1/20

[1:23:03] PacManMVC: you take a bit of exp
[1:23:08] PacManMVC: to do some anviling in the outer end
[1:23:16] PacManMVC: and then grab the rest so it's more efficient with levels
[1:23:17] fudge1: @ChaosNateDog levels are worth less exp at lower levels so anviling is less expensive in outer end
[1:23:25] StargamerXD: hello team
[1:23:27] x_shaI7ow_x: does fein get local brewery in igloo?

[1:23:43] PacManMVC: and if he doesn't get it in igloo for some reason
[1:23:44] CurtisDN_: cause you need hdwgh potions

[3:54:21] PacManMVC: @lizzys9876 just more efficient to only grab like 20 or so

[3:55:04] FlexiumNova: not even close
[3:55:08] SAMS300FOXES: @lizzys9876 it's exponential; if you pick up 30 the first time and use it all up, you'd have like 40+ picking up the remainder. If you pick it all up, you only get about 60
[3:55:27] Ethannu_: ship pls
[3:55:28] dankensteiN6: proj prot could be useful for shulkers

[3:55:42] CurtisDN_: no if you pick up 30 and use all 30 and then pick up the rest, youll still get around 60
[3:55:51] CurtisDN_: whereas if you pick it all up at once you get like 65
[3:55:56] Ethannu_: yippee
[3:56:01] AceRPx_: yeah you get like 55 minimum
