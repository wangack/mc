[7:34:46] Yakobro: @Giantwaffle looks like it's good as a magnet, especially at higher temperatures
[7:34:49] lvyEartman: it stalls the reaction is better yea
[7:34:50] Cazuchi: > Samarium is a chemical element with symbol Sm and atomic number 62. It is a moderately hard silvery metal that slowly oxidizes in air. Being a typical member of the lanthanide series, samarium usually has the oxidation state +3. @Giantwaffle

[7:35:35] DarkKnghtt58: @Giantwaffle it's used as a magnet at high temps, active component of a drug that kills cancer cells and one isotope is a strong neutron absorber
[7:35:50] tomey36: You will probably need to be able to request 64 at point lol

[7:40:46] Tetsomina: Chat, is it possible to play this pack in a way where I can automate everything to point where I hit a button and can craft whatever I wish?
[7:41:04] Brandar711: what about the wires and downgrade to at least have some on hand?   I know you need more but at least you have some ready
