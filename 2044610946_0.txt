[1:12:56] isabelcoolaf: no more squad streaming is actually completely out of touch from twitch. i get they want people to use guest star but there are benefits to squad streaming over guest star

[1:14:08] CurtisDN_: chorus flower for some reason doesnt require silk touch, i always think it does
[1:14:08] WillDaBeastPlays: it would be pretty cool if there was like an all 100% category where you need every item, mob, achievement, etc.
[1:14:10] isabelcoolaf: @lion4202 guest star is the new feature on twitch where you can stream with someone else. old squad stream was where twitch natively supported having two streams open

[1:14:33] Clawarae: Bundles would be so useful for this kind of run when you get only 1 of each item, actualy better than shulker boxes
[1:14:34] CurtisDN_: @myndzi yea popped chorus fruit
[1:14:35] AwtimalTwitch: sub 1 hour fish kill?
[1:14:36] myndzi: popped chorus fruit or whatever
[1:14:46] rickenn: Fishinge
[1:14:52] Tabspacecrafting: @SantCost Oh I forgot phantoms also gave an item lol

[1:14:59] hazemetoo: isn’t there a banner in the end cities??
[1:14:59] TheOnlySuSquatch: so how does all items work exactly? do you have to fill chests with them, have picked them up at some point, place them?
[1:15:10] spicypengin: like combine it with a bucket to get popcorn
[1:15:15] SantCost: so theoretically they could be the same length but i dont think so

[1:39:55] Klefki98: YIPPEE
[1:39:59] sh4dle: but im just autistic so who knows
[1:40:01] FlaiFlai: in general, children / teens tend to prefer more bland food, science has a couple theories as to why
[1:40:01] Novamb: progress YIPPEE
[1:40:02] the_mmx: Hai
[1:40:02] skyward_14: do you need all 2700 types of tropical fish
[1:40:03] DiaDlamonds: Hai
[1:40:04] Switchpalacecorner: i stopped drinking soda and then tried one again after ~6 months and it was disgusting
[1:40:08] Novamb: yes skyward
[1:40:08] penguinsandstuff: Hai da
[1:40:08] PacManMVC: @skyward_14 no
[1:40:09] FlaiFlai: but the fact that children prefer bland stuff is known
[1:40:09] Switchpalacecorner: like nauseatingly sweet and undrinkable

[1:41:31] FlaiFlai: @FlaiFlai woobercool it's also more than that, e.g. esp. bitter taste changes in children afaik. Children dislike bitter stuff (e.g. broccolli is a standard example), but adults tend to like it more
[1:41:34] the_mmx: normal potion, tier 2 potion x2 for splash x2 for lingering
[1:41:37] starlitfires: @pacmanmvc feel like Fein has gotten 2:1x phantoms only for ages
[1:41:42] Novamb: oh right, lingering and shit can also use extended right, so like 4 each?
[1:41:44] FlaiFlai: I now enjoy broccoli, and I can tell you that until like 20, I didn't :D
[1:41:46] CurtisDN_: I think it's like 4 of each for brewing, plus the item itself?

[2:34:27] SuperC__: i used to do that in all blocks
[2:34:42] doubleo_popo: how about mossy cobble
[2:34:46] CurtisDN_: echest is more convenient for like casual survival, or if you have like 15+ shulkers and youre strapped for inventory space or whatever
[2:34:51] Thanoscope: @the_mmx well it would need to cycle duration, splash and lingering
[2:34:52] CurtisDN_: but theyre not exactly struggling right now

[2:36:35] Novamb: gonna have to smelt so much glass but then I remember you can just buy glass
[2:36:39] FreshlyMC: potions and tipped arrows

[3:49:30] skyward_14: it makes my phone heat up and drains battery really fast
[3:49:45] lobito695: @CurtisDN_ and 1.14 destroyed the porpouse of mansions

[5:50:50] pheerg_: Worst category I've imagined
[5:50:52] UFWM: for each enchant its either 12 or 8 different brews, depending if they can be lvl2 enchants or not
[5:51:04] penguinsandstuff: nod
[5:51:07] PacManMVC: why do you keep calling them enchants

[5:52:54] xilnex: Is charged creeper skull a thing
[5:53:05] UFWM: @lobito695 you know yapping is the action of talking over and over about a specific topic for a really prolonged amount of time, without giving really valuable information of what to say. all the information exchanged while yapping can be easily said in a few words, but the yapper (person who yaps) intentionally prolongs it.
[5:53:09] nicey_y: @xilnex no
[5:53:20] penguinsandstuff: @UFWM exhibit a:
