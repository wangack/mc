[0:26:31] Daanaas: 10 hr strum ?
[0:26:46] mysts_07: 12 hr?
[0:26:48] mechoriet: PauseChamp don't forget the old patterns upstairs
[0:26:51] banshay3: where have I heard that before pepeLaugh
[0:27:26] mechoriet: KKona Brother
[0:27:29] mysts_07: need more machines for like wires and plates
[0:27:31] Twin5un: this is so dumb
[0:27:50] DemonicHell3: At least you know the solution
[0:27:53] Twin5un: it's really sad cause it makes the game much harder
[0:27:59] mechoriet: or have converters for old patterns
[0:27:59] fbritoferreira: They fixed it on the new ae2 rewrite
[0:28:06] cmmeth: dev skill issue
[0:28:08] argilrants: arent there fuzzy cards?
[0:28:37] Swocoom: there was a blip that might have reset them when the craft started
[0:28:43] kbigLiar: Pati had a brownout starting the craft
[0:28:44] fbritoferreira: Ae2 did a full rewrite and has some nice new features
[0:28:49] Morlega: They do what I think they do YEP
[0:28:59] Bilobo: Does anyone know what are the differences between regular Nomi on FTB vs GTCEu on Forge ? Is there an easier one of the 2?
[0:29:05] fbritoferreira: All we need is Greg tech to update to 1.9 😂
[0:29:09] ike2ike: ike2ike subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 46 months! Is it 2 days until you finish the pack or until you're done playing it?
[0:29:18] kbigLiar: don't chaotic cores require the rockets?
[0:29:22] bobolpwnz: Chaotic cores probably wait on chaos shards
[0:29:27] Wibit: COPIUM
[0:29:29] IronGajeel: COPIUMTRUCK delivery
[0:29:31] DemonicHell3: i'm sure pati will finish it

[0:30:07] kinglouisxvii: roger 🫡
[0:30:10] mysts_07: u broke the recipe, since took out the patterns
[0:30:13] DemonicHell3: COPIUMTRUCK going to crash donowall
[0:30:16] cmmeth: I thought your house is conencted directly to the main COPIUM line
[0:30:17] Va3lin: creative tank just for copium

[0:30:47] SmokeBaIl: What does NBT stand for?
[0:30:57] stickman_02: its chaos shards we're out of them
[0:31:04] daedmissica0: chaos shards no drones

[0:31:08] mysts_07: the draconic battery
[0:31:10] helioph0b: do you have morge chaos shards? or do you send miners
[0:31:13] jayrickson87: gretech is getting a rewrite also. it's called gregtech intergalactical
[0:31:26] mechoriet: @SmokeBaIl nbt is how a block or item is defined + the extra data it can hold like for example a drive the contents
[0:31:43] Swocoom: it stored 800
[0:31:47] Swocoom: so it has 800
[0:31:56] melenejason13: You have 800 stored though
[0:31:57] Apparentthreat: @SmokeBaIl Named Binary Tag (and what @mechoriet said)
[0:32:03] rickthe_punk: are the 128 from patie yesterday completed ?

[0:32:32] DemonicHell3: always old systems
[0:32:40] mechoriet: just yeet the upstrairs system
[0:32:44] Apparentthreat: you could give the downstairs interfaces a higher priority
[0:33:30] TechNaOkami: takes a few tries

[0:35:21] TechNaOkami: whats the diff?
[0:35:50] CoolReal: What's going on right now?
[0:36:40] daedmissica0: is alot of power
[0:36:53] Marguti: itiswatitis
[0:37:00] Morlega: It's charging so should be working
[0:37:04] DemonicHell3: it's working
[0:37:07] maccabeus: skill issue, most likely
[0:37:09] Morlega: It being out of power is another issue YEP
[0:37:11] DewSpray: ran out of power. rip
[0:37:14] xSascha1337: Maybe
[0:37:20] TheIrishGuy: power cable bandwidth
[0:37:28] ImposterArchitect: Power issue?
[0:37:34] PureSpider: skill issue?
[0:37:36] Allmostdone: Check the power krunk
[0:37:39] Cooper_XX: ye i think not enough power in the lines
[0:37:41] DemonicHell3: you do need more power over there
[0:37:45] Morlega: Check that you didn't accidentally disconnect it LUL
[0:37:56] imTymp: need moar power
[0:37:57] IronGajeel: slap another creative just for those?
[0:37:59] Bagz_69: common out of orb? more pylons
[0:38:08] ピッザダディ: Morning chat, Morning waffle waffleWave
[0:38:10] Morlega: Conduits have an internal buffer
[0:38:11] BMYGRLFRND: I think DaddyDiddy said something about not having enough power transfer for that many fusion crafters in his playthrough
[0:38:19] sevn7th: need more powa
[0:38:20] stickman_02: place a creative cube near this system
[0:38:29] fortheloot: buffer in the conduit runs out that's why it stops
[0:38:29] M4nnix: low RF/t? MiniK
[0:38:31] deadgolfer: need more connections to the orb
[0:38:31] ImposterArchitect: buffers run out at a certain point?
[0:38:32] aundros: yeah, def need more creative energy sources
[0:38:36] mrleonehart: @Giantwaffle Remember those require about 100mil RF to charge to full. It just takes time
[0:38:42] Cooper_XX: think its only charging one by one cause not enough power incoming
[0:38:43] aundros: You need more
[0:38:50] Marguti: moh pawa
[0:38:53] DewSpray: the initial speed is from the power from the pieces around it, but the reserve runs out and then goes to the transfer speed of the cables
[0:38:56] ImposterArchitect: Need more power
[0:38:57] Morlega: Your orb output isn't high enough
[0:38:59] banshay3: that charge looks like an exponential curve
[0:39:04] Allmostdone: Turn off one and see if thing start working
[0:39:11] mrleonehart: @Giantwaffle You are limited by the power carry limit of the conduits
[0:39:11] Moobot: Come join the Waffle House Discord! <# https://discord.gg/fhGFtMuzdS
[0:39:15] BlueEnvyNation: bandwith? creative with one side for each tower?
[0:39:17] Cooper_XX: cables can´t keep up yes
[0:39:21] Morlega: It first goes quickly because the conduits have an internal buffer, but the orb output can't keep up so it slows down
[0:39:26] Dvaina: One infuser doesn't get enough power
[0:39:39] bubblebrainer: the wireless draconic crystals can do 2b rf/t can't they?
[0:40:00] CurbSerpent: do you need more cables from the powers source or is one cable enough?

[0:41:22] Advecti0n: Better get used to AUTOSAR
[0:41:45] jdog0616: GENIUS
[0:41:45] jmm548: seems to be faster
[0:41:46] imTymp: sped it up yea
[0:41:53] melenejason13: Is the ball still gaining?
[0:41:53] deadgolfer: add more yet?
[0:42:17] Morlega: You could use Wireless Energy Crystals to speed it up. You only need like 2 draconic relays to get from the orb to here
[0:42:19] rickthe_punk: build additional pylon
[0:42:23] Allmostdone: Or get more solar panels
[0:42:36] mrleonehart: Some crafted
[0:42:39] mysts_07: tick accel pylon Kappa
[0:42:41] jay7tx: 121
[0:42:44] ninopanda: is the static fire scheduled for tomorrow with spaceX?
[0:42:46] mrleonehart: Some crafted since last time
[0:42:48] Morlega: There was red
[0:42:52] Swocoom: they are packaged
[0:42:56] imTymp: missing 1 it said lol
[0:42:56] jmm548: sopme deleted whne u canceld it ?
[0:42:56] mrleonehart: @Giantwaffle Some crafted
[0:42:57] TheRealGamingFire: what does 2 days remain mean?
[0:43:06] Swocoom: stuck in a package somewhere

[0:43:22] imTymp: @joe_romania 5 year sub badge
[0:43:23] jay7tx: you’ve crafted 7 @giantwaffle
[0:43:25] Redswampfox: It's how you fuel a Flux Capacitor
[0:43:27] DemonicHell3: those were on that one crafter you broke
[0:43:31] LurkerNr5: maybe only in the old system?
[0:43:32] melenejason13: it crafted 3
[0:43:42] ImposterArchitect: missing crafting card?
[0:43:47] xrokic: up
[0:43:51] rickthe_punk: upstaire?
[0:43:52] DemonicHell3: @Giantwaffle it was on the crafter you disconnected up top
[0:43:53] Morlega: Still in the packager?
[0:43:54] Superswag3211: Up
[0:43:56] maccabeus: devCheck
[0:43:58] Morlega: Packagers have a buffer
[0:44:00] Swocoom: in the packager
[0:44:21] jay7tx: you already crafted 7 infinity cores
[0:44:28] Swocoom: stored as a package
[0:44:38] DemonicHell3: now it will work
[0:44:40] Swocoom: look in the ME system for package
[0:45:02] Swocoom: you can shift right click to open them
[0:45:06] Swocoom: yes
[0:45:09] Morlega: Just drop those in the unpackager of the right tier
[0:45:12] jay7tx: craft 121 cores not 128 @giantwaffle
[0:45:20] mechoriet: well the recipe is in there
[0:45:21] Torgi: your rich, but didn't know it^^
[0:45:27] Morlega: Well if the recipe is complete
[0:45:33] Swocoom: shift right click
[0:45:37] magnus_tottrup: shift right click
[0:45:45] magnus_tottrup: in hand
[0:45:47] mechoriet: in hand probbly
[0:45:57] TarMonA: did the craft finished??
[0:46:06] mechoriet: Pog goals

[0:46:08] Swocoom: yes
[0:46:09] mechoriet: YEP
[0:46:11] PureSpider: yes

[0:46:18] Twin5un: Free loot ! POGGIES
[0:46:18] mrleonehart: Kappa rich
[0:46:31] mechoriet: loot boxes Pog
[0:46:35] Morlega: I don't think crafts that got cancelled, but that were queued up in the unpackager when someone broke it
[0:46:36] snurre: it's christmas!
[0:46:43] Tapeman83: I had the same problem KEKW
[0:46:45] Allmostdone: Think of all the times you canceled
[0:46:56] mechoriet: yeah all results from a craft get put on drives
[0:47:05] TechNaOkami: it made 2 right off the batt because of that lol
[0:47:06] mechoriet: if canceled
[0:47:07] Experiment_B: did it make the first 128 last night or no
[0:47:18] PureSpider: nbt bug :D

[0:47:29] 0x4273: @Dibbsu moon2M
[0:47:35] mechoriet: YEP 1b is scuffed
[0:47:38] PureSpider: 1b means big pattern, right?
[0:47:41] DemonicHell3: time to fix it
[0:47:51] Morlega: NBT issue YEP
[0:47:51] BrickDickJr: @Giantwaffle cant you just remake the patterns?
[0:47:51] PureSpider: ah no 1b is from before update?
[0:47:59] PureSpider: yea
[0:48:23] Morlega: They probably upgraded from byte to int to allow patterns that use over 256 of an ingredient/output
[0:48:23] Allmostdone: He has remade them but he hasn’t replaced them all
[0:48:34] PureSpider: @Morlega this
[0:49:02] Dibbsu: What is QA ItIsWhatItIs
[0:49:03] Morlega: It doesn't break if you don't update pepeLaugh
[0:49:05] ThatOnneGuy: just fix it, you're losing 1/4 of the production by disabling it
[0:49:07] DemonicHell3: Do the other ones have the other tiers of solars?
[0:49:11] Morlega: or if you started on 1.5 to begin with

[0:49:54] Morlega: I think it just prioritizes the interface that got placed first, which most likely has the old pattern
[0:49:56] Allmostdone: Byte smaller than the integer
[0:49:57] BMYGRLFRND: ME is too strict about NBT data, apparently
[0:49:58] DemonicHell3: and bricked inc
[0:50:13] SailorWS: gachiBASS clicking
[0:50:15] stormzwest: it crafted some catalysts
[0:50:20] stormzwest: you dont need 128 anymore
[0:50:45] Morlega: Well I don't think AE2 explicitly sorts them on when they got placed, but I imagine that's just programmatically how it turns out
[0:51:06] Morlega: First added to the network, earlier in an array/list that gets checked when looking for the recipe
[0:51:07] DemonicHell3: @Giantwaffle try to craft the solars it needs
[0:51:10] philipkatis: philipkatis subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 28 months, currently on a 28 month streak! popCat
[0:51:11] DemonicHell3: no recipe
[0:51:16] mechoriet: no pattern KEKW
[0:51:17] LurkerNr5: do you still have a recipe for draconic solar panels?
[0:51:19] FinnYellowbelly: you took it out
[0:51:24] Marguti: LUL
[0:51:24] ImposterArchitect: you just took it out
[0:51:25] ThatOnneGuy: you just deleted it..
[0:51:27] Marguti: KEKW
[0:51:27] Morlega: KEKW
[0:51:29] mechoriet: you took it out KEKW
[0:51:32] deandosss: You took it out lmao
[0:51:36] ThatOnneGuy: Did I not say just fix it? KEKW
[0:51:39] Dagmoo: you need to remake all those recipes
[0:51:48] DemonicHell3: I was trying to say that lol but chat wanted to be like it's all the packages
[0:52:05] TarMonA: stuck in a machine
[0:52:28] BMYGRLFRND: @Morlega that can't be it, because when you change the recipe to another interface it prioritizes the new one. So it seems like it just prefers '1b' over '1'
[0:52:29] mechoriet: PauseChamp can it run on the lower tiers
[0:52:45] dewchaz115: Some of those interfaces are missing recipes
[0:52:57] Zunderz: btw you could name the interfaces and access them from the terminal, but you need to redo them all, dont know if its worthed now
[0:52:59] mechoriet: Pog legacy systems
[0:53:00] Morlega: @Morlega If you move the old recipe to a very new interface, that still checks out
[0:53:00] Allmostdone: I thought there was an interface that you could use a single card and it would be sent to the correct location
[0:53:02] Bagz_69: can it run on all the panel levels?
[0:53:16] DemonicHell3: could reconnect the one up stairs now and use that for extra crafting or move the chaotic crafters down. otherwise it's a waste
[0:53:21] matori666: chaotic cores are only int he accelerated towers
[0:53:35] mechoriet: no can all the crafters run the panel craft, he meant probbly
[0:53:39] LurkerNr5: bring capacity cards?
[0:53:47] maccabeus: popCat
[0:53:51] meller127: Hmmm i wonder if this is the problem why my alloy smelters wont craft in parrallel
[0:54:00] deepsens3: so what is the main point to do on this mod? in a standart mod is to beat dragon? @Giantwaffle
[0:54:01] LurkerNr5: yeah those :)
[0:54:02] TuxLafitte: Modpack will be finished in 1.5 days... danCopium\
[0:54:06] TuxLafitte: danCopium
[0:54:15] BMYGRLFRND: @Morlega I think I understand what you mean now, but either way, when you remove the recipe to change it to another interface it must remove it from the internal list, so the next call to that list would have the good recipe first
[0:54:33] SailorWS: chat theres something dead in my kitchen and I cant find it Madge
[0:54:37] SailorWS: it smells like death
[0:54:46] deepsens3: @SailorWS  your soul Kappa :P :D
[0:54:55] maccabeus: it's probably your sink drain
[0:54:58] mechoriet: @SailorWS susHmm
[0:55:00] SailorWS: its not the drain
[0:55:02] IronGajeel: @SailorWS waffle hopes to finish this pack
[0:55:04] ninopanda: @SailorWS fire usually takes care of that Kappa
[0:55:07] Morlega: @Morlega Oh I didn't mean there's a big list of recipes. I meant there's a list of interfaces it checks in order. So the first placed interface will always be checked first, regardless if it has the oldest or the newest patterns
[0:55:09] emnitthy: Have u checked the dish washer filter ?
[0:55:14] matori666: what Panda said
[0:55:26] TechNaOkami: not the last one
[0:55:26] Moobot: You can find Waffle's Youtube channel here - https://youtube.com/giantwaffle
[0:55:26] imTymp: sometimes u just gotta buff out the kinks so it can work flawlessly
[0:55:31] Morlega: @Morlega i.e. the algorithm is something like "go through each interface, then go through each pattern in that interface"
[0:55:32] Blockmann317: So how we feeling about completion?
[0:55:41] Purple_haze12: @SailorWS  check under your oven
[0:56:00] TechNaOkami: 20 SEC LOL
[0:56:07] DemonicHell3: @Giantwaffle reconnect the one up top and add patterns to it since it's chaotic crafters.
[0:56:14] LastSajin: Woah. On time? lol
[0:56:27] BuLLeT_LV: Is this actually second deadline? :D
[0:56:42] Purple_haze12: Purple_haze12 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 14 months! 
[0:56:47] officialhunterx: the infinity cat
[0:56:48] imTymp: remember when his goal was finish before new years KEKW
[0:56:59] kbigLiar: the catalyst has so many crafts in all the molecular assemblers?
[0:56:59] Swocoom: some of the catalyst completed - so it needs a ton of mats
[0:57:13] TarMonA: machine being flooded
[0:57:13] Morlega: Probably tower in use yeah
[0:57:20] Morlega: although still sus
[0:57:23] meller127: its waiting on your mega craft
[0:57:25] BMYGRLFRND: @Morlega but then, if you put the new recipe in the first interface it should also call the rest of the interfaces that share the same NBT, and that is in fact, the issue. That doesn't happen
[0:57:25] Rollingx: did Waffle estimate his time for the playthrough with the estimation of time from ME system ? Lul
[0:57:31] officialhunterx: did the 128 of them finish last night

[0:58:16] ImTheDummy: Waffle did you have a person you watch complete this or you doing this all with no guidance?
[0:58:25] Morlega: @Morlega Fair. Maybe it did cache the recipes in some internal list, haven't checked. And I imagine that list would get reloaded on server restart anyway (as little as that happens here)
[0:58:36] fraenklyn: @Giantwaffle you could make more small cpus to use all the coprocessors of the big cpu

[0:59:37] TheMatchyman: can we tick accelerate the package crafters?
[0:59:40] Nexhunter: needs more draconic injectors YEP
[0:59:41] Tapeman83: It used to be so much worse cause there were none of the end-game multiblocks

[1:01:29] Bernd135: Just build more packagers so it can packege faster as packergers are like molecular assemblers

[1:06:42] DecoyOcelot: you got creatve rf right?
[1:06:43] JoyToyJay: @Giantwaffle out of curiosity..  what level of PC is required to play MC this juiced up? LIke, is this as CPU intensive as I imagine it is? or is it not that different from regular MC?
[1:06:49] Cooper_XX: think the tower is not running at full speed cause of power
[1:06:53] Morlega: I'm pretty sure you crafted some, I've seen them in ME on Pati's stream monkaHmm

[1:08:52] Dagmoo: saved Clap @lastsajin
[1:08:54] jdog0616: @JoyToyJay waffle mentioned previous that this server is running 12gb memory but a beefy CPU that has crazy amount of L2 and L3 cache,  idk what one exactly but with how MC is coded you need more single thread power than you need multiple cores
[1:09:17] LastSajin: @Dagmoo ALOO
[1:09:41] Opsidill: Why only one at a time though?
[1:10:28] Opsidill: Can you craft multiple field generators at a time in one machine?
[1:10:37] brenner1265: Do the machines all have the correct fluids for the crafts?
[1:10:44] Morlega: @JoyToyJay Yeah. Dual-core CPU at 3 GHz is better than octa-core at 2.4 GHz (although a 12th gen 2.4Ghz is prob a ton faster than a 7th gen 3 Ghz or whatever for example)

[1:12:12] kbigLiar: I'm guessing pump and motor look too close
[1:12:17] ThatOnneGuy: Why not just fix them or remove the 1b recipes so if you do need it in the future you're forced to fix it

[1:15:25] SebastiaanO: place the controller and use the terminal ipad thingy to finish it in one go
[1:15:31] Morlega: Copy gadget prob can't copy the controller and busses/hatches, but the casing/glass should be fine?

[1:23:40] frainsbreeze: the important question now is are we getting a 24h stream today? :)

[1:29:04] Protonmat: blocking mode ?
[1:29:12] SebastiaanO: it doesn't need crafting cards

[1:32:00] Tiggaboo: throw another hatch to see how much faster it would be?
[1:32:01] maimvice13: @Giantwaffle i know i need glass the appointment is set for may
[1:32:08] TrickyHi: I'm converted now
[1:32:21] PureSpider: waffle can you accelerate the multiverses?
[1:32:21] Moobot: New here? Welcome! You can usually catch Waffle Mon-Sat at ~1400 UTC. Feel free to hang out in chat before the stream and/or join the !discord. waffleEgg | Use !thisweek for any changes.
[1:32:26] Morlega: Crafting 4 at a time NODDERS
[1:32:39] Morlega: Yeah it pre-loads the ingredients since the input busses are "empty" during craft
[1:32:46] Littleme02: sounds like you need 6 more
[1:32:54] Morlega: i.e. microverse empties the bus when it starts, so ME thinks it's ready for another craft YEP
[1:33:05] deadgolfer: pre-craft stuff for the next batch
[1:33:11] SebastiaanO: try adding another energy hatch
[1:33:25] akaCube: Add more pylons as well to prevent throughput bottlenecks
[1:33:27] Gotizie: Or like the length to fill the Draconic Core as an example
[1:33:39] kbigLiar: you probably need to launch another 2k t7s and t8s
[1:33:46] Morlega: PauseChamp
[1:33:51] DemonicHell3: nope you broke it

[1:35:19] tomey36: There is still one casing being made in the assembler upstairs. Needed for the catalyst
[1:35:23] Littleme02: it looks cool
[1:35:32] DemonicHell3: I'm just entertained at the fact that you have a set of chaotic crafters sitting idle now doing nothing

[1:36:36] fleur_k: itiswhatitis
[1:36:43] Morlega: Might as well just queue 128 catalysts? (or as much as your 2nd biggest CPU can handle)

[1:37:34] Morlega: The tick accelerated crafters can go through these very quickly
[1:37:35] Littleme02: the timer there might actually be kinda correct since its only one thing crafting
[1:37:41] Morlega: The charging for these is nearly instant
[1:37:44] deadgolfer: more powah
[1:37:53] Alamose: fusion crafting is nearly instant if you shove enough power into it

[1:43:34] 1killersquirrel: 6 PM here, finished work, Waffle is online finishing the pack, this is a good day Chat

[1:45:07] Hurtwolf: what happened to the team that was on the server t oo
[1:45:12] jdog0616: if the conduit has a buffer is there through put limit?
[1:45:16] Minelmonia: there are 3 ones idling on Patis machine
[1:45:33] GummiKu: wouldn't you have to tick accelerate the power input blocks?
[1:45:36] xKaldra: you can steal some from grains of infinity one
[1:45:41] brom321: maybe more energy conduits into the injectors?
[1:45:45] jdog0616: just download more
[1:45:55] maimvice13: if it is empty then it puts noting out than the max in
[1:46:18] rickthe_punk: @Giantwaffle looking back what would who change if you had to reddo this modpack
[1:46:23] BMYGRLFRND: be careful making that many endgame things, it might consume materials you need for the catalysts
[1:46:51] alozaur88: on the first day there was trouble getting one stack of gold. now you consume raw materials in the millions

[2:25:07] DX_Plates: @xFroze0 The CPU isn't doing the craft, it is asking another machine to do the crafts.  I don't think acceling the CPU will do anything.
[2:25:08] officialhunterx: its fine
[2:25:09] mrleonehart: Power?
[2:25:11] usernameNull: more coprocessors allows more things to craft at the same time in one pattern

[2:38:54] SailorWS: zoom in
[2:38:59] Ghandus: legos
[2:39:04] SailorWS: ENHANCE
[2:39:06] DX_Plates: Trees on my spaceship
[2:39:13] hisdue: hydroponics PauseChamp
[2:39:18] Domnonos: kinda looks like lego
[2:39:19] daedmissica0: i think the tree with them
[2:39:23] Hurtwolf: looks cool!
[2:39:32] Wazepas: a beach in space PogChamp
[2:39:33] orangecreamsicle3: SailorWS So I grinded DSC for 24 hours straight Sadge and no eyes
[2:39:38] Littleme02: I wonder if assemblies will be better implemented
[2:39:39] DX_Plates: ENHANCE
[2:39:42] daedmissica0: make it bigger
[2:39:42] Hurtwolf: the mon
[2:39:44] Littleme02: since they placed multiple
[2:39:50] daedmissica0: is got ladders
[2:39:51] Ghandus: i have a feeling ksp2 will be the same experience as cp2077 regarding the hype and living up to it
[2:39:52] SailorWS: DX_Plates Madge my joke
[2:40:00] Hurtwolf: open the image in another tab
[2:40:00] PureSpider: rayleigh scattering?
[2:40:04] PureSpider: aka atmospheric interference?
[2:40:12] Morlega: If you can't tell, maybe zoom in YEP
[2:40:13] PureSpider: yea
[2:40:13] inforv: Have we seen game footage of KSP2?
[2:40:22] DX_Plates: @SailorWS CSI did it long before you did young padawan
[2:40:24] hisdue: peeposLost
[2:40:35] Littleme02: Shaderssss
[2:40:45] Ghandus: did you watch sebastians new video @Giantwaffle ?
[2:40:45] PureSpider: rayleigh scattering is when light gets bounced a bunch on tiny particles
[2:40:46] cmmeth: peeposLost
[2:40:52] VikashPindoria: Waffle tick accelerate that crafter really quickly
[2:40:54] Boston_Mass: chat, is there any changes to the pack that Waffle made or is it just the GTCEu Port?
[2:41:03] PureSpider: @Boston_Mass no changes
[2:41:06] Provision_: @ghandus why? ksp1 already good why would 2 be cp2077 level? that just trying to be negstive for nothing LUL
[2:41:11] Boston_Mass: @PureSpider thanks :)
[2:41:22] Morlega: It's not for this recipe is it?
[2:41:29] Morlega: oh there it is
[2:41:29] Moobot: Come join the Waffle House Discord! <# https://discord.gg/fhGFtMuzdS
[2:41:30] inforv: Did launch get moved for tomorrow?
[2:41:32] sbcsnipe: Fourth row, second from the right
[2:41:38] DX_Plates: @Provision_ Cause its a cash grab instead of a passion project...
[2:41:38] lvyEartman: Did the modmakers from ME ever foreseen that this crafting was possible?
[2:41:43] Boston_Mass: @PureSpider do you know why everyone seems to recommend the CEU port/fork rather than original?
[2:41:55] thethurst_: top
[2:41:57] maimvice13: and try tick accel them
[2:42:04] Ghandus: @Provision_ because almost nothing of what they advertised ksp2 with will be in the early access. it will be the same early access gameplay experience as ksp1 (except the novelty fact) and that is not worth 50€ in my opinion
[2:42:24] Battal10n: make flowers for the thrusters as well
[2:42:28] tomey36: Iron thrusters were slow too
[2:42:39] Morlega: NBT issue Despairge
[2:42:39] PureSpider: Boston_Mass more up to date
[2:42:51] rektumtv: how do you mount a battery to my GT terminal anyone remember?
[2:42:56] maimvice13: make mor cpus befor restart
[2:42:56] Morlega: @Giantwaffle if the pattern was the same, they should've already been running pretty sure Despairge
[2:43:01] matori666: and for the redstone coils maybe? or are they assembler
[2:43:03] akaCube: old original recipe? monkaS

[2:43:22] maimvice13: and make more cpus
[2:43:24] Allmostdone: Stuck in packaging
[2:43:25] Littleme02: probably not
[2:43:25] GrumpyEngineer: you are fine
[2:43:26] TippletonJohn: I think Pati cancelled it at one point last night and it was okay.
[2:43:26] VikashPindoria: Send ittttt

[2:44:19] Mandorake: @Giantwaffle it'll just be sleet dont worry
[2:44:22] Boston_Mass: its raining in New Braunfels
[2:44:23] R1Rider01: TX doesn't get snow...we get ICE
[2:44:36] Allmostdone: Oh no snow in Texas? Call the national guard
[2:44:37] Troupster: here in California we've become Washington, nothing but rain
[2:44:43] Sreolla: Sounds fun, about 6 inches snow today in ontario
[2:44:48] yellowspy: I said that half an hour ago waffleHands
[2:44:48] maimvice13: you have free cpu's
[2:44:52] Mandorake: @Allmostdone not funny some of us are going to freeze
[2:45:05] daedmissica0: watch the tom scott  5 min video
[2:45:11] DX_Plates: @Troupster Imagine complaining about rain in drought ridden CA
[2:45:14] pinhead_larynx: one of two things happens when theres a "chance of sleet" in texas. either nothing happens or its way worse than we were told it was gonna be
[2:45:18] Allmostdone: @mandorake How are you gonna freeze?
[2:45:19] Vapp3: I really tried to start this pack but I really can't manage crafting all the things without autocrafting in AE2
[2:45:31] Littleme02: make more cpus?
[2:45:38] Dagmoo: @troupster except i think most places will still be happy to have some more with a few exceptions on the central coast
[2:45:38] Vapp3: Like plates, screws, circuits and everyithng so annoying to craft manually
[2:45:40] LurkerNr5: there was a cpu free
[2:45:48] maimvice13: you have free cpu's
[2:45:51] IAmJester: The air seems to be made of air.
[2:45:52] matori666: you do have some free
[2:46:01] coolbots7: I really want to make a custom dashboard for the automated crafting statistics
[2:46:09] Littleme02: is the liquid normal?=
[2:46:14] Frankenstain: Aren't you going to focus on creative storage first to speed up crafting the last few items?
[2:46:15] Littleme02: or in the assembler
[2:46:16] PureSpider: @coolbots7 that'd be amazing
[2:46:16] Twin5un: free time ? what !
[2:46:18] zyxep: Is Pati feeling better today?
[2:46:30] DarkKnghtt58: It was titanium, not trinium
[2:46:41] DarkKnghtt58: for the liquid
[2:46:52] maimvice13: @Giantwaffle you have some free cpu's 5 min ago
[2:47:00] SebastiaanO: it's burger monday
[2:47:14] aundros: looks like it
[2:47:18] MagnesiumOxide: that one has multiple triniums that you could replace
[2:48:07] stickman_02: We know
[2:48:58] upgradecarton: boots and pants and boots and pants
[2:48:59] lvyEartman: and the chestpiece?
[2:49:16] G_stav: If I could do one thing on this world it would be to rename ass line to buttcrack.

[2:49:40] Moobot: You can sub to Waffle by clicking this neat link -> twitch.tv/giantwaffle/subscribe SUBprise
[2:49:52] CyberrPickle: @upgradecarton  AlienDance
[2:49:58] 1killersquirrel: Waffle wouldn't be a great idea right now to make a few more Molecular Assembler+Interface towers and spread the recipies around those as well, so everything works faster?
[2:50:06] Bj4rk3: How do you add the battery to the terminal? To use the recipe chart?
[2:50:35] 1killersquirrel: I know you made the flowers for the high intensity crafts but what about the others that need to wait for one another
[2:50:36] kane1941: diamond you can just do manually
[2:50:54] Twin5un: that reminds me of a clip LUL
[2:51:35] Littleme02: just make a stack
[2:51:50] stormzwest: do a set for pati?
[2:51:53] PureSpider: "we need two, let's make a stack" YEP
[2:52:13] mr_funkylicious: Ci doesnt get a set, sadge

[2:53:21] aundros: yeah, thats probably smart
[2:53:22] TippletonJohn: I like it.
[2:53:54] SailorWS: chat, what D&D race should by College of Lore Bard be thats a hardcore nerd. Hes going to have low AF Charisma and be an ACHTUALLY mofo
[2:53:55] Larklen: can it only craft 1 thruster at a time?
[2:53:57] coolbots7: wow, I am out of touch with current hardcore modded cause I have no idea what either of those are
[2:54:12] Dagmoo: @coolbots7 for a long time through DML. Deep Mob Learning which is like a virtual mob grinder
[2:54:15] MagnesiumOxide: on the plus side, 6 minutes have passed since the craft was started!
[2:54:16] SmokeBaIl: The thruster makes 1/tick, it take a shit ton of time wow
[2:54:47] aundros: Wouldn't more co-processors help crafting faster? A lot of them are schedules
[2:54:49] coolbots7: interesting, thanks
[2:54:50] pinhead_larynx: nooooo its 6 minutes
[2:54:53] Anarkilore: vacation in danger!
[2:54:55] DareDeFlug: It's pretty good
[2:55:02] DecoyOcelot: could you add mutiple thruster patterns in?
[2:55:08] MagnesiumOxide: crafting cpus are available, you might be able to make more cpus
[2:55:14] stickman_02: 256 exact
[2:55:14] SmokeBaIl: Its like 265 co
[2:55:15] FishhNado: isnt it 256
[2:55:17] Cyberwire69: full chunk 256?
[2:55:17] P00nDozer69: I think you have some free CPUs to make more CPUs
[2:55:18] MisterRabbitHead: 256 iirc
[2:55:20] Frankenstain: Increase storage in case you need to cancel the craft?
[2:55:24] Morlega: @aundros Scheduled can also mean 1) waiting for ingredients to be crafted 2) waiting for machines to be free

[2:58:13] Dagmoo: yeah make mulitple more cutting machines
[2:58:15] DaddyDiddy: morning Waffle
[2:58:15] MagnesiumOxide: on the bright side, that means it has already cut 2.7m ram, so that's pretty fast
[2:58:16] nAZAr1uS: you could do side by side multiblocks to use both via the same interface, no?

[3:01:50] PureSpider: @silentassassin185 no
[3:01:55] deadgolfer: by the time you finish it, the recipe will be done
[3:02:03] Morlega: You don't need to dedicate a new cutter to bolts. Just having more multi-purpose cutters helps already
[3:02:09] mrleonehart: You are only making 2 cuppernickle wire per tick @Giantwaffle
[3:02:58] SebastiaanO: i got soggy fries with my order and i'm kinda pissed off

[3:03:11] TheShaddo13: @caldin06 yes he did
[3:03:11] sorairodays_: sadJAM
[3:03:25] lvyEartman: since it goes 1 type of item at a time, it would prob be more efficient to do multiple batches
[3:03:32] Nilau: Nilau subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 33 months! Sus amogus when the greg is the imposter
[3:03:33] Morlega: I like channels YEP

[3:03:41] caldin06: @Giantwaffle Soaryn LOVES those AE channels :P
[3:03:46] hungryish: I like channels, but probably not for apack like this.
[3:03:47] DaddyDiddy: channels are ungreg
[3:03:48] AbyssDepth: its off by default in nomi too
[3:03:48] DragonApoc: Wait you have to turn it off? It’s not off by default?
[3:03:48] pinhead_larynx: you didnt put the parallel thing down lol
[3:03:52] coolbots7: I thinks it's an interesting constraint, adds a networking aspect
[3:04:00] Morlega: I also love ME subnets and P2P tunnels though LUL
[3:04:05] Cyberwire69: didnt place parallel
[3:04:07] Swingeing_Folk: making billions of me controllers Despairge
[3:04:22] PureSpider: good old SSD :D
[3:04:26] AlfredTheSalmon: im playing an expert pack and already have used over 100 p2p, already told myself it's the last time im dealing with channels
[3:04:28] KiloJoel: p2p network is a nice thing
[3:04:36] Bleu_Forge: It's solving a problem that didn't need to exist ItIsWhatItIs
[3:04:37] KiloJoel: that deals with the channels
[3:04:39] orangecreamsicle3: @hungryish HUH
[3:04:48] itsjusttriz: yea SSD was easy to figure out, but P2P isnt for me. I wish the SSD worked for autocrafts etc
[3:04:52] coolbots7: although I've been learning towards refined storage because I got sick of AEs early game
[3:04:59] DecoyOcelot: i think its hollow on the left side too
[3:05:07] Nilau: AE2 was programmed with the idea of using channels, its therefore more efficient with its calculations if you properly use channels. Becomes important in super lategame GTNH with the mega bases
[3:05:08] aundros: ^
[3:05:14] Morlega: My main "issue" with AE2 is that in "vanilla" modded you need to go meteor hunting KEKW
[3:05:25] TippletonJohn: 256
[3:05:29] inforv: Did they disable the saws bloom?

[3:50:39] Kuroiorb: eh not super worried @PureSpider
[3:50:49] PureSpider: Kuroiorb probably fine anyway, yea

[3:55:39] 1killersquirrel: Should also increase the amount of liquid the Crative Tank gives to the Mixer, looked slow

[3:56:25] frainsbreeze: 135 catalysts POG
[3:56:29] Allmostdone: nice chart BTW
[3:56:43] Morlega: If the NBT is right, the assembly line should immediately start
[3:57:06] Morlega: I mean you can quickly do the stack test if you want to be sure
[3:57:37] Morlega: If it doesn't have the limits, the Item Interface will have items while the assembly line is still off

[3:58:38] Morlega: Blocking mode? monkaHmm
[3:58:41] Mr_Warsta: The last Python package that we need updated so now we can move to Python version 3.11.1!!
[3:58:51] Mr_Warsta: In prod
[3:58:56] Morlega: It shouldn't be crafting 60 at a time with only 8 lines
[3:59:04] Morlega: It should only say crafting 16
[3:59:35] Morlega: That's what transpilers like Babel are for
[3:59:40] aundros: Why mobile?
[3:59:40] officialzip: It would be your server not their client
[3:59:41] stormzwest: wtf is that identation
[3:59:42] MagnesiumOxide: Well that's why you have transpilers and minifiers
[3:59:43] PureSpider: you can transpile
[3:59:50] Morlega: There are sites to get the percentages. It's probably like 95%
[3:59:51] PureSpider: just transpile down to whatever
[3:59:53] snurre: what you write shouldn't be what is served to clients
[3:59:54] 0sem0: use Babel :)
[3:59:57] Morlega: Yeah caniuse com
[3:59:59] DemonsDawn: whats an update
[3:59:59] nAZAr1uS: feels like a personal problem to me...
[4:00:01] zero3juan: you need to transpile for older versions
[4:00:02] PureSpider: yea as always, caniuse
[4:00:11] Noblez_: You can transpile using Babel or SWC or something
[4:00:13] plattnotpratt: JS Number Formater
[4:00:16] SimonSez: Can't you set a minimum SDK level and compile for that?
[4:00:23] PureSpider: never compromise workflow for target system if transpilers exist
[4:00:29] Morlega: @Giantwaffle if you're gonna transpile anyway, good excuse to try out TypeScript YEP
[4:00:35] 1StClassAlcoholic: Use ts and compile it down
[4:00:44] zero3juan: the use the flashy stuff for your dev experience
[4:00:45] PureSpider: just use babel, it's not super hard
[4:00:47] 0sem0: you can use Babel for it
[4:00:50] zero3juan: then
[4:00:54] PureSpider: or use typescript right away, yea
[4:00:55] VaultPls: deno + typescript is pretty good
[4:00:57] Noblez_: SWC is supposed to be a crazy fast transpiler

[4:01:57] Zapper_777: react?
[4:01:58] Noblez_: We still support ES5 or something, so we transpile our TS to JS ES5

[4:14:01] Llyin_: they are all about 2 bad releases from being closed
[4:14:01] PureSpider: truth
[4:14:02] aundros: Its almost like zuck just wants to live in a digital society where everything is all cozy and safe
[4:14:04] banshay3: there is no chance you can though
[4:14:09] Glacial_Indifference: They do nothing of value, so good riddance.
[4:14:11] inforv: IMO Esports are overvalued and investors are going to be pissed soon
[4:14:17] Amatean: I hope so, we gotta burn the brush to let new growth flourish
[4:14:17] Dagmoo: we can only hope they collapse
[4:14:19] snurre: silicon valley is also completely out of touch with the issues that are plaguing the rest of the world
[4:14:21] DX_Plates: Going to see? Already are
[4:14:23] VaultPls: i think it would be a cascading effect that makes it feel like a dotcom burst
[4:14:23] DatoPotatoDato: theres some companies that either try to think way too far ahead or not adapt quick enough
[4:14:33] aundros: not that elon has done much for twitter yet
[4:14:33] hiposlipo_: money money money lol ruins everything

[4:14:42] YOUCEP: the last changes made twitter worse for me
[4:14:43] flamingpaul: well from twitter's standpoint, they needed the money
[4:14:52] punkgeek: Yeah, a lot of it is regression to the mean
[4:14:54] TheRackster: I believe the exact same. A fun thing is thinking how ahead of its time VINE was. Imagine if that released today pepeLaugh
[4:14:58] Brandar711: Just wanted to stop by and sub and say hi. Been about a year since I watched you but, this Minecraft has been amazing.
[4:14:59] Atomic5_: I feel like these companies are oversized and its good that theyre downsizing
[4:14:59] SebastiaanO: imagine buying twitter, actually so fucking stupid

[4:15:02] RatsmahisboringZzz: Good thing oil and gas is still going strong.
[4:15:07] xlpants: lots of tech companies were relying too much on vc money
[4:15:17] ns0z: I mean.. If you can fire half of the employees and the company still runs fine. Something was really wrong before
[4:15:33] PuggoThuggo: im more on the hardware side of things in IT, so a little safer for now but its looking similar for the future here too.
[4:15:35] Blackdeath911: "we wont need more then 1 disclocator"
[4:15:50] thecodealive_original: i vote 3 times the size of the setup
[4:15:51] thenaylander: why choose?
[4:15:57] punkgeek: Depends on what you mean by 'runs fine'. Are you just in maintenance mode with no improvement or new features? That's pretty bad
[4:16:03] tomey36: Why not just wait and work on other stuff
[4:16:03] BaTu016: why not both :)
[4:16:05] Atomic5_: @ns0z Yeah like there were tons of employees that werent doing anything productive at all, they were just getting paid to hang out
[4:16:11] inforv: Do you think Esports is worth how ever much it’s evaluated as?
[4:16:24] SebastiaanO: upgrading would almost double the speed

[4:17:13] Tenkaichi500: NOTED i am liquidive
[4:17:15] TheWonderLlama: gamers gaming PepegaCredit
[4:17:20] VaultPls: i feel like esports teams peaked and now are on the downfall.  why they took the vc money lol
[4:17:21] TheRackster: There's a reason so many mainstream brands are bonding with big internet names. They see the money in it
[4:17:35] Provision_: @dx_plates you mean like any other job? LUL
[4:17:37] SebastiaanO: how

[4:18:02] DX_Plates: @Provision_ My job doesn't pull that bull shit
[4:18:21] PuggoThuggo: gatcha is insanely addictive, glad i was only an addict when i was a child and had no money to burn
[4:18:28] PureSpider: i've never had to work crunch before because my boss actually values us :D
[4:18:29] Flamingass: Did you already tick-accelerate the tick-accelerators?
[4:18:30] Provision_: @dx_plates well guess your job is also not paying what twitter is
[4:18:35] xKaldra: Wasn’t it a bill in a year
[4:18:37] Funken_: minecraft $10 15 years ago, that are gamer
[4:18:47] GGoodGGuy: grinder is the best :D

[4:19:22] Glacial_Indifference: Administrative overhead is why Universities have become so expensive too.
[4:19:25] 0sem0: It is not necessary
[4:19:25] primo_qwe: you fire them :)
[4:19:27] TheRackster: Too many nonsense titles given out for useless positions that could be removed

[4:19:34] mobfarmer: delagate
[4:19:38] Brandar711: I'm one of those too many managers and I agree.

[4:19:40] 0sem0: Amazon could probably be ran by 2k people

[4:19:51] mechoriet: y ?
[4:19:51] bcdmonkey: we need less managers and more mentors
[4:19:54] banshay3: can't wait for the time where the manager works for the software engineer to do the annoying paperwork
[4:19:58] mechoriet: susHmm y?
[4:20:00] Version037: Why?
[4:20:06] SimonSez: Dating apps are designed to not work. If they worked they would loose coustomers
[4:20:06] Igmatic: a lot of big tech has very specific specializations ... with hope for speed, efficiency and innovation
[4:20:06] Provision_: @dx_plates isk if you earn more rhan those at twitter. if they would pay bad they would not work under that pressure
[4:20:10] Apparentthreat: Why waffleThink
[4:20:10] DX_Plates: Provision_ Take your uninformed BS to the door chum. I turn down regular requests from The Zon and MS because I wont work that burn out lifestyle.

[4:56:30] Wetware: Don't tools get stolen all the time from construction sites though?
[4:56:35] StorableOcean04: Team Red does that too
[4:56:35] TheWonderLlama: It is supposed to keep the tools from being stolen from job sites
[4:56:37] Hemry64_: I'm sure nothing could go wrong with that KEKW
[4:56:38] Gotizie: fingerprint sensors will be next lol
[4:56:38] Docgalaad: the useless safety

[4:56:46] maccabeus: that's the only way
[4:56:50] Igmatic: Yeah, they are talking about by 2030 we will have subscription models for everything
[4:56:54] SimonSez: Open it up and bypass the chip. Problem solved
[4:56:54] iamforever27: Next, you'll have to pay a month fee to use it
[4:56:55] coolbots7: an nfc wristband would make more sense
[4:57:00] Nexhunter: KEKW BMW KEKW
[4:57:03] Littleme02: Imagine if your phone is out of power and your fucking drill wont work
[4:57:03] Docgalaad: car as a service is the future

[4:57:11] RockyMountainHiThere: it deters theft is my guess
[4:57:11] VaultPls: @Giantwaffle speaking of subscription for hardware: did you hear of intel doing that now for servers?
[4:57:13] Brakebein: yeah, fuck everything about that
[4:57:14] MaIlchad: DRM doesn't stop theft lol, it just makes the theif realize they have to throw away their goods
[4:57:14] babyaddalyn: and its not even cheaper
[4:57:16] BMYGRLFRND: whoever thought that was a good idea is so far detached from reality
[4:57:19] KnickKen: said on twitch stream KEKW
[4:57:19] Dagmoo: yeah products as subscriptions is horrible
[4:57:22] lvyEartman: stealing of tools is a big risk, because most service guys leaves them in the van
[4:57:23] EmilioHoffmann: That doesn't makes any sense, paying for something that your car already has but you can't use it
[4:57:23] Trilex: does tesla do that or mercedes ?
[4:57:25] forsc1: imagine cracking the car software KEKW
[4:57:26] melenejason13: All I see is an opportunity in the hardware cracking market KEKW
[4:57:30] Not_a_Machine: gotta jail break your car
[4:57:31] Littleme02: Or there just isn't mobile service
[4:57:32] le_Pure: everything is based on loans nowadays
[4:57:33] Generic_Gamer: My neighbor has one of those robot lawn mowers and they have GPS. That would be a good idea for tools I think. Instead of allowing access
[4:57:36] Biskit427: I miss being able to own Adobe software. Its on a monthly subscription :/
[4:57:37] Ghandus: @Littleme02 "sorry boss, can't drill the hole right now. need to charge my phone" KEKW
[4:57:40] explosion116: daily subscription to oxygen soon ;)
[4:57:40] deathfroma6ove9: dude phone battery life declining with all these bluetooth things that dont need to be bluetooth
[4:57:45] Obsidian_Vanir: Can I pay a monthly subscription to not get butt R#%$ed by corporations?
[4:57:48] calebhub514: thats the natural evolution of the publicly traded companies on the stock market, gotta force infinite growth in a finite market
[4:57:49] TheWonderLlama: This screwdriver works in drive-mode only. To remove screws please pay for the "drive mode switch" feature, only $4,99 a month
[4:57:51] gregcee: So my twitch subscription is more expensive by month
[4:57:55] SniperDude24: subscriptions allow the companies to get a lower but longer term income
[4:58:00] MaIlchad: I love bluetooth headphones that don't even have enough battery for a 6 hour stream : D
[4:58:10] Nexhunter: more importantly fuck everything involved with pantone and their plugin bullshit
[4:58:11] Nexhunter: Madge
[4:58:14] Docgalaad: Serum
[4:58:17] her0zer0: most subscriptions I immediately cancel and it lasts the rest of the period
[4:58:19] Morlega: So like leasing?
[4:58:19] Biskit427: That is nice. I wish I could do that for design software.
[4:58:20] P00nDozer69: Fusion 360 got rid of the CNC nesting tool and added it as a $2000 yearly subscription
[4:58:21] Atzgee: it's always morally right to pirate adobe sofware
[4:58:26] officialhunterx: i went to cancel my floatplane subscription to linus and i couldnt find it
[4:58:28] Allmostdone: next will be to subscribe for the safty guard on your saw
[4:58:38] Docgalaad: Serum has a very good model
[4:58:40] zero3juan: actually cheaper over time because of inflation. smart
[4:58:46] Trilex: @Atzgee i agree with you
[4:58:47] MaIlchad: Pantone seemed cool but retroactively soft-damaging people's projects is straight up criminal
[4:58:48] CyberrPickle: floatplane LuL
[4:59:03] KnickKen: stteve duda is the best
[4:59:05] xlpants: when notability went to subscription model, i was so sad
[4:59:05] Moobot: You can find Waffle's Youtube channel here - https://youtube.com/giantwaffle

[4:59:32] DragonApoc: What’s the benefit of those lasers ?
[4:59:32] Ghandus: what the heck is floatplane
[4:59:42] Trilex: fuck paying for subscription the only subscription i love is NETFLIX
[4:59:46] Nexhunter: it is like other subscription sites we don't talk about in public @officialhunterx where gotta go to central sub page instead of the creator page itself
[4:59:48] babyaddalyn: @Ghandus linus tech tips video platform
[4:59:48] SimonSez: I subscribe to 'Studio Live' a DAW. You get everything you need to make music
[4:59:50] emnitthy: Fuck Netflix too
[4:59:51] TigerLuv: It is more like let's not rip off our customers
[5:00:00] CyberrPickle: @Ghandus its like an extras/behind-the-scenes subscripttion for Linus tech tips videos, to heavily summarize it
[5:00:13] Allmostdone: rent a kidney here. Have you made you payments today?
[5:00:19] Ghandus: damn everyone and there mother now doing subscription based models
[5:00:22] geraldtgnome: @Giantwaffle  speaking of making music have a look at twitter when you have 5 mins working throiugh moog tutorials aarrgh
[5:00:22] emnitthy: Fuck all of these on demand streaming services. When there was one it was amazing.  Now there’s 15 each for 20$ a month it’s insane
[5:00:24] yepatstafoo: EVGA
[5:00:24] jdimango: 10k softrware?
[5:00:29] WhoAmIErik: what do you mean almost? Literally every decision a company makes is to make money. Thats the name of the game
[5:00:29] jdimango: for 15 a month?
[5:00:32] imTymp: subs = people spend money more easy cause its easy to auto renew and forget
[5:00:33] daedmissica0: @Giantwaffle https://twitter.com/Jaytheamazing_/status/1619826618104680448?s=20&t=plqoUArfBVsZvst8X3S2wA was Retweeted  Kerbal Space Program i want this is ksp 2

[5:00:51] explosion116: you said draconic!
[5:00:54] 0omkins: @Giantwaffle Car manufacturers are starting to do this with performance/higher end unlocks in the systems...I think Mercedes has started.
[5:01:00] Trilex: i have a Netflix sub with ads its perfect i was watching top guns last night only got 3 ads

[5:01:22] CrasH_CTB: @Trilex only 3 ads KEKW
[5:01:29] MaIlchad: @rblshockey That one makes sense because cloud storage costs money to maintain. if its local its not fair.
[5:01:56] BoskoSlo123: @Trilex ads KEKW
[5:02:34] Trilex: i dont mind good ads i hate annoying ones i want ads to be skippable for all platform just like twitch as well

[5:02:48] CrasH_CTB: I dont even know what modern ads look like.
[5:02:56] ashkii_uwu: I never played any mod like this, what's usually the end goal? Seems like a grind and a half to get there
[5:03:17] DecoyOcelot: sus
[5:03:25] PuggoThuggo: i think maybe the goal is the grind
[5:03:43] maccabeus: @Ashku the goal is the grind, these packs are all about complex automation
[5:03:49] Trilex: this pack is all about grind just GTNH
[5:04:00] thecodealive_original: Wokege  TakingNotes

[5:05:14] Apparentthreat: kuro
[5:05:18] ricdesc26: ItIsWhatItIs sounds like a good stream plan
[5:05:21] CosmicDistortions: Are crafting recipes just more extreme?
[5:05:32] Trilex: @aden_potato sounds fun time yep
[5:05:34] Flobu_: do oyu need to setup 10 injectors?
[5:05:51] MaIlchad: nerf all the recipies. require expensive resources for everything.
[5:06:03] maccabeus: @CosmicDistortions the endgame recipes are a 10x10 crafting table where every ingredient is a multi-step manufactured item
[5:06:07] thecodealive_original: PETTHESCHNOZER  wafflePTS
[5:06:19] Komradkrunch97: Komradkrunch97 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 41 months!

[5:07:28] OtonP: So what you saying is... pati carried this run? KEKW
[5:07:29] 1killersquirrel: I'm at MV right now, going into making fluids, OMG this shit is complicated
[5:07:31] SailorWS: yes it will
[5:07:36] TuxLafitte: But Draconic stuff, especially latter tiers takes a LOT of power.
[5:07:37] Trilex: @Salerodis that what i heard too

[5:08:52] thecodealive_original: waffleAwkward  JuiceTime
[5:09:00] Flobu_: how does it know what to put in the middle?
[5:09:13] MaIlchad: I don't think I could play a modpack like this without playing obsessively, it becomes a slow burner
[5:09:23] MaIlchad: that's like programming without making actual programs
[5:09:28] d3vrand0m: yeah need to take it slow, and really stick to the quests to progress
[5:09:31] Trilex: you play FTB Infinity Evolved Expert mode with Sevedus that was fun to watch Waffle
[5:09:33] SebastiaanO: SE multiplayer is goated

[5:11:00] yung_tessa: i never know whats going on in these modpacks but i love watching it anyway lol

[5:11:18] frainsbreeze: powah
[5:11:25] Snah__: SKILLISSUE
[5:11:53] Danishwiz: Does scroll wheel work for moving 1 item between inventories at a time in this modpack?
