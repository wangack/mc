[1:05:39] KrupTionn: Sadge
[1:05:39] BrewCat1215: @Venxuri Is it worth it???

[1:05:43] Denethor: D:
[1:05:43] DrWinston0Boogie: Sadge
[1:05:45] Zoinx: @Variandra Drag Reduction System - a flap in the rear wing opens up, reducing drag.
[1:05:47] RpidFrTommyGun: D:
[1:05:51] Default_Uk: @Variandra The back wing of the car can open to reduce drag which makes them faster.
[1:05:51] tommyfod: im waking up at 6am, watching from bed
[1:05:51] Vibranti: Sadge
[1:05:57] MisterRabbitHead: just make this a 24 hours stream EZ
[1:05:58] Zoinx: @Variandra making the cars go faster
[1:05:58] datSycko: its at 6am for me Sadge
[1:06:01] magenof: widepeepoSad
[1:06:03] Tensten: @SolarisFall Diffuser pulls car to the ground, but on the straights car flats out meaning airflow stops releasing car from ground and then it loops
[1:06:05] JimmyXQ: 8 am here :)
[1:06:06] Vargh: 7 am for central, I'll be up
[1:06:07] magenof: im up at 6
[1:06:09] AlphaSchnauzer: 6am is fine
[1:06:09] babyaddalyn: 7
[1:06:11] tommyfod: no offence, but i wont tune into you at 6am hahah
[1:06:11] Vargh: 8 am for qualy
[1:06:13] GFQPR1882: im down
[1:06:14] holypt: @holypt I said to someone before. it is because of the down forces. When the cars get lowwith compressed suspension, the car suddently wants to decompress the suspension making it go up and then the cycle restarts with the suspension wanting to compress and then decompresses etc. So it is like small bumpy road but at 200kmh
[1:06:15] babyaddalyn: but i will set my alarm for it
[1:06:17] smokes53: Now you know how we feel for every other race
[1:06:18] Astalavista87: 8am on eastern europe
[1:06:22] Venxuri: @SamJam1215 depends where you live, for my country the "national" broadcast is pure shit LUL so F1TV or "non offical ways" are the only way
[1:06:26] amv1: @SolarisFall the track is shitty too, thats the main reason. and car can't compensate for all these bumps
[1:06:27] Jehuty07: 7 in Max time
[1:06:37] hideeeeo: Fair Dinkum Mate  LUL

[1:07:59] imTymp: 3 is where they kept locking up in practice
[1:08:04] Vargh: this is a street circuit
[1:08:09] imTymp: in water its gonna be rough
[1:08:11] tommyfod: if you get DRS at detection 1, you keep it for activation 1 + 2??
[1:08:14] Dawgdigidy: im pretty sure its a road course, i say bike lane
[1:08:14] Vargh: it's not a permanent race track, it's in a park
[1:08:15] pjenjusac: its road
[1:08:17] Dawgdigidy: saw*
[1:08:18] G0Free: they have a bicycle lane on track pepeLaugh
[1:08:23] Invalidm_: are you playing Dayz again today waffle?
[1:08:24] Astalavista87: the OG street circuit

[1:11:43] Galline: so they completely turn a set of streets into a track for this? how much does that cost?
[1:11:49] Astalavista87: you can see MSC in 2002 ;)
[1:12:12] Tamerlain: @galline it's F1 its millions
[1:12:13] Venxuri: @Astalavista87 in 2002 cars were half the width lol
[1:12:29] Kuroiorb: !dots @CallMeRazzie

[1:15:12] Vargh: a F1 race is about 300 km total, so take that and divide by the track length in the bottom right to get the number of laps for just about any track

[2:54:18] TeaBoneTV: @Harmar ye its bad and sad some really great players careers full ruined being stuck behind some shit contract they signed as kids
[2:54:23] Tech: I doubt a union would work for streamers
[2:54:27] Chronoes: isn't that what networks do, like Nerdfusion?
[2:54:29] mrdoctorcheese: Predatory contracts WutFace
[2:54:33] meanhattermeanderer: That why the orinally made the actors guild
[2:54:35] thunderdan11: and streamers being told that they cant share their income with people
[2:54:40] trigol: So waffle is saying you should always sign the SECOND contract you get offered!
[2:54:44] Apparentthreat: wouldn't most people have to agree on the terms?
[2:54:47] Bleu_Forge: Tech spoken like a true amazon employee Susge
[2:55:02] Tabakhase: KEKW
[2:55:03] Tech: @Bleu_Forge KEKW heck
[2:55:05] Harmar: @Harmar ya, i was partnered till a few years ago the amount of stuff i saw coming to be before i had to give it up with taxes and medical it was nuts
[2:55:09] Bleu_Forge: pepeLaugh
[2:55:23] Tech: I guess I should specify, a union for streamers would benefit the streamers who can already pay into the union
[2:55:31] Tabakhase: monkaS mans gotta be carefull what he types
[2:55:33] NevaDaha: emiruS emiruT

[2:55:36] Scojan: I'm interested to see what OTK turns into in a few years
[2:55:37] daemonaedryn: c
[2:55:38] Tech: smaller streamers would opt out since dues would be a bigger proportional hit

[2:56:41] SkibbezZ: gesundheit
[2:56:41] DigitalVortex92: @Tech I think a community of people that are able to help people identify malicious contracts would work as an intermediate. People willing to eitehr volunteer, or on a per contract basis, help people analyze the contracts offered maybe?
[2:56:43] galaxy_berry: Nerd fusion reminded me of bacon donut miss that guy
[2:56:47] Salix__: Na zdrowie
[2:56:51] KnickKen: only MC stream today?
[2:57:02] daemonaedryn: straight? wafflePride
[2:57:02] RedalousTheRed: salud
[2:57:12] Tech: @DigitalVortex92 ideally there is a service that you pay for _after_ getting a better contract and after they give you the knowledge
[2:57:13] DigitalVortex92: so maybe not a union, but sort of like a CPA to help people better understand
[2:57:20] Tech: So they get a cut of a better contract.
[2:57:24] DigitalVortex92: @Tech Yeah
[2:57:24] itsIffy: fuckywucky uwu
[2:57:30] Archelonde: lucrative collect relics weekly from lost ark, 3 world tree leaves and 1 platinum fields ticket
[2:57:31] Venxuri: BattleBit Remastered?
[2:57:32] Zapper_777: builder wand? to exchange the blocks? is that gone from the mod pack?
[2:57:33] Tech: Better contracts are good for everyone because they increase prices for influencers from companies
[2:57:36] „Åù„Çå„Åß: lirik started playing and the servers started struggling OMEGALUL
[2:57:37] KingMidasNV: battlebit is awesome
[2:57:44] KingMidasNV: plays alot like battlefield
[2:57:46] Tech: Since companies will always use the lowest bidder
[2:57:53] DigitalVortex92: ALWAYS
[2:57:57] Chronoes: 20k viewers, 17k from Lirik
[2:57:58] daemonaedryn: It legitimately looks like a game already on roblox KEKW
[2:58:06] 0x4273: not hosting servers with aws Sadge
[2:58:11] KingMidasNV: i think its on Unity?
[2:58:14] EmotePerMessage: its an indie era
[2:58:16] L3g3ndA: truee.
[2:58:16] AndyHayes: as an indie dev myself yes I agree haha
[2:58:22] KingMidasNV: its like minecraft and battlefield baby
[2:58:27] Poopicus: Yeah
[2:58:29] L3g3ndA: valheim and that vampire game.
[2:58:30] DigitalVortex92: @KingMidasNV krippKEK
[2:58:34] pruffles: Valheim is also 2 years behind schedule lol
[2:58:36] Grumpage: vampire survivors? 1 dev?
[2:58:36] Myekos: Valheim originally 5 I think
[2:58:37] DigitalVortex92: Vampire Survivors
[2:58:40] theleezen: stardew
[2:58:43] Scojan: Its crazy to see how much streamer/youtube influence can make or break a game. Like Soda and Amongus
[2:58:44] daemonaedryn: Good, indies are proving to be more reliable than AAA
[2:58:47] Jakosin: phasmaphobia :)
[2:58:48] Tech: I mean it's what happens when al the other aspects are solved
[2:58:49] Cannonboot: @Giantwaffle most simple example: stardew, crazy dude done it all alone
[2:58:51] Harmar: 5 then on release hired 2 more due to popularity
[2:58:55] DoctorJpeg_: what happened to valheim
[2:58:56] L3g3ndA: yeah stardew was one guy too right?
[2:58:57] rudaaa8: hello :D
[2:59:02] „Åù„Çå„Åß: he made among us
[2:59:08] AIex_0: soda and viggy made among us

[2:59:10] DigitalVortex92: Shitshow Saturdays
[2:59:12] Honeyscope: SUSSY
[2:59:13] Tech: The real difference though between small games and big games isn't dev teams, it's support teams, safety teams, legal teams, etc
[2:59:14] Vosy1984: shit show saturday
[2:59:15] lange__: Did you see the "State of Unreal" a couple of days ago?
[2:59:24] jbh1390: well this era is releasing games that arent done and they die within 1-2 years.
[2:59:28] maybol283: I think the fact that so many of the big companies have dropped the ball with terrible games people are more open to indie devs who give a fuck
[2:59:31] Harmar: soda then the youtube crew picking it up skyrocketed it
[2:59:31] „Åù„Çå„Åß: soda has exploded a lot of indie games
[2:59:45] jbh1390: well thats why i think indie games will be good.
[2:59:46] chiefbasti_: indie games mostly struggle with promo, this is where streamers can help
[2:59:46] Arimil: Welcome to games as a service.
[2:59:51] Tapollo: when slime rancher first came out. it only had 3 devs
[2:59:51] daemonaedryn: Have you thought of revisiting Slay the Spire with the free fan made expansion that came out?
[2:59:51] BadLa: people dont understand the value of a company having a legal team NODDERS
[2:59:55] sp4wn999: like New WOrld
[2:59:56] extrasaulty: except Minecraft. long live minecraft
[2:59:56] ManneehFresh: i wish nintendo would understand that simple concept and not go after content creators
[3:00:06] Archelonde: I feel like i've had more successes than bombs with indie early access vs big games and early access
[3:00:07] Tech: @BadLa NODDERS
[3:00:08] Face_32: that becasue of the way we consume games so quickly, why spend years on project that people will eat up and spit out in a week?
[3:00:09] Moobot: You can find Waffle's Youtube channel here - https://youtube.com/giantwaffle
[3:00:30] BobTaco21: Also Indie games are often times published way more frequently than AAA titles bc there are far more single to 5 person teams than a AAA company
[3:00:40] „Åù„Çå„Åß: minecraft is always gonna be THE indie game
[3:01:02] Face_32: ive got a creeper hole you can fill Gigidy
[3:01:12] Harmar: @Face_32 big issue on that part is there isnt much replayability new stuff its streight forward and done nothing new to do
[3:01:13] PetOrange: league of legends
[3:01:16] m0nkeyman_14: wait there was one big one before minecraft
[3:01:25] Face_32: @Face_32 agree
[3:01:28] m0nkeyman_14: it was a block zombie one idk the name
[3:01:30] theleezen: stardew is a good indie game to look at too
[3:01:33] 0x4273: Factorio is another good one like that
[3:01:40] Allmostdone: until they are bought before Microsoft
[3:01:42] daemonaedryn: Rimworld is a great one too
[3:01:42] Tech: Minecraft is a bad model though for Indie games
[3:01:45] ak1732: calzone is not pizza
[3:01:50] PetOrange: league is small indie company
[3:01:51] Tech: Because the game itself has no value
[3:01:55] ThatExcitedViewer: i think terraria hit number 1 though or?
[3:02:00] heyitsappl3: gta is rank 2
[3:02:01] Face_32: i thought roblox passed it tho
[3:02:03] ThatExcitedViewer: am i mistaken
[3:02:04] Venxuri: wait, somebody pays for tetris?
[3:02:05] Tech: The IP is what sells and is a mechanism to get more users into an ecosystm
[3:02:11] Mandorake: I prefer Skyrims model.
[3:02:16] i44991: As an Enviormental Dev. We're often encouraged In during Dev learning to join AAA rather than indie, as you're never sure whether the company will go under or can provide benefits.
[3:02:17] Tech: See, that's the thing
[3:02:20] galaxy_berry: yeah its minecraft > grand theft auto > tetris for game sales
[3:02:22] daemonaedryn: @Mandorake Which version KEKW
[3:02:25] m0nkeyman_14: anyone play that shitty zombie survival block game on xbox? way back in the day
[3:02:29] Mandorake: @DaemonSzyman pepw
[3:02:34] Harmar: @Tech and minecraft wasent even the first version another dev team made the original design pepeLaugh
[3:02:34] Tech: Games these days are not really cash grabs. It's just that they can't leverage the game into other revenue streams
[3:02:37] galaxy_berry: sale**
[3:02:43] Face_32: AAA game companies wont invest in games unless the think they can milk the shit out of it
[3:02:45] Royal_TRC: the fact that im still enjoying minecraft and got it during alpha
[3:02:46] AndyHayes: Minecraft has 230million sales
[3:02:47] „Éî„ÉÉ„Ç∂„ÉÄ„Éá„Ç£: telltales minecraft

[3:02:54] jbh1390: 238m for minecraft. GTA is 160m and tetris is 100m
[3:02:59] Tech: People have been really spoiled by free/low cost games
[3:03:01] Scojan: I thought Microsoft would do way more with Minecraft over these years than they have
[3:03:02] goodguy_z: I'm trying to play this modpack but I'm having issues with cpu spikes. Not sure what's going on
[3:03:04] Royal_TRC: 50 kr
[3:03:04] B0atyMcBoatface: 5 or 10 dollars
[3:03:05] Apparentthreat: Tech you talking about mtx or what
[3:03:07] MisterZero_: 5 usd?
[3:03:10] Face_32: indy games are the future, they are the only ones with passion for the craft they are doing
[3:03:11] PapaDskillzZz: 50 I think
[3:03:12] XkijuX: 8usd
[3:03:15] Chronoes: I bought it for 15 EUR
[3:03:18] MiesterTee: As far as I was aware GTA is not an indie game KEKW
[3:03:18] i44991: I've even met a few individuals who'd refuse to work on / at a indie company or game purely because they believe it will hurt their hiring potential at "professional company."
[3:03:23] VanDomand: i bought it for 10 euros
[3:03:24] Tech: @Apparentthreat huh?
[3:03:24] Josedude: Hytale is unofficial minecraft 2

[3:04:31] TheOnlyDoubleE: TheOnlyDoubleE subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 13 months! 
[3:04:32] Tech: @Apparentthreat Games these days can make money through other revenue streams. Like Minecraft makes more money selling it's IP than selling the game itself.
[3:04:35] daemonaedryn: KEKW

[3:17:44] maccabeus: i'm pretty sure eidolon has some time-gated things so it might be good to start early if possible
[3:17:45] Dexy2811: blizz is cold and bazalz is probably underground?
[3:17:47] Monty0x: You found a blitz before, so you already have that
[3:17:59] daemonaedryn: blizz
[3:18:02] thestoicjohn: Just got back from geocomposite liner class in Austin. Time to grind out Lost Ark
[3:18:02] daemonaedryn: nvm
[3:18:13] Arimil: He did find them, he killed all the spawners.
[3:18:14] Face_32: blitz are just overworld blazes arent they?
[3:18:44] Jibbur: no, nocturnal powder just helps more mobs spawn
[3:18:47] Monty0x: No, you fought a Blitz in the Atum already
[3:18:48] Venxuri: Or just sit in a biome for a minute and it will eventually spawn
[3:18:55] drebisdavid: undergarden dungeons have a lot of nocturnal powder and botania stuff
[3:18:59] Royal_TRC: pepeLaugh
[3:18:59] Jibbur: glitter kelp is undergarden kelp

[3:19:20] daemonaedryn: Prepare though, they have a fuckton of spawners KEKW
[3:19:22] Dexy2811: yes basically a exploration task
[3:19:23] TelRehiad: fix armor?
[3:19:43] dobie: not sure if theres an easy ranged torch option? can help with the dungeons a lot
[3:19:47] enol3est: @Giantwaffle do they have pumps to pump water and crude oil like buildcraft in the modpack

[3:20:06] maccabeus: YEP
[3:20:10] thunderdan11: can you make more cod and chips?
[3:20:15] Jibbur: it is to a point, this modpack pushed that point too far
[3:20:17] drebisdavid: it will be worth it in the end because botania will be ez after getting blacker lotus from the dungeons
[3:20:21] Face_32: exploring early game is normally what i do at the start of a new MC world
[3:20:21] undeniablyrexer: catacombs spawn in frost fields and forgotten fields, I believe
[3:20:25] dobie: the undergarden dungeons feel v rewarding, can find a lot of good expensive botania stuff

[3:21:25] daemonaedryn: Want an imgur of what it looks like?
[3:21:26] undeniablyrexer: frost fields and forgotten fields
[3:22:15] Jibbur: I don't think nocturnal powder is anything more than a mob spawn increaser
[3:22:44] CD579: do blizz spawn in the frozen fields?
[3:22:46] daemonaedryn: It essentially forces a lot of mobs to spawn
[3:22:49] undeniablyrexer: didn't it also need mechanical dirt?
[3:22:53] ChillyFierce: you need nocturnal powder for crafts
[3:22:59] dobie: it jus spawns a huge group of mobs, you still need to go the respective biomes for them tho
[3:23:00] ChillyFierce: other than using it
[3:23:00] slyjedi: why is health half orange?
[3:23:10] ernatsu10: hi, whats a good tech modpack for someone that havent played moded minecraft for 5+ years in your guys opinion?

[3:24:00] ChillyFierce: mech dirt spawns mobs like crazy
[3:24:05] dobie: mechanical dirt is industrial foregoing i think, which is p expensive

[3:26:34] Face_32: i think there is a pickaxe socket or something that lets you place with your pick
[3:26:36] Makaheehee: Then youll probably run away and forget about the shield. Kappa
[3:26:36] Harmar: just a big hole
