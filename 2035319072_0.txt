[0:28:00] lunette6: @ghost27488 You can send a doll of yourself with someone into the vault and then you'll get a percentage of loot and XP from that vault that the person collects
[0:28:14] Luthien907: But isn't lucky alter only a small %
[0:28:22] queenchazzy_: yes disk drive would be good
[0:28:38] 440stainless: @luthien907 30% at max iirc.  Next update lucky alter is a free crystal
[0:28:42] Yrouel86: @impulseSV worth doing the integration with the storage to pull automatically what you already have, if you can do it
[0:28:43] Matkimble: He is bringing enough loot to potentially crash the server he said.
