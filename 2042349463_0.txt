[3:29:14] SantCost: so at least an hour left
[3:29:15] youthchaos: Peachy_Gurl they got jumped, george died and him and h ran but george was the leader so it got auto disbanded
[3:29:20] hrothgar_sminitrious: must be a server thing
[3:29:20] PacManMVC: @hrothgar_decatur it shows per server
[3:29:22] siyege: maybe they are waiting for a specific amount of deaths for the storm?
[3:29:24] grin_bee: @dor0203 oh shoot

[3:30:15] katian1551: oh
[3:30:16] kot7k: @hrothgar_decatur isn't that like impossible? there were only 116 players today
[3:30:18] itsMuter: @hrothgar_decatur no way it shows per server. that means theres 180 people left when day 2 started with 180?
[3:30:21] ec1pz_: surely the next challenge is to tame the fastest horse
[3:30:23] TheRauhnachte: and since george was the leader of alliance

[3:30:42] PacManMVC: no muter they both started at 116 but they decrease per kills on each server
[3:30:42] grifferthrydwy: it shows overall but we think it only shows deaths that happen on ur server muter
