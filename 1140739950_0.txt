[0:17:02] ayonme: Hope alfa will support Bottas, not like merc
[0:17:03] LordDynom: More than a second in some cases
[0:17:29] The_DTS51: best thing about the race was that bottas went for the fast laptime at the end haha even that the team said stop it haha

[0:20:23] Konsi2481: he actually did loose 1 sec in the last sector
[0:20:26] Motomasher: Bottas finally cracked
[0:20:32] SherlockHemlock: Bottas fav? LUL
[0:20:36] Idawn: Idawn subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 9 months! waffleH
[0:20:44] The_DTS51: if he would not lift then it would be a 1.09.5
[0:21:02] punkgeek: @Giantwaffle new cars/regs next year though, so it's a bit up in the air
[0:21:05] tripwires: alfa is a retirement home
[0:21:10] jamie230191: To be Honest, complete different regulations next year so it could be anyone’s game.
[0:21:11] MIICUTICO: no more 3rd places PepeHands
[0:21:11] Damikiller37: I guess it beats being Hamilton's pedestal
[0:21:12] Raxxlian: Who's replacing him now?
[0:21:13] Flashx2: widepeepoSad
[0:21:16] SherlockHemlock: Hamilton has 7 titles
[0:21:16] snorrow92: kimi has 2 points
[0:21:17] Batistutah: botas will be ok the cars are equal next season
[0:21:20] Whoz: peepoSad
[0:21:20] JustPepeDontBeMad: @Raxxlian george russell
[0:21:21] Denethor: 7 WDC KEKW
[0:21:27] Konsi2481: @Raxxlian Russel probbably
[0:21:34] aundros: yeah, hes def a nr 2
[0:21:37] Decinho_: he got enough money---
[0:21:44] Larklen: The Endeavor of F1 widepeepoSad
[0:21:45] Xorkrik: Bottas has always been solid.
[0:21:54] JustPepeDontBeMad: bottas 92 times in Q3 in a row
[0:21:55] SherlockHemlock: Look at Perez in Red Bull
[0:22:00] BennyF_Jr: It's like Barrichello with Schumacher
[0:22:00] Obriin: Riccardo is a good example of that
[0:22:06] thisisbrad: just 1 pt ?
[0:22:08] alkowing: there is a link on f1 reddit to a dutch commentator of this fast lap attempt, its hilarious
[0:22:17] ObsceneTwix: If you are Bottas what do you do here? im 100% taking the point you know you are at Alfa next year
[0:22:21] Danny_1888: Yeah, but then they realised they had no chance of catching Max and Lewis is in the title race Bottas is no where near it
[0:22:22] Lazdrin: lastest fap Kappa
[0:22:25] punkgeek: Yeah, Danny left Red Bull (the #2 team at the time) cause we wasn't the #1 driver any more
[0:22:27] nesse007: you have the leiws and Nico Rosberg back in past to
[0:22:30] aundros: Are you saying they wanted him gone?
[0:22:32] Sandiro1: He did abort he knew ham was gonna pit on lap 71 @Giantwaffle
[0:22:33] OneLickAway: he was literally nerfed by his team
[0:22:36] Dannythebrill13: he did slow down a bit
[0:22:41] SherlockHemlock: Nah third sector he lifted
[0:22:46] dilliedAlly: what is a purple time?
[0:22:48] JustPepeDontBeMad: @ObsceneTwix Why? it doesn't do anything for you, it changes nothing about his spot at mercedes
[0:22:53] B3RBAT0V: @Giantwaffle have you played F1 2021?
[0:22:56] Ghost0447: its james the strategist
[0:22:59] MajorSleeper: LUL
[0:23:00] LordDynom: It was james right?
[0:23:00] SherlockHemlock: @dilliedAlly fastest time in that sector of all
[0:23:01] Zoinx: That was James Vowles the stategist
[0:23:02] jeinerson_: They pitted him so Hamilton could have a free pit to take an even faster lap and cover Perez from taking it
[0:23:07] ObsceneTwix: @kaweirace yeah exactly you get an extra point
[0:23:08] Glennox2009: its was the plan after all
[0:23:10] podwe: Rosberg defending Ham tho, that makes a change
[0:23:20] Willinfinite: It was disgusting strat
[0:23:23] Miestro: Just him saying, "Fuck it what are you gonna do fire me from the team???"
[0:23:23] aundros: Went out on a high
[0:23:25] dilliedAlly: @SherlockHemlock <3 thanks, purple is an interesting choice I feel like lol
[0:23:25] JustPepeDontBeMad: @ObsceneTwix which helps hamilton a lot more... just shows bottas is team player
[0:23:34] Miracleshot: I hope he doesnt listen to team orders the rest of the season
[0:23:37] jamie230191: Is it me or is rosberg shit at all the media stuff. Find him boring as hell
[0:23:39] ItsOnMax: He's leaving next year tho, so he hase some races left
[0:23:43] macola4: and then he said "im just playing" LUL
[0:23:45] SmoothBlizzard: is this cup of the day?
[0:23:45] Raxxlian: I guess that point matter more for Ham, since he's so close in points to Max
[0:23:47] ItsOnMax: has*
[0:23:48] Vaulthunter_jb: should have said Kimi's line LUL
[0:23:50] BennyF_Jr: He still has some races left

[0:24:12] IANDREWI: monkaSTEER Samieeee!
[0:24:15] The_DTS51: hamilton knows that he could loose the title this year if he doesnt get the fastest lap every race
[0:24:16] Denethor: Merc strategy KEKW
[0:24:18] Danny_1888: Max was pulling away on the hards he had no chance short of Max bonking
[0:24:18] 0x4273: hamilton is such a baby
[0:24:19] Decinho_: hamilton complaining lol
[0:24:19] OneLickAway: i need that point guys peepoSad
[0:24:21] Danny_1888: Yeah
[0:24:23] vihmi: Kappa
[0:24:24] ObsceneTwix: @kaweirace team game so mercades still get the point, plus you get the extra point in the drivers and witrh it being close at 3rd and 4th im taking that point
[0:24:24] JustPepeDontBeMad: HAM wasn't going to catch max anyway
[0:24:27] Willinfinite: bottas pit was to hamilton to pit without battling Bottas
[0:24:28] Sandiro1: @Giantwaffle Ham was a gonna pit anyway
[0:24:30] Cascadium26: KEKW teammates
[0:24:33] macola4: he couldnt win
[0:24:34] Glennox2009: if max hit a wall he would have been second anyway
[0:24:36] blackholebums: blackholebums subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 31 months, currently on a 23 month streak! hi dad I just moved
[0:24:40] eyesometric: HAM wouldn't have pitted if he knew he had a chance to win
[0:24:42] macola4: he was 2 secs or more behind him
[0:24:45] matteuus337: @Giantwaffle noita runs today? :D
[0:25:02] thisisbrad: tiesto
[0:25:03] jamie230191: Fastest lap every race will give pretty much  the same amount of points as an additional race win so well worth it
[0:25:04] JeanBaldeux: he was 3 seconds behind
[0:25:04] Denethor: YEP
[0:25:07] Xorkrik: It's just that, why pit bottas in the first place then.
[0:25:09] podwe: show me how u can win without actually showing me you can win
[0:25:17] JustPepeDontBeMad: you're not going to catch 3 seconds in 2 laps lmao
[0:25:18] Whoz: peepoHmm wait
[0:25:19] Konsi2481: like 3 or 4 sec behind, yea
