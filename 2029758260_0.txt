[0:53:21] Anurith: Go for old school; I vote the opening theme song from Cowboy Bebop
[0:53:25] XboxIsBoom: I’ll have Swift sneak karqOK
[0:53:36] Capt_Bunny99: I suppose
[0:54:19] bendersbeard: @caps4thewin you are probably applying for a credit card that you just don't qualify for. most people need a secured credit card as their first card, or another type of loan with stricter repayment obligations (student loans have lots of caveats for deferment and nonpayment). an auto loan, home loan, personal loan, etc. would all count
[0:54:29] Capt_Bunny99: I stole mokus then found it about an hour later in another ancient city with kyle. I padded moku handsomely for letting me have it first
[0:54:45] Capt_Bunny99: Paid*
[0:54:45] Anurith: Which
[0:54:45] XboxIsBoom: @kycool12 state a price for a Swift sneak book
[0:54:49] Anurith: It had two
[0:55:02] Anurith: Ah,  Just Communication
[0:55:15] caps4thewin: @bendersbeard I have high credit because of a car loan in my name and it's a basic card. Chase Freedom Flex. Low spending limit and $0 annual fee
[0:55:21] athaelas4: immediately awoken pog
[0:55:21] kycool12: @XboxIsBoom I'll give it to you for free

[0:57:37] Capt_Bunny99: Yes xbox
[0:57:40] RuaMoku: thank you steph
[0:57:41] ladytook: steph pogg
[0:57:49] bendersbeard: @bendersbeard that card has a really high cash back percentage which is probably why they'd want a longer credit history + credit score, and with the 0% intro APR and no annual fee they're also probably worried about nonpayment. makes sense that someone who hasn't had a CC before wouldn't qualify
[0:57:50] athaelas4: woah!

[1:01:07] Jooshie1222: ggs <3
[1:01:11] bendersbeard: @bendersbeard caps4thewin yeah i think it's ridiculous too tbh, but length of credit/credit history is a real big factor in qualifying. having a secured or lower risk card for about a year would make you look a lot better to a lot of CC companies. carrying a balance is also important. credit cards are stupid. my score was also 700-ish when i got my first card and it only got me the most basic card my bank offered

[3:09:55] ArmyofThalia: Cheer100 Hey guys, did you know that in terms of human companionship, Flareon is objectively the most huggable Pokemon? While their maximum temperature is likely too much for most, they are capable of controlling it, so they can set themselves to the perfect temperature for you. Along with that, they have a lot of fluff, making them undeniably incredibly soft to touch.
[3:09:58] ArmyofThalia: Cheer100 But that's not all, they have a very respectable special defense stat of 110, which means that they are likely very calm and resistant to emotional damage. Because of this, if you have a bad day, you can vent to it while hugging it, and it won't mind. It can make itself even more endearing with moves like Charm and Baby Doll Eyes, ensuring that you never have a prolonged bout of depression ever again.

[4:29:12] ArmyofThalia: Cheer100 People think the hard part of nuzlocke is the self imposed rules like no items, or pokemon permanently dying. For KarQ, it is different. For someone of his caliber, the hard park of the nuzlocke is playing the game normally. If Pokemon Challenges watched this stream, he would have died on the spot from an aneurysm
