[4:13:02] babyaddalyn: you did it the other day

[4:13:37] chaoskub: I thought the front row was using Nitrogen
[4:13:41] fishypooos: @ninopanda i read ccp made it unplayable without omega? am i getting wrong info

[4:14:57] tomey36: Now way
[4:14:58] eckphoenix: chees3
[4:15:00] Zucate: I am a club cracker guy myself
[4:15:02] GeekJenn: Ritz crackers are the best
[4:15:08] Baysyxx: wtf no way
[4:15:23] DemonicHell3: IMO just make lunch
[4:15:26] BrickDickJr: @Giantwaffle modpack complete in next 4 days?
[4:15:28] theRealWesty84: Ritz with pimento cheese is GOAT
[4:15:33] P00nDozer69: nah flip sides are the best, half pretzel half cracker. great for charcuterie as well
[4:15:38] kane1941: do you remember all the things you automated yet at different tiers?
[4:15:41] ninopanda: @fishypooos i know i was being funny, since the KEKW.  but honestly they have not announced any changes.  just more of the same stuff.  you can still do a lot of stuff on F2P and if you grind enough you can get omega.
[4:15:41] The_Flembo: I can understand club crackers, but no way saltines are better than ritz
[4:15:51] gdawg99: eating too many ritz gets greasy over time compared to saltines imo

[4:18:10] Ouroboros_LoL: you could just set it to always have 1 made at any one time so it doesn't eat though your plates and you  don't have to craft them
[4:18:15] GeekJenn: Ah well she doesn't have a computer so poop
[4:18:19] That_Lurker: Get the VR Chat app from limewirre Kappa
[4:18:30] fishypooos: @ninopanda the "spreadsheet game" stuff kinda makes me wanna play LUL
[4:18:31] Tro95: Why don't you set up on-demand crafting for the HV hulls? Still quicker than doing it manually, without over-consuming stainless steel
[4:18:32] The_Holas: ask waffle he can recomenr one for sure Kappa
[4:18:40] ragemonkey227: @ninopanda you chuckled before you timed me out, *smirk*
[4:18:42] The_Holas: recommend one*
[4:18:46] GeekJenn: It is a Quest.
[4:18:49] ninopanda: @fishypooos i played heavily back in 2017 - 2018 then stopped due to other things.  i restarted about 3 months ago and still love the game.  I get omega free every month from grinding isk

[4:25:18] eckphoenix: antagonist
[4:25:28] The_Flembo: But main character name.. is it realistic for that reality?

[4:25:49] The_Flembo: Yup KEKW
[4:25:50] Asphoron: Dungeon Crawler Carl is good book series with rpg elements in the real world instead
[4:25:52] So_Stormy: @Tabakhase i assume its just my connection, i use 5GHz and the router is 5 feet away
[4:25:54] Alem_Sinner_pt: @Giantwaffle I'm sure even with all that full dive we would still blame it on lag KEKW
[4:26:00] emparallax: Damn the base looks so different! just coming back since before Christmas
[4:26:02] wargig42: I like the anime were the mains op off the start

[4:26:20] RandomLibrarian: @Asphoron DCC audiobooks are so good
[4:26:28] Tabakhase: @So_Stormy every 20 min? how regular is that? and country ya in? that almost sounds like it could be DFS (aka Radar forcing your wifi to switch things around)

[4:28:16] Furiak: PGE has another 6h+ outage right now in Portland area
[4:28:36] GeekJenn: I'm glad we only lost power here for an hour. Was the first night though.
[4:28:37] Tabakhase: @So_Stormy depending on how good of an router it may even have a logmessage written about that somewhere to check - but fliping channels/static assign be a thing to try...
[4:28:48] The_Holas: w8 you have power in texas? Its on pair with EU and gas KEKW
[4:28:58] Furiak: high winds I guess, some storm -- reminiscent of ~2 years ago when they were out of power for 2 weeks

[4:29:14] dylan0806: KEKW
[4:29:25] Allmostdone: overloaded power system?
[4:29:25] SmokyMtnRed: We had rolling blackouts in East Tennessee
[4:29:29] Dagmoo: crazy rain today where I'm at in California
[4:29:30] GeekJenn: I've been looking at Washington state
[4:29:49] calebhub514: Man I'd love to go see MT Rainier at some point
[4:29:50] Tabakhase: @So_Stormy blaming it on game be more the encoding route (hardware to encode) - but then that "every 20min" would be kinda odd... - but tweaking those settings may be worth a test too
[4:29:51] The_Holas: Waffle ... you live in Vr why do you care Kappa
[4:29:57] tomey36: No don’t come to the PNW it’s horrible you will hate it
[4:29:57] GeekJenn: I've been in Austin since 2007 and I'm just over it. Cost of living here is pretty comparable.

[4:31:30] A_Wildland_Firefighter: @Tapeman83 I live here too,too damn expensive.
[4:31:33] mobfarmer: before republicans went off  the deep end.
[4:31:33] GeekJenn: I'd be rich
[4:31:38] theRealWesty84: I live in CS, CO.  Besides the high house costs its not too bad.  Especially if you like skiing
[4:31:38] JJenson: ouch
[4:31:45] DareDeFlug: Jesus
[4:31:46] bugsplatter23: well you have no income tax
[4:31:49] Minelmonia: income tax?
[4:31:52] CocoScruff: just don't get your house reassessed :-P
[4:31:54] Allmostdone: 4% isn't that bad
[4:31:57] Blakejh_: boston also is in the most populated part of the country though, so its a little more justifiable then some of hte other crazy expensive places
[4:32:03] ChromaCym: Yeah every state has its own way to get its money
[4:32:04] Tapeman83: Oh, I get that. It’s not the cheapest place @a_wildland_firefighter
[4:32:07] kingLordsy: @Allmostdone Kappa
[4:32:10] JayPeaSize: Yeahhh. The house of my price has gone up by 50k in the last 2 years
[4:32:11] CocoScruff: @Giantwaffle ewww that's awful

[4:32:16] GeekJenn: I live in the downtown area and my neighbors that are older can't pay their property taxes. They are losing their houses. It's terrible
[4:32:17] Babyblasphemy: @Giantwaffle check out pictures of Ruby Beach, it's super beautiful
[4:32:18] ak1732: @Allmostdone lol idiot
[4:32:19] Furiak: 4% is terrible for property
[4:32:19] DespiseTheirLies: pepeLaugh hmm
[4:32:20] chilly_doggo: Must be European
[4:32:20] Tro95: 25 year mortgage or 4% tax
[4:32:21] macdrai: just be rich Waffle
[4:32:22] Smithii: Property tax is so weird... 20 years and you've basically paid for your house twice
[4:32:23] eckphoenix: y'all have goof bbq though
[4:32:25] fractalcake: Assessed house value doesn't = what your house is worth when you sell it. House doubling in market value doesn't really mean you now pay double taxes.
[4:32:26] eckphoenix: good
[4:32:29] Techniker32: That must be the SMALL Government KEKW
[4:32:29] dylan0806: Not bad for European standards
[4:32:31] podwe: Denver calling? waffleD

[4:32:35] kayle_chips: @Giantwaffle just move to the mountains and homestead Kappa
[4:32:36] kingjonjames: it's like you're renting with that much property tax
[4:32:40] A_Wildland_Firefighter: @Tapeman83 And god forbid ya live in cook county.
[4:32:42] Furiak: Texas is great for business/corporations -- shitty for residents
[4:32:44] Allmostdone: try property tax, sales tax, city and countyy tax
[4:32:45] LiveType: Bro, no don't move to denver.
[4:32:45] lizard__lips: Or just join the army and get free housing
[4:32:46] mommahale: We own a smaller house outside of Dallas and the amount we pay in house taxes insane. Our house is way overpriced but nothing we can do about it.
[4:32:47] Daggne: You could join the military and I think you get free healthcare and never pay state taxes again.
[4:32:49] mobfarmer: if you are renting, you are paying the taxes and more
[4:32:49] Dagmoo: after you said this the other day about property tax, i did the math and you pay more in property tax alone then my wife and i pay for all our California and federal taxes LUL
[4:33:04] gman0821: texas loves to brag about no income tax yet glosses over the property tax situation LUL

[4:33:18] Ch1ldish_Cambino: bigggg no thanks
[4:33:20] kqueue: here I sit crying over my 40+% income tax rate
[4:33:22] DespiseTheirLies: im gooood
[4:33:27] Allmostdone: the military healthcare isn't the best
[4:33:30] Wetware: I don't think Waffle is ready for the military... or the military is ready for Waffle
[4:33:31] eckphoenix: what was the healing process like for lasik? I have 1 more year before I can do it
[4:33:31] mobfarmer: join the airforce... you can fly a drone from the safety of the base
[4:33:43] Babyblasphemy: GI Bill is pog
[4:33:51] MUHFUGGIN: but waffle don't you want to be all you can be? /s
[4:33:52] McFlannel: i did 6 years in the navy and ended with 80 % disability
[4:33:53] Daggne: I thought Texas was the number one state for benefits from military.
[4:33:56] Asphoron: Higher property taxes with no income tax is just a rich people tax dodge
[4:33:59] Angel0death: I live in japan because of the military. so worth it lmao

[4:34:14] Dagmoo: @mcflannel oof sorry dude
[4:34:19] Techniker32: It's just soo sad to see how bad the US is managed... Like people having to rely on some sort of electric boards to be willing to fix power issues is crazy to me KEKW
[4:34:19] TheHPGarage: Space Force!!!
[4:34:20] GeekJenn: I loved Austin so much and it's been great to live here but it's getting very un Austin like.
[4:34:20] Wetware: Be a drone pilot, all that war thunder exp go to good use!
[4:34:27] Soulif: Would you ever switch to yt streaming?
[4:34:33] eckphoenix: space force would be pog
[4:34:42] RobbieReborn: private sector ftw
[4:34:47] Razorain56: what are the settings you are pasting in?
[4:34:49] koko_chicken: im DoD army civilian its chill af
[4:34:50] Wetware: Cyber Command!
[4:34:51] theRealWesty84: You could go cyber in the Army.  Learn to hack other systems

[4:34:56] dylan0806: Or just like destin
[4:34:57] Daggne: I have worked both and private sector is just better.
[4:34:57] fractalcake: Then we could call you captain waffle Kappa
[4:35:01] Allmostdone: DoD is the way to go
[4:35:01] Angel0death: contractors get paid a lot of money too depending on what you are doing
[4:35:18] Tabakhase: more like DoT pepeLaugh
[4:35:19] sogerr: join space force and get sent to an asteroid to be a space border guard
[4:35:24] Az1iiiz: what is DOD? non american asking

[4:36:23] Alem_Sinner_pt: Silver wire
[4:36:24] Furiak: silver wire did it yesterday
[4:36:27] Babyblasphemy: @Giantwaffle why don't you just set the machine to auto export?
[4:36:29] johnnykrat: what snack are you eating 2020Snacking
[4:36:30] DOOMinion: maybe when it exports them, it imports them back in
[4:36:30] Igneous3: you had fine gold wire in gold
[4:36:39] maimvice13: i have the same problem
[4:36:46] gman0821: are there any parts of living in texas that you enjoy?
[4:36:51] Azure_Storm: Did it happen to any of the others? might have to do a daily check.
[4:36:53] maimvice13: don't output in the same interface
[4:36:54] Angel0death: yeah, we have contractors that train people on yalls jets @az1iiiz
[4:37:07] Starmetal_: item conduit sucks the bolt into the input slot from interface, can happen sometimes
[4:37:16] JaFoste99: is this the GTCEu port?
[4:37:19] McFlannel: DOD and military in general is sort of moving in a direction that is very unfavorable. Most hospitals/offices are moving towards the DHA model and it is failing. At least in the dmv area
[4:37:22] TheResinger: @JaFoste99 yes
[4:37:33] drsnaki96: when it's imported in the interface there is a small amount of time that the item is available to be extracted back to the machine
[4:37:44] dylan0806: Import filters?
[4:37:46] Babyblasphemy: The -> in the gregtech machines is auto export mode I think
[4:37:47] loaded57: @Giantwaffle cant you use an ender chest import system to avoid it?

[4:38:01] Schutter07: you can use a dedicated interface for importing in the system
[4:38:04] kitty_cat20: you can put an import on an ender chest, an use conduit to put the items on the ender chest
[4:38:20] Az1iiiz: @Angel0death my dad worked as contractor trainer after he retired. they usually do that cause of experience
[4:38:20] Polkich: Can;t you like change the auto output side with a screwdriver?
[4:38:24] Abudun2011: make a blacklist for bolts in the conduit
[4:38:31] Babyblasphemy: I think you can move the export direction with wrench, though that might be knowledge from 1.6.4 that hasn't ported this far lol
[4:38:54] IlsaGold: It cool future waffle said he would fix that
[4:39:03] dcirusc30: lol wtf would use that many for in ae system xD

[4:39:34] SmokyMtnRed: Depends on how you craft polymer for DML. That would eat thru 26k Ender Pearls like nothing
[4:39:38] Archie8300: 10 minutes laaater
[4:39:40] Angel0death: @az1iiiz Yeah, my job allows for me to do that if I wanted when I got out. But I have a different plan. it's not a bad way to live. make good money for the amount of work you do tbh. just requires you to live there for years
[4:39:52] TheCairon: going through a lot of x material? just make more! the factory must grow!
[4:40:17] drsnaki96: @SmokyMtnRed those ender pearls are made specifically for DML
[4:40:23] Az1iiiz: @Angel0death well its good for a person who is 50+
[4:40:29] GuardMoony: is the ender pearl drawer locked?

[5:19:53] Razzjiel: @Face_32 With pineapple and ham KEKW
[5:19:55] MonteKuchen: i think we have a winner
[5:20:03] aundros: how easy is that ore to get?
[5:20:16] frainsbreeze: check the recipe for the large checmical thingy
[5:20:25] dcirusc30: ore is 5 pennys for 32ore
[5:20:29] PureSpider: how abundant is pristine matter?
[5:20:30] itamarb77: less apetite
[5:20:35] DarkKnghtt58: more apetite and less air. Doesn't use the blaze matter either
[5:20:51] The_Holas: isnt less air ... with like less machines?
[5:20:52] MonteKuchen: do you have ptfe already?
[5:21:02] SisyphusAgain: more apatite needs much more pizza
[5:21:05] pi70n: and air is free too
[5:21:07] KnightofObv: multiblocks aren't fun to work with

[5:21:20] TelRehiad: teflon
[5:21:28] R1Rider01: air is free, but requires power.   apatite you'll be getting on the first drone anyways.
[5:21:28] MonteKuchen: PureSpider SeemsGood
[5:21:30] itamarb77: the only core component of the recipe that isnt free is appetite. you should use less of it
[5:21:33] Dagmoo: pati may have automated it?
[5:21:45] Dagmoo: or was that only PTE and PVC
[5:21:47] KICKKJ: which verison is currently more scalable?
[5:21:56] R1Rider01: appatite is dirt cheap
[5:22:23] eckphoenix: who needs a college degree when you have mc mod packs :)
[5:22:26] DarkKnghtt58: I say use the more apitite with coins to get you started until you can get more with the dimension miner. Should be plenty until you get to that point I'd think
[5:22:44] TelRehiad: Pati did
[5:22:46] jberk26: I think some of those crates needed more storage upgrades
[5:22:54] McSauce: KEKW

[6:09:13] mechoriet: @Tabakhase pepeLaugh
