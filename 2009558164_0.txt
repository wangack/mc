[4:48:10] Zpeedi: thank u
[4:48:22] EX3C_7115: oh there he is
[4:48:39] Wut1080: And WHO is that exactly? >:v
[4:48:45] h4724: Does the Israphel account still exist?
[4:49:11] Wut1080: Man, there wasn't even a hunger bar.
[4:49:17] Wut1080: Porkchops did not stack.
[4:49:25] SivTheGreatFull: @h4724 no idea
[4:50:45] EX3C_7115: if only they killed him in this episode, how different things would have turned out
[4:51:14] Wut1080: If only the world hadn't been corrupted. u,u

[4:52:51] Wut1080: Fpreshadowing.
[4:53:33] Wut1080: I actually miss that from older versions. The sun setting and rising on stages.

[4:55:11] SivTheGreatFull: dang
[4:55:15] marmaladethedestroyer: I didn't remember they have been doing this for so long

[4:59:40] Wut1080: Wait, you could shear a sheep with a sword without killing it?
[4:59:51] SivTheGreatFull: yeah
[4:59:57] SivTheGreatFull: back in the day
[5:00:06] Wut1080: I never knew that.
[5:00:19] SivTheGreatFull: I don't think they add shears to after beta
[5:00:27] EX3C_7115: @Wut1080 I think it was just a right click thing
[5:00:35] Wut1080: I did know that zombies used to drop feather, for some reason, but I never knew that about sheep. I always though you just had to kill them for wool.
[5:00:48] Chronosera: I don't remember not needing shears, I started in beta 1.8 - not super sure though
[5:00:51] SubtleSilver: Alright alright I leave. Good night chat, be well I love you
[5:00:57] Chronosera: o/
[5:01:01] Wut1080: Then again, I didn't play earlier versions that much.

[5:01:33] Chronosera: real OG
[5:01:45] Wut1080: I thrived from 1.7 onwards.
[5:01:53] 69yo_mama420: i remember ignoring there first videos until after like th 1n2 cake update or something
[5:02:16] SivTheGreatFull: yeah
[5:02:22] Wut1080: 1.12 was the colors update, if I recall correctly.
[5:02:32] EX3C_7115: I still consider myself late to it, and I started beta 1.7
[5:02:36] Chronosera: I remember enjoying stuff like the dropper series the most originally from them
[5:02:42] SivTheGreatFull: I think so to but I could be wrong
[5:02:54] SivTheGreatFull: @Chronosera I remeber that series
[5:03:16] Wut1080: You mean the Dropper minigame?
[5:03:25] Chronosera: I just rewatched it, was in need of the nostalgia
[5:03:31] Chronosera: the adventure map
[5:03:35] MrPewpyPants: HOOOOOOLD!
[5:04:09] 69yo_mama420: haha i remember the dropper and all the cool maps
[5:04:14] SivTheGreatFull: I think it's on the Youtube channel
[5:04:15] Wut1080: Hey, I remember that pyramid!
[5:04:18] 69yo_mama420: wasnt one an optical illusion
[5:04:26] Chronosera: yeah
[5:04:33] SivTheGreatFull: think so
[5:04:39] Chronosera: pretty awesome map for its time
[5:04:41] SivTheGreatFull: was one in the neither or something like that
[5:05:01] marmaladethedestroyer: I always loved the falling up one
[5:05:35] Wut1080: Hold on, that portal.
[5:05:45] Wut1080: Wasn't this what gave start to the SoI series?
[5:06:05] Wut1080: That old cobble texture.
[5:06:06] EX3C_7115: maybe
[5:07:35] 69yo_mama420: i cant quite remember what the nether dropper looked like but i think so

[5:17:31] Chronosera: correct, same
[5:18:26] EX3C_7115: I was planning on sleep at some point but this is more important
[5:19:27] MrPewpyPants: we can do all of SOI
[5:19:45] MrPewpyPants: then Jaffa Factory
[5:19:57] MrPewpyPants: which was my intro to Sips
[5:20:17] T2Needles: Jaffa factory has unwanted people in it, so it's better to steer clear of that one
[5:20:30] EX3C_7115: maybe not all of jaffa

[5:20:49] Zpeedi: i wish there was an actually active alpha server
[5:20:58] MrPewpyPants: Dirt Factory was also a good series....but alas...
[5:21:01] Zpeedi: old minecraft is so good
[5:21:03] Immindragon: Yeah, no watching stuff with Voldemort in it
[5:21:46] EX3C_7115: they good series' but cinema no like
[5:23:09] EX3C_7115: also no way we'd get through them all tonight
[5:25:14] Immindragon: Such clear directions.  It's hard to fathom why Simon didn't understand him.
[5:25:53] marmaladethedestroyer: Incoherent screaming is the best form of comunication
[5:26:19] Wut1080: Is it buffering a lot for anyone else as well?
[5:26:38] EX3C_7115: seems fine

[5:47:58] Wut1080: That used to piss me off so much, for some reason.
[5:48:35] Immindragon: It is weird
[5:48:47] EX3C_7115: I never noticed that
[5:49:28] Immindragon: It's a bit like noticing how often he use to say "friend".  Once you realize, you can't help but notice again and again.
[5:49:38] EX3C_7115: I guess he exclaims afterwards
[5:50:08] EX3C_7115: @Immindragon that one is hard to miss
[5:51:12] Wut1080: It's hot in there and it's not because if the forge. :v

[7:35:39] renlo0: @DaxianPreston WHY TF yu in chat complaingin semd an email
[7:36:26] T2Needles: Most likely your email just filtered out the email with Codes as Promotion or Spam

[7:42:42] T2Needles: Obviously you don't have to, they've made it clear to only donate if you have the capacity to. Though your Code issue was very likely a You problem not checking your email tabs and not a Tiltify problem since the Collection is automatically added and you'd need to Manually remove it to not get it
