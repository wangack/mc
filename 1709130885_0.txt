[0:37:46] Zyie: First time they might've timed them, just cause it was the first time and they wanted a cool shot, but maybe it's better to stagger the landings, so that why they've done that since?
[0:38:01] AtchTwoOh: maybe not going tangent to the two pads, so the one pad is close to the cutoff?
[0:38:24] piprrrrr: I think even on the boost back one ignites before the other

[0:39:03] DocMarrs: im betting tiny differences in re-ignition times adds up to the difference
[0:39:19] mrleonehart: Rumor has it 2 variables are in play. 1 shockwave deterrant and 2 in case one fails it gives time for the 2nd to fix itself

[1:09:04] frainsbreeze: 500k a side
[1:09:09] Venxuri: per side
[1:09:11] jmm548: easy way to test
[1:09:15] LsTheRoberto: oh nice
[1:09:25] stefan150: you rpoved it was one each with the battery
[1:09:33] bobolpwnz: You can have multiple transievers in space
[1:09:42] jmm548: plus see if u can just place them on the box without the wire too gotta test that
[1:10:03] Sam_1443: dont drop them
[1:10:03] officialhunterx: suit
[1:10:14] mysts_07: dont wanna drop those into space like ur helmet KEKW
[1:10:41] jmm548: LUL
[1:10:47] LsTheRoberto: we dont talk about the helmet...
[1:10:56] Gh3ttoboy: @jmm548 that does work so you know
[1:11:11] jdog0616: death count?
[1:11:12] Davemathews: u don't want to through ur helmet off into space again
[1:11:15] J0hanAndersson: sure COPIUM
[1:11:16] moldymerkin: PepeHands helmet
[1:11:17] officialhunterx: magnet check
[1:11:20] Novaht: You should make an air tight enchant it's so much easier
[1:11:48] sneakyHoovy: uh oh
[1:11:49] GracelessDonkey: No magnet?
[1:11:51] PureSpider: careful, they dont stack
[1:11:52] Gh3ttoboy: just .ake

[1:11:54] frainsbreeze: those panes are not stacking
[1:11:58] TheIrishGuy: carefully mbt data
[1:11:58] jmm548: u can take down the wire too
[1:12:00] AtchTwoOh: they don't stack!!!
[1:12:02] Scerion_TX: oh they aren't stacking
[1:12:04] jdog0616: panels dont stack?
[1:12:05] sneakyHoovy: inv is full KEKW
[1:12:06] Sam_1443: maybe just put some vacuum chests around stuff up here?
[1:12:07] Intohimos: they don't stack so be careful
[1:12:08] Scerion_TX: oh just the first one
[1:12:09] PureSpider: ah some do
[1:12:12] Gh3ttoboy: just make a pressurized room
[1:12:19] chickie_xD: hey sry for the out of context question but i dont know who else to ask :) does any1 have a suggestion for a factorio modpack for me and my buddy? we just finished our first vanilla playthrough
[1:12:25] jmm548: ones with a chareg u can prolly slap backl down to drain it
[1:12:25] Novaht: Inventory space!!!!!
[1:12:30] PureSpider: if they have different power values n stuff, they dont stack
[1:12:32] mrleonehart: Hammer or vein mine?
[1:12:36] stefan150: just use the destroy gadget
[1:12:36] J0hanAndersson: novaht , they stack :)
[1:12:40] Scerion_TX: does the conduit need to be replaced too or it can take t8?
[1:12:50] suicidebolt: If you sneak harvest them it keeps the power and they don’t stack
[1:13:03] jdog0616: @chickie_xD if you want to go really long i could recomemnd Angle-Bob mod pack

[1:17:34] LsTheRoberto: building gadget?
[1:17:35] mrleonehart: Use the builder gadget
[1:17:36] PureSpider: you can connect them in one spot, yea
[1:17:37] jmm548: maybe to multi sections of pannels and have them on there own power box ?
[1:17:45] lukasalbert: did you guys update ?
[1:17:46] PureSpider: so slap them directly onto the dimensional thing, no conduits?
[1:17:49] daedmissica0: build tool
[1:17:51] stefan150: multiblock?
[1:17:53] GGoodGGuy: so green
[1:18:11] LsTheRoberto: the color is way better than before
[1:18:18] cmmeth: catJAM
[1:18:19] stefan150: whats a multiblock
[1:18:34] sneakyHoovy: 5Head
[1:18:36] frainsbreeze: can you build it using the building gadget?
[1:18:38] akaCube: Nice lawn
[1:18:45] jdog0616: @chickie_xD i would reccomend @marsh8056 on YT if you need any help with progression, the only ongoing Angle Bob series on YT, over 200hours
[1:18:55] stefan150: very cheeky to use space btw :p
[1:19:00] Yakobro: the end steel conduits can only output 32k/face right...
[1:19:03] Gh3ttoboy: you know you onky need 1 connection right for those solar panels
[1:19:26] Yakobro: ah, lumium, looks like end lol
[1:19:55] Mythrillo: we finally got solar panels Pog
[1:20:11] mysts_07: u could use like some enderium conduits?
[1:20:20] hippiedude212: chunk load
[1:20:22] GracelessDonkey: This is peak performance
[1:20:30] Scerion_TX: are the upgrades in the pack too?
[1:20:30] jmm548: so shouldwe add more connections to each box
[1:20:45] jdog0616: wire transfer rate doesnt limit power flow??
[1:20:48] jmm548: all sides
[1:20:50] Yogithebaer: ive missed so much
[1:20:53] BOLT_M4G1C: cant you upgrade the rf/t?
[1:21:05] Sam_1443: is there a better way to send the power through dimensions?
[1:21:05] Moobot: You can sub to Waffle by clicking this neat link -> twitch.tv/giantwaffle/subscribe SUBprise
[1:21:08] jdimango: 8 million is only 16 sides
[1:21:13] Bulltank: ^
[1:21:18] TheIrishGuy: space suit
[1:21:19] jdog0616: what kind of wires you have the dont have flow restriction??
[1:21:32] spiwn: each box side is limited by the conduit connection limit
[1:21:36] officialzip: @Giantwaffle space suit
[1:21:52] Yogithebaer: are you going to take the diamond dynamos down or keep them
[1:21:55] BOLT_M4G1C: i´m sure there is a speed upgrade
[1:22:11] keanway: So many backseat gamers lol
[1:22:12] cmmeth: space popCat
[1:22:31] hippiedude212: do the solar panels need to be chunk loaded?
[1:22:50] Ratscapula: @hippiedude212 they are
[1:22:50] moldymerkin: @hippiedude212  he already did
[1:22:52] officialhunterx: 16
[1:22:57] hippiedude212: k
[1:23:04] frainsbreeze: 16 sides...so 8 dim transceivers. 4 in space and 4 in the base
[1:23:07] Bulltank: 16
[1:23:07] jdimango: You only need 16 of those too
[1:23:11] Gh3ttoboy: and what about the efficiency solar panel upgraded
[1:23:20] stormzwest: depends on the capacitor inside
[1:23:21] Bulltank: you need 16
[1:23:26] jdimango: 16 sides and 16 cable connections
[1:23:33] Sam_1443: so just do 18 then
[1:23:42] Timiderxbox: The solar panels can only transfer 260k, so you need to factor that in extracting from solar panels
[1:23:48] LosBurritosHermanos: 16 + connection to solar panels
[1:24:08] officialhunterx: i thought it was per solar panel
[1:24:12] matori666: isn't that per panel?
[1:24:16] thebodge: thebodge subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months! woot
[1:24:21] matori666: extract
[1:24:35] MrRubickscube: right click it with the new conduit to change it
[1:24:49] Maximus439: do you need to chunkload the panels?
[1:24:58] ValueTown: the 260 is per panel. the panels can output energy faster than they can create energy. so it's only relevant if there's a buffer in the panel
[1:25:37] Gh3ttoboy: what if you slap the solar panels on the capacitor bank
[1:26:14] lampman87: What did he intern as?
[1:26:16] ymelus: it dnt turn into a job?
[1:26:32] Chaossms: if you wanna be cable efficient you should place the relievers in the middle of 4 rsolar panels
[1:26:43] sorefingers: didnt you want to use the enderium cables for something?
[1:26:43] spiwn: The conduit pulls faster from the panel it is connected to. But the power coming from other panels to that panel is limited by the transfer speed -> so connect more/all panels
[1:26:45] Gh3ttoboy: and attach the the transceivers to the capacitor bank
[1:26:51] Trahir: are you limiting throughput by sharing a conduit between two of them?
[1:26:58] Aivarm: extra space between tranceivers because cable max troughput
[1:27:26] trabadam: you want to use solar buffer too , so insert / extract
[1:27:35] mrleonehart: Its fine. you dont have it on receive for the signal
[1:27:47] Gh3ttoboy: @aivarm these conduits are teleport pipes
[1:27:55] frainsbreeze: you missed 3 sides
[1:27:56] RXZED_: I dont think you can input energy back into the solar panels anyway
[1:27:59] stefan150: you havent finished all sides
[1:28:01] Tetsomina: Tetsomina subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 12 months, currently on a 1 month streak! And just like that, how amazing
[1:28:04] LsTheRoberto: worst comes to worst you come back up here and flip it
[1:28:21] phoss2k: Has anyone died in space yet?

[1:28:32] daedmissica0: CI did
[1:28:32] boogerbomb01: Its not enough
[1:28:33] ninopanda: restarting the patreon server again
[1:28:37] frainsbreeze: you missed 3 sides on the dim trasceivers
[1:28:38] Gh3ttoboy: @phoss2k ci did
[1:28:46] phoss2k: ofc LUL
[1:28:58] Tetsomina: Following since 2014 and forgot that I have to renew my prime subscription each month :/
[1:29:04] Vovosunt: does it matter if you set them up to insert/extract?
[1:29:19] Spirevipp: doesnt angel ring prevent fall damage?
[1:29:19] Moobot: You can find Waffle's Youtube channel here - https://youtube.com/giantwaffle
[1:29:23] DKJensen98: You dont have to worry about fall damage when you have an angel ring?
[1:29:27] jmm548: put them bhid it maybe ?
[1:29:28] Gh3ttoboy: @phoss2k but he did drop off all his shit but forgot about the angel ring
[1:29:33] TuxLafitte: Fix power issues forever... danCopium
[1:29:38] helioph0b: question is, can the solar panels transfer energy fast enough from panel to panel to replenish the energy in the panels that are connected
[1:29:39] Sam_1443: put the transceiver behind the battery?
[1:29:42] Bulltank: @TuxLafitte KEKW
[1:29:46] Timiderxbox: Do it behind?
[1:29:49] boogerbomb01: At least you can easily replace them
[1:29:54] Davemathews: behind the back
[1:29:55] kypudo: i would just use the transceivers for new stuff
[1:30:00] boogerbomb01: Click the new ones on the old ones anx it repalces them
[1:30:01] xIENVYIx: xIENVYIx subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 48 months! 
[1:30:03] iXommy: i thought you could switch cables without braking them. or was that with a mod?
[1:30:05] Timiderxbox: You have 2k lumium
[1:30:17] Gh3ttoboy: why not just attach the transceivers to the capacitor bank
[1:30:24] Allmostdone: why not wireless?
[1:30:25] Yakobro: @iXommy you can just rclick the cables to swap, but there's a lot of cables lol
[1:30:30] frainsbreeze: every ingot of signalum will become 4 cables
[1:30:43] FriedPBJ: Everytime I come here i see you building stuff. Is there a goal here 2
[1:30:51] matori666: or cut them up in sections and connect them to a buffer ? so you can change them in sections?
[1:30:58] Timiderxbox: Turn on the automation for signalum dust again - autoexport is broken
[1:30:59] Bulltank: @FriedPBJ theres a questbook. The end goal is to make the creative vending upgrade for storage drawers
[1:31:09] matori666: nothing i think
[1:31:09] bballaustin: Connect the auto crafting signalum to an interface
[1:31:14] iXommy: @iXommy will be a lot of work :o
[1:31:21] Bunjimus: can you do sig main runs then use end steel to the machines that dont need tons of power?
[1:31:35] RefiixGaming: EV is outdated
[1:31:36] Bulltank: upgrade that!
[1:31:37] FriedPBJ: @Bulltank oh......... sounds super exciting... LUL

[1:31:55] Madarion: Time for LuV Signalum making PogChamp
[1:32:00] TPells67: Give it iv
[1:32:01] vexed_out: worth importing from the signalum mixer so it can continue to work

[1:33:46] JonnyL: Wokege
[1:33:46] frainsbreeze: if enderium is easier, you just need a few stacks of signlum cables
[1:33:47] Saytos1: Wokege
[1:33:51] qoob: congrats on getting out of the power pit!
[1:33:59] boogerbomb01: Should each automation setup receive power from a transceiver instead of a line from main power?
[1:34:00] ValueTown: can't you get a powered spawner on capturing mod to automate enderman souls?
[1:34:04] lukasalbert: how do you get the enderman souls ?
[1:34:04] InternetPlumber: fluid extract matter -> tank -> machine
[1:34:11] Madarion: @frainsbreeze Endirium takes for ever
[1:34:16] lukasalbert: OHHH
[1:34:16] Timiderxbox: Fill the experience obelsik - that way you can automate xp to soul binder

[1:40:15] DX_Plates: No Cyno in WH
[1:40:17] ninopanda: yeah we have a few people who are going to record the war from the 2 stations
[1:40:20] DaFez_: @kane1941 yes
[1:40:25] MomotOut: MomotOut subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 3 months! PeepoHappy
[1:40:45] maccabeus: peepoH
[1:40:48] Jaydepps00: @kane1941 why not both?
[1:40:52] PODD: @kane1941 watch waffle in bed  Okayge
[1:41:03] Saytos1: sp true
[1:41:04] Bulltank: I wish there was a way to turn pvp off in that game. I understand why that isn't possible, but man, Id play the shit out of eve if it had a pve only server
[1:41:09] daedmissica0: i loved mining and that stuff on it
[1:41:11] IronGajeel: @causei imagine you could do both... or asking strangers what to do when you sick
[1:41:12] SmokyMtnRed: Sounds like fun, but I just never tried it
[1:41:12] Polystyx: it's a game for masochists with no jobs
[1:41:16] DX_Plates: Albion basically does
[1:41:25] bobolpwnz: It's a huge niche
[1:41:26] beatsalad_: cant wait for archage 2 tbh
[1:41:26] brewerdc: I always found the worlds beautiful
[1:41:34] GameDadel: x3?
[1:41:39] Hemry64_: Eve is definetly a spreadsheet game
[1:41:43] Scerion_TX: Any time I hear about EVE I think about that heist story pulled off by the Guild of the Guiding Hand
[1:41:45] Bunjimus: star citizens getting there weve had spies try to infiltrate our org
[1:41:50] Kjoelby: Imagine EVE but not as ancient game Kreygasm
[1:41:53] itsisaiahclark: How about star citizen
[1:41:58] brewerdc: Salvaging in EVE was fun too
[1:42:05] Jaydepps00: scam citizen :)
[1:42:16] Bunjimus: lol theres a ton of of things to do and its fun as hell
[1:42:19] beatsalad_: its still fun rn tho
[1:42:19] dennixfailalot: let people dream
[1:42:22] brewerdc: Big time dopamine hits when you roll up on some higher tech salvage and make lots of ISK
[1:42:28] Scerion_TX: Star Citizen 2? Kappa
[1:42:48] Chris_Cross_Crash: Isn't Bethesda making a Skyrim/Fallout type game in space?
[1:42:49] Casual_Steve_: elite dangerous is as large as an ocean deep as a puddle LUL
[1:42:51] GracelessDonkey: Make suer teh enw one is set on solar
[1:43:00] hackett33: If SC stopped development right now and polish the game it would still be a pretty good game
[1:43:05] thetexasewok09: SC is great if your just out to have fun and not looking for like aprogress or achivements
[1:43:22] HostileLogOut: Don't expect Starfield to be any good. its the same engine as Fallout most likely.
[1:43:27] DaFez_: does it make more sense to just surround the transceivers with the battery?
[1:43:32] beatsalad_: starfield also wont be multiplayer at all apparently
[1:43:35] Bulltank: @HostileLogOut you say that like fallout is bad
[1:43:36] Kascade418: And also its bethesda, so I can't wait for a new frontier of bugged jank in space
[1:43:49] Kjoelby: With the dev time and money sunk into it, “pretty good game” is far too low for Star Citizen LUL
[1:43:51] HostileLogOut: @Bulltank and it is. a buggy mess.
[1:43:54] beatsalad_: yuup yup
[1:43:56] InternetPlumber: it's skyrim in space... what are people expecting?
[1:43:58] Kryllyk: Fallout in space
[1:43:59] Bulltank: it needs 16 unique unconnected conduits doesnt it?
[1:44:00] GracelessDonkey: Star citizen is star citizen killer
[1:44:03] DX_Plates: Ya know nino, a couple HAW dreads might run them off as well, but it may also cause an escalation... I think a couple bomber runs would be easier for a small group.
[1:44:07] Superswag3211: You moving you power?
[1:44:09] Jaydepps00: i dont think it was even marketed like a "sc killer" LUL
[1:44:32] Gh3ttoboy: @bulltank what he did is fine
[1:44:35] Aivarm: set trancievers to receive mode as well or not needed
[1:44:42] Hemry64_: Bethesda can barely get a single player game working right. We also have 76 as an example of their multiplayer
[1:44:44] lukasalbert: you can also connect the cable directly ?
[1:44:45] jim_from_high_school: good morning waff
[1:44:46] LurkerNr5: can you p2p with signalum connections? :)
[1:44:53] Bulltank: @Gh3ttoboy but the 1 wire that runs to the battery is capped out?
[1:45:00] lukasalbert: cause is can do 130k per connection if its connected to your whole base
[1:45:01] MrDaveje: Only half a million RF/T atm right?
[1:45:03] LurkerNr5: yeah probably would be a bad idea :)
[1:45:08] daedmissica0: waffle you playing Hogwarts Legacy on 10 Feb
[1:45:12] Nexhunter: @Hemry64_ 76 is an example of them using id to tack on multiplayer onto their singleplayer game widePepeLaugh
[1:45:14] Gh3ttoboy: @bulltank its not its instant transfer
[1:45:17] Scerion_TX: Bulltank no the cable can do infinite basically, it's the connections that limit
[1:45:19] Madarion: do you even need the battery? @Giantwaffle
[1:45:19] lukasalbert: connect to the whole base to the solar ?
[1:45:20] Sleepkever: Is the 2 million RF limit for the capacitor also for passtrough or only for charging/discharging?
[1:45:25] frainsbreeze: the dim transceivers wouldn't output 500k per side without the capacitor
[1:45:37] Switcharoo: Make the base walls out of capacitor banks!
[1:45:37] Moobot: You can sub to Waffle by clicking this neat link -> twitch.tv/giantwaffle/subscribe SUBprise
[1:45:38] Sam_1443: you can start with the main trunk lines first then run power to the ebf first
[1:45:41] AlfredTheSalmon: the max I/O of the battery is per connection as well, not in total?
[1:45:52] Bulltank: @Gh3ttoboy @Scerion_TX ahh ok, fml... i could have saved A LOT OF CABLES and HEADACHES if I knew this lmao
[1:46:04] Fitmit: Can you like put holes through the capacitor bank so 1 conduit has access to 4 sides?
[1:46:05] Scerion_TX: Bulltank oh noes. :(
[1:46:33] Moopoop: do it
[1:46:37] Madarion: Do you even need the battery if you upgrade all cables to signalium? there should be no need of a buffer as solar has 100% uptime
[1:46:45] Knightishift: future proof
[1:46:53] Gh3ttoboy: @bulltank LUL well atleast you know now for the next time
[1:47:09] LsTheRoberto: You dont have to recable everything though? Just what touches machines?
[1:47:13] Bulltank: @Gh3ttoboy ya, if I did another modpack like this, Id need to be evaluated by a shrink first
[1:47:21] dam_it_bobby: Is the Flux network stuff in this pack
[1:47:36] ih_shevtsov: automate this cables, in any case you will need that
[1:47:38] LsTheRoberto: 100% if they are cheap
[1:47:45] Gh3ttoboy: @dam_it_bobby it is not saddly
[1:47:51] jmm548: or just add cables to all sides
[1:47:52] daedmissica0: do 1 par room
[1:47:57] frainsbreeze: every LuV and above should have a dedicated transceiver
[1:48:08] GameDadel: auto craft them
[1:48:17] Soulif: Why multiple inputs to the battery?
[1:48:27] jmm548: dont each machine only pull like 120 k
[1:48:40] jmm548: ah
[1:48:41] Switcharoo: Ender Io best mod imo
[1:48:45] jmm548: gottcha
[1:48:58] Bulltank: @Switcharoo it really is an amazing mod. But it is a bit overpowered
[1:49:15] aundros: Congrats on solar milestone tho
[1:49:17] audy: Is it possible to understand this as a first time viewer like me?
[1:49:29] aundros: Don't have to use diamonds anymore
[1:49:29] audy: Its quite amazing though
[1:49:30] Gh3ttoboy: @bulltank do you know ab9ut tye stellar ingot
[1:49:46] Jaydepps00: @audy this is a bit too high level stuff for a first timer
[1:49:51] BiJay0: we all pretend to understand it
[1:50:00] ski11y: ive never played minecraft. i understand 0 of what goes on

[1:50:51] Tuskon15: Wokege
[1:50:53] Bulltank: The entire goal of this modpack is to make 1 item. Everything they are doing is to make that 1 item at the end and beat the modpack
[1:50:57] Jaydepps00: Wokege
[1:51:00] Raging_rinoz: that sound scares me
[1:51:01] ski11y: im just here to watch people post poki emojis
[1:51:04] BiJay0: Wokege
[1:51:04] MrTurtle__: yea to be fair this is not a pack to star on but it is very fun and challenging
[1:51:24] daedmissica0: @Giantwaffle what do you think about nofio for the index? have you seen it?

[1:51:51] lazyhot: hasn't this modpack an average of 600/h before completion?
[1:51:53] LurkerNr5: change the range maybe?
[1:51:56] AlfredTheSalmon: just decrease the range
[1:51:57] Tekbot: This is a good idea : tomatoSmile
[1:51:59] frainsbreeze: change the range
[1:51:59] Frankenstain: just turn down the range
[1:51:59] BiJay0: if its a real explosion youll also see it
[1:52:04] Bulltank: @lazyhot if you know what you're doing, yes
[1:52:09] JasonDM_: monkaS
[1:52:10] GGoodGGuy: it is in you house dude :D
[1:52:11] Deji0: step

[1:52:23] Blanket_Boy: chisel?
[1:52:25] Spirevipp: grind?
[1:52:37] KnightofObv: turn the range down to like 10?
[1:52:52] Crafthor: @Giantwaffle is this the normal Nomifactory or the gregtechCEu port?
[1:52:55] frainsbreeze: remove the explosion sound. you'll never know if a few machines explode
[1:53:00] Bulltank: @Crafthor ceu port
[1:53:02] TheShaddo13: range is 256
[1:53:03] jdimango: It’s the CUe
[1:53:06] Crafthor: @Bulltank ty

[1:53:14] Skylert: !mc_pack
[1:53:29] Jaydepps00: "december pack" KEKW
[1:53:36] Bulltank: I dont think you're making the glowstone ones anymore. You guys are on the better ones now I think? Not sure if Pati automated it
[1:53:38] lazyhot: @Bulltank I you know hat to do and you can keep the focus, maybe you can drop it down to 400h. that is why the average is 600 i guess.
[1:53:38] Moobot: You can find Waffle's Youtube channel here - https://youtube.com/giantwaffle
[1:53:47] Gniflod: inputting into slice n spice puts them in the correct slots automatically
[1:53:49] dylan0806: Export bus?
[1:53:55] Jaydepps00: "5 minutes. in an out. :) "
[1:53:57] TallBro97: we he says
[1:53:59] Bulltank: Who told you 14 days?
[1:54:03] GGoodGGuy: it is possible
[1:54:03] hisdue: its fine i've done poe kappa mode TrollDespair oh
[1:54:04] official_lynical: @Giantwaffle A friend og mine came with a riddle, " What comes before infinity? " is there a complete answer to it?
[1:54:10] Larklen: a little tomfoolery
[1:54:17] Jaydepps00: 14 days?
[1:54:25] GGoodGGuy: speed run gregtech :;D
[1:54:25] Jaydepps00: no way even w 10 people
[1:54:26] Billiards: you would need like a team of 8+people with someone always going 24/7
[1:54:26] S1rRogue: Assuming 10 hours a day per person, that's only 280 man hours in 14 days.
[1:54:30] Zyie: 14 days, 16h a day, 2 people, that's 448h
[1:54:31] Tasar_: yeah 336 hours - 14 days
[1:54:36] jmm548: how many were on thje server ?
[1:54:37] bcdmonkey: You have like 2.25
[1:54:37] DaFez_: @official_lynical a smaller infinity
[1:54:38] Niitr0gen: theres tons of downtime
[1:54:38] BiJay0: so how long will it take for you two?
[1:54:39] Bunjimus: especially not with all the wars they had
[1:54:42] Yakobro: they were in space by day 3, after fucking with pvp too lol
[1:54:46] Hede888: 10 people who raided other people for mats? peepoHmm
[1:54:51] Bulltank: 280 man hours is not enough for this pack
[1:54:53] hisdue: crafting wait times
[1:54:56] ok_juju: You have 3 people in this modpack Ci is playing also
[1:55:03] Jaydepps00: war?
[1:55:11] Yogithebaer: space ships got stolen
[1:55:11] Bulltank: @ok_juju Ci is "playing" COPIUM
[1:55:11] noturkeyjeremy: 10x CI's could
[1:55:18] Pati: they did colonize and extort groups
[1:55:19] Jaydepps00: wth? KEKW
[1:55:20] Scerion_TX: imagine trying to power that orbital laser..
[1:55:20] lazyhot: I guess for 14days you need to scale everything gigantic, like 50EBF's just for stainless and other long recepies.
[1:55:26] Zyie: @Bulltank Ci actually helped with some progress though LUL
[1:55:30] GGoodGGuy: if you have Ci in your team then RIP base
[1:55:34] Arkypoo909: Poor Church of Morrbius
[1:55:35] Bulltank: @Zyie a llittle bit here and there
[1:55:39] officialhunterx: could of ben scripted or something
[1:55:54] sorefingers: if i was on that server i would have scouted for enderchests and kept nabbing resources hahaha
[1:55:54] dylan0806: Level emitter?
[1:55:55] Niitr0gen: that sound is something...
[1:55:59] TigerLuv: the guy that stole the rocket LUL
[1:56:15] Jaydepps00: where is the main engineer? letMeCi @Giantwaffle
[1:56:25] blastfamus: Hi chat. Does anyone know if there's an issue with the recipes for vacuum tubes in the assembling machine in this pack?
[1:56:33] Rollingx: whats the name of the video agan?
[1:56:50] Bulltank: 500-600 hours if you dont keep saying "we dont need that many of this item, so i wont automate it" ya
[1:56:55] GGoodGGuy: there is no need to speed run this.. if you pay like this then this modpack is not for you
[1:57:08] BassPhass: I'm playing the non-CEu version and have spent loads of hours to get to the second level of circuits
[1:57:12] vexed_out: Ci's "contribution" is like minus 30 hours LULW
[1:57:17] TuxLafitte: On schedule to be complete by 2024 danHype
[1:57:20] Neroner: then limit it?
[1:57:21] frainsbreeze: Ci played for 45 hours and made Naquadah! waffle played for 173 hours and hasn't automated Signalum xD
[1:57:27] Jaydepps00: its a balance
[1:57:33] Kryllyk: Or you automate in a way that you can easily upgrade it later as well
[1:57:43] daemonaedryn: Thats a slippery slope though, gotta be careful how far forward you go
[1:57:45] n3wtpond: 10 hours a day for a team of 10 is 1400 hours in 14 days no?

[1:59:00] dontb4nmeplz: I mean building infrastructure to easily expand passive systems for basic items or infinite resources saves u so much time later
[1:59:01] maccabeus: nice
[1:59:13] bobolpwnz: I've upgraded my stainless blast to naq/zpm and it takes 5 ticks to make stainless monkaS
[1:59:42] dylan0806: Other ebms are also disconnected now
[1:59:51] Luthais: @n3wtpond you have to remember that just having 10 people doesn't mena you do 10 times the work. at some point you can't perfectly split the work.
[1:59:52] GoodOldXijan: and ugly
[1:59:59] Vovosunt: why is it a bad idea?
[2:00:01] hisdue: PauseChamp
[2:00:17] dylan0806: Ah okay thought that the cable went on
[2:00:17] mrleonehart: Just use one transeiver and a bunch of the 2mil conduits on the ebf only
[2:00:39] frainsbreeze: the LuV will need the double compressed
[2:01:00] frainsbreeze: IV is okay
[2:02:05] frainsbreeze: seems like a waste
[2:02:13] GameDadel: should you have different channels?
[2:02:14] Moobot: Come join the Waffle House Discord! <# https://discord.gg/fhGFtMuzdS
[2:02:16] Bulltank: seems like a great idead
[2:02:17] mysts_07: seems wasteful
[2:02:26] mrleonehart: How many ticks in a second?
[2:02:28] dylan0806: Wouldn’t you lose your power buffer?
[2:02:30] maccabeus: KEKW swing and a miss
[2:02:31] Pict1on: 20
[2:02:33] Tro95: Tro95 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 7 months! 
[2:02:34] S1rRogue: pati Pog
[2:02:34] boogerbomb01: Its not wasteful if its the last time you have to spend repalcing cables
[2:02:37] 1killersquirrel: I am watching yesterday's vod and at some point Waffle says "Pati just started the stream"... 30 sec later I get a notification that Pati started the stream for today LUL
[2:02:42] Timiderxbox: Change it to a new system that is not the same as solar? So a new after the capacitor bank?
[2:02:49] rDal_: Just curious, what is your method of material gathering this time around?
[2:02:51] Frankenstain: you could attach one to the multiblock crusher
[2:02:52] Larklen: giga miss
[2:02:59] Bulltank: @rDal_ early game is Deep Mob Learning
[2:03:03] bcdmonkey: Imagine missing a 69 month sub waffleSad
[2:03:13] TuxLafitte: Patti finally reporting for werk...
[2:03:20] DemonsDawn: is pati ever okay
[2:03:25] bcdmonkey: waffleH
[2:03:29] maccabeus: @bcdmonkey peepoPat
[2:03:35] sorefingers: i would probably separate the solars into multiple groups. that way if your ebfs pull too much power the whole base doesnt go down its just the ebfs that sre throttled
[2:04:30] Tro95: needs to be a way to upgrade conduits easily
[2:04:45] DrYProtoss: output fission reactor directly to capacitor bank?
[2:04:52] rDal_: @Bulltank even rn? in this stage?
[2:04:57] RefiixGaming: dzien dobru
[2:05:20] Bulltank: @rDal_ forever. It produces the basic resources for you. From there you can make a lot of other resources. Some resources need to be constantly mined through-out the game or bought with coins
[2:05:33] Nexhunter: japan's printers are from 1970 pepeLaugh
[2:05:37] Larklen: laser printers all the way :)
[2:05:37] xrokic: you could make a channel just for ebfs etc then you could easily turn of one channel if you have power issues an the rest still works
[2:05:39] LVL97Magikarp: i think thats becuase everybody hates printerrs
[2:05:40] DemonsDawn: just dont use ink printers
[2:05:43] OMICRON: supertank printers ftw
[2:05:43] Psyclone____: does ae2 have channel limitations?
[2:05:44] BiJay0: printers are designed this way intetionally
[2:05:45] LurkerNr5: we at least no longer use matrix printers :)
[2:05:46] Bulltank: @rDal_ they are doing bounties to get extra coins to buy resources they cant get from deep mob learning right now
[2:05:51] MrArrig: PC load letter wtf does that mean?
[2:05:58] dylan0806: He will use it in a day
[2:05:59] boogerbomb01: all printer r and d is going into locking down toner and ink
[2:06:06] hackett33: Its called planned obsolescence
[2:06:09] RefiixGaming: Print what just make it digital
[2:06:12] GuardMoony: clean headers doesn't use paper :/ put spews out inkt of small cushions
[2:06:13] Timiderxbox: Should be 10 with the diamond production aswell
[2:06:19] Houghdini: There's no money in making better consumer grade printers because commercial is where the money is at
[2:06:32] The_Wibe: automate the transcivers?
[2:06:35] Nexhunter: @MrArrig i can't tell if office space meme or if your ass doesn't actually know tobiiiSus
[2:06:47] Pict1on: Houghdini enterprise printers aint any better

[5:36:24] Tyraelol: any1 can help me with crafting in ae2 with a bucket-recipe? like infinite water source
[5:36:26] frainsbreeze: @Giantwaffle can you check what a magnetic separator (in game) is?
[5:36:26] jdog0616: make buttons you can press that dispense the resources
[5:36:48] Vovosunt: automate everything NODDERS
[5:36:54] InoUno: Having micro miners fully automated on-request is nice
[5:37:07] frainsbreeze: you can get trinium from this ez
[5:37:24] Vovosunt: but serotonin from autocrafting
[5:37:38] noturkeyjeremy: Can you use the copy paste tool to copy EBF's?
[5:37:51] Apparentthreat: bhenchodify no.
[5:37:51] Tapeman83: this is much easier to use when you start doing it, don't worry
[5:38:04] Apparentthreat: bhenchodify it won't copy tile entities like the inputs/outputs/hatches
[5:38:10] Apparentthreat: so you still end up placing a lot of blocks
[5:38:12] Tapeman83: it's the same as an ME pattern terminal, essentially, it's really easy
[5:38:41] primo_qwe: you want to setup auto-crafting for those, each craft needs one of those
[5:39:17] Vovosunt: it's cheap but annoying
[5:39:40] frainsbreeze: you are using a crafting card
[5:39:43] KnightofObv: the machine has a crafting card
[5:39:46] That0neGeye: Can’t you farm the starts from a DML?
[5:39:54] Littleme02: Seem counterproductive to make a tool to bypass a systemlimitation frustrating to make
[5:40:01] drsnaki96: iirc you need a packager and an unpackager per recipe. packager go anywhere on the system and unpackeger next to the machine
[5:40:05] o0mates0o: o0mates0o subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 48 months! 
[5:40:19] luthal_: how do you autocraft those big crafts
[5:40:32] Vovosunt: this one doesn't even need packager
[5:40:50] MrSlagle: you can put the items in the grid and then hit the 3x3 squares to distribute all the materials
[5:40:50] WARHERO322: Cant you add more on the buttons on the left side of the crafting table
[5:40:58] kane1941: Packager need for recipes with 10+ different items

[5:51:32] Tapeman83: you'll generally want an individual interface for the very long recipes, because you can't speed up the crafting, but many of the quick recipes can share the same crafter

[5:52:23] Moobot: You can find Waffle's Youtube channel here - https://youtube.com/giantwaffle
[5:52:58] Tapeman83: you should automate the packagers/unpackagers tbh, it's a pain to craft them by hand every time
[5:53:10] daemonaedryn: Its like a 3 tall, 1 wide machine. Packager over unpackager over crafter
[5:53:25] cmmeth: a recipe used 2
[5:53:27] xDDmg: you used them in another recipe
[5:53:29] daemonaedryn: used for encoder

[5:56:45] PureSpider: you only need one
[5:56:45] daemonaedryn: ye
[5:56:47] Tapeman83: yeah
[5:56:55] daemonaedryn: thats the pattern terminal
[5:56:59] PureSpider: a packager makes bigger recipes, like patterns
[5:57:01] Tapeman83: now connect it to the ae system
[5:57:06] itsfilipoficial: Now power and flux cables
[5:57:10] frainsbreeze: connect to the ME system first
[5:57:12] primo_qwe: no
[5:57:12] daemonaedryn: change processing
[5:57:15] primo_qwe: change processing
[5:57:25] Tapeman83: it needs to be on the correct table size for the recipe to save correctly
[5:57:59] Tapeman83: now save
[5:58:00] PureSpider: yes
[5:58:04] daemonaedryn: yep then save
[5:58:05] PureSpider: now save
[5:58:07] Tapeman83: and you can store a bunch of recipes on the same card
[5:58:09] daemonaedryn: :)
[5:58:10] PureSpider: correct
[5:58:12] Infra_Roodborstje: Are the fans just for aesthetic purposes or does it have a purpose?
[5:58:12] itsfilipoficial: Only put two drives
[5:58:18] daemonaedryn: you'll need two packages, one for packager and one for unpackager
[5:58:23] sorefingers: you only wanna save this in 3 of the patterns i think
[5:58:30] Tapeman83: two patterns, one for each
[5:58:32] daemonaedryn: the two tapes things
[5:58:34] kane1941: each needs a drive
[5:58:40] itsfilipoficial: 2 drives per craft
[5:58:41] jdog0616: one pattern per machine\
[5:58:41] Bernd135: Only have two patterns inside as you only need two of them 1 for packeger and unpackeging
[5:58:43] PureSpider: each needs an orange thing
[5:58:46] PureSpider: packager AND unpackager
[5:58:47] itsfilipoficial: 1 on each block
[5:58:47] daemonaedryn: one into packager
[5:58:48] primo_qwe: you need to put recipe both packager and unpackager so they both know
[5:58:50] daemonaedryn: one into unpackager
[5:58:56] MrSlagle: one goes into the packager and the unpackager
[5:58:59] PureSpider: correct
[5:58:59] Tapeman83: YEP
[5:59:00] daemonaedryn: YEP
[5:59:05] jdog0616: one pattern per machine, and many recipes per pattern...
[5:59:06] daemonaedryn: thats it
[5:59:11] itsfilipoficial: Request it now
[5:59:13] DarkbuilderX: Now you should be able to request
[5:59:13] PureSpider: they both need to understand each other
[5:59:14] rofl1436: not at all LULW
[5:59:15] Tapeman83: and each pattern can hold several recipes
[5:59:20] IamtheJK: More recipes per pattern?
[5:59:22] bobolpwnz: Also, enable blocking mode in unpackager
[5:59:32] Wetware: Where's that Staples 'Easy' Button?
[5:59:40] MrSlagle: you can save multiple recipes per drive @Giantwaffle
[5:59:45] Littleme02: I think the packager needs to know what materials to collect, then the unpacker takes the materials from the packager and injects it correctly into the table
[5:59:46] Tapeman83: it's slow
[5:59:52] primo_qwe: it takes time
[5:59:55] jdog0616: THAT WAS EASY
[5:59:58] daemonaedryn: PogChamp
[5:59:59] boogerbomb01: wooo!

[6:00:57] itsfilipoficial: It’s connected too ae2
[6:01:10] frainsbreeze: i think you can save upto 9 recipes per orange thingy
[6:01:19] PureSpider: you can save many recipes per orange tape thing, it's not one on each

[6:01:47] itsIffy: you can save more recipes on the orange tape thing

[7:13:43] Krysvac: na quah dree ah is the way to say it as someone who has seen it all
[7:13:45] Tasar_: depends what youre smoking
[7:13:50] IAmJester: the smaller the black hole, the faster it evaporates.
[7:13:51] jmm548: u drain the power off till it runs out so its safe
[7:13:51] MrWizard1974: @EndenPayne wrong lol
[7:13:52] Dibbsu: Susge Isn't that how big blackholes are formed
[7:13:54] Nexhunter: it fine
[7:14:02] InternetPlumber: it's good when it doesn't go boom, bad when it does
[7:14:06] Drazer_: blackhole bad, energy good
[7:14:13] 1StClassAlcoholic: Insert everything is fine meme
[7:14:15] Nexhunter: it is self contained by these ancient people from another galaxy
[7:14:16] Nexhunter: YEP
[7:14:17] GuardMoony: coliders also make small black holes
[7:14:18] jdog0616: there is a joke somewhere in here about microscopic something
[7:14:18] RamboRambowski: Naquadah and naquadriah are from stargate, they're like, magic uranium
[7:14:19] itsfilipoficial: No power on the infuser
[7:14:19] Dagmoo: dont they say this word in stargate? isnt this verifiable how they say it?
[7:14:23] hyperion6767: Its all good its in a box. Whats the worst that could happen.
[7:14:28] iWALL_E: its just a very small portal to another dimension
[7:14:29] Baske_T: its like fission is bad, nuclear power plant good
[7:14:44] RetreatingHairline: blackhole energy gnobad

[7:15:07] Nexhunter: depends upon how canadian the actor is @Dagmoo
[7:15:08] Tabakhase: The most recent big-filter event was Tom who could not resist on taking a peak inside, deleting 2.4 million years of progress in a pinch Kappa

[7:15:26] Moobot: Come join the Waffle House Discord! <# https://discord.gg/fhGFtMuzdS
[7:15:48] itsfilipoficial: Create a recipe for that
[7:15:53] TheUnrealOculus: There are so many modpacks based off gregtech that are so well done.
[7:16:23] itsfilipoficial: He’s making his own game
[7:16:24] DrYProtoss: gregtech is a good basis for insane mods
[7:16:29] RamboRambowski: is there any actual progress on GT6? I haven't seen anything recently
[7:16:30] stormzwest: algorithmX2
[7:16:30] Allmostdone: Why did the guy quit making mod packs?
[7:16:37] FinnYellowbelly: minecolonies GT edition?  make the minions do all the work...
[7:16:41] Vovosunt: I still hate it LUL
[7:16:49] Vovosunt: it's too much of the same stuff
[7:16:55] Smileynator: now let's start accepting the silly BEE mod, i hate that one too KEKW
[7:16:56] Luxen77: youre 26 days in, of course you love it
[7:17:08] MrSlagle: Directly from clips of the show "Na-quid-ah"
[7:17:22] jdog0616: maturity is a hell of a drug
[7:17:23] Smileynator: gregtech stockholm syndrome OMEGALUL
[7:17:27] manelins: i love gregtech,,, but it has always beaten me
[7:17:27] boogerbomb01: What about when he made it so that certain players just died if GT existed in the pack they played? Kappa
[7:17:38] Vovosunt: @Smileynator TRUE OMEGALUL
[7:17:41] Drazer_: you can actually automate things fully now. Back in early gregtech days it was grindy. there weren't conduits or storage
[7:17:45] manelins: its a love-hate
[7:18:18] boogerbomb01: And when it comes to Minecraft what is the definition of "grindy"
[7:18:21] Jaydepps00: Wokege
[7:18:25] InternetPlumber: enderio makes gregtech playable
[7:18:26] DanJ3tt: Wokege
[7:18:29] itsfilipoficial: It was when it was a stand-alone mod instead of a ic2 add on
[7:18:34] Filikeu: Imo it removes the essence of minecraft, basically no exploration, basically no nature/environment interaction...
[7:18:43] Tapeman83: Vanilla is actually much grindier than Gregtech nowadays tbh, since you have so many tools in modded
[7:18:50] TheUnrealOculus: @boogerbomb01 Scicraft
[7:18:57] Vovosunt: new cave updates are amazing
[7:19:00] DFron1: so cosmetic vs deep
[7:19:06] boogerbomb01: Big massive ultra mega builds that take a year to build just arent fun to me
[7:19:07] ChromaCym: No matter how much new content they add, I always feel like I've already seen it all
[7:19:10] Tapeman83: I've never liked exploration in this game. I like crafting and buliding-based stuff
[7:19:20] DatoPotatoDato: yeah i dont like how they try to expand heavily on only one thing
[7:19:25] KritterIsBack: we probably outgrew it
[7:19:26] Kryllyk: YouTube is in a bad spot with Minecraft right now as well.  It takes like a full week to make one video
[7:19:28] Smileynator: The sense of wonder has gone, as did our innocense. And now the mods make it new from time to time
[7:19:32] MrWizard1974: Thats because you're getting old and starting to reject change
[7:19:43] InternetPlumber: zero
[7:19:44] boogerbomb01: 10
[7:19:45] Luxen77: ^
[7:19:46] Tabakhase: no real immersion and then trying to be a spooky explorer is odd you mean?
[7:19:46] prairydog: i expect better graphics tbh
[7:19:48] Apparentthreat: far fewer
[7:19:49] d3vrand0m: everything they are adding has been added by a mod long before ... no reason to go past 1.12
[7:19:52] jdog0616: vanilla minecraft is fun with friends, but many games are.
[7:20:02] cjthedjdolphin: Solo? 0. With other people? Probably thousands.
[7:20:02] DKJensen98: 100maybe
[7:20:02] hyperion6767: without modded Minecraft is just plain boring for me
[7:20:03] WARHERO322: Its simple
[7:20:06] Smileynator: graphics are consistent, they don't need to be better
[7:20:11] CocoTheClown: i only play modded :)
[7:20:12] notn3w: Hytale Beta soon™
[7:20:13] SubbDogg: But I would say the newer base game updates do make modpacks more enjoyable
[7:20:14] Tapeman83: I do like vanilla a lot, but I like modded much more
[7:20:22] Tapeman83: na-quad-ree-ah
[7:20:25] thecodealive_original: minecraft graphics are part of gameplay imo
[7:20:28] stormzwest: i keep saying, minecraft is a coding MIRACLE dude, java sucks balls
[7:20:31] DemonicHell3: best thing about this mod pack is the spheres that Ci made.
[7:20:32] RamboRambowski: quad, not quay, D:
[7:20:34] prairydog: not a reskin tho
[7:20:37] Drazer_: pati is correct pronunciation
[7:20:38] Tapeman83: quad, not quay
[7:20:39] Ksolo24: na qua dah
[7:20:42] orillion: MONKERS how hes pronoucing it
[7:20:42] MrSlagle: Nah-quid-ah is the base metal
[7:20:43] Rocknsugar: minecraft graphics are great because its mostly easy to tell what blocks are what, even when watching someone else playing
[7:20:46] masturi66: NAK qua dah
[7:20:46] Ksolo24: na quay dree ah
[7:20:49] Kouga00: omg chat stop helping, your making it worse...hahaha
[7:20:53] 1StClassAlcoholic: I love the concept but can’t see myself committing this much time in to it
[7:20:59] DrYProtoss: he need to go watch stargate

[7:22:01] DrYProtoss: na-quod-ree-uh
[7:22:16] itsfilipoficial: Time to automate the wires?

[7:22:28] TheUnrealOculus: Streaming allows talking to viewers while mindlessly working on the game.
