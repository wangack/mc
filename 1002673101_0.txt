[0:21:00] daemonaedryn: The end-game of this modpack seems barely thought out, for example a room of magmatic dynamos gives me more than enough power for anything Ive needed
[0:21:20] Fooker: What else will you do?
[0:21:29] daemonaedryn: YEP
[0:21:36] a_brink: Will I study for my final today? Find out next time on DBZ

[0:21:49] merginflergin: @a_brink true

[0:22:02] airforce9000: PogChamp
[0:22:10] TheIrishGuy: Its like full spirt doing it and then just giving up and shitting out the end to stop the project

[0:22:24] Tom7258: do you have a team to work on the modpack?
[0:22:35] MarquesCoding: MarquesTwitch subscribed at Tier 3. They've subscribed for 33 months! How'd did your game jam go?
[0:22:37] dogma802: Then you'd end up with a shitty early game potentionally
[0:22:37] Moobot: Support Waffle by using his Epic creator code: Giantwaffle
[0:22:43] Firstnecron: Yeah, play testing is huge
[0:22:51] daftMOOSE: you should put a vacuumilator in there
[0:23:00] lunar_ish: just have chat be playtesters Kappa
[0:23:06] RoKaX: Soaryn can find 1000 exploits the first day
[0:23:08] aundros: Do you have any contact with wyld waffle? he has lots of experience with modpacks and does some playtesting on stream i believe
[0:23:09] dogma802: weoweoweoweoweoweoweo
[0:23:15] MarquesCoding: I didn't take part, sadly... To much uni work @Giantwaffle :(
[0:23:39] ForgottenTime: Big cube Pog
[0:23:41] TheIrishGuy: @Giantwaffle do you start at the END or
[0:23:43] daemonaedryn: I feel like early game will be easier to make than end game
[0:23:45] daftMOOSE: @Giantwaffle  RokaX is right, just give the pack to Soaryn. He'll find any exploit in no time at all
[0:23:54] Firstnecron: Soaryn doesnt report bugs.
[0:23:54] TheIrishGuy: Dimension
[0:23:58] daemonaedryn: KEKW
[0:24:52] daemonaedryn: Im thinking the next pack I play will be one that lets you become stupid OP since both manufactio and this pack dont really let you become more powerful
[0:25:15] BOLT_M4G1C: name?
[0:25:23] daemonaedryn: YEP
[0:25:27] aundros: po3 daemon? think you can get pretty OP in that one
[0:25:45] aman36000: 2
[0:25:46] ZyianDev: 2 Expert
[0:25:48] Jomeaga: there is no 3
[0:25:49] daemonaedryn: @aundros Maybe, Ive not decided yet
[0:25:53] ninopanda: skyopolis 4 KEKW
[0:25:58] airforce9000: PogChamp do it
[0:26:04] Jomeaga: E2E is my favourite pack and it's the one I've gotten furthest in
[0:26:05] jupi1001: @ninopanda KEKW
[0:26:07] ZyianDev: 2 Expert is very good, really well optimized
[0:26:17] kkisame2: KEKW HYPERCLAP

[0:26:27] RafaLorenzo: Good morning chat and waffle
[0:26:28] 3968omer: I played it on expert. its amazing
[0:26:31] TheSparMan: dont they have a newer one?
[0:26:31] daemonaedryn: Is there a difference between E2E and E26?
[0:26:33] 3968omer: So much hours of content
[0:26:34] Jomeaga: you CAN bumrush it in a couple days
[0:26:37] ninopanda: you should do skyopolis 4 on 1.16.5 i have been playing for about a month so far
[0:26:38] daemonaedryn: KEKW
[0:26:41] Nincy1986: buuuuuuugz
[0:26:41] ZyianDev: I sped about 1-2 months on it
[0:26:43] Jomeaga: but if you setup automation and stuff then a lot longer
[0:26:51] aman36000: Alot easier than Infinity Evolved and no Erebus
[0:27:04] daemonaedryn: 650 quests and apparently the end goal is to craft the creative items
[0:27:11] Apparentthreat: @ninopanda show waffle that bee dimension from skyopolis KEKW
[0:27:31] Nincy1986: that bug tht stucks on you face is scarry as shit
[0:27:33] aundros: Erebus is a good idea in theory, but how it was done made it less fun, and scary lol
[0:27:36] KnickKen: does it have EMC though? always didnt like it
[0:27:41] lunar_ish: basically turn survival into creative
[0:27:51] aman36000: Clean the world
[0:27:53] daemonaedryn: A story based ending
[0:27:56] ninopanda: @DaemonSzyman have you tried skyopolis 4?
[0:27:58] Benno1472: voltz --> pumping out antimatter
[0:27:59] lunar_ish: an item that nukes the world and start a new
[0:28:01] Firstnecron: I feel like infinite gets pretty boring. Thats like.. every pack it feels
[0:28:02] i7oldgregg: nuke lol
[0:28:03] Headshotzz: Waffle will you ever do cycling streams again?
[0:28:03] PepzzOG: Mine a bitcoin xD
[0:28:05] aundros: Oh easy. The one where the game play itself in the end

[0:28:19] daemonaedryn: @ninopanda Nah manufactio was my first pack and this is my second pepeLaugh
[0:28:25] aman36000: @Giantwaffle There was a modpack where you clear the world of taint, that was really cool
[0:28:26] airforce9000: @giantwaffle what's your opinion on sevtrch ages? should i play it?
[0:28:39] the_veh: I like rlcraft
[0:28:41] ninopanda: @DaemonSzyman i want waffle to play it.... just because of one zone
[0:28:42] nFteddy: nFteddy subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 17 months! 
[0:28:50] twiQsP: best endgame would be getting an item that deletes everything and kills you
[0:28:54] Jomeaga: I think you'd like Ultimate Alchemy. You start with infinite cobble/wood/creative flight and you have to automate through tons of mods to make clay
[0:28:56] daemonaedryn: I would like a modpack that actually has a story, giving you valid reasons to actually do things, where the ending feels like the actual end
[0:28:59] Firstnecron: Nah, we havent updated it really :)
[0:28:59] 4729_zex: crash landing most iconic mod pack
[0:29:04] daemonaedryn: @ninopanda let me guess, bees KEKW
[0:29:04] ShuxDC: sevtech is rewarding af
[0:29:09] thebodge: sevtech ages of the sky was the best modpack I've ever played
[0:29:19] thebodge: and my friends will attest to that
[0:29:24] ninopanda: @DaemonSzyman mmmhmmm you teleport into a bee hive KEKW
[0:29:53] aundros: @Giantwaffle Did you play that modpack back in the day where you had to make a village and give items to help grow and support said village? forgot the name of it
[0:29:59] QuesoBad0nga: you can tab
[0:30:02] Nincy1986: TAB Kreygasm

[0:32:12] QuesoBad0nga: yes
[0:32:16] hypnoshroom333: KEKW
[0:32:19] ninopanda: @Giantwaffle https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/skyopolis-4 here is a different style of modpack that you get resources from different types of water
[0:32:24] Nincy1986: save it for later?
[0:32:25] RanOutOfUsernameIdeas: KEKW
[0:32:28] QuesoBad0nga: LUL
[0:32:30] MiraPacku: reinforced NODDERS
[0:33:02] daemonaedryn: I think the lowest level energy hatch isnt good enough to make the glitched machines
[0:33:31] daemonaedryn: Mine is currently the Normal one and it works
[0:33:31] aundros: Found the name of it. Millenaire. It was such a great mod @0x4273
[0:34:03] daemonaedryn: Just got the giant room, Kreygasm what will I do with all this space
[0:34:08] Nincy1986: DaemonSzyman wht was that machine that drove you nutz making?

[1:05:31] Riddixdan: there's also dynamic memory allocation
[1:05:32] Winner5001: everything is virtual and is being handled by kernel i believe
[1:05:35] dogma802: A process(program) is given it's own virtual address space that separated from other processes
[1:05:36] Chronoes: A program can't access another program's memory. Except with the Spectre meltdown and such
[1:05:41] Chronoes: But that's been patched
[1:06:00] ZennonTheThird: thats why you shouldn't give MC more than half your ram otherwise your PC could suffer
[1:06:06] ShionSinX: @Chronoes Cheat Engine Kappa
[1:06:13] dogma802: You'd need the kernel to do some fuckshit in order for two processes to overlap in memory in a destructive way

[1:06:54] dogma802: I've made an RTOS in one of my classes
[1:06:55] Chronoes: @ShionSinX that's mostly because it hooks onto the program itself and that is user-initiated
[1:07:15] Stonan: RIP Terry
[1:07:19] JusticetoAll: the youtube algorithm also gave me that tetris os video

[1:46:39] Apakawata: Didn't his parents own some mines that possibly used a dash of slave labor?
[1:46:40] mrb0808: the thing is @fortunateson91 money is made through law usually its through bypasses of law and such so you actually didnt earn it
[1:46:45] Klorell: lots of real billions dollars ideas were given to humanity like the polio vaccine
[1:46:52] PossibleScam: A dash of slave labour.

[1:50:33] SeeAGamer: Can you make and "deploy" a second version that is your updates?
[1:50:33] Crozbo: learn Interfaces
[1:50:46] macey17: Is it spelling Kappa
[1:50:47] Apparentthreat: Crazyfox55 like, touch typing?
[1:50:51] mechoriet: localstorage i think
[1:50:55] Stillglade: browsers have indexeddb built in you can access to store stuff in
[1:50:57] PepzzOG: Need mute botton !
[1:51:01] SlaskoCZ: local storage or index db
[1:51:07] Apparentthreat: singleton sounds like an insult
[1:51:12] Chronoes: interface is not storage
[1:51:14] mugging_monkey: when do they do the reviewing for your game?
[1:51:21] bazketcase: you cannot store in an interface an interface is like a template for designing classes
[1:51:21] Apparentthreat: a class?
[1:51:25] Chronoes: it's just a definition of what a class should look like
[1:51:26] Yatko: u mean using inheritance?
[1:51:28] Soul_Synergy: Yes
[1:51:29] FlyingVillage: You mean a abstract class?
[1:51:30] ZyianDev: a constructor
[1:51:31] SlaskoCZ: interface is just interface, you mean object
[1:51:34] PossibleScam: Yeah. As a array with scoping elements.
[1:51:36] MagnesiumOxide: You could have classes that implement your interface, yes
[1:51:41] PossibleScam: Or as a class with properties.

[1:51:47] natsu130: parent object
[1:51:49] bazketcase: I agree interfaces are good. you'll need to practice!
[1:51:49] Benno1472: a class
[1:51:58] Apparentthreat: Yes. You'd make a block class
[1:52:02] Klorell: indeed interface is the solution here
[1:52:06] Doritobob269: Waffle, i think you're thinking of making implementations of an interface
[1:52:07] digipex12: look at scriptable objects
[1:52:17] QuesoBad0nga: you should learn OOP and design patters for games
[1:52:25] Apparentthreat: make class, override functions, etc.
[1:52:28] QuesoBad0nga: It will make your life much easier
[1:52:35] Stillglade: your entire program is hardcoded to the unity UI. Instead better to model the entire game internally and then attach it to the UI.
[1:52:50] Stillglade: so basically imagine it working from the commandline
[1:52:58] Crozbo: Interfaces describes what api object need to implement and you use Interfaces in function arguments, so you ca use any Class implement that Interface
[1:53:12] itzSimondr98: pepeLaugh
[1:53:15] Enconi: that's a bitch
[1:53:33] bazketcase: interfaces describe a class
[1:53:42] natsu130: interface only say what object can do but object do the things
[1:53:45] Chronoes: interface is a common descriptor of classes that implement it
[1:53:46] GUARD14N21: GUARD14N21 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 74 months! 
[1:53:48] Riddixdan: interface is a blueprint for a class
[1:53:50] QuesoBad0nga: Interfece its just a declaration
[1:53:50] Crazyfox55: @Giantwaffle An interface is a contract that multiple different classes can implement
[1:53:52] Klorell: you cant instanciate a class
[1:53:58] Klorell: interface lol
[1:54:01] MagnesiumOxide: You can't instantiate an interface, but you can a class
[1:54:14] QuesoBad0nga: describes what a class has to impelents
[1:54:22] SkywardDev: No they are contracts that define classes
[1:54:25] Crozbo: Interface is more generic, Classes can implement multiple Interfaces
[1:54:25] Soul_Synergy: Classes implement interfaces
[1:54:26] SkywardDev: Not objects
[1:54:26] KoniQ111: just slap all methods from class into interface and remove lines inside them Pepega
[1:54:29] CanadianHealthCare: A vehicle is an interface, a Ford truck is a class
[1:54:31] QuesoBad0nga: you can instatiate both
[1:54:33] natsu130: like you have ORE interface and IRON well be ORE and ore can be mined but in iron ore you will say when you mine it you will get 5 cents
[1:54:34] grimmn: an interface is an abstract class
[1:54:38] MagnesiumOxide: An interface never gets instantiated, an interface is basically a contract saying that it'll have a guaranteed set of methods or properties
[1:54:46] Stillglade: abstraction - generic Ore interface that has common methods like getMinDepth, getMaxDepth, getMoneyValue. Then each type of Ore would impelement the interface and the code that interacts doesn't need to know the specifics of each ore - just interacts with the interface
[1:54:51] ZyianDev: Interface: "Run Motor", Class: "Electric Motor", "Gas Motor", etc.
[1:54:52] QuesoBad0nga: is like Hierarchy (objects and childs) but for methos
[1:54:58] Doritobob269: @giantwaffle In minecraft, blocks could be an interface and all minecraft blocks are implementations of the interface. the interface is like a list of variables and the implementation class would be where each variable is defined in the constructor
[1:55:04] bazketcase: you need to practice. don't guess! you'll pick it up
[1:55:06] TheUsefulDistraction: An interface is like a group of functionality or set of properties that a class would like to implement, like both a 'snake' and 'goblin' class will fulfill a 'monster' interface
[1:55:11] SkywardDev: Correct
[1:55:12] Crazyfox55: Y E S
[1:55:13] ZyianDev: yes
[1:55:15] TheUsefulDistraction: Yes
[1:55:16] Soul_Synergy: yes
[1:55:22] SkywardDev: It's good for polymorphism too
[1:55:22] Crozbo: yea
[1:55:28] Chronoes: Yes, but each class must implement the "click" method
[1:55:34] SkywardDev: ^
[1:55:35] Crozbo: and different Class can implement more Interfaces
[1:55:46] SkywardDev: Yes
[1:55:47] TheUsefulDistraction: Right
[1:55:49] Crazyfox55: yup
[1:55:56] johnshepherd104: Yes with polymorophism
[1:56:09] Crazyfox55: He's a genius.
[1:56:12] AnonWithLove: An interface is a form of contract. The class that implements the interface has to live up to the contract set in the interface :-)
[1:56:14] KoniQ111: I just understood more than on my web app design classes
[1:56:14] SuperKnight106: An interfface defines a set of methods. So if different machines all accept energy then they can all implement an energy acceptance feature while belonging to different classes of machines
[1:56:27] Charlesiv: an interface doesnt tell you how you must implement a method, just that you must implement it

[2:29:59] Bkmoto28: @Giantwaffle just make the changes and slap a 2 on after the name and have it as a second game
[2:30:18] Vietnomnom: fungus amongus
[2:30:24] Allmostdone: chrome is the least secure bloated piece of crap that is full of google made holes
[2:30:38] Vietnomnom: @Allmostdone firefox :)
[2:30:59] Vietnomnom: privacy first is waaaaay better than google's "Collect everything"

[2:31:14] Allmostdone: Firefox. Special made almost anythign other than chrome
[2:31:15] Arimil: It is a positive feedback loop.
[2:31:20] Kaylome97: the crucible is the best way i think

[2:32:08] Kaylome97: the fuel source is thorium tho which he doesnt have
[2:32:13] itzSimondr98: Don't need thorium, can use a tourch or a lava source etc as well
[2:32:15] daemonaedryn: Thorium?
[2:32:17] AComfyKnight: you can get thorium from an isotope separator and a decay hastner
[2:32:27] MURDERDOME: is this pack really resource intensive? I tried to play that huge pack a while ago and couldn't run it

[2:32:48] itzSimondr98: DaemonSzyman I got my thorium from the decay generators YEP
[2:33:09] daemonaedryn: @itzSimondr98 I tried that, for some reason it takes forever, way longer than the recipe says it would
[2:33:17] AComfyKnight: @MURDERDOME not really, it seems to be decently optimized
[2:33:26] Allmostdone: i’d rather see Waffle use an open source utube watcher than a 250meg panel
[2:33:27] HoytZephyr: Also I don't think the decay generator is working if the power doesn't have anywhere to go
[2:33:33] daemonaedryn: Giant room?
[2:33:46] itzSimondr98: DaemonSzyman It went way faster fi you placed a uranium block surronded with decay gens
[2:33:47] MURDERDOME: @the_sazed awesome, might have to try it out
[2:33:56] daemonaedryn: @itzSimondr98 I did that aswell KEKW

[2:51:34] ZyianDev: if only it was as easy as your morning coffee
[2:51:36] M1k3D3l7a: gym*
[2:51:40] daemonaedryn: My friend was a fitness nut for like 4 years, lost most of his progress over a month of drinking
[2:52:23] Orejo58: Just dont stop working out 4Head
[2:52:28] n8level: I've known people who suddenly stopped working out and ended up in worse shape (round) than before they started working out -- biology is strange
[2:52:55] MrChurchh: Chug a beer and pop some Low T pills
[2:53:12] フリクリ: agreed. seen the same info on muscle and alcohol
[2:53:24] panic_inducing_citrus: There are T pills?
[2:53:37] tioberto: Beer has lots of proteins hehe

[2:53:44] BONBONNIE13: wow I didn't know I was a cyclist pepeLaugh
[2:53:44] MastrRob: Yep, we called em recovery beer
[2:53:46] brenner1265: A beer is much different than going to a bar and getting wasted
[2:53:46] ontoppofit: @n8level guessing it is cause they kept eating the same amount as when they were working out so they gained a lot of weight
[2:53:47] TelRehiad: @desertpenguin27 usually  shot
[2:53:54] Allmostdone: it’s almost impossible to build muscle without T. For men at least
[2:53:55] M1k3D3l7a: We have a beer called "Radler" (engl for Cyclist) an alcohol free beer with sprite
[2:54:40] MrChurchh: Female body builders take testosterone supps
[2:54:43] daemonaedryn: I remember when my friend was trying to lower his body fat to the low 1 digits, god his schedule was insane
[2:55:07] n8level: @ontoppofit metabolism has momentum, keeps delivering material you aren't using and storing it as fat and ya, appetite stays the same for awhile
[2:55:10] MrChurchh: The point is that they can't get the way they are naturally
[2:55:12] daemonaedryn: I can do 2 hours max
[2:55:14] ssquire14: radler isn't necessarily alcohol free
[2:55:27] babyaddalyn: you sit 8h begind a pc? they sit in gym instead :p
[2:55:28] VoylRL: if you were in the gym for that long you better get some movies or TV shows in

[2:56:25] M1k3D3l7a: have you seen the GCN video on how much training you need?
[2:56:27] Omeyn: HIIT for 15-20 minutes is lit
[2:56:29] Drmaxishere: i think nutrition is also an important part
[2:56:30] fadedredx: I’ll spend 2-3 hours in the gym. But I’m also training to dive D1 in college. @giantwaffle
[2:56:35] VoylRL: you did some cycling streams right?
[2:56:36] daemonaedryn: problem is I ament trying to stay fit, Im trying to lose weight which takes a hell of a long time LUL
[2:56:37] Frost_Bite86: 15 Minutes = Very High Intensity 30 Minutes = Elevated heart rate.
[2:56:39] VoylRL: do you still do those?
[2:56:48] her0zer0: pre covid I enjoyed going to a rock climbing gym for like 3 hours a few times a week with a friend. but that doesn't feel like working out for the sake of working out.
[2:57:17] VoylRL: You used to have a Vr For cycling do you still have/use that?

[3:06:57] Rozz161: youll see the radiation bar turn red if youre getting rad sickness
[3:07:07] RussianRainbowTV: the bar is your radiation, the 827uRads/t is how much radiation there is per tick in the environment

[3:16:25] RussianRainbowTV: what about a turtle to place the blocks then activate a dropper for the redstone?
[3:16:28] DecoyOcelot: vacum, shift right click, but you have to stand farther away or you just open it
[3:16:38] AComfyKnight: I just put a hopper in the middle, the vacuumulator sucks up the redstone when you drop it sometimes

[3:19:43] daemonaedryn: Cant you undo?
[3:19:44] Madarion: @kingdigun yeah but there seems no way to drop the redstone and only pick up ender pearls
[3:20:12] AtchTwoOh: place them manually?
[3:20:12] Nexhunter: just finish filling in the block??

[3:21:06] Xenotics: @Giantwaffle the fact that i watched you participate in Ludum Dare, might actaully have gotten me a second interview for a job i want!
[3:21:11] babyaddalyn: the collecter from thermal
[3:21:23] Foooks: vacuum block?
[3:21:32] HoytZephyr: You can filter it
[3:21:32] Moobot: You can find Waffle's Youtube channel here - https://youtube.com/giantwaffle
[3:21:35] kingdigun: You can, filter it with shift-right click
[3:21:42] AComfyKnight: it doesn't have a filter option
[3:21:44] DecoyOcelot: we did
[3:21:51] HoytZephyr: Multiple people did
[3:21:57] Xenotics: They wanted to know if i was interested in coding, and i mentioned that, and one of the interviewes participated himself, so he was all about that

[3:23:53] Foooks: up a block perhaps?
[3:23:53] benjamin_berry: @g1ng3rs you can automate everything in this pack
[3:23:54] UECNSNemesis: KEKW the dev out-brained you
[3:24:06] Larklen: can you raise it up and detect from underneath? I assume same issue would happen though
[3:24:07] Scerion_TX: what about just redstone?
[3:24:15] benjamin_berry: The projectors emit with a comparator
[3:24:15] blackhawksfan97: can you raise it up 1 block?
[3:24:16] UECNSNemesis: detect from above?
[3:24:22] script_terror: i use a dropper from above
[3:24:23] AComfyKnight: move the scanners up one block
[3:24:26] itzSimondr98: benjamin_berry well it requires you to program yo do so, which like 99% dont understand how to do KEKW
[3:24:27] Nincy1986: try detecting it from above?
[3:24:59] TheWumbologist101: what do you normally eat in a day waffle?
[3:25:13] benjamin_berry: @giantwaffle the projectors emit resdtone
[3:25:21] Tithonius: ^^
[3:25:28] AtchTwoOh: just place the projectors one level up
[3:26:21] benjamin_berry: It’s a comparator I believe
[3:26:37] Maykr__: then you could put a hopper under the center
[3:26:48] Maykr__: auto collect to fire the next
[3:26:57] MrArrig: Probably has to be normal comparator
[3:27:07] MrCrobe: @Giantwaffle Completely non related, but have you seen the great moose migration?
[3:27:25] winchesterboys: what about a piston ?
[3:27:38] splix661: it's for a lever to them off for low power PCs
[3:27:46] Mapleton: @MrCrobe ill migrate your moose PepeFlushed
[3:27:57] brenner1265: Invert signal
[3:27:59] MrCrobe: @Mapleton Hit me up on LUL
[3:28:05] toclosebutfar2: invert it?
[3:28:19] benjamin_berry: The signal goes low when it finishes.
[3:28:19] UECNSNemesis: probably need a timer then unfortunately
[3:28:27] Mephesto_: Tripwire?
[3:28:31] UECNSNemesis: do observers exist?
[3:28:35] omar_i_: you're almost done, dont worry about automating it
[3:28:42] MrArrig: Why can't you continuously fire redstone?
[3:28:47] brenner1265: repeater out of the block with a redstone signal going into it
[3:28:51] LanceDH: Can't you check for a blockupdate under the corner?
[3:28:56] QB_3: something like observer
[3:28:57] Rene_211ful: just time it
[3:28:59] Foooks: sounds like it best to do a timed event as it may not be able to detect the block being placed
[3:29:07] brenner1265: susHmm
[3:29:13] Nexhunter: interrupts the lasers yo D:
[3:29:14] halloweenkid9: cant you just detect from above?
[3:29:14] Smileynator: send redstone wire powered into a corner, then on the other side of the corner a repeater out? PepoThink i forgot how powered blocks send signals
[3:29:18] UECNSNemesis: could put an observer upside down from the top most block and lead a signal to an AND gate with the inverted comparator
[3:29:22] Stillglade: redstone torch on one side of the corner, and line on the other
[3:29:24] Shiiratama: does an observer below 1 block work?
[3:29:26] Tithonius: and you dont wanna monitor when the drop is done? that would show when its ready? you want when its placed, not empty correct?
[3:29:33] Nexhunter: CHAT ARE YA'LL LISTENING uhnRee
[3:29:34] Moobot: Come join the Waffle House discord https://discord.gg/G5FeeveP3c and chat with the community! Remember to link your Twitch account in the Settings (gear) > Connections for subscriber channels.
[3:29:34] TiddlesnBits: @giantwaffle would it work if you raised everything up and then have a circuit underneath that is inverted. when you place the block on top have it cut the signal which flips signal on.
[3:29:34] TelRehiad: you can do it with the "integrated dynamics" mod
[3:29:35] Tithonius: you could monitor when the item comes through
[3:29:35] BlackBattousai: Are there porcupines?
[3:29:48] Nexhunter: im getting angry at java and ya'll uhnRee
[3:29:49] TiddlesnBits: cut the circuit*
[3:30:03] UECNSNemesis: didn't know it was 1.12 *shrug*
[3:30:05] AtchTwoOh: can you do something with detecting it from the bottom, if you redo the setup one higher?
[3:30:07] my_bedroom: @tiddlesnbits, that was what i was thinking too
[3:30:08] Smileynator: send redstone wire powered into a corner, then on the other side of the corner a repeater out? PepoThink i forgot how powered blocks send signals though, should light up when the block is placed
[3:30:09] scappa_1986: can the signal be detected from the top?
[3:30:09] Allmostdone: how about you watch it yourself?
[3:30:09] TelRehiad: see if there is the item world reader part of integrated dynamics
[3:30:11] Zwazi: hey waffle, I know there's no observers, but have you tried an observer? Kappa
[3:30:14] TxMaverick88: @giantwaffle just move it up one KEKW (this is a joke' please no bannerino)
[3:30:21] HoytZephyr: Observers exist in 1.12
[3:30:27] Duvenel: Think someone suggested that a min ago
[3:30:35] Madarion: put everything one up, integrate a cobblestone on the lowest level, get ur corner detector + mine the cobble
[3:30:36] Allmostdone: you guys are funny
[3:30:36] TiddlesnBits: @my_bedroom yeah that would be the solution.
[3:30:37] Madarion: LUL
[3:30:42] benjamin_berry: You could maybe do it buy moving it up 2 blocks and using a daylight sensor
[3:30:45] 4729_zex: Observer is added in 1.11
[3:30:46] TiddlesnBits: thats the only way I can see doing it easily.
[3:30:54] Nincy1986: rapidfire and what sticks sticks otherwise gets collected and back into the droper?
[3:30:54] script_terror: that what i said
[3:31:09] Askjong: @Giantwaffle Put a repeater in a corner and use the other side of the corner block as a power block
[3:31:09] cooljas19: KEKW

[3:31:36] AtchTwoOh: from the top?
[3:31:39] Foooks: above?
[3:31:42] Nexhunter: put it on the roof
[3:31:45] Drobotic: from the top or under
[3:31:54] script_terror: and you can use the vac to pick it up and send it back up
[3:32:01] Nexhunter: KEKW
[3:32:03] toclosebutfar2: the bottom?
[3:32:04] Nexhunter: god damn that debv
[3:32:05] daemonaedryn: KEKW
[3:32:09] TiddlesnBits: @giantwaffle raise it all up one and place it underneath it.
[3:32:10] Mephesto_: Why no tripwire?
[3:32:10] brenner1265: Under?
[3:32:13] Nincy1986: thats illegal!
[3:32:18] MrMoneybagMan: no automation KEKW

[3:32:40] Stillglade: the floor isn't interfering..
[3:32:43] Smileynator: why not with observer
[3:32:44] TxMaverick88: Try under KEKW
[3:32:45] Cdup07: the floor
[3:32:45] itzSimondr98: Its not gonna work, indeed YEP
[3:32:49] MilezFPS: If the floor isnt detecting, then yea under works
[3:32:52] MagnumCopus: isnt there blocks under it rn?
[3:32:55] babyaddalyn: your on a floor now so yes under works :p
[3:32:58] Bleu_Forge: It's already on the floor KEKW
[3:33:00] TiddlesnBits: is the 2 block no zone on the vertical axis as well?
[3:33:02] cooljas19: pepeLaugh
[3:33:06] Helo_KiX: its on the floor now and its not interfering
[3:33:06] OfficerMilkshake: opencomputers was fun automating machine wall
[3:33:22] goldmarcel: Are Tripwires in there ? Have no idea about the MC versions anymore
[3:33:27] UECNSNemesis: KEKW the brute force method
[3:33:27] LordDynom: PauseChamp
[3:33:28] itzSimondr98: 5Head
[3:33:34] TelRehiad: Ok.. so this is the way to do it.. computer craft
[3:33:39] Nincy1986: waffle the floor isnt interfering with the signal @Giantwaffle
[3:33:44] UECNSNemesis: have the vac succ the redstone and then just feed it back in, absolute madlad genius
[3:33:44] aelus: it's LUA time
[3:34:07] benjamin_berry: The floor is special blocks
[3:34:17] Larklen: tick ppHop tick
[3:34:24] itzSimondr98: ppHop
[3:34:25] MrMoneybagMan: why not just change the timer
[3:34:48] Kaley4D: unpopular opinion probably but the gamestages mod is soooooo annoying and so unnatural
[3:35:05] Nexhunter: fuck the slowed timer
[3:35:25] Allmostdone: I was wondering what was picking it up
[3:35:29] Stillglade: comparator off the projector for this one
[3:35:41] MrMoneybagMan: is there a builder in this pack
[3:35:42] itzSimondr98: Nexhunter I mean, the slowed timer makes less clicking KEKW
[3:35:53] Nexhunter: yea but more clicking is better KEKW
[3:35:59] TelRehiad: falling edge?
[3:36:07] Enconi: use the copy-paste thingy in auto-clicker
[3:36:11] yoveler: osmosis
[3:36:26] UECNSNemesis: that's where you could use the comparator right? to time when to click
[3:36:39] fadedredx: Can’t you do a hopper comparator system so that it fires once it detects a pearl has been picked up @giantwaffle
[3:36:46] Larklen: thats when you just make a new room Kappa
[3:36:46] Nexhunter: D: loose redstone D:
[3:36:54] Watertoad: just stack another projector NODDERS
[3:37:03] coolcake2: is there not a /wanOops kinda deal with this ?
[3:37:18] WGG25: or just copy a 3x3x3 cobble structure to test HahaThink

[3:38:27] splix661: rftools builder ?
[3:38:36] Invalidm_: Nope
[3:38:50] benjamin_berry: I used a robot to automate it. Was a nice little coding puzzle
[3:38:50] ninopanda: are you going to go in, or give up?
[3:39:06] obtoe_: tfrs cancelled
[3:39:07] robotunicr0n: dammit waffle now i'm eating a cheesesteak. i guess i'm not mad tho
[3:39:22] Invalidm_: Idk, I might give up since Ive been getting offers from places closer
[3:39:25] toclosebutfar2: Well with my quick youtube research seems there is no way to autmate the builing of the cubes Sadge
[3:39:31] benjamin_berry: Is that the booster catching tower?
[3:39:48] Enymowns: on space launch now it says 30th friday
[3:40:01] ninopanda: @Invalidm_ if you are getting other offers, then take em. fuck that company. its their loss
[3:40:07] Invalidm_: Yeah
[3:40:08] obtoe_: the tfr on the 28th isn't there so yeah
[3:40:19] Invalidm_: Sadge I just wanna get to working again
[3:40:39] ninopanda: yeah i understand bb.
[3:40:40] benjamin_berry: Thinking about that, doesn’t take that much of a crane if there’s no fuel.
[3:40:46] Madarion: couldnt you stack another miniziation setup right on top of the existing one? double the output in the same time with minimal overhead
[3:40:55] obtoe_: i like watching the tower being built
[3:41:14] SyncRe: @Giantwaffle why isn't the floor affecting the projectors?
[3:41:15] M1k3D3l7a: the METAR and TAF for KBRO look fine though
[3:41:15] obtoe_: an operational tower*
[3:41:34] obtoe_: not just some building

[3:41:49] obtoe_: yesss
[3:42:08] Invalidm_: Also I think with this place its a different time cycle from the other one. Im not fully sure yet cause they have three shifts but I think the night one would be better for me
[3:42:13] obtoe_: emchagodzilla
[3:42:18] ninopanda: @DaemonSzyman since when do they force a word count max?! WTF
[3:42:22] dabeda1: but they are super unefficient stockAck
[3:42:32] Madarion: couldnt you stack another miniziation setup right on top of the existing one? copy the 3x3x6 and paste that, minimal overhead
[3:42:35] stanls: @DaemonSzyman it´s always easier to delete than write more when you don´t know what to write
[3:42:39] ninopanda: @Invalidm_ nice, i hope you get it!!!
[3:42:42] Tahj____: Mech are gonna come right after the flying cars

[3:45:55] Invalidm_: Oh I didnt give a shit about HS and was like a C/D student and didnt really have the mindset I have today
[3:45:58] n8level: learning is painful, but like going to the gym you can only appreciate it after the gains

[3:46:09] Scerion_TX: I almost didn't graduate college due to spending all my junior and senior years playing an MMO (EverQuest) but now I have a job with a MMO game company
[3:46:09] ninopanda: @Invalidm_ i feel the same way some times. but i forced myself to get a degree because i wanted the paper.... down side to it, is it didnt do anything good for me
[3:46:09] Drmaxishere: the education system is seriously flawed though
[3:46:22] XiaoBaiMalz: from the age of 6 to the age of 20 i was bullied by the same group of people until they all went to jail LUL Karma as is best.
[3:46:24] Allmostdone: It doesn’t help that your brain was still evolving
[3:46:30] Kalpar: The times when you wish you had a builders wand.
[3:46:32] MrMoneybagMan: no wand?
[3:46:33] Lands8142: that's a part of growing up. learning to appreciate the things that you took for granted and hopefully inspire those younger than you to do it instead
[3:46:38] bugsplatter23: I couldnt finish calc 2 because i preferred Everquest to homework
[3:46:52] ninopanda: @Kalpar so freaking true!!!!! I love the builders wand
[3:46:54] daemonaedryn: KEKW
[3:46:55] Invalidm_: Yeah nino when I started college that was my fear, oh cool I have this paper that no one is gonna care about
[3:47:00] NordESA: same
[3:47:02] benjamin_berry: To me half of college is it’s living without your parents on training wheels
[3:47:06] Allmostdone: We need to change the schooling system completely

[3:47:56] Fourseason_: Same thing happened to me when OSRS came out
[3:48:01] Fourseason_: Grades dropped so hard

[3:48:13] M1k3D3l7a: oh damn
[3:48:14] ninopanda: @n8level actually the job i do now has little to no interaction on my degree.
[3:48:17] Enymowns: TBC and wrath was the shit back then

[3:56:20] RhinoWrEcKs: i get to red maps and just kinda stopepd
[3:56:26] punkgeek: I haven't beat the campaign yet, work is too busy
[3:56:26] Tahj____: It's pretty fun
[3:56:28] NordESA: 160
[3:56:29] RussianRainbowTV: im too stupid to learn how to play PoE, my friends got me into it but idk how builds work
[3:56:33] Alamose: I didnt make it past the horrible day 1, it ruined my hype for it
[3:56:34] NordESA: Chaos is just not worth anything
[3:56:34] DrHax_: still in white maps and already bored af KEKW
[3:56:35] Watertoad: im waiting for poe2 NODDERS
[3:56:36] MrQuags: theres a new shield that i made a BB BF build with and its rly fun
[3:56:37] daemonaedryn: @RussianRainbowTV Same KEKW
[3:56:38] Aarimous: Launch killed my motivation
[3:56:39] WilliamWeist: play SSF, market price is always good
[3:56:42] Klorell: ex price stabilized
[3:56:42] Tahj____: Lot of chaos enter the economy
[3:56:51] MrQuags: also yesterday they hit like 180 for a bit
[3:56:54] bugsplatter23: New to poe, still playing.
[3:56:54] Fourseason_: They were 172 yesterday
[3:56:55] DrHax_: Ultimate shits out chaos, what
[3:57:00] Duvenel: Opposite is true, more chaos is dropping
[3:57:05] NordESA: I get shitloads of chaos
[3:57:06] Tahj____: Nah that's the opposite, you get tons of chaos
[3:57:07] n8level: the new gambling encounters weren't very interesting for long
[3:57:07] Mordenak: Nah, there's lots of chaos, Ultimatum gives a lot.
[3:57:14] CTBrts: is that real fireplace in background?
[3:57:14] jawnythompson: I have seen a lot of chaos
[3:57:19] mentiz: the new league mechanic drops loads of chaos
[3:57:19] MrQuags: yee lots of C
[3:57:24] NordESA: I haven't gotten a single exalt yet
[3:57:27] Tahj____: Yeah it's frequent to get like 3x per
[3:57:27] DrHax_: even in white maps I leave with like 5 - 15 c just from ultimatum
[3:57:29] GoodOldTiberius: there is chaos spam atm
[3:57:29] Fourseason_: Yeah that's why there so much C available per exalt
[3:57:29] Zapodidae: Pretty sure this is how Half-life started....
[3:57:31] Duvenel: Chaos is worth less so the price of  Exalts are worth more to compensate
[3:57:34] TxMaverick88: Yeah high cost of exalts means theres too much chaos in the economy (or not enough exalts)
[3:57:40] Chyromyr: I'm still playing SSF. Ultimatum is kinda meh, but previous ones are still lots of fun.
[3:57:40] jawnythompson: but that explains whhy exalts are expensive
[3:57:40] daemonaedryn: Can you change the coords the copy and paste tool pastes to, so you could theoretically click two blocks away and still get it placed right @Giantwaffle
[3:57:42] thebodge: yeah i get like 10 chaos on average from Ultimatums
[3:57:48] Kaylome97: another stone barrel?
[3:57:52] DimensionalShadow: Would the ender io pipes make it faster?

[3:58:33] n8level: flickering obsidian cubes NotLikeThis
[3:58:33] Scerion_TX: does the cobble gen need an upgrade?
[3:58:38] babyaddalyn: disconect the pipe use one servo per crusible
[3:58:44] Amcham: how much obsidian did you have in your create wall?
[3:59:00] daemonaedryn: You can just put the cobble gen right next to it and it works
[3:59:18] nerffro: hmmm
[3:59:40] daemonaedryn: PogChamp
[4:00:27] Nincy1986: you need a smelting array
[4:01:18] daemonaedryn: I guess you could technically make another room with the mini fields
[4:01:31] DimensionalShadow: KEKW
[4:01:34] ogspaceyy: for a minute I thought the fireplace was real LOL

[4:04:30] punkgeek: Come up with something you want to make and make it. Doesn't matter if it's simple at first
[4:04:37] PinkandWhite: that's what I did bro, just picked a project and learned that specific thing
[4:04:37] Happzimus: auto sudoku solving is a fun one to start
[4:04:39] ReiydL: You need to learn the basics to know where to start, but then yeah you need to try and build things so you know what to learn
[4:04:46] YaseenDIY: okay thanks so much
[4:05:04] dylan0806: Use code wars
[4:05:06] R1Rider01: my iron hammer doesn't kill all the blocks like that  :-/
[4:05:11] Asanf91: any Wands in this pack?
[4:05:16] YaseenDIY: and yeah imma just get basics under my belt and try and dive into it
[4:05:40] LinearLayer: Build a linked list from structures in C KEKW
[4:06:15] ReiydL: @YaseenDIY CodeCademy has free lessons as well, and you code directly in the browser
[4:06:32] benjamin_berry: @happzimus fill with random numbers and check for valid solution, repeat if no
[4:06:33] Nexhunter: firebase yo Kappa
[4:06:37] R1Rider01: what mod does that when you hit a block it kills all the others that are the same?
[4:06:49] gnargl: > extreme > 10k KEKW
[4:06:51] Karnaxx: 10,000 users is nothing in databases
[4:06:53] Nexhunter: no
[4:06:57] jawnythompson: Depends
[4:06:57] gnargl: 10k is nothing
[4:06:58] EZTEQ: Not a problem, super fast
[4:06:58] ZyianDev: 10k is nothing
[4:07:00] Asanf91: @R1Rider01 Veinminer, or Excavate
[4:07:02] YaseenDIY: @ReiydL ill check it out! thanks!
[4:07:03] jawnythompson: 10k is nothing
[4:07:04] tommyfod: super easy and fast
[4:07:05] ItsOnMax: SQL is quick
[4:07:07] Nexhunter: 10k is like half a milliscond KEKW
[4:07:08] sofalord_: depends on the database
[4:07:10] Janzert: easy
[4:07:10] ReiydL: Well for his LD game 10k might be a lot but still
[4:07:11] FlopFlipOreo: sql can do that no problem
[4:07:11] Quinnerdude1: waffle is going to learn SQL
[4:07:13] TelRehiad: for a real DB, 10k is no issue at all
[4:07:15] CaptainAlkohol: you dont need to sort, you can just compare to the previous top 10 @Giantwaffle
[4:07:15] Benno1472: 10k is like 0.0000001 with quicksort
[4:07:15] ravi981: SQL is easy and fast
[4:07:18] AtchTwoOh: databases are litteraly made for sorting and going trough lots of data, so yeah no problem
[4:07:22] benjamin_berry: That’s a trivial db problem
[4:07:23] hallis21: all databases should be able to do that in no time
[4:07:24] jawnythompson: You can get a O(n) sorting algo easy
[4:07:25] tommyfod: SQL super easy as well
[4:07:26] shzbr: u dont need a sorting, u just need to ask for you DB sonsult to organize it by ascend
[4:07:29] Soul_Synergy: You could also use something like a heap so the largest score is always first, but DB's are super quick
[4:07:29] LinearLayer: Super easy. SQL: from scores select top(10) from scores
[4:07:31] R1Rider01: @Asanf91 are they apart of this pack or extra?  I have this compact mod already
[4:07:35] EZL1190: SELECT ... FROM table ORDER BY score DESC LIMIT 20
[4:07:35] Janzert: don't do it manually though, just sql query for the top 10
[4:07:36] camelJon: plus you won't be sorting the whole database all the time.. just look ups on insert
[4:07:37] Zoltac27: 10k int db sort is cake
[4:07:38] EZL1190: pure SQL
[4:07:40] jawnythompson: Look up algorithmic time complexities
[4:07:42] KavokCollective: Its nothing if its an already organized array
[4:07:42] sofalord_: which database you want to use?
[4:07:45] Allmostdone: learn sql don’t over think it
[4:07:50] Asanf91: @R1Rider01 Not sure if Waffle added it or not, wasnt here for the start
[4:07:54] benjamin_berry: You put an index on the score field and walk away.
[4:08:00] Happzimus: @benjamin_berry there's a basic ruleset to follow to be proficient
[4:08:03] LinearLayer: MySQL 100%
[4:08:04] Nexhunter: also for that you can go NoSQL instead of pure SQL and use the DB natural ordering system instead of execution ordering hiroHmm
[4:08:07] EZTEQ: Database would be behind an API that you connect iwth your game to
[4:08:11] tommyfod: you would paginate, so just store by order anyway, and grab top 20 records, then next 20, etc
[4:08:15] ItsOnMax: You can use unity to connect to a server and use SQL to query the result.
[4:08:19] EZL1190: JPA
[4:08:20] n8level: 10k entries of a single value is trivial, db is kinda overkill
[4:08:20] RhinoWrEcKs: MSFT access starts chuiggin around 1M rows
[4:08:31] Nexhunter: @RhinoWrEcKs do you want to get banned
[4:08:32] Karnaxx: The most important feature of SQL code is using Caps Lock
[4:08:41] Mentox: i think you sill got like 300 obsidian on the storage wall
[4:08:41] Nexhunter: @RhinoWrEcKs a DB doesn't belong anywhere near access or excell uhnRee
[4:08:47] bier_404: cardinality of a simple leaderboard is really small. Should be no problem.
[4:08:47] Ladon_Dragon: calling access a database Kappa
[4:08:55] R1Rider01: @Giantwaffle is that an extra mod that clears all the blocks?  I don't have that function in my compact claus game...
[4:09:16] Happzimus: @benjamin_berry plus you can train in code redundancy the more you progress
[4:09:17] sofalord_: the database and api depends on you budget and what do you can use timewise and longterm
[4:09:31] Nincy1986: you need few obsidian to clear the previous build
[4:09:37] daemonaedryn: @R1Rider01 Only specific tools can veinmine
[4:09:38] Nincy1986: nvm
[4:09:45] RhinoWrEcKs: @Nexhunter :tf:
[4:10:04] R1Rider01: @DaemonSzyman he had an iron hammer i think....

[4:11:13] Nincy1986: its better then original wall making machine
[4:11:27] n8level: a mod that lets you duplicate your player doing a simple thing like placing a block, would be neat
[4:11:32] weightmaker: diamond block is gonna take at least a week.
[4:11:38] daemonaedryn: It takes approximately 4-5 seconds per craft aswell
[4:12:12] weightmaker: no the issue is the recipe for normal diamond. the energy required to make a normal diamond is insane
[4:12:28] itzSimondr98: Exporters
[4:12:40] babyaddalyn: make poop with ... poop :p

[4:14:48] WanderingArcificer: can you automate this?
[4:15:05] AComfyKnight: you can get rich slag from cycling compasses or clocks in an induction smelter
[4:15:25] AtchTwoOh: yeah, but won't you be able to use the automation in the next phase?
[4:16:23] Invalidm_: What did you use to code your game btw waffle mehdiHMM
[4:16:48] robvi: @Invalidm_ blender and unity?
[4:17:00] Scerion_TX: oh man I recently found the Breakfast Club videos I'd downloaded back from when I first found you and modded minecraft and was learning from that series @Giantwaffle

[4:17:59] hallis21: vs is visual studio
[4:18:03] BurnedAether: Now VS Code is not Visual Studio
[4:18:05] jawnythompson: VS Code and Visual Studio are different things
[4:18:13] Nexhunter: VS is the big chunky boi

[4:24:57] Chronoes: @TinyBicycleTom I mean I do like the premise of it, space games always charm me. But I just can't get over jankiness of it. And the X4 game was still underwhelming. I'm surprised X3 is getting another DLC
[4:25:29] Tahj____: Albion was super fun for me

[4:29:00] JDoobs: Or they'll just pocket the money.
[4:29:00] Abbyy: I have no idea, at walmart corporate we aren't required to let them know about the vaccine. They just give us time off for symptoms and stuff
[4:29:06] complexprotein: Our company is giving us 75$ if we get it
[4:29:33] Nincy1986: we got 250 for each dose
[4:29:42] SinfulPhantom: I don't think Corporate Walmart is giving us anything unfortunately
[4:29:55] bugsplatter23: Have not heard of this.  Ours has never asked if we are
[4:30:18] complexprotein: I work for City Government so they're more inclined to have us get it
[4:30:46] Nincy1986: incentive for getting it both times becuse 1st one suck for alot of ppl and the chicken out for 2nd one
[4:30:48] Orin_The_Sly: Typical
[4:30:55] Invalidm_: cant you copy the redstone on the iron block with your building gadget and not have to place anything mehdiHMM
[4:30:59] bugsplatter23: We’ve had ppl get free days off.. but it was sick leave do to vax reactions heh
[4:31:07] JDoobs: It amounts to roughly 5 million people.
[4:31:13] n8level: and is there 5% error in reporting?
[4:31:21] Arby_52: does 1st dose become null after a while then?
[4:31:32] complexprotein: Doesn't it just up the affectiveness from 80%  to 90 - 95?
[4:31:56] n8level: teaching the immune system is not easy
[4:31:58] Nincy1986: 6 monts if you get both doses

[4:35:30] Nepli: my arm was sore for 5 days LUL
[4:35:39] TelRehiad: I actually had symptoms after like 2 hours
[4:35:44] Jaret180: The pain was from the vaccine too
[4:35:50] Doomwyte: @Giantwaffle I didn't see symptoms for almost 16 hours after my 2nd shot, and then my arm hurt like hell for like a day
[4:35:52] Invalidm_: I was swore for like a day which was insane according to everyone else who got it
[4:35:54] Lands8142: the pain was part of the immune response
[4:36:05] cornsharks: YES. I had my first on Sunday. My arm was killing me Monday.
[4:36:05] Nincy1986: foggy
[4:36:09] KnickKen: my arm was barely sore
[4:36:13] Solitude411: the sickness probably hit me 6-8 hours after the shot then for like 6 hours after that i still felt bad
[4:36:19] UECNSNemesis: ngl dude that could have just been because you had 5 hours of sleep that day
[4:36:21] Bouv_: First shot I had little to no symptoms, 2nd shot I JUST got yesterday and had a 101.5 fever
[4:36:25] ItsOnMax: I got the first AZ shot a few weeks ago, I got really cold chills at night and a really bad headache. But I did not feel sick. Just running a fever and a headache.
[4:36:28] Droth_: First dose, just 1 day of arm soreness.. 2nd dose tomorrow
[4:36:30] Jaret180: They say the worse you feel from the shot the more your immune system responded and the better protected you are
[4:36:38] leadtooth: ^^
[4:36:41] leadtooth: thats true
[4:36:50] Jaret180: I got like sick the day after my Pfizzer shot
[4:36:53] Nepli: would a tattoo hurt like that as well then? monkaHmm maaybe not since it's not as deep? monkaHmm
[4:36:55] Jaret180: like 1 degree fever
[4:36:58] KnickKen: will the second moderna dose be worse or better?
[4:36:59] Arby_52: 2nd moderna I got chills going to bed. headache and achyness when i woke up. fine by Noon
[4:36:59] SchroTN: It actually took me about 3 days to feel the symptoms from my second shot.   Luckily it hit in the middle of the night, so i barely noticed them
[4:37:03] n8level: my soreness only lasted 3 days, just tired otherwise - but I worked hard to hydrate before, during, and after the shot
[4:37:03] leadtooth: side effects are good
[4:37:06] teej_dv: how does one automate this machine?
[4:37:17] Solitude411: also you could have no reaction to the shot its not a gaurentee
[4:37:20] kaptainkuyk: @Jaret180 time to temporarily screw with my immune system :)
[4:37:21] cornsharks: @Jaret180 Did you have Covid before you received the vaccines at all?
[4:37:23] none_the_wiser: What are we doing.
[4:37:23] calhanb: Have you seen the size of the Nasa Pegasus Barge Nasa Spaceflight just posted a picture off
[4:37:38] teej_dv: I'm wondering more out of curiousity, not flame -- I lirerally don't know HOW you would do it.
[4:37:49] Jaret180: @ahud2 now that i know of
[4:37:53] Jaret180: not*
[4:38:06] Nepli: I was sick the night I took the astra zeneca, after that it was fine, just sore arm SeemsGood
[4:38:07] Jaret180: I only got sick for 1 day after my 2nd pfizzer shot
[4:38:10] Invalidm_: Unity takes so long to install NotLikeThis
[4:38:14] Jaret180: first shot just felt like i got punched in the arm hard
[4:38:23] kaptainkuyk: is there not some sort of redstone automation for this?
[4:38:25] TelRehiad: @teej_dv you could use turtles to place etc or integrated dynamics
[4:38:33] Moobot: Play Waffle's entry for Ludum Dare 48, Dig Deep, at giantwaffle.itch.io/digdeep | Check out the other entries at ldjam.com/games
[4:38:42] cornsharks: @Jaret180 I got my first Pfizer Sunday, and I had Covid beforehand. My arm was extremely sore and was tired.   I'm curious how my second one will be.
[4:38:46] teej_dv: ah, so just computer craft / program the turtles or something? I've never used integrated dynamics
[4:38:49] her0zer0: are we going to automate 5x5s?
[4:39:00] Jaret180: @ahud2 Why get a vaccine for a disease you already had
[4:39:17] TelRehiad: @teej_dv direwolf has a couple of examples up on YT
[4:39:21] Nepli: @Jaret180 you should still get it.
[4:39:28] Jaret180: Yeah but doesn't the vaccine just give you the same level of protection?
[4:39:32] Jaret180: as getting it
[4:39:36] cornsharks: Because I live in Honduras more than I live here; and the government will most likely require it for my work.  And what he said.
[4:39:36] Nepli: not necessarily
[4:39:39] Jaret180: I got my 2nd shot last week
[4:39:49] teej_dv: @TelRehiad ok, interesting. May check it out later
[4:39:52] 101101101: What are you doing man?
[4:40:01] Jaret180: Right the spikes make your white blood cells fight it
[4:40:13] Jaret180: just like they would if you had it though yeah?
[4:40:21] obtoe_: looks like a test will take place today at boca. pad clearing
[4:40:25] Jaret180: ahh yeah
[4:40:26] cornsharks: @Jaret180 living internationally has made it complicated to get it or not.
[4:40:26] dkcas11: Where can i check out the LD game you did? PogChamp
[4:40:27] UECNSNemesis: It produces a fingerprint of the virus inside your body
[4:40:28] n8level: its like the fingerprint of the virus, easy to recognize and muster a response
[4:40:32] Lands8142: It's similar to the flu. It changes and can have different proteins. You get the flu but are still susceptible to getting another strain.
[4:40:41] Nepli: BUT WAFFLE, THE AUTISM
[4:40:45] Lands8142: And it helps protect other people
[4:40:45] Jaret180: Yeah no I got my 2nd shot but i never had covid
[4:40:55] obtoe_: pad clearing
[4:40:56] Nepli: it's a joke chat, don't murder me
[4:41:06] Arby_52: PauseChamp
[4:41:07] UECNSNemesis: POG cars leaving?!
[4:41:07] Jaret180: @ahud2 ahhh yeah
[4:41:10] Invalidm_: chat if you say dumb stuffs monkaGun I will bop you forever
[4:41:10] n8level: or you like the idea of medical bills from a potential hospital stay, dunno
[4:41:10] daemonaedryn: pepeLaugh
[4:41:17] DrNucleotides: those are some big grain silos @Giantwaffle Kappa
[4:41:23] Lands8142: how dare you @Nepli >:(
[4:41:25] obtoe_: the third one is almost done too
[4:41:27] cornsharks: I'm glad I was able to get it and for free. My wife may not be able to get it until July or August at this rate AND we may have to pay for it there.
[4:41:33] TimmyVRC: I love me some big tanks Kreygasm
[4:41:36] ThatWeirdoGuy: Nah just grain for the cafeteria to make bread...
[4:41:36] Solitude411: wasnt static fire yesterday?
[4:41:37] Nepli: @Lands8142 I had to pepeLaugh
[4:41:38] ItsOnMax: How are they going to keep it cold?
[4:41:42] UECNSNemesis: LUL I fucking love the absolutely massive dirt wall
[4:41:46] Driitzz: idk man feels right now it's a beta testing of the vaccine there's a 13 yo girl who died after getting her 2 doses of the vaccine due to complication with it , idk which one it was but .... wtf
[4:41:47] Cozmo300: where do they hold all the fluid before it goes in the tank
[4:41:50] n8level: what volume of air would it take to fill one of those with liquid oxygen?
[4:42:01] BeastboySAW: Oh my God Becky.  Look at those tanks.
[4:42:04] beltazar156: Anyone remember the time Waffle watched a certain video for 10 hours?
[4:42:11] leadtooth: @Driitzz how is that worse than the amount of people who died of covid
[4:42:15] Solitude411: lets hope for no fog this time KEKW
[4:42:20] Jaret180: Ask your alexa
[4:42:22] Crazyfox55: infinite
[4:42:27] BeastboySAW: I like big tanks and I can’t deny.
[4:42:28] Arby_52: @beltazar156 waffleAYAYO
[4:42:29] AtchTwoOh: steam to water is 1000+ i know, not the exact number
[4:42:31] Maykr__: 1:861
[4:42:33] UECNSNemesis: 1:700
[4:42:34] DrNucleotides: I'm sorry but I cannot unsee a giant grain silo. why you do this Elon. rooCry
[4:42:39] Crazyfox55: oxygen gas has no set "density"
[4:42:49] Driitzz: leadtooth covid you can control by doing quarantine and taking precausion , while vaccine = you took that to feel safe and it kills you
[4:43:01] Crazyfox55: You mean oxygen at stp
[4:43:03] UECNSNemesis: it's why my lab does not allow people to carry liquid nitrogen into an elevator and stay with it on the ride up or down
[4:43:05] n8level: @Crazyfox55 its sea level, warm, and oxygen is ~20% of air
[4:43:08] Jaret180: Water...
[4:43:10] Jaret180: JK
[4:43:11] TelRehiad: condensed
[4:43:22] AtchTwoOh: a saturated gas?
[4:43:22] Moobot: Support Waffle by using his Epic creator code: Giantwaffle
[4:43:35] Crazyfox55: STP is standard temperature and pressure.
[4:43:37] fb_slim: adiabatic transformation_
[4:43:38] highlandermccloud: @driitzz  as far as I recall the 13 year old you mentioned died of covid not the vacine
[4:43:46] Nincy1986: 900ish
[4:43:47] n8level: this is a basic college science problem chat
[4:43:56] leadtooth: @Driitzz can you? because the USA has done a horrible job of controlling it
[4:44:36] akitsuki_: same lmfao
[4:44:46] DrNucleotides: it sounds to me like he is trying to talk about (Pressure*Volume)/Temperature but if you cool it do a liquid i'm not sure the gas equation work. I think the question is really how man Liters does it hold.
[4:44:50] Driitzz: leadtooth on the oposite new zealand shutdown the borders and they have the lowest covid related case, if people could have stopped being dumbasses it wouldnt of been as bad as it is
[4:44:51] cornsharks: @leadtooth I followed everything and I didn't get Covid until I returned back to the USA...  It is literally like I am living in a different world because people here do NOT care...
[4:44:53] AtchTwoOh: I failed my chemistry 2 exam like 4 times KEKW
[4:44:54] her0zer0: DUMP IT
[4:44:56] Reach_Beyond: dump it
[4:45:07] obtoe_: its hot as HELL in NJ for no reason
[4:45:09] Jaret180: it's cold out today in Arizona
[4:45:16] leadtooth: @Driitzz ok but thats not reality lol the reality is people wont stop being dumbasses so getting the vaccine is a no brainer
[4:45:17] Jaret180: All stormy
[4:45:22] UECNSNemesis: We about to see SNowpocalypse 2 Electric Boogaloo?
[4:45:33] leadtooth: @ahud2 its INSANE
[4:45:43] Jaret180: only 72 in arizona...
[4:45:46] Jaret180: oh shit nm
[4:45:46] Nincy1986: how is the meme bot in your discord doing?
[4:45:48] Jaret180: lol
[4:45:52] obtoe_: do you have any solar panels?
[4:46:10] AtchTwoOh: KEKW
[4:46:11] obtoe_: lmao
[4:46:18] CitrusFlavoredOrange: Would you ever do a Terraria playthrough?
[4:46:19] Mundakka: power your mining rig Pog
[4:46:20] Yeneews: but y
[4:46:21] Jaret180: Just be like yeah, and pull out a calculator from the 90s
[4:46:21] UECNSNemesis: LUL
[4:46:28] UECNSNemesis: Power your Raspberry Pi on it
[4:46:32] I_MINGO: a portable charger with one on it
[4:46:36] Jaret180: Yeah
[4:46:37] obtoe_: little garden light with a cell
[4:46:37] Chronoes: yep
[4:46:38] Jaret180: there you go
[4:46:39] Aarimous: Would actually be fun to mess around with a small solar cell for learning
[4:46:41] Chronoes: you got them
[4:46:43] Jaret180: yup you have solar
[4:46:47] Mundakka: solar powered crypto mining KEKW
[4:46:52] TechNaOkami: power you waffle lamp
[4:46:52] Jaret180: lol
[4:47:05] Crazyfox55: @DrNucleotides No he is asking if you took oxygen gas at say one atmo and 25 degrees C how many liters of liquid oxygen would that make. I assume the liquid is only a few degrees below its gaseous state
[4:47:15] Jaret180: Is it really?
[4:47:22] Troptics: ya dont say LUL LUL
[4:47:28] akitsuki_: @citrusflavoredorange he has. he did one when 1.4 came out, then he did a calamity playthrough after that
[4:47:32] Miguelrara: wich is the new one?
[4:47:42] Ladon_Dragon: they also released the antminer E9
[4:47:45] Yeneews: how big is your rig
[4:47:46] Jaret180: I've been doing about $60 a week with 1 3080, 1 1080, and one 970
[4:47:50] Ladon_Dragon: that's gonna obliterate GPUs
[4:48:06] Jaret180: Blah yeah
[4:48:07] Ladon_Dragon: one of them is like 32 3090 worth or something
[4:48:08] ManneehFresh: I’m making more money
[4:48:10] sky_driver6: What are we talking about? Bitcoin?
[4:48:12] Jaret180: you need ROI before april
[4:48:14] ThatWeirdoGuy: "not profitable" is relative to the price, so yea if you sell your ETH when you mine it, yes it might not be profitable, but if you think of the possible price for however long you are HODLing..
[4:48:15] babyaddalyn: no but you can sell the card
[4:48:25] Cozmo300: gotta think of the future price at 100k though
[4:48:26] TimmyVRC: does that mean we will get graphics cards back?
[4:48:30] DrNucleotides: @Crazyfox55 I see. I suppose the issue is to answer that question you might need to know how many atoms or moles you have to figure out how much you have.
[4:48:31] Crazyfox55: @Giantwaffle so your saying to sell ETH and what should we buy instead?
[4:48:47] Jaret180: @Giantwaffle I was watching an OG miner and he said even from mining back in 2012 he would have made way more money if he just invested in bitcoin
[4:48:49] fejitsu: but then ravencoin takes over the bulk of mining
[4:49:07] Lands8142: then gpu price crash? :)
[4:49:15] Ladon_Dragon: I mean people that buy it probably are betting on the fact that ETH 2.0 doesn't come soon
[4:49:16] Jaret180: How about Helieum
[4:49:19] nAZAr1uS: you still locked in the cube? when will you get out?
[4:49:21] calhanb: Do you think when Eth 2 happens  there will be a dump of graphics cards on Ebay
[4:49:21] MrBubbahut: @giantwaffle yeah but dogecoin is going To the moon
[4:49:22] Jaret180: I almost did Helieum
[4:49:28] Crazyfox55: @DrNucleotides yea I think with those assumptions its possible to calculate
[4:49:30] fejitsu: No one wants it, but it is profitable right now
[4:49:35] Ladon_Dragon: since it's been transitioning since forever I think
[4:49:40] Jaret180: Yeah your mining is income
[4:49:46] Ghosstk: Tax? XD
[4:50:00] Jaret180: Really?
[4:50:00] DrNucleotides: @Crazyfox55 been a looooong time since I did chem or physics
[4:50:03] Ghosstk: no
[4:50:05] Jaret180: I'm using Nicehash and doing it easy mode
[4:50:07] DaFez_: Well, the growth is taxable
[4:50:09] BeastboySAW: I can’t afford raven coin. I got crow coin instead.
[4:50:10] witty_pup: you don't get taxed twice
[4:50:15] Jaret180: Also yeah it is
[4:50:22] RodriCraft93: yes it is
[4:50:23] Crazyfox55: @Giantwaffle so is ETH going to go up or down?
[4:50:24] Jaret180: not probably you
[4:50:33] witty_pup: taxed on the initial amount then on any gains
[4:50:38] Jaret180: you pay capital gains on the profit you made
[4:50:49] Ultranot20000: Waffle what game/modpack do you think your playing after CC?
[4:50:52] Jaret180: and if its over a year you get it a lot cheaper
[4:50:52] UECNSNemesis: Pad is clearing, any bets on the static fire time?
[4:51:08] obtoe_: they might move bluto or something too
[4:51:36] TelRehiad: peepoLeave
[4:51:36] Moobot: You can sub to Waffle by clicking this neat link -> twitch.tv/giantwaffle/subscribe
[4:51:42] Jaret180: Ugh I have to go, I have an onboarding call, we are moving from Connectwise to Datto this month
[4:51:44] Jaret180: Fun times
[4:51:59] TimmyVRC: think we'll finally get some GPUs back after Etherium cant be mined or will they just switch?
[4:52:06] Jaret180: Giant still has his IT company yeah?
[4:52:13] Quinnerdude1: fun crypto question, what will the next coin everyone goes to mine?
[4:52:13] sofalord_: i hope for the point, to get a new graphics card for my gaming pc
[4:52:14] ZOZE55: 8.8 =9 right ?
[4:52:23] Jaret180: @Quinnerdude1 Heleium
[4:52:36] Jaret180: Have you seen the new wireless access point mining?
[4:52:49] Omeyn: I mine random alt coins just for the lulz and to have them, it's becoming a small collection now
[4:52:50] zacpdx: what about monero mining?
[4:53:00] Jaret180: They are doing this IOT mining with Heleium APs
[4:53:26] Kampfkater16: you cant mine monero with gpu
[4:53:43] Jaret180: I mean it's a year from now so 4080's will be out anyways?
[4:53:58] Crazyfox55: So the value of ETH should stabilize soon.
[4:54:03] Jaret180: hmm
[4:54:11] Arimil: 3080Ti was leaked
[4:54:15] Aurielli: 3080 Ti in june tho
[4:54:17] babyaddalyn: ^
[4:54:20] Aurielli: and 3070 Ti too
[4:54:23] daemonaedryn: Im 30 minutes into DSP and already have spaghet KEKW
[4:54:23] Jaret180: @Crazyfox55 Predictions are betweek 10k-20k by the end of the year
[4:54:28] UECNSNemesis: LUL there's a car booking it back to the pad. someone must have left their wallet
[4:54:31] Arimil: https://videocardz.com/newz/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3080-ti-allegedly-launches-may-25th-rtx-3070-ti-early-june
[4:54:34] Jaret180: Oh yeah new 30s
[4:54:49] ThatWeirdoGuy: DSP?
[4:54:49] ItsOnMax: Oh yay, another card we can not get Kappa
[4:55:02] AtchTwoOh: dyson sphere project?
[4:55:03] Omeyn: I think they said the 3080 Ti will push around 120Mh by itself which is unfortunate for gamers
[4:55:07] n8level: back of the envelope I get something like 2.6km^3 for 7.5 lbs of liquid oxygen if a super heavy booster held nothing but lox
[4:55:20] Scerion_TX: DaemonSzyman that'll resolve itself eventually with upgrades :) but yeah, DSP is all about the spaghet pastaThat
[4:55:22] Aarimous: Some needs to make a logistics game with a spaghetti production theme.
[4:55:26] Jaret180: Yeah I had to buy an entire machine on Newegg to get a card
[4:55:26] TinyBicycleTom: @DaemonSzyman press TAB to cycle through spliters to get ther stack ones, saved my life
[4:55:28] UltraScientism: 7nm to 5nm should be a huge jump, and then 3nm should be insane.
[4:55:34] n8level: sorry, thats 2.6km of gaseous oxygen, but thats only 20pct of air
[4:55:36] Soul802: WAFW
[4:55:37] TimmyVRC: you cant even get 10 series cards right now
[4:55:45] Jaret180: ROI is 7 months with mining though lol
[4:55:47] Chronoes: You don't really need the 3090 either but you have it
[4:55:48] navalship55: Haha new release, the 3099 pro ultra deluxe by Nvida
[4:55:51] DigitalVortex92: @UltraScientism you think we're gonna get 3nm kiiKEK
[4:55:57] zynithtv: im still on a 980
[4:55:59] babyaddalyn: im so happy i got my 2070super last year lol
[4:56:00] Jaret180: I got the ABS Gladiator
[4:56:02] JadedOnyx19: im on 3080 ill probably skip 2 unless my life gets comfy
[4:56:06] Jaret180: I mean the entire newegg computer
[4:56:07] SoldierFieIds: Just sneezed really hard and accidentally shit my pants
[4:56:08] Omeyn: I skipped the 20xx and 30xx series I'm going to try to jump on a 40xx card
[4:56:10] Fivesix6: Ayo the 5080 to super looking mighty good with that $7099 price tag 5 years from now Kappa
[4:56:11] Skafo222: I will be upgrading from 2080 once 4080 out makuHMM
[4:56:13] Crazyfox55: I'm getting ready for AMD earnings report coming soon
[4:56:20] UECNSNemesis: can you imagine the stonks on TSMC if they up capacity and still can't fill demand? wild
[4:56:20] sky_driver6: What does "mining" mean?
[4:56:25] Jaret180: I got an entire computer with a 3080 from new egg for about 2500
[4:56:30] n8level: almost 13 km^3 of air to make a super heavy with just liquid oxygen
[4:56:54] Omeyn: I think you can still grab a 1080 Ti for like $800
[4:56:55] Jaret180: So using my old pc and this new 1 I make my money back in about 8 months total. so free machine
[4:57:12] UECNSNemesis: god dayumn
[4:57:29] Jaret180: Correct
[4:57:39] Jaret180: but then people quit mining and the money comes back
[4:57:39] Fivesix6: 8 months of constant electricity PogU
[4:57:40] Jaret180: :D
[4:57:40] TimmyVRC: I wouldn't be surprised if newegg kept cards to sell in prebuilds to deter miners from buying just the card
[4:58:03] Jaret180: You have your own pool?
[4:58:17] Scerion_TX: there's that new ETH ASIC miner too right? once those hit difficulty will jump insanely fast
[4:58:23] Shuruzou: Yes Very cool ....
[4:58:31] Va3lin: best place to get a pre-built from?

[4:58:38] sankhazo: And the used market floods with motherboards and other parts KEKW
[4:58:48] Duvenel: I work in 3D and I've been trying to upgrade my setup since lockdown, been seriously thinking about buying a prebuilt and buying other parts after for it
[4:58:49] PossibleScam: NZXT has no pc avail.
[4:58:49] Scerion_TX: supposedly $30k
[4:58:50] Jaret180: Oh yeah I read about the new miner from Nvidia is sold out already haha
[4:58:57] TheWumbologist101: thats true but I have all the parts for a pc sitting here since december with no graphics card
[4:59:05] Jaret180: Yeah I wonder what coins it can even mine
[4:59:12] n8level: @Giantwaffle if you took on the order of 13km^3 of air and pulled all the oxygen out of it, it could fill the liquid storage on a super heavy booster with LOX -- my calcs are rough but order of magnitude
[4:59:18] Nioly_: My graphics card died 2 weeks back and I had to buy a 2060 for 600€ to do anything. loving this situation. should have bought a new prebuild
[4:59:18] Jaret180: Ouch
[4:59:29] Jaret180: The nvidia card with no video hook ups?
[4:59:44] ThatWeirdoGuy: But if you consider it an investment and keep all the coins you mine for like 5-10 years, it is most likely well worth it
[4:59:44] Moobot: You can find Waffle's Youtube channel here - https://youtube.com/giantwaffle
[4:59:46] Jaret180: It's not an asic though I thought it was just a video card with no ports
[4:59:56] zacpdx: so why would they even produce the asic to start with if it's fundamentally unprofitable?
[5:00:07] Scerion_TX: no theres a new ASIC Jaret180 it's not the nvidia cards w/ no ports.
[5:00:07] Lands8142: mostly nitrogen
[5:00:12] Xiocata: is there no other way to make enderpearls?
[5:00:12] Jaret180: OMG please ALL stay away from Myblockchainlife
[5:00:14] Dodara87: 21
[5:00:15] UECNSNemesis: 20%
[5:00:17] The_SilentGuardian: 22%
[5:00:17] Janzert: 21%
[5:00:25] Scerion_TX: I tried to by a Litecoin ASIC like 3 years ago, and never could find it in stock :p
[5:00:34] CrumbCakeee: nah 99%
[5:00:37] Fivesix6: just make you're own crypto, buy 5k and then wait 20 years... profit Kappa
[5:00:40] Jaret180: Eth2 will most likely be delayed also
[5:00:48] Jaret180: since that's par for the course
[5:00:49] n8level: if it were significantly more than 20% o2 in air, lots of things would start spontaneously combusting -- oxygen is crazy reactive
[5:01:04] contraban: can you not mine eth once 2.0 comes out?
[5:01:09] Jaret180: @Giantwaffle OMG or what if Cardano or Dot take off and Eth goes to shit
[5:01:15] Janzert: atmospheric oxygen level monitors often are set to go off at 19% for the low limit
[5:01:21] KnickKen: @contraban nope its profe of stake and not work
[5:01:27] Omeyn: I'm interested to see what happens next tax season when all the new doge-er's find out about capital gains taxes because I'm pretty sure a lot of them don't know it exists
[5:01:31] Jaret180: @Giantwaffle 100% just buy the coins
[5:01:37] contraban: interesting, i never looked into it. @KnickKen Thanks
[5:01:40] Fivesix6: just a major flex tbh.
[5:01:45] Jaret180: Only mine if you already have the equipment
[5:01:47] The_SilentGuardian: And then against that, dollars are worth less in the future,
[5:01:47] n8level: right, feels a bit like a pyramid scheme sometimes
[5:01:54] PossibleScam: Yeah. Agreed. Just buy the coin.
[5:01:57] Madarion: maybe volume?
[5:01:59] sankhazo: @Giantwaffle Maybe they are doing both?
[5:02:05] TheWumbologist101: yea if it doesn't roi now it is more profitable to buy the coin
[5:02:06] Crazyfox55: Everybody is gambling
[5:02:09] Jaret180: The people selling the Asic's are like the people selling online classes to setup an amazon store
[5:02:11] Stintrist: @Giantwaffle thinking of buying crypto should I buy BTC and ETH?
[5:02:14] PossibleScam: Both. Also viable.
[5:02:17] Scerion_TX: well that kinda happened with the Litecoin ASIC I was trying to buy.  You had to buy it in LTC, and since i wasn't able to buy it and hodl it, it's one of my greatest portfolios
[5:02:18] n8level: if you give the miners your money, they're buying crypto with it?
[5:02:31] Chronoes: KEKW
[5:02:43] Chronoes: I pity the fool who actually buys those
[5:02:50] Jaret180: @Giantwaffle Have you ever checked out Compass?  It's a legit place that will source a miner and a host for you.
[5:02:59] Smileynator: seems legit Kappa
[5:03:00] フリクリ: could you use differential calculus here since there are 2 changing factors waffleThink
[5:03:06] Jaret180: But going back to you...100% just buy the coins!
[5:03:07] PossibleScam: Seems legit Kappa
[5:03:10] nAZAr1uS: piramyd scheme when you put it like that
[5:03:14] n8level: if they could make more money using the miners they make, they wouldnt be selling them?
[5:03:14] Fivesix6: I'll give you this that makes gold bar out of the atmosphere. but you gotta pay me in 4 gold bars LUL
[5:03:16] Madarion: @Stintrist you should probably get ur own understanding and make a decision, if u listen to a random guy, u probably will lose ur money
[5:03:19] Jaret180: Ok later all!
[5:03:20] Smileynator: it's like those financial advice books on stock markets, if they knew something special, they didn't need to sell you the book
[5:03:21] Jaret180: I have to go
[5:03:22] PossibleScam: Madolf style.
[5:03:36] RoddyU: How much have you mined?
[5:03:39] Scerion_TX: Mining is like the whip cream on top
[5:03:43] Stintrist: @Madarion fair point
[5:03:49] Crazyfox55: @Giantwaffle I mean you haven't made money until you go back to USD
[5:04:05] Chronoes: Wouldn't now be the best time to shell your shovels (1080s) ?
[5:04:08] sankhazo: @Giantwaffle Can you mine with a 3090 while working on other stuff in your PC?
[5:04:09] Chronoes: sell*
[5:04:14] Little_Lady_Lauren: i put 2k into crypto two days and im 250 up today :)
[5:04:26] n8level: what is the copium to eth conversion ratio? LUL
[5:04:29] Duvenel: Thermal pads?
[5:04:32] Janzert: need to know the value at time you mined it for taxes btw
[5:04:45] Fivesix6: like I got $280 in a coin but it's not worth that if you wait. cause it'll either double/triple. or it'll tank to pennies @giantwaffle
[5:05:06] Omeyn: instant thermal junction is a scary thought
[5:05:07] IRL_Dex: 3070 and 3060ti are fine with thermals
[5:05:10] Crazyfox55: But ETH isn't stable so I don't consider it as a value.
[5:05:15] UECNSNemesis: yeah... idk how I feel about voiding warranty at this time...
[5:05:19] IRL_Dex: founders i mea n

[5:23:38] Memi02: Doesnt the beetroot give 2? So its the same
[5:23:47] richie385: I ate a burger and salt and pepper chips and fell asleep for 3 hours what have I missed

[5:24:12] TheodenArratay: oh well if beets also give 2 then its still the same
[5:24:29] Setinal44: you can put a watering can in an autoclicker pointing down towards an infinite water block for super fast growing if you set it on the fastest setting

[5:38:26] BurnedAether: @Setinal44 My company is slowly switching over to TypeScript. I'm so glad cause I don't have to deal with those errors anymore YEP
[5:38:36] Setinal44: compact machines have innate light

[5:41:32] Chronoes: @Setinal44 say, how much effort would it take to convert an existing React project to use Typescript? I have zero experience with it but am interested
[5:42:01] WishIHadABetterName: Does this modpack use ex nihilo?
[5:42:23] Madarion: you will need two caches for the sawmill, as it has 2 outputs with beet roots
[5:42:32] pengeg: pepeJAM
[5:42:36] BurnedAether: @WishIHadABetterName Kind of? To get some new items you need to sift but the chance is low so they want you to not use it for long.
[5:42:37] Soul802: peepoBlonket
[5:42:49] BurnedAether: @WishIHadABetterName for the most part you hit the walls to get resources.
[5:42:56] Igneous3: its not connected
[5:43:14] Setinal44: waffle theres a keybind for that device in settings

[5:44:32] ahent_: havent tuned in for a while!! looking good waffle
[5:44:49] MrPeabodyLive: is this minecraft 1,12
[5:44:51] Setinal44: @Chronoes well you just need to install the npm package for typescript which gets you the compiler, then you go through and rename all of your js and jsx files to ts and tsx
[5:45:12] Setinal44: Then you have to deal with all of the typescript errors that are going to pop up due to it being a superset of js
[5:45:28] Setinal44: Its not the worst but its definitely not fun
[5:45:48] babyaddalyn: start smelting the gold since you need gold blocks
[5:45:58] Invalidm_: why are your smelters not just auto inputing back into your system NotLikeThis
[5:46:14] Nincy1986: smelt it all
[5:47:12] Chronoes: @Setinal44 well, currently it's bundled by webpack so compilation can be handled by that. But I assume both regular JS and TS can exist in the same project at the same time?
[5:47:17] Nincy1986: why 2 cashes for seeds cant you input from closhes and sawmills into the same cashe?
[5:47:35] Setinal44: @Chronoes yes they can!
[5:47:40] Aurielli: get the gold for the upgrades
[5:47:56] her0zer0: need servos on the  bottom right?
[5:48:02] Stegmurmulis: what can you do with all seeds you get??

[5:49:17] Aurielli: servos for output
[5:49:31] Aurielli: ok works aswell :D
[5:49:44] Setinal44: @Chronoes TS is a little more work than js due to its strict typing requirements and interfacing but its so much better than js
[5:49:45] babyaddalyn: its faster then before :p
[5:50:06] Stegmurmulis: waffle what can you do with all seeds you get??
[5:50:08] MorgJay: Day 2 of asking @Giantwaffle for a hot tub stream
[5:50:09] Setinal44: You do need to make sure though to configure webpack to handle the ts and tsx extensions
[5:50:20] UECNSNemesis: what's your opinion on the ender 3 for a beginner's printer?
[5:50:52] Ardrago: didnt you need 3k cause you needed about 1k bioblend?
[5:50:58] dj_gaming18: @morgjay Great idea let’s see waffles hairy chest
[5:51:16] Chronoes: @Setinal44 Yeah I doubt it'll be a big problem, not the 1st one to have this use case
[5:51:37] Foooks: @UECNSNemesis I picked the ender 3 as a starter printer... great way to learn a BUNCH without spending a ton of cash...  It worked WELL out of the box, and learning and tweaking it has been enjoyable.
[5:52:12] CurlySC: waffleDab weeeee im back
[5:52:31] UECNSNemesis: @foooks thanks, gonna buy it when the next stimulus check comes in LUL
[5:52:45] Foooks: E3v2...  that is what I got

[6:05:48] Invalidm_: so I found it
[6:06:14] TxMaverick88: @Giantwaffle just move it up one Kappa
[6:06:31] daemonaedryn: Do something 144 or learn a new programming language, sounds like the first one may be easier

[6:07:00] Ruan_A: @Invalidm_ peepoPat
[6:07:24] Setinal44: you can shift click with the copy opaste tool to link it to an inventory
[6:07:31] Stonan: Is there any way to speed up the stupid animation?
[6:07:34] Setinal44: the quest book says you can automate with this and an autoclicker
[6:07:38] Madarion: can u copy a structure with a disconencted part?
[6:07:40] Setinal44: Try it
[6:07:52] scoobyrich: Yes thats true

[6:15:42] Krawberries: @Giantwaffle Hey waffle did you know that in AUS now we need to register NERF guns as registered firearms?
[6:15:49] JP3GG3R: you should probably do a repeater  to be safe
[6:15:53] JP3GG3R: just to delay a bit
[6:16:01] S13sam: Waffle or chat, is anyone well versed in programming led boards with controllers to control multiple dancing/strobing modes?
[6:16:17] Krawberries: @S13sam What do you need?
[6:18:09] S13sam: @krawberries Trying to see if it’s possible to simplify and update building custom led taillights for show cars. Most of the original japanese imports have multiple large controller boxes and what seems like 100 different wires
[6:18:34] CovertPyro: no
[6:18:35] S13sam: i figure with todays technology it could be much simpler and improved

[6:41:36] script_terror: you can put an itemduct on the top of the barrel
[6:41:55] MrArrig: Im thinking poop insertion speed isn't that important, the bottleneck is probably in the fluid transposers?
[6:42:00] OfficerMilkshake: hoppers work too with the barrel
[6:42:23] daftMOOSE: @script_terror That might cause a jam if a poop tries to go in when the barrel has sewage in it
[6:42:41] Acr6007: E = MC Shit?
