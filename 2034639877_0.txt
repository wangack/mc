[0:04:49] mindacrossing: I have been playing VH since 3rd edition came out and I just completed my first scav… < I know I am awful at the game) but it felt so good to get that completion

[0:05:01] rytional: GG, they just need to get good
[0:05:02] Pocket_Vally: I love that you are streaming but why at nearly 23…
[0:05:04] Hymdallr: Skill difference
[0:05:05] k1_setae: it is not too hard but it is alot harder than in co-op
[0:05:07] rad_ju: 13 min left?

[0:05:15] flotje_: iskCOOL
[0:05:16] damnsecci: no mic and here i hear him talking lol
[0:05:16] BigPoppaHouse: This is my first playthrough of VH, I am 0 for 3 on scav vaults. Not quitting though!
[0:05:18] Darkstar159: You mean you'll actually focus on the Scav from the beginning and not leave it to the last 10mins?
[0:05:19] ShelobsLair_: HALLO Iskall and Dylan
[0:05:20] fiddlyfudbucket: GAMBA???
[0:05:22] P3pp3rF1y: I believe the issue may be that we don't scale scavs based on difficulty so normal / easy have much harder scavs for their level
[0:05:22] RobotSerpent3000: bye guys
[0:05:28] theb0redpotato: Are you going to do any mega vaults anytime soon?
[0:05:29] TaliaTwist: is this a soul flame one?

[0:05:42] Attackeight: @P3pp3rF1y Scaling for the scavs might be benneficial
[0:05:42] muppification: no greeding? who are you
[0:05:43] TAxels: crate icon?
[0:05:43] Cat_0012: Gamba iskall
[0:05:45] Diggles11: iskall not greeding? who is this and what did you do with iskall
[0:05:46] tonTeufel: honestly with the individually adjustable difficulty and the big range from piece of cake to fragged vh is doing pretty well
[0:05:48] morgonsockan01: do you Schedule your streams or are they just random
[0:05:49] sneakypete55: hypno has lost like 5 in a row on scavs right now

[0:06:12] matjea: in the generic info

[0:06:52] Cat_0012: @pocket_vally u should get the sleep and watch vodskall later
[0:06:53] dominte_emanuel: Helloo raideea
[0:06:54] tonTeufel: The vault stats screen could use a lot of love. It doesn't even scale to the available space
[0:06:55] BigPoppaHouse: For me, it's definitely a skill issue! I'm just not fast enough in the vault.
[0:06:56] PurpleLunalesca: I think it's absolutely a skill to b

[0:07:06] GreatLakesGirl: No mic featuring mic
[0:07:08] Kasszi_: HELLO
[0:07:09] Tyler_Rose_94: I rarely ever win scav 😂 usually because I have one item that I’ve just struggled to see the chests for. but I’ll be the first to admit that because I’m scared of getting lost in the vault I don’t explore a huge amount of the vault. (maybe just two lines)
[0:07:10] TAxels: yeah mobility seems super important. I'd be interested in see you do a scav without wings
[0:07:11] CapraDiCollina: hallooo

[0:07:18] GlamPixie: Hypno raaaid
[0:07:19] jakisco98: Scavs are skillbased. I am poor and won't complete even in piece of cake. But that is only due to my own limitations
[0:07:21] NeptonX: I love scavs. It is difficult, but I'm not very skilled
[0:07:22] Kasszi_: Hi SEcci!!!
[0:07:22] Darkwytchcraft: we got a really awful one last night, lvl 16 and lvl 22 but it was frustrating

[0:08:05] CoconutTiim: yea I think scav should be the challenging objective for sure
[0:08:08] ShelobsLair_: @damnsecci We’ll get well soon! Your vodskall videos have been killing it!
[0:08:09] strandberggg: ofc
[0:08:10] Kasszi_: Is Salsa sleeping? modCheck
[0:08:10] Prowl8413: I feel like one answer could be that base scav runs should be easier, but you need a objective difficulty modifier that boosts how hard the objective is in exchange for higher reward
[0:08:10] Buggyhoser: scav gives best loot it shouldn’t be the easiest
[0:08:11] matjea: had a scav with 2 omega yesterday. Had to bail because of empty jars
[0:08:15] tomasdev: I dont think knowledge is skill
[0:08:18] tomasdev: poll?
[0:08:19] BigPoppaHouse: I'm at lvl 32 in VH, still haven't seen a dungeon yet! lol
[0:08:19] valkojam: Expedia a skill, for sure.
[0:08:21] waysidescroll: Its a part of skill
[0:08:22] Zinoba: dylans always helping
[0:08:26] ValueTown: knowledge is part of skill
[0:08:26] Arqae: Knowledge is definitely skill
[0:08:26] Darkwytchcraft: partly skill partly game luck getting items in the chest
[0:08:27] dragonslayerx453: Knolage is power
[0:08:27] Hip_Frame: Knowledge enhances skill
[0:08:29] ShelobsLair_: @Kasszi_ HALLO
[0:08:30] bestbla: nah keep scavs like this if they don't like them they can just exit the vault crystals are free anyway
[0:08:31] MathiMand_: skill is also time spenc
[0:08:34] darkhold_user: With scavs you get the best reward, so a hard objective is expected
[0:08:35] bhavyajain05_: i think knowledge is kind of a skill
[0:08:36] TAxels: knowledge is the result of skill
[0:08:36] flotje_: sssht man you were going to save your voice
[0:08:37] pikadude1228b: Knowledge is definitely a type of skill
[0:08:38] damnsecci: @ShelobsLair_ its not all me obviously :D i only edit the vod parts, but ive been busy past days yes
[0:08:38] AquantisLive: knowlage is not a skill, but it's a base for EVERY skill
[0:08:38] PremieressS: @Hip_Frame 100% this
[0:08:40] Stupi_001: !nomic
[0:08:40] mrjackal85: Experience is knowledge is power
[0:08:41] Nightbot: i am chilling and have very little to no mic, voice needs resting :D
[0:08:41] Odiioo: knowledge is power in some games
[0:08:44] jakisco98: Depends. If you get it from in game sure. If you get it from watching stream, maybe no
[0:08:45] I_AM_JAFAM: I_AM_JAFAM subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 18 months! 
[0:08:46] TheRedBrain: knowing how to use knowledge is skill
[0:08:46] JulesInSpace: How you use knowledge is skill
[0:08:48] thestupidtrooper: Yo
[0:08:48] Treity: i would argue skill, because no matter how much i play, i cant seem to memorize things like i see tango did
[0:08:50] LeoTheLeopardNZ: I do find Scav easier with friends, since we're able to help each other out and extend our time longer than if we were alone, but I don't think Scav is too difficult
[0:08:51] tricksofevil: knowledge is skill acquired
[0:08:51] tomasdev: _applied knowledge_ is skill...
[0:08:52] Cat_0012: Knowledge is optional
[0:08:53] darmongames: what are we talkingabout?
[0:08:55] pikadude1228b: Having knowledge of your options and how the game works is a skill
[0:08:56] JashinFanatic: knowledge is a skill, but I've sometimes had gilded as an objective, explored 2 lines with only 1 gilded poi and no dungeons
[0:08:56] Ribery931: Knowing where dungeons are helps so much with scavs
[0:09:00] Darkwytchcraft: if the items needed scaled with level it would likely be a bit better.  you get luck too with what you need to find
[0:09:01] Kasszi_: ivee never seen him START a live this late lol
[0:09:02] Xarallon: Luck and skill are not opposite, they are orthogonal, maybe knowledge is orthogonal too
[0:09:03] GhostlyMarrow49: knowledge can be skill if you know how to use knowledge
[0:09:03] Therank2100: Knowledge is power, so inherently you become better the more you know and retain
[0:09:04] Tyler_Rose_94: I don’t think knowledge equals skill… my partner knows A LOT about league of legends but he’s still in silver most seasons
[0:09:06] ValueTown: the only scavs i take issue with is the ones where it wants like 12 pottery shards
[0:09:06] untruthfully: even mr peter doesnt get 100%
[0:09:07] ShelobsLair_: I agree
[0:09:09] thestupidtrooper: Thought you said no mic
[0:09:09] Kasszi_: Hi Shelobs!!
[0:09:09] vaporize_xl: I like that it's not 100%
[0:09:11] motlin: getting it, using it is a skill, but knowledge itself is not i think
[0:09:11] tomasdev: @pikadude1228b if you don't use it, it can't be a skill
[0:09:12] sk1pwatt: decked out showed ethos supreme skill at map memorisation, same for VH rooms/POIs
[0:09:13] Zinoba: @Kasszi_ p sure, is late for him. of course that also never stopped you lmao
[0:09:16] damnsecci: @Kasszi_ these are very very rare occasions
[0:09:18] Tyler_Rose_94: but I will admit that knowledge does help in the vaults
[0:09:23] Kasszi_: @Kasszi_ so true
[0:09:23] sid9dipple: no fun in games with no danger
[0:09:24] Jake_A_Tron: hi iskall
[0:09:25] gnarlyyycharlieee: hallo gm gm
[0:09:25] Tyler_Rose_94: and in games in general
[0:09:26] ShelobsLair_: @Kasszi_ How are you today ?
[0:09:27] rytional: I'm no good and I'm probably 70% completion
[0:09:30] fortune85_: damn its been a while since i catches you live
[0:09:33] momaggie1273: Scavs are fun because of how difficult they are for me
[0:09:36] brett30105: !nomic
[0:09:36] Nightbot: i am chilling and have very little to no mic, voice needs resting :D
[0:09:36] Garnail20: noone wins every hand of poker, yet it requires skill too
[0:09:36] NGw7_: Anything that is RNG is not skill based. U can just have bad luck, loot thousand chests and not get what u need.
[0:09:41] TAxels: if you can hit the loot thresholds to normalize the RNG you should be able to counteract luck with large numbers
[0:09:43] joel_nk: i mean what really is "skill"? isn't it the ability to do good at a certain task? So if your knowledge helps complete a task like scav hunts more effectively, than I'd argue that knowledge is skill
[0:09:44] goofyme: Hello mr iskall
[0:09:51] ValueTown: @nichtg tell that to poker pros
[0:09:51] Kasszi_: I was getting up and saw he messaged me and I'm like "what is iskall doing?" and noticed he was streeaming and got out of bed faster KEKW
[0:09:55] BONNe1704: Well, if I have green thing in top, i offten even not bother with scav
[0:09:56] EldritchDigger: Knowledge is absolutely a skill. One can spend a lot of tiime and not learn anything.
[0:10:01] mrjackal85: The more you run, the more you watch, the more you know, the easier it gets. But it's the same with almost any game. This game is so expansive that it's hard to know everything
[0:10:02] damnsecci: @Kasszi_ kek
[0:10:06] LeoTheLeopardNZ: Love the look of the new Dungeons
[0:10:09] tomasdev: @ValueTown skill is what you do with your RNG
[0:10:21] Earnham: @mrjackal85 totally agree
[0:10:22] CrunchyZedman: !nomic
[0:10:23] Aylabar: Majestic charm Pog
[0:10:24] Nightbot: i am chilling and have very little to no mic, voice needs resting :D
[0:10:33] Kasszi_: @Kasszi_ idk if he's noticed im up or not :P
[0:10:37] damnsecci: why is this such cool chill late night iskall
[0:10:45] Zinoba: @Kasszi_ lmaoo
[0:10:46] damnsecci: there is like this late night vibe over his voice
[0:10:54] thestupidtrooper: It's cold
[0:10:56] damnsecci: like my etho sleep sessions
[0:10:57] melonhunt: @damnsecci yeahh, i feel that too, so comfy
[0:10:58] CheekyGirl43: @damnsecci so true
[0:11:00] xsmilesx: I have a like 99% completion rate with scavs… a lot of it comes down to being able to actually focus on only what you need
[0:11:04] R_The_Viking: I'm on about 65-70% completion on scavs now, which I think is down to my knowledge and skill. I happy with that as without know and skill I was probably on 20%. It's about getting better at the game means you have a higher chance of completion
[0:11:14] Zinoba: @Kasszi_ kass you know he always ignores u 😔 we know you are here though
[0:11:17] TaliaTwist: i did 2 ornate dungeons and 3 ornate secrets and couldnt get 1 saddle bag and lost the scav
[0:11:18] Attackeight: @P3pp3rF1y That would be good for the Hunt The Guardians objective too
[0:11:21] forelini: iskall knows everything
[0:11:22] Ramzi65ok: ah perfect
[0:11:23] novemberromeo1: Use of knowledge is part of having skill, otherwise knowledge is useless
[0:11:26] lordsfave: it does help
[0:11:27] flippy_1496: almost didn’t click when I saw no mic, but thought “nah it’s iskall he can’t resist” and here we are
[0:11:29] bhavyajain05_: tbh scav are my favorite out of all the objectives in the game like when you just want to get loot then elixer is great but if you want some kind of challange the scav is great but i think since scav is harder compared to other objectives it should give a lot more exp imo
[0:11:31] tre_2018: Had to abandon a VOD when I suddenly saw this lol
[0:11:38] 0of1est: 6 I think lol
[0:11:41] ShelobsLair_: @Kasszi_ do we wanna do a „will he complete“ gamba or just chill?
[0:11:43] krostoffrosvik: Game knowledge is skill. It'd be rather reductive to write off beating a boss in a game like Elden Ring as just game knowledge and not skill.
[0:11:44] noxe_jkl: Heyo iskall! How the weather there? Pretty cold in east US rn
[0:11:45] bhavyajain05_: @0of1est same
[0:11:48] Kasszi_: @Kasszi_ I think sometimes he pretends NODDERS I adore you Dylans.
[0:12:00] Kasszi_: @ShelobsLair_ oh I could!
[0:12:00] MasterTRED: Quick question, i plan to start a fresh world is it better to wait for update 13 before i do?
[0:12:01] NGw7_: @ValueTown Poker is something different. There is bluff, strategies, cheating. That is not complete RNG, luck based.
[0:12:03] Colebot17: Is there a way to move the pickup notifier closer to the center of the screen?
[0:12:03] billy_butcher79: hallo
[0:12:06] kot7k: i Saw "no mic" and got sad but then he has mix 🤣🤣🤣
[0:12:10] Darkwytchcraft: still don't know how to know it's an ore room tbh, still tryin to figure things out. It was her first scav tho, and to say it was frustrating is putting it mildly
[0:12:12] Ramzi65ok: at least you won't fall into powdered snow here
[0:12:13] norvillesdingus: Hallo Iskall! super hyped for the coming update!
[0:12:16] vichyra: '' i think i think a lot'' is a mood lol
[0:12:16] Attackeight: !nomic
[0:12:16] Nightbot: i am chilling and have very little to no mic, voice needs resting :D
[0:12:20] basteyos: He's a SCAV-MAN. Skipidididi dododo .. dododo!
[0:12:22] Zinoba: vh lives rent free in my head and i am not even playing!
[0:12:23] Tinokk85: Knowledge and skill are needed for scavs, but so is good judgement. You need to know when to focus a chest/ore/coin type instead of just looting aimlessly.
[0:12:26] MaximumLiberty: Maybe it's a skill issue. I think I've completed one scav.
[0:12:26] elemelonnn: @MasterTRED a lot of the changes are late game imo so i would say you can just update tbh
[0:12:27] Svennonontwitch: Skill is how you use your knowledge.
[0:12:30] Ithilrae: I thought it was mute lol
[0:12:33] just_megnn: I've gotten way better at playing vh watching you play
[0:12:37] mastertaint: Iskall no mic talks constantly
[0:12:37] Kasszi_:  GAMBA IS UP
[0:12:44] Darkwytchcraft: question: does this ever scale with level?

[0:12:59] sylbel_w: A nice chill iskall stream the perfect treat
[0:13:00] redstonedad: Hello Iskall and chat!
[0:13:06] iPassiive: @Darkwytchcraft the scav items? yes
[0:13:18] CoconutTiim: that’s why scavs scale with level. if you’re not making a hammer to make it easier then that’s not the vaults fault
[0:13:21] lynx6008: Hallo iskall how was your day sir
[0:13:24] fortune85_: damn shelobs on the offensive with a no
[0:13:24] justaguynexttoyou: hallo what did i miss?
[0:13:32] twistytommy01: although i'll only complete 1 in 20 scav's, i still find them very enjoyable
[0:13:42] Attackeight: @Darkwytchcraft scales with level but not vault difficulty (yet)
[0:13:43] Xarallon: if you use diamond pickaxe without vein mine at this level - skill issue
[0:13:45] fakegermano: cool nomic lol

[0:14:07] damnsecci: late night gambas here
[0:14:08] Attackeight: !cookies @xverion_
[0:14:09] Nightbot: Here, xverion_ have some cookies!
[0:14:14] chager212: Expecting someone to have a hammer so that an ore room is “processed” in less than a minute is completely reasonable. That’s the point of the game
[0:14:16] loading0110: wooo an Iskall stream when im not asleep!
[0:14:17] Ramzi65ok: more coins!
[0:14:20] nounou26x: take it

[0:14:25] Nightbot: Stress has been hugged 17960 times! Gotta luv ‘er!, ya monsta!
[0:14:27] the_whtvr: this “no mic” sounds weird
[0:14:31] Kasszi_: @charlesjhnfrtz ello!
[0:14:33] henryt__: Getting good at Scavs is a thing that I barely experienced at my late lvl 80s. So I think a lot of people complaining about Scav difficulty are also impatient.
[0:14:33] damnsecci: gmgmgmgm @charlesjhnfrtz
[0:14:43] Attackeight: @snowyowl369 like 20 i think
[0:14:44] skierbrenn: I have used roughly 400 vault gold this week alone cause of dying! not a fun time to be me
[0:14:50] Darkwytchcraft: @Attackeight that's a bit frustrating, I mean we were low level and don't have the best gear/tools yet.
[0:14:51] damnsecci: chat remember this
[0:14:57] rad_ju: why does the breaking overlay stay on the water in this theme?
[0:14:58] argetlaam007: !stress

[0:15:36] redstonedad: @iskall85 do you ever feel like you're always defending scavenger vaults???
[0:15:46] tezdogg: gm gm gm from Australia
[0:15:47] nystadt: Any release date for the update?
[0:15:48] basteyos: Can we add some seconds for turning items on easy mode?

[0:15:58] tre_2018: Iskall rambling about his scav is IskallASMR
[0:15:58] Darkwytchcraft: remember though that scavs happen at low levels as well and gear at low levels isnt' exactly at it's prime
[0:16:06] damnsecci: this is a late night iskall podcast on scavs i love it
[0:16:09] GerbilOfWolves: 12 black
[0:16:15] Animeinlove_: YAY no pic WITH mic!! tbh, im happy you have the mic, even if i was hoping for some SUPER GOOD music :3
[0:16:16] futureimagineer13: Hallo everyone!
[0:16:27] waysidescroll: I feel like i can not even pay attention to scavs for the first half of the vault and usually complete them
[0:16:31] fakegermano: I love this it sounds like a recording
[0:16:34] quirkyship28698: Do scavs scale with difficulty level?
[0:16:46] k1_setae: they are not hard. they have completely different playstyle for them
[0:16:48] Zinoba: its an emotion thing again
[0:16:49] adddy21: Hey Iskall!
[0:16:52] Lashings: If it can track gold in your backpacks can it pull scav items out of your pouches as well
[0:16:55] Kasszi_: secci can you take the [no mic] from his title KEKW
[0:17:01] LOLitzAshwin: Trinket Pog
[0:17:05] mindacrossing: definitely an emotional feel good

[0:17:22] kibaz_x: Nice trinky
[0:17:23] jpblocki_21: Hi Chat
[0:17:24] skierbrenn: but scavs are so easy!
[0:17:26] charlesjhnfrtz: @damnsecci keep it
[0:17:29] gorsolotri: I'm lvl 100...early game I was about 30% completion...late game about 80%
[0:17:32] MaximumLiberty: Had there been a change to scavs in the update?
[0:17:35] damnsecci: @damnsecci it's THE PERFECT EXAMPLE of iskall's unability to PLAN
[0:17:40] Kasszi_: scav crates are already insane
[0:17:49] Ramzi65ok: i used to get a ton of cage dust when spawners only broke 50% of the time
[0:17:54] FreudPlays: sir you lied
[0:17:56] the_whtvr: scavs are harder since there’s one more layer of rng with them, there’s rng on rolls you need, on chests you find and then on what you get from the chests, elixirs don’t have this extra layer, and other types have even less of it
[0:17:57] FreudPlays: you have a mic
[0:17:58] lenjenben: @damnsecci kek
[0:17:59] flippy_1496: part of the reason I love scavs is the feeling of leaving and noticing how many of a chest type I looted because I struggle to target loot in other vaults
[0:18:02] loading0110: Scavs are the best objective because its completely random each time
[0:18:08] FreudPlays: how dare you lie on the internet
[0:18:09] Skywalker8510: dang ads
[0:18:11] kibaz_x: I agree with you, people are mad because they can't deal with "failure"
[0:18:12] XeroTheStreamer: hello
[0:18:13] charlesjhnfrtz: @damnsecci true lol, man can't help but to ramble on and on and im all for it
[0:18:17] skierbrenn: So glad iskallman is strimming today
[0:18:20] Kasszi_: oh lawd it's Freud
[0:18:29] FreudPlays: hai kazzssii
[0:18:30] tre_2018: @Skywalker8510 IKR? Twitch wanting that coin -_-
[0:18:32] InflatablePanda: are scav items the same rates in all chests?
[0:18:33] CheekyGirl43: @damnsecci but even so, it's still a chill chat
[0:18:37] Ramzi65ok: you're meant to win
[0:18:37] HighlyRatedYT: HighlyRatedYT subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months, currently on a 1 month streak! i love bosses

[0:18:39] FreudPlays: dont mind me just making my vault hunters remake KEKW
[0:18:45] randqmized: make command to choose difficulty of certain objectives
[0:18:49] Xarallon: souls like is "the" difficult genre
[0:18:54] CoconutTiim: same I love challenging games
[0:18:54] mastertaint: Most modern games are interactive movies
[0:18:56] z0studios: hello peeps
[0:19:10] skierbrenn: trust me, VH is hard for me. I almost threw my laptop across the room the other day when I died and had to pay 170 gold for my body
[0:19:13] redstonedad: It's our age Iskall. We remember playing video games in the 80s lol
[0:19:13] Loosenut2024: Thats why I've played Doom Eternal since its launch. It has an insanely high skill ceiling and is hard. But SO rewarding to play
[0:19:19] Ramzi65ok: solution: hunter vrs hunter iskTroll
[0:19:20] damnsecci: I remember iskall once saying " i do not lose in MTG"
[0:19:23] pigeon_killer1: Also, if you lose sometimes winning feels better
[0:19:28] StrangePanthers: I love this game because it helps me improve my other Minecraft and gaming skills
[0:19:32] tre_2018: @skierbrenn *whispers* Casual mode
[0:19:36] TheOnePercentGotMyMain: I think the issue has become, games want to appeal to everyone, and not everyone has infinite time to play, so when something is hard it turns into something that feels like additional work instead of fun IMO
[0:19:43] Darkwytchcraft: challenging games do exist, a downside to your scav is that it doesnt' even scale to piece of cake. if you're talkin  about skills
[0:19:52] batt3ryac1d: no mic btw LUL
[0:19:53] untruthfully: yea but you can toggle the diffuculy, maybe you should auto default it to the esaier difficulties and if you want the harder ones you can opt into it
[0:19:57] rhometheus: the comments on this vodskall video are going to be very ignorant
[0:19:58] Kasszi_: i wont leddit scavs but i WILL leddit fizzle spawners in village rooms Madge
[0:20:01] Darkwytchcraft: and you just said unlucky with regards to mobs.
[0:20:08] JustAlecz: @rhometheus agreed
[0:20:10] red_mask333: oh whoa. this is the first time in a while i was able to make to a stream. its always too early for me
[0:20:11] ShelobsLair_: it makes sense to me
[0:20:11] Wint3rhart: @TheOnePercentGotMyMain yeah.  I like a challenge - but it needs to be achievable, for a casual gamer, because I just don't have the time to put into "getting good" :|
[0:20:14] damnsecci: no its chillax late night podcast voice
[0:20:15] skierbrenn: @skierbrenn I know, but I do like the challenge. had to run so many vaults with lower gear to get the gold from the vaults. made me try other things
[0:20:23] Darkwytchcraft: I'm not a guy
[0:20:25] Croseven: speedrun tutorial on how to get better Kappa
[0:20:26] scoopycalash: it makes sense
[0:20:29] adashira: I mine this Chillskall versio of u
[0:20:34] JashinFanatic: I think the objective should be completable by most, and skill should matter on how much leeway to loot you have
[0:20:36] adashira: *like
[0:20:37] Ramzi65ok: won't the game always be balanced around hard?
[0:20:47] nitsua14ninja: iskEagle
[0:20:52] charlesjhnfrtz: man bingeing vodskall85 on 1.5x makes strems feel so slow
[0:21:01] Lashings: A nerf to scav difficulty would be just adding a premade bag for it that people can craft
[0:21:12] basteyos: How about extra seconds on the timer, when you turn in items for easy/casual mode.
[0:21:19] jl52021: Hi
[0:21:19] Darkwytchcraft: I had 5 to go for and my daughter had 3 in our first POC vault
[0:21:21] CheekyGirl43: but it's already easier on lower modes, because mobs are easier
[0:21:22] tre_2018: @Darkwytchcraft We all "sir"s here and we are all Dylan LUL
[0:21:24] Ramzi65ok: difficulty affects the mobs, not the ammount of chests
[0:21:27] sunlitmoss: love this chill iskall podcsat
[0:21:29] qerutar: if you kill mobs faster it makes objective easier
[0:21:29] batt3ryac1d: scaling the objective to level is way simpler tbh
[0:21:30] ShelobsLair_: I like that objectives don’t Skale, everything else is scaled
[0:21:33] CoconutTiim: people just want stuff for free it seems like
[0:21:33] hellpiegamin: Can ya speak up i can't hear you over all this rain we have here , silly tin roofs makes it 10x louder :(
[0:21:39] loading0110: its that easy on peice of cake?
[0:21:39] bighero258: easier mobs=easier loot
[0:21:45] Zinoba: you underestimate how bad i really am at the game lol
[0:21:56] CoconutTiim: makes for good sleep tho @hellpiegamin
[0:22:10] Darkwytchcraft: actually the mobs do scale as far as damage to me and me to them, I'm assuming your gear does factor
[0:22:11] sgt_susman: !nomic
[0:22:12] Nightbot: i am chilling and have very little to no mic, voice needs resting :D
[0:22:12] Darkstar159: !nomic
[0:22:26] Kasszi_: remembering when kriskiki died in a dungeon on peace of cake
[0:22:28] the_whtvr: what about making it possible to roll more than one item from the same chest? I mean that you could have required drowned hide and zombie arms, that way you would need one less type of chests
[0:22:29] tre_2018: @CoconutTiim Might as well play in peaceful and have no mobs spawn assuming that MC mode effects vaults
[0:22:35] ShelobsLair_: I agree it doesn’t need to be scaled
[0:22:35] damnsecci: @Kasszi_ rofl
[0:22:36] hellpiegamin: @CoconutTiim lol sleeps whats that? it's 8:59am for me , yet to go sleep lol , was up all nite on path of exile with the crew
[0:22:38] CoconutTiim: skill issue @kasszi_

[0:22:46] Ramzi65ok: ur good
[0:22:47] TAxels: makes sense
[0:22:48] FreudPlays: you're horrible
[0:22:49] Smurfz87: agree
[0:22:51] untruthfully: make sense
[0:22:51] tonTeufel: Discord FAQ says it's 25% of hard, not 10%
[0:22:51] CheekyGirl43: yes i agree
[0:22:52] Darkwytchcraft: I'm not mad, but I really do wish I could talk to a person face to face, because a lot of what is said is dependant on how you read what is written
[0:22:52] ShelobsLair_: yep makes sense
[0:22:52] rytional: you make sense
[0:22:53] Teeldove: Makes sense to me
[0:22:53] enne0404: agree
[0:22:53] mystoken: yes
[0:22:53] Tntaap1: piece of cupcake
[0:22:54] VogelVrouw: it definitely makes sense
[0:22:56] bhavyajain05_: agree
[0:22:58] crackrjack05: makes perfect sense
[0:22:59] jaruzicpark: no you’re right

[0:23:04] StrangePanthers: Yeah
[0:23:04] Lizerdman87: it makes total sense
[0:23:05] TheAmateurQueen: I agree. Makes enough sense to me
[0:23:05] darknessmeoooow: makes sense! thanks for explaining
[0:23:08] Xarallon: are the chest rarity and scav item rarity tied together?
[0:23:09] CoconutTiim: hey @lazypandaman
[0:23:09] darckdragon63: darckdragon63 subscribed with Prime. 
[0:23:09] Ice1Berrgg: Yes this makes a LOT of sense sir
[0:23:10] CheekyGirl43: i like the challenge on easy/normal, while I don't like the extra damage
[0:23:10] TheOnePercentGotMyMain: If im being a developer about it, you defined a setting for casual people and are worrying about it being TOO casual
[0:23:10] GhostlyMarrow49: when you play a campaign are you complaining that the levels don’t become shorter when doing a lower difficulty?
[0:23:11] forelini: I always trust the process tho yknow
[0:23:11] FreudPlays: @FreudPlays kekw
[0:23:14] maxdisney: maxdisney subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 10 months! 
[0:23:14] Kastumoem: The funniest way to scale it would be that piece of cake always will spawn an item in a chest instead of 50%
[0:23:15] Krebstarr: Having been raised on the original NES, this feels totally fine
[0:23:15] pirateyoho76: Makes sense, we agree in our house
[0:23:15] Lymmoo: have you explored the idea of being able to reroll a particular scav item needed for a cost ofc?
[0:23:16] douira: all the things in the game work together, it make sense that scaling a very important factor in it would make the overall difficulty easier
[0:23:18] martynn32: I totally get that
[0:23:20] Lashings: Multiple difficulty settings make games harder to design I think
[0:23:21] fortune85_: scav check ?
[0:23:23] GerbilOfWolves: it's nice to have scalling explained
[0:23:23] coolspider92932: greed is good
[0:23:25] FreudPlays: how you feeling @damnsecci
[0:23:30] strandberggg: u spotted that fast
[0:23:30] SivysPlays: Nothing wrong with scavs, excactly. It provides variety to the vault challenges
[0:23:34] damnsecci: @FreudPlays not as dead as the weekend
[0:23:34] Nightbot: Vault Hunters Reddit for you to check out! https://www.reddit.com/r/VaultHuntersMinecraft/
[0:23:35] ShelobsLair_: I agree sir
[0:23:37] TAxels: you're very fast at identifying ore rooms, do you have any tips?
[0:23:38] miraculousmultifan: i find that my only problem with scav is that i am not fast enough/skilled enough yet. nothing to do with the game itself, its a skill issue
[0:23:38] scoopycalash: or be a pacifist like brry
[0:23:39] FreudPlays: pag
[0:23:41] CipheredEntity: Hey Iskall, What do you think about changing the mastery talents to vault mob archetypes, like Hoard, Dweller, Assassin, and Tank?
[0:23:41] hellpiegamin: @CoconutTiim lol it's pretty much the norm for me , go to sleep around 12pm'ish and then back up at 3pm backing to grinding again
[0:23:41] chager212: I really like the scaling where it is. Sometimes the negative people are just louder :/
[0:23:41] BeMMMKay: BeMMMKay subscribed with Prime. 
[0:23:45] GerbilOfWolves: it's indirect scaling
[0:23:46] batt3ryac1d: @Xarallon yeah higher item rarity % makes you get omega/whatever chests more often
[0:23:48] coolspider92932: I understand you
[0:23:51] moreno175: what info I just got here rip
[0:23:57] tre_2018: I get it...Still hate god altars tho :P

[0:24:03] pajamaman7: vanilla minecraft difficulty changes very little besides mob damage
[0:24:05] TheUltimateRaider: ITTSSSSSGALLLLLLLL STARE
[0:24:05] Darkwytchcraft: Like I said, and keep saying, context when chatting is important and it's hard to convey things in the medium of a chat. Especially when you are used to talking directly to other humans
[0:24:06] VogelVrouw: i do think scavs are hard, but when i do complete one it feels amazing
[0:24:06] darknessmeoooow: it did change my mind!
[0:24:07] Ryking09: !nomic
[0:24:07] Ramzi65ok: I am playing on easy only to play without having to drain alters, once the update hits def going back to hard, it's much better
[0:24:07] CoconutTiim: nope I want it all for free iskall Kappa
[0:24:08] TheImmortaldonut: It's definitely something I hadn't thought about before
[0:24:09] Nightbot: i am chilling and have very little to no mic, voice needs resting :D
[0:24:10] frostelisbd: nah i supported you from the season 1, do your thing Iskall you’r amazing
[0:24:22] Darkstar159: Could you add shorter vaults as a game setting? Scaling accordingly for people with less time to play
[0:24:23] ablkus: !nomic
[0:24:25] dyniss_: Skill that would let you reroll one two or free scag items and nums?
[0:24:38] Hielo88: Why there is only a cake vault and not a pie one ?
[0:24:41] dyniss_: Even tho I think it's good as it is
[0:24:45] Kastumoem: Tomato soup
[0:24:46] GerbilOfWolves: i don't think that the objective is easier, it's just easier to complete
[0:24:47] Ramzi65ok: @Hielo88 dev bias
[0:24:51] DraamaQ: i would argue that gaming is more fun when it’s not easy. yeah it’s pretty satisfying playing on arcade mode with autocompleted crystals for example, but I’m only satisfied for a second. but playing on a harder difficulty means that that I’m more proud of my own progress and therefore it gives me more satisfaction longer to make my own crystals or not being able to complete EVERY vault
[0:24:58] Attackeight: @Hielo88 missed opportunity...
[0:25:05] Skywalker8510: I wonder if you could make objective scaling a gamerule. that would solve the problem for the few that see it as a problem.
[0:25:11] certified_kaos: I'm playing my solo world while watching you
[0:25:13] kibaz_x: I rarely complete scavs, but I know it's a skill issue so when I need to complete I just don't do scavs, and when I need more challenge I do them, easy
[0:25:19] Ramzi65ok: as much as death feels punishing now i miss the hardcoreness of vh2
[0:25:20] italopussi: I know VH is better on multiplayer. But why not scale scav UP with the players amount?
[0:25:22] damnsecci: @Darkstar159 we have higher loot settings, which basically does the same. Gives you twice the loot in 30 mins, does the same as normal loot in 15. I think a different game mode like that wont be implemented though
[0:25:27] s1m0n251: !nomic
[0:25:29] Nfora: scabs stack ultimate kinds of rng together, so extreme outcomes stand out a lot
[0:25:29] TheImmortaldonut: Your skill build pays a big role in combination with the gear too
[0:25:31] DynoFusion: Why does the title say no mic
[0:25:38] intomain: hallo
[0:25:38] Nightbot: i am chilling and have very little to no mic, voice needs resting :D
[0:25:42] frostelisbd: because even if everything is a piece of cake where is the challenge right?
[0:25:44] Kasszi_: @DynoFusion because he is a silly man
[0:25:51] Ramzi65ok: also have been having a ton of fun with my battle cry build which is made to 1 shot crabs
[0:25:57] Nfora: autocorrect mangled that, oh well
[0:25:58] Dutchieb87: !nomic
[0:26:00] sezzabez: Hallo
[0:26:01] Nightbot: i am chilling and have very little to no mic, voice needs resting :D
[0:26:03] batt3ryac1d: @DynoFusion I'm assuming he was planning on not really talking much and is getting carried away KEKW
[0:26:09] zinou2019: why not using your soul flame 🔥?
[0:26:18] DynoFusion: I love when this man rants
[0:26:18] antegravity: Have we finished a puzzle room in this playthrough?
[0:26:23] damnsecci: pro stremmer
[0:26:27] fortune85_: hey iskall love the whole chat but the SCAV !!
[0:26:34] rad_ju: very humble
[0:26:35] Xarallon: not only do you play as much as you like, you make the game
[0:26:36] loading0110: yeah that's your job you should absolutely be better than us
[0:26:38] Ramzi65ok: its ok etho is still better
[0:26:40] FreudPlays: wheres my etho content
[0:26:41] IceSpice12: whatsup cream lords
[0:26:45] futureimagineer13: @frostelisbd you see, it's people like you that iskall needs to listen to more. Let's be so fr right now, Iskall listens constantly to the jerky Johns, but struggles to listen to the people who care, and believe in him
[0:26:47] Lizerdman87: I’m well aware how much better you are at this. it’s why I love watching. but I love playing the game even tho I’m not as good lol
[0:26:51] Ccbeemee: it's gamer pride
[0:26:51] damnsecci: @FreudPlays vodskall
[0:26:53] Kasszi_: i neeed to take my dog out brb
[0:26:56] MaximumLiberty: Trueing
[0:26:56] untruthfully: imagine someone compares to pete
[0:26:59] damnsecci: !vods
[0:26:59] Nightbot: Watch iskall85’s VOD’s at https://youtube.com/@vodskall85
[0:27:01] Ramzi65ok: if the game was easy it would be about getting lucky with loot rooms and finishing
[0:27:02] Solly8700: he skilled issuee'ed all of us ,,hahahahah
[0:27:03] FreudPlays: @FreudPlays watched it alreadyyyy
[0:27:03] Kasszi_: behave dylans (and iskall)
[0:27:04] Attackeight: @FreudPlays we 'dylans' come here for iskall...
[0:27:11] the_weerdo: Exactly. I love impossible dungeons, but I play on normal difficulty
[0:27:11] damnsecci: @Kasszi_ no *REBELS&
[0:27:14] loufo_21: Have you thought about making a full gank/thorn build available in the game (I just started my playthrough but from what I've seen it exist as a "class")
[0:27:15] PixleChris: i play on easy arcade mode, because i'm lazy and i'm okay with that.
[0:27:17] FreudPlays: @FreudPlays sorry im a bleb
[0:27:18] loading0110: 25%
[0:27:19] f0uad01: What do you think about a pity system for scav items to reduce the annoyance of rng like every 9 living chest you opened and didn't get a drowned hide you a guaranteed one at your 10th chest
[0:27:19] oDtEoDoA: my main issue is scav is supposed to be a challenging obj but I can randomly get it
[0:27:21] BlarZek34: I started on cake now running normal and level 53
[0:27:22] eselpgagHD: Its literally why you have lower difficulty, so it can be used
[0:27:22] Coralotl: Skill isn’t a morality thing, but I think that is a hard thing to grasp sometimes
[0:27:24] dcptcncrescendo: My husband and I changed our difficulty to fit our play style and we have loads of fun
[0:27:24] xblacker89: @iskall85  what if elements can be a thing and can get effective with wands and such
[0:27:24] red_mask333: i like the multiple difficulties cause we can start easy and progress to harder as we become more skilled
[0:27:25] VogelVrouw: haha
[0:27:27] iPassiive: i got chills right there
[0:27:27] Attackeight: @Kasszi_ OVERTHROW THE MODS
[0:27:31] Xarallon: of course Kappa
[0:27:32] muttpacket: i started on easy, now on normal. my next playthrough on hard!
[0:27:32] Ice1Berrgg: You got the scroll
[0:27:33] lynx235: then the game has no difficulty and no reward
[0:27:37] christiancreep1: I MADE IT!!!
[0:27:43] damnsecci: @Attackeight I CAN REBEL MYSELF AAA
[0:27:44] loading0110: kek I use frog and they're still easy
[0:27:46] vaaaarna: omg helloooo!!!!
[0:27:47] Ribery931: Why woul u not use a hammer ?
[0:27:52] baambopanda: how about something like “Practice Vaults” so people can practice for more skill and knowledge?
[0:27:56] Verrandath: Also if you are not great at the game you can feel the progress as you get better while you play on easier difficulties
[0:27:57] Ramzi65ok: i prefer my frog :)
[0:27:58] batt3ryac1d: Wings are too slow tbh OSFrog life
[0:28:01] Ramzi65ok: stepup is op
[0:28:02] Hip_Frame: You know to use trinkets because of your knowledge, which enhances your skill in the game
[0:28:04] slimepsychic: Having a disability is a great reason to change difficulty, and it isn't being "bad at it" it's just harder than what you'd expect if you weren't disabled.
[0:28:09] JashinFanatic: @iskall85 if we go with that rhetoric, you playing on normal would be like other people playing in easy or poc
[0:28:09] VogelVrouw: it will be harder if thats not how youre used to playing
[0:28:10] moreno175: I play with 0 trinkets
[0:28:11] stefono4: You really finesse the wings
[0:28:16] Smurfz87: experience
[0:28:18] MilaDog: !nomic
[0:28:18] Nightbot: i am chilling and have very little to no mic, voice needs resting :D
[0:28:20] Ramzi65ok: you're also complete negating your movement speed buffs with elytra @iskall85
[0:28:23] stefono4: Your wings skill is so high
[0:28:24] the_whtvr: hammer is awesome, but I didn’t like wings, prismatic feather is way more op for me
[0:28:26] TheUltimateRaider: No mic Stare
[0:28:26] StrangePanthers: It's preference I think
[0:28:29] Darkstar159: Why would someone complain about hammers? If they're so good, you can use it too!
[0:28:30] NaruhShousa: i love my hammer =3
[0:28:30] damnsecci: i love false
[0:28:36] pigeon_killer1: I love that Iskall’s tone is late night philosophy rn
[0:28:38] Attackeight: scav chest
[0:28:38] kaydog10305: !nomic
[0:28:39] thegurb: I second the practice vaults
[0:28:42] damnsecci: always so humble also joining in on iskall strem as well
[0:28:42] toasty_ryebread: back to living dungeon
[0:28:46] chager212: Yeah. No. That’s a part of the game. There are a ton of different trinkets that help with movement. USE THEM.
[0:28:52] oralekin: "ok now play without armor" i love false but this is a weird take
[0:28:53] romdow: so the argument is if i dont use the gear adn equipment that the game provides to do the hardest objective, thats the games fault?
[0:28:53] FreeZe1k: FreeZe1k subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 23 months, currently on a 21 month streak! Ello! Glad to see you streaming today. Can you tell me when the official servers will be resetting? I would love to play there. #nevereverleaving
[0:28:54] GhostlyMarrow49: not everyone has 2 eyes. plz can you do a run with one eye closed? @iskall85
[0:28:55] Ramzi65ok: I use the pickarang on vault stone
[0:28:55] TaliaTwist: did u just skip the orante village ? dont u need orane
[0:28:58] TAxels: anyone can guarantee a hammer, the wings are rng tho
[0:28:58] iPassiive: yeah
[0:28:58] breadandbutter07: I feel like the wings are more OP than the hammer
[0:29:02] Ribery931: Yep
[0:29:08] TheSilver_Kitsune: cant make a hammer if i dont have hammering jewels. Kappa
[0:29:08] BigD_Tiny420: BigD_Tiny420 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 60 months, currently on a 60 month streak! Hello sir.. 5 years!!!! And many, many more to come..
[0:29:18] Lizerdman87: yep. go do the thing that makes it easier
[0:29:20] seraphinx_iii: But then there's no variety in tool use with different players
[0:29:21] CoconutTiim: the hammer is an option for everybody if they don’t want to use it that’s their choice
[0:29:21] BlarZek34: Junk management is an important thing with hammers
[0:29:23] Tyler_Rose_94: yeah I think the issue is if the only way to have an easy scav is because you play the meta of hammer and wings??? then I feel like that goes against what you keep saying which is you don’t want there to be a meta?
[0:29:24] Tjidobo: Getting a wizard wand there :')
[0:29:25] karabahk: Hammer is one thing anyone can make a hammer.  Trinket drops however are rare and random.
[0:29:25] valkojam: You are providing options to solve problems and play different
[0:29:28] tonTeufel: you can play without a hammer, but you can't complain about difficulty when you spent ages mining ore
[0:29:31] Lashings: Should other tools get built in vein miner as an alt to hammers then. If it is clearly just better
[0:29:36] Kastumoem: Like Hammer just works out to being vein mine with automatic finesse
[0:29:37] shibubbles1417: That's like someone having difficulty with addition and handing them a calculator. The right tool for the job. Males sense.
[0:29:39] redstonedad: Not playing much modded myself I find hammers difficult to figure out
[0:29:42] Zinoba: false not being sarcastic for once? my brain is breaking
[0:29:42] RSBlunden: ehh that just means without certain items you cant do the content which i actually dont like
[0:29:43] ShelobsLair_: @valkojam Based comment
[0:29:45] MaximumLiberty: Some ppl don't like hammers
[0:29:46] Attackeight: scav check pls
[0:29:46] TheOnePercentGotMyMain: If im being a dev about it, is it intended that the hammer be a toll gate on progress and is that super clear to players ?
[0:29:47] melonhunt: yes, its same with chest breaker, as you might not use it, but it will be easier to vault with it
[0:29:49] Vlazmanian_Devil: A player who intentionally doesn't use a hammer, chest breaker, or trinkets is similar to asking someone to play hockey with no stick or puck. They are making it harder for themselves to do well.
[0:29:56] Treity: If your gear choices are making things more difficult for you and you dont like it, change your gear choices
[0:29:57] SivysPlays: Are you flying or is that a skill?
[0:30:00] Megaking202: oh, it is with mic after all?
[0:30:00] Garnail20: but you also don't want hammer to be the only meta, right?
[0:30:01] batt3ryac1d: Spicy vaults are fun. Nothing makes the blood rush like pounding down lemons till you're 1/2 hp and fighting for your damn life to get that last zombie arm.
[0:30:03] valkojam: Someone else might op a spell to keep mobs away as an alternative
[0:30:05] Meena4578: if someone finds the game too hard but doesn’t know how to utilize the game it’s normal.
[0:30:06] Skleny_11: Hallo, why no mic? would love to hear iskalls opinion on the game
[0:30:12] Ramzi65ok: i'd love to be able to see theese people who complain's armory stats
[0:30:14] red_mask333: if i find things difficult, just use different methods imo
[0:30:15] Ribery931: @vlazmanian_devil couldnt have said it better
[0:30:16] iPassiive: @Skleny_11 LUL
[0:30:17] kablaq: Isn't that just another part of figuring out the puzzle for your own character?
[0:30:20] Mjsfuzzycat: I think it would be better if there’s an intro to hammers in the quest line. without watching people play I’d have no idea how they work or why to use them
[0:30:21] damnsecci: @Skleny_11 well then up your sound he hasnt been quiet hahaha
[0:30:23] misfirelord: !nomic
[0:30:23] Nightbot: i am chilling and have very little to no mic, voice needs resting :D
[0:30:24] verqix: I would say playing with the wings gets me killed a lot more, so not sure if it is a way to represent a different part of the community to take them off. There's still a massive skill gap
[0:30:25] JulesInSpace: If you can't win with your build,  you need to change it,  that's the skill
[0:30:25] oralekin: !nomic
[0:30:30] CoconutTiim: at that point it’s a skill issue not a game issue
[0:30:34] loading0110: "better sword" because we all know no one is ever using an axe
[0:30:37] sagittarius_greenbow: skill issue
[0:30:39] smash7711: Skill issues.
[0:30:39] Linkazzatore: it's player's fault for not using their options
[0:30:40] astro_cipher: definitely a skill i think
[0:30:41] TheOnePercentGotMyMain: Does the game make it clear that hammers are expected to progress ?
[0:30:42] JashinFanatic: gear drops are also rng
[0:30:43] Seraphim_Mae: Genuine skill issue
[0:30:44] Migas5: Know what's better is a skill
[0:30:44] NaruhShousa: scav is hard but, easy is borring
[0:30:45] Tinokk85: Gearing choices is a skill issue.
[0:30:45] loading0110: skill yeah
[0:30:47] birtrim: its a knowledge issue
[0:30:47] H3r0games: but to do that that would build a meta
[0:30:48] Ramzi65ok: movement is a big thing in vault hunters and people are bad at it
[0:30:48] frostelisbd: def skill issue
[0:30:48] kot7k: a good game is not a game that's 100% compeltable for all players
[0:30:48] Knew_It_Owl: Knew_It_Owl subscribed at Tier 2. They've subscribed for 15 months! Just woke up and found out Iskall is streaming.. life is good, have a nice day!
[0:30:48] Sootydog47: I tried hammer, but didn't like it. It was less precise than I wanted in my build. But I do have a hammer for overworld
[0:30:49] douira: it's just user error
[0:30:50] quaka95: What is the difficulty you build the features around?
[0:30:51] Colebot17: Those things are part of the game, players should be expected to use them if they need to
[0:30:52] a_a_ron_wp: In a sense you're saying a hammer is the natural progression
[0:30:52] just_megnn: Knowledge and time
[0:30:53] NGw7_: Of course its a skill issue. Agree
[0:30:53] DatGuyIFK: Or is it that some playstyles are just stronger? idk btw.
[0:30:53] martynn32: It falls under a skill
[0:30:54] m0dzer0: not skill, but experience and knowledge
[0:30:55] Tomaeux: This whole problem is a skill issue
[0:30:56] SivysPlays: Skill issue. No matter how good your gear is, skill is always a crucial factor
[0:30:57] Roxas_Strife626: I feel as if it depends on the player's playstyle
[0:30:57] crackrjack05: in that situation, it’s on the player, not the game
[0:30:57] Naraka00: I agree with that because I noticed improvement when I improved my gear
[0:30:57] michallive1337: i think its 50/50
[0:30:58] batt3ryac1d: 100% skill issue the game really isn't THAT difficult.
[0:30:58] MrChicken1111: If you never crafted a hammer than you have the hammering jewels to do so
[0:30:58] PixleChris: i would also say Knowledge
[0:30:59] lauraannierose: if you’re playing a game with an ice area you could play without a fire weapon but it’s making your life harder. why not use a hammer if it makes the game easier?
[0:30:59] candidcrafter: There is a balance between them
[0:30:59] fortune85_: to be honest i have no idea i just love the game
[0:31:00] lpandamoniuml: yes its a skill/knowledge issue
[0:31:00] secondfifth: see it makes sense for scavs to be a skill/knowledge gate
[0:31:00] melonhunt: @iskall85 its same with chest breaker, as you might not use it, but it will be easier to vault with it
[0:31:01] thevoidknight430: some rng, but a skill/tme issue
[0:31:01] hossam2294: I think there should be multiple ways to beat the game
[0:31:01] untruthfully: yea its like saying in a battle royale game saying wow its so hard to get a win but using a pistol instead of the best setup
[0:31:02] gorsolotri: 30% of this game is learning gear
[0:31:02] TechJosh: the ability to learn the game is a skill
[0:31:02] ghostlymo: skill issue, they need to explore all benefits in game
[0:31:04] jmommers98: I feel like people are afraid of the hammer for some reason
[0:31:05] zichor: Well I take 3 to 4 mins to loot a room but I dont blame the game its skill issue
[0:31:05] g2gaming_rx: knowledge
[0:31:05] tonTeufel: if you don't want to use game mechanics designed to make your life easier, you can't complain about difficulty
[0:31:06] redstonedad: Is lack of knowledge lack of skill?
[0:31:07] TheRedBrain: it's definitely a skill to know what tools are available to you and how to use them
[0:31:07] Konkers: Konkers subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months! If the game has not helped the player understand that they need the gear, could be a game issue.
[0:31:08] sneakypete55: the player is not using the tools intended to make the game easier
[0:31:08] baambopanda: what if, there are practice faults for more skill and knowledge
[0:31:08] EldritchDigger: I thiink a lot of the problem is that people seem to take the statement of "lack of skiill" as an insult, not a challenge
[0:31:10] nanatsunotaizai000: I agree w knowledge
[0:31:10] matjea: hammers should be put forward more in the tools desciption
[0:31:12] muttpacket: my partner asks me why I constantly loot more than him. my ttk is lots shorter than his I think.
[0:31:12] Xarallon: "I dont have a skill issue, gold pick axe is viable, game is too hard"
[0:31:13] miraculousmultifan: my challenges either scav falls COMPLETELY under skill issue
[0:31:14] swiss_fighta: Ignoring or not using game mechanics that make a game easier is a skill or knowledge issue.
[0:31:14] Zinoba: it depends.. you still want to avoid meta gaming right?
[0:31:15] Svennonontwitch: Skill is how good you are using your knowledge.
[0:31:15] NGw7_: Ur stupid not wanting a hammer False, so annoying
[0:31:15] antegravity: Should you just give a weaker opponent more chess pieces, or have them understand the game better?
[0:31:16] lynx235: nether it’s just a lack of time unless there is a lack of knowledge
[0:31:18] Mjsfuzzycat: if hammers make things that easier then they should be introduced in the intro
[0:31:19] damnsecci: GGs
[0:31:19] xxxqaz124: I think too many folk are lazy nowadays and that tells in their gameplay. VH is near perfect for what it's aimed to be.
[0:31:23] VogelVrouw: why not use the tools at your availibility
[0:31:23] xXWrensWorldXx: knowledge issue in the sense of knowing how to build your gear
[0:31:24] esinadmoonshadow: Knowledge of skill
[0:31:24] cyberwolf139: Sorry ik its annoying,  i just joined , any update yet on update 13?
[0:31:25] Shoot_Blank3: I will always say Skill Issue..... difficulty is good, it'll push you to get good
[0:31:27] mozamel__: Thats gameplay issue I'd say
[0:31:27] k1_setae: not wanting a hammer is not optimizing for the task
[0:31:30] cershadow_: GGs
[0:31:32] Kasszi_: i return
[0:31:33] Ramzi65ok: I prefer using the flamarang on vault stone and vien mining
[0:31:33] ShelobsLair_: GG
[0:31:35] Meena4578: yeah, it simply is a knowledge issue. when i started, i didn’t how to utilize all the aspects of the game and it was really really tricky.
[0:31:38] forzawin: you need more skill without the hammer
[0:31:38] dcptcncrescendo: Gg
[0:31:40] argetlaam007: GG
[0:31:40] damnsecci: @Kasszi_ i broke the chat down
[0:31:42] damnsecci: sorry
[0:31:43] Wizirdd: Wizirdd subscribed with Prime. 
[0:31:45] tgrs126: It is not even about equipment, people who put less than 1000 hours into minecraft will stuck on blocks and stuff a lot more.
[0:31:46] Dragonshooot: Why you need hammer for scav?
[0:31:46] Xarallon: time to clear
[0:31:48] tracyw1978: Etho is very skilled and doesn't use a hammer and does well with scavs
[0:31:54] TheOnePercentGotMyMain: I mean the line is pretty clear right, Skill is the ability to elyra though the room tunnels, knowledge is things I have to be able to google
[0:31:54] antegravity: GG
[0:31:55] pepa1d: Hi, little out-of-context topic, but I have an idea for relics: Finished vault = 1 usage of relics in next vault, Failed vault = 1 cooldown on usage of relics in next vault. Make it a counter, that goes up with finished vaults and down with failed vaults.
[0:31:55] Kasszi_: @damnsecci what'd you do
[0:31:56] H3r0games: im with false tbh
[0:31:56] redstonedad: How does a hammer make it easier?
[0:31:56] Knew_It_Owl: Is the game gonna be harder if you don't have minecraft installed.. YES!
[0:31:56] jimi_dean: If the game has provided what is needed to complete, then that is the player opting in to a greater challenge by not using the tools at their disposal.
[0:32:01] ghostlymo: if a player wants to challenge themselves by not trying new tools thats their own faults
[0:32:02] damnsecci: @Kasszi_ fire
[0:32:04] Mjsfuzzycat: a book on the tools and jewels  would be nice in game
[0:32:04] Lucy4ever: Why live now I can't be here🥲
[0:32:04] BingusMcGuffin: you also have to concider play style
[0:32:07] Nightbot: @jaronnthechosen_arcetect -> What an interesting hypothesis. [stop spamming symbols] [warning]
[0:32:08] piso112: What with green doors ? When rework
[0:32:08] loading0110: would you ever consider being able to right click on a scav hand in with a pouch to hand in all the things you have at once?
[0:32:09] verqix: POIT, poi time
[0:32:12] DraamaQ: that is like saying that i think its annoying to use a shulker box in the vault, there is other options
[0:32:16] CeleiteStreams: Opting out of a hammer also means using levels in vein miner, leaving less for player strength.
[0:32:17] vibecisco70: iskal how would people who dont watch any vh content or what not how would they know that hammer for ores is goated
[0:32:18] momaggie1273: A hammer makes it easier to loot, but it comes with the tradeoff of junk items. But that can be mitigated with junk management
[0:32:19] oDtEoDoA: I feel like there should be other options to a hammer
[0:32:20] rhometheus: everything you just described is  the exact battle I have with professionals on a daily basis... I make tools / workflows for them... they refuse to use them and then complain that things are too hard

[0:32:20] TheOnePercentGotMyMain: Chess is 100% knowledge
[0:32:20] Verrandath: knowledge is skill; if you know haw to use a keyboard you have the skill to use it
[0:32:21] sneakypete55: it’s not knowing or using the right tools for the job
[0:32:22] Kasszi_: "in my chambers"
[0:32:23] NeptonX: To me, it's definitely skill issue
[0:32:25] JulesInSpace: Both
[0:32:27] jimi_dean: The wings trinket though, that's a chance drop, people might not have that for ages
[0:32:28] sgt_susman: knowledge = skill
[0:32:29] TechJosh: Chess is a game of memorization in 2024
[0:32:31] tyler193947: I used to struggle with scav hunts, especially ore based until I’ve started using a hammer. it’s knowledge
[0:32:33] Hyweed_: bigger bags when? 🤔
[0:32:33] fortune85_: damn this is going deep btw chess is a game of stratergy
[0:32:33] nanatsunotaizai000: Chess is definitely a good mix of both
[0:32:34] Brot90: chess is a lot about knowledge first
[0:32:37] benhutto2003: I find the game is all about play styles and optimisation like it’s all about making rooms vaults etc so it becomes faster and faster and more understanding
[0:32:38] MaraudingBacon: chess is a game of both knowledge and skill
[0:32:38] Knew_It_Owl: Chess is both knowledge and skill
[0:32:38] jaronnthechosen_arcetect: when is the new update ? ?
[0:32:38] piso112: iskEnergy
[0:32:38] symonsters: we need to instruct the players better about the possible knowledge out there We need a guide to what is possible
[0:32:40] Zinoba: this falls under the same thing of back when you were stupid to not take Nova. not a skill issue to not take it then IMO!
[0:32:41] Tyler_Rose_94: I personally don’t see hammers making it easier really. I think the chest types that show up and whether you get ore rooms impact it more xD but you’d say that’s me having a skill or knowledge issue
[0:32:42] TAxels: the more you know the more opportunities you have for skill
[0:32:43] cyberwolf139: Hi , sorry ik its annoying to hear it allot , i just joined , any update for update 13? Im really exited
[0:32:44] charlesjhnfrtz: chess is all pattern recognition
[0:32:44] HazzaBazza9: HazzaBazza9 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 21 months, currently on a 21 month streak! your a great dude. thanks for everything #nevereverleaving
[0:32:46] ShelobsLair_: pawns
[0:32:49] TheOnePercentGotMyMain: The best chess players know the most chess positions and the winning moves to make from there
[0:32:50] fortune85_: pawns
[0:32:53] smash7711: The game has no 1 one to he played so you can make objective difficulty different.  There is no right way to build your abilities and they help you in the vaults as much as tools.
[0:32:54] Zach010: I think the hammer and wings is more of a meta thing then if it's the only/best wayto complete a scav
[0:32:55] loading0110: more knowledge and practice
[0:32:55] BingusMcGuffin: isnt skill just effective aplication of knowledge
[0:32:55] rad_ju: knowledge is part of skill
[0:32:56] LilikoiLucy: hi hi
[0:32:59] jazzmartiiin: so irrelevant but what does poi stand for lol. I always thought it was pui for some reason
[0:33:02] Tntaap1: chess used to be a game of skill now it is a game of pattern recognition + remembering since chess computer era
[0:33:03] vibecisco70: hammer is also best for coins
[0:33:04] Sootydog47: I tried a hammer in vaults, but didn't like it. It was less precise than I wanted in my build. But I do have a hammer for overworld
[0:33:05] candidcrafter: Nope .. knowledge very important in chess .. top tier players remember a lot of chess position from experience
[0:33:07] Ramzi65ok: Momvement is also sevearly underestimated as a minecraft mechanic, people arn't good at it i've been noticing
[0:33:10] phillykd11: yay!!! Evening Iskall Stream! Hi Dylan and Iskall
[0:33:10] VogelVrouw: @jazzmartiiin point of interest
[0:33:10] ahmadhafez21: I'm sorry but what is wrong with her?
[0:33:13] a_a_ron_wp: You're saying a hammer is a required item to be better.
[0:33:13] lordsfave: i disagree
[0:33:14] alex_needs_coffee: Why Hammer is so good? Is it because durability and skill points on (vein-miner) saving?
[0:33:16] jarivd03: I don't know how that is toxic
[0:33:24] BigBlueHawk87: bring the hammer if no ore than don’t use hammer
[0:33:27] lordsfave: hammer allows to open up vault
[0:33:28] strandberggg: she's fluent in yappanese
[0:33:30] kxnrkeane: Could also say that decision making is a skill
[0:33:31] CoconutTiim: I think the phrase skill issue is being taken the wrong way
[0:33:33] kibaz_x: Not saying hammer is skill, just that it makes it faster, then easier
[0:33:35] StrangePanthers: I always thought ien miner and hammer were more equal
[0:33:35] sneakypete55: use the right tool for the job at hand
[0:33:36] forzawin: hammer isn't skill, it's a substitue for it
[0:33:39] jarivd03: Knowledge / better gear will compensate for skill
[0:33:41] NGw7_: I hate False as a person. I hate these kind of persons
[0:33:43] samueltreehouse: !nomic
[0:33:43] VogelVrouw: chat.... dont get rude about false
[0:33:44] damnsecci: ofc iskall on the reddit lol
[0:33:45] nanatsunotaizai000: That's fair but I mean the difficulty of scaav does decrease with a hammer considering the rng of getting a ore scaav otem
[0:33:47] Nicola_002: a hammer is a must in vh not having a hammer should be a crime
[0:33:49] Xarallon: there might be other ways that clear ores fast enough, that's' not a hammer
[0:33:51] Chromal_Assassin: I think choosing not to use a hammer is personal, but if a newer player could have a hammer but doesnt't know, it's more skill and knowledge of the game
[0:33:51] ValueTown: hammers are in the game and players are expected to use them to mine ores faster? i don't see the issue
[0:33:51] iPassiive: @nichtg chill
[0:33:51] Tyler_Rose_94: you’re saying that if the player doesn’t have a hammer that’s a skill issue. it’s not. it’s not even the RIGHT tool for the job.
[0:33:52] Nightbot: i am chilling and have very little to no mic, voice needs resting :D
[0:33:53] TheOnePercentGotMyMain: I think Iskall has misrepresented his thoughts LUL Knowing that a hammer makes it easier is a knowledge check its not a skill, MC combat is a skill, flying is a skill etc
[0:33:54] Verrandath: tools are needed sometimes and not other times it is being prepared
[0:33:55] tre_2018: Iskall talking about this stuff whilst tired at 11pm is dicing with danger?
[0:33:55] Zach010: Hey mods can we get rid of the people hating in False, like what the heck!
[0:33:57] Kasszi_: @damnsecci when isn't he
[0:33:58] samsam21amb: hammer gives way to much junk items
[0:33:59] basteyos: If anything, you have more skill if you complete the objective without a hammer
[0:34:01] rytional: oh did gumpers get under your skin again? lol
[0:34:01] Darkwytchcraft: efficiency comes with time and making tools etc
[0:34:08] damnsecci: @Kasszi_ only every toilet break i assume
[0:34:08] Tyler_Rose_94: I think False is totally right.
[0:34:08] kibaz_x: It's like trap disarm, if you have 100% trap disarm it's going to be way easier
[0:34:08] batt3ryac1d: Has iskall turned off the 7tv emotes or is my chat brokey?
[0:34:13] k1_setae: hammer is optimising. its increasing efficiency. its like comparing mining enhachement in vanilla. if your task is to mine efficiency speeds you up
[0:34:13] fortune85_: @damnsecci redditskall
[0:34:13] Pwnater267: understanding the progression, to include advancing equipment, to allow for a hammer and the proper inventory management towards completing any goal is indicative of game knowledge and execution of such is skill
[0:34:15] lenjenben: it’s not skill it’s strategy
[0:34:15] Ramzi65ok: There are other utilities to mine effectively such as the pickarang
[0:34:19] BingusMcGuffin: but what if that is true for you and not for stress
[0:34:21] thinkjaguar: I don’t think it’s skill, I think it makes it easier but not technically a skill
[0:34:24] Darkwytchcraft: and learning the game takes a bit of time as well
[0:34:29] RSBlunden: but should you have to be as efficient as possible to complete it?
[0:34:29] untruthfully: to minimize the rng as much as possible
[0:34:33] pastule: Why does he use a different tool to break wooden chests?
[0:34:35] Garnail20: @batt3ryac1d still working for me BASED
[0:34:37] BigPoppaHouse: The choice to use a hammer is the player's choice. If a player wants to not use a hammer, that's on them. BUT, a hammer can make a big difference in completion!
[0:34:37] grossjr20: if you choose to play the game without the best tools then it is a poor decision, not a skill issue.
[0:34:37] saaaitam: Look at Etho for an example, he doesn't use hunter nor hammer to be able to complete and enjoy scav
[0:34:37] Shoot_Blank3: Skill issue = means push harder and learn more
[0:34:38] Kasszi_: hammers make it so quick doing an ore room
[0:34:40] Solly8700: is that a new pedestal?
[0:34:42] Ramzi65ok: @untruthfully i mean thats what people do in speedruns and pokemon nuzlocks
[0:34:43] emi191101: emi191101 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 17 months! Finally i bought a computer so i can play VH iskHeart iskHeart iskHeart
[0:34:43] Halo_Xmas: Its the difference between a drill and a screwdriver some are better in situations but most of the time the drill is better
[0:34:45] Kasszi_: much faster than anything else
[0:34:46] MrChicken1111: Junk items can be dealt with junk identifier, also another knowledge thing
[0:34:46] Darkwytchcraft: I still can't figure out how to get a hammer rather than a pick  or whatever, I'm still learning
[0:34:50] TheOnePercentGotMyMain: Iskall needs to standardize his use of the word skill LUL
[0:34:52] BingusMcGuffin: playstyle
[0:34:53] thinkjaguar: I think it can raise a skill ceiling but doesn’t mean a non hammer user can’t be better then a hammer user
[0:34:56] batt3ryac1d: @Garnail20 Dang I wonder how I fix it
[0:34:56] el3l_: I guess the question is, should multiple play styles be viable? Sometimes things are just not meta, but it feels like things are balanced so that only one style is viable
[0:34:57] Zach010: I think hammers and wings are too meta then
[0:34:57] AtomizedCake: Not using the tools that are availble to you is just handicapping yourself and complaining about the fact that you are handicapping yourself is weird.
[0:34:58] toasty_ryebread: idk if it’s so much as skill as much as it is a boost in efficiency
[0:34:59] tymac300: tymac300 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 17 months! iskHeart
[0:34:59] goofyme: @lenjenben good one
[0:34:59] Darkwytchcraft: mods can be difficult to Learn
[0:35:02] JustAlecz: Iskall is right
[0:35:02] fortune85_: so the debate is over using a hammer or not using a hammer in scavs ?
[0:35:02] TAxels: it sounds like META vs casual perspectives
[0:35:03] fakegermano: but they are
[0:35:05] Ribery931: @pastule to save dura on his chestbreaker
[0:35:06] Tjidobo: False's biggest downfall is her negativity and complaining that stuff is bad or broken and it's not her fault, it's the game's fault
[0:35:06] michallive1337: its basically gatekeeping the game like to get good u need a hammer.. no other options i think thats the problem, like i want to not use a hammer i want to use something else
[0:35:08] enne0404: Just a combination
[0:35:09] JashinFanatic: it doesn't have to be knowledge or skill, it's a playstyle choice
[0:35:11] chager212: Unfortunately it’s an objective evaluation. Iskall clears an ore room poi faster than False clears one. By an order of magnitude
[0:35:11] zerogiven: Lies! It says no mic. Kappa
[0:35:12] Z0eff: Dangit I haven't watched yesterdays VOD yet D:
[0:35:13] charlesjhnfrtz: that's just being stubborn for no reason
[0:35:14] smash7711: Using a hammer makes you set up your pouches differently.  So it's a skill altering tool. This is also still an opinion.  Have no hammer and learn more vain miner.
[0:35:14] lauraannierose: choosing not to use a hammer knowing its not as efficient at mining ore is fine if they know they’re not as efficient as they can be
[0:35:16] Itz_Dragon_Yo: Itz_Dragon_Yo subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months! 
[0:35:17] Megaking202: what if I don't want to get my inventory full of random items
[0:35:18] fakegermano: if you can google a meta, its not fun
[0:35:20] Plaeymaker: its knowing that hammer is best in slot for ores
[0:35:21] PixleChris: if the goal is to remove screws from a piece of wood and you chose to use a hammer instead of a screwdriver that's on you.
[0:35:22] damnsecci: well its memory skill as well
[0:35:25] Hyweed_: and skill to execute it
[0:35:27] untruthfully: @untruthfully exactly its part of skill knowing to minimize rng and to play optmally if the goal is to complete all scavs
[0:35:27] JustAlecz: it’s knowledgeable AND skill to know if you want something done quick, especially in scav, use a hammer
[0:35:28] lenjenben: strategy
[0:35:28] Tyler_Rose_94: just because you know what works together doesn’t mean you can use it… that’s the difference between knowledge and skill here
[0:35:29] JashinFanatic: same as choosing a build or another. If you say that there is no meta, hammer shouldn't be meta
[0:35:30] angelfoxruby: @tjidobo no need to be negative
[0:35:33] dyniss_: If you know hammer is so scalable and so helpful in scavs why not make one, you can scale it with time and it helps. That's knowledge, once you know that, it's your option if you choose not do so, it's not that ur bad, it's that ur decision making is bad.
[0:35:34] zearam123: would you not say that knowlage is a skill?
[0:35:34] cyberwolf139: Hi iskall, off topic here , ik its annoying to hear people ask, but any update on up13? Im really exited for the update😂
[0:35:35] Mitozqli: But is it a choice if choosing not to use a hammer makes you not succeed or just makes it much more difficult?
[0:35:37] TheOnePercentGotMyMain: No thats not the same thing at all, the Skill in a POE speed run is managing your resources efficiently and risk managment, the build is something you pick at the start
[0:35:39] chager212: @pixlechris exactly
[0:35:39] birtrim: its like trying to eat soup with a fork, its just not the right tool
[0:35:40] StrangePanthers: Should bien miner be better then?
[0:35:44] comanche22: You are handicapping yourself by not using the tools available to you
[0:35:45] nanatsunotaizai000: Sleepy-skall ahha
[0:35:45] dcptcncrescendo: So don't use a hammer
[0:35:45] lordsfave: but you can be good without
[0:35:48] JustAlecz: then use vein miner?
[0:35:48] a_a_ron_wp: Correct, it's not skill, it's knowledge when you say that way.  I think towards end game, what you're creating is a situation where deleting everything in the vault is the most efficient path to playing the game.
[0:35:49] jmommers98: You don't need a hammer to play this game what
[0:35:49] asimithehero: Wow, iskall is so loud i can here him even without a mic D:
[0:35:53] kot7k: what is the "Greed" Stat what he opens his character thingy?
[0:35:55] tre_2018: I don't use a hammer but I do okay...
[0:35:56] Zach010: Wings and hammer is a little too meta then maybe
[0:35:56] Ribery931: Nah u can use a pick and vein mine
[0:35:57] fursten001: hallo what with the no mic?
[0:35:58] rachs224: Using a hammer iz only efficient if you can handle the inventory filling with junk
[0:35:59] damnsecci: @asimithehero lmao
[0:35:59] Marigglypuff: that's ridiculous. You arent gatekeeping anything
[0:36:02] hamisharms: Personally I dont use a hammer and im ok with not using one
[0:36:03] loading0110: you dont really need a hammer :/ just vein mine if you dont want a hammer
[0:36:04] BigPoppaHouse: If you don't want to use a hammer, get a fast pick and high vein-miner.
[0:36:04] pepa1d: Look how good is Etho and he does not use hammers
[0:36:04] Mjsfuzzycat: I think we just need the knowledge in the game rather than by watching or reaching online
[0:36:05] treeheadedwraith: no mic!
[0:36:05] baambopanda: but why wouldn’t you wanr to use a hammer?
[0:36:07] Hyweed_: etho doesn't even use hammer o.O what's even that now? wth
[0:36:07] romdow: ts player choice to use it or not, that is the opposite of gatekeeping
[0:36:07] secondfifth: hammer isn't needed if you're doing what i do for late game artifacts, which is running guardian vaults
[0:36:08] Nicola_002: some ppl are just dumb, you cant help it
[0:36:08] OrangyLive: It's like saying you don
[0:36:08] tgrs126: Good gear is knowledge, navigating the vaults efficiently is skill IMO
[0:36:09] enne0404: Gatekeeping??? Ridicolous
[0:36:09] Meena4578: i think, the skill is in the execution. the knowledge is what allows you to be more skilled
[0:36:10] jarivd03: You are also gatekeeping gear :/
[0:36:11] sil3nt_m3ow: that's like saying I want to use a shovel to mine obsidian
[0:36:14] lenjenben: but the room is build for a hammer! you wouldn’t loot a living chest without living affinity
[0:36:14] oneupguy: i think hes saying that with the right tools and filter that scavs are manageable
[0:36:14] basteyos: Meh, depends how the person plays innit
[0:36:15] iPassiive: oh man this is gettin real
[0:36:16] Vlazmanian_Devil: You can do it with maxed vein miner panel, it won't be perfect but it's an option
[0:36:16] Kasszi_: Etho, False and others don't use a hammer and they are perfectly fine at playing and doing scavs, that's not gatekeeping..
[0:36:17] waysidescroll: The other option is using vein miner which is a good option
[0:36:17] ShadeyNGL: the *no mic* really threw me off
[0:36:18] sophistic_ated: Yeah iskall where are our vault explosives?! >=[
[0:36:19] Croseven: Etho doesnt use hammer and is a beast at vault hunters
[0:36:23] valkojam: Could the efficiency be gained in another way?
[0:36:23] spicytoecheese: In vanilla you need a pickaxe for mine is that gatekeeping?
[0:36:24] Ramzi65ok: hydrop void on the hammer is also crazy
[0:36:25] 0of1est: @hyweed_ he's just simply goated
[0:36:28] miraculousmultifan: i only find scavs hard bc im not fast enough yet. complete skill issue from me
[0:36:28] jmommers98: forced
[0:36:28] Lizerdman87: you can use whatever you want. but if your method isn’t as good, it’s gonna make it more difficult. simple concept
[0:36:29] zolek06: Will there be new quests in update 13?
[0:36:30] f0uad01: If it's gatekeeping the game then etho shouldn't be that good and efficient in the game
[0:36:32] jimi_dean: False has a very good point though, in that if your scav objectives aren't related to mining a lot of blocks, then the hammer is unnecessary and vein miner would be perfectly acceptable
[0:36:34] pepa1d: Etho is excelent example
[0:36:38] LilJagty: iskall is 100% right. knowing the best combinations of gear to win an objective is an important factor
[0:36:39] antegravity: Not going to get a screw in with a hammer, not gonna mine wood with a pickaxe
[0:36:40] takowszem1: !nomic
[0:36:40] Nightbot: i am chilling and have very little to no mic, voice needs resting :D
[0:36:40] the_weerdo: With gear, you can look at ***
[0:36:41] zerogiven: Trying to make everything equally effective is a fool's errand. Players will always min/max.
[0:36:41] vibecisco70: u can play the game perfectly fine without a hammer like didnt H not ever use a hammer for ores
[0:36:42] symonsters: the knowledge isn't made accessible, we need something where features and options and possibilities are explained
[0:36:42] argetlaam007: ETHO does not use hammer and still does great with Scavs
[0:36:43] ohmaenbro: hi
[0:36:43] ShadeyNGL: !nomic
[0:36:46] Z0eff: @Croseven I genuinely find that very interesting, and still dont quite understand haha
[0:36:47] MrChicken1111: Chest breaker is just as knowledge based as making a hammer. Like it's important to have both
[0:36:47] zanydruid_93: Would it be considered introducing a new meta?
[0:36:47] Sea_Jay27: Well, hammers aren't needed to play the game. If you have top skill vein miner unspeced and a super fast tool with high dura then a hammer isnt really needed
[0:36:48] Wat3rMelown: i mean considering there is a skill which allows for more block breaking, you technically do have another option
[0:36:48] lauraannierose: saying that you should use a fire weapon on an ice boss isn’t gatekeeping
[0:36:49] Hyweed_: @0of1est I mean yeah, but not about that, saying gatekeeping the game is just trolling
[0:36:52] cptxmaster: it is just part of game.  it is up to you if you want to use it or not
[0:36:52] zinou2019: a pick in minecraft is gate keeping the caves in vanilla Minecraft
[0:36:55] kunfudragon: I love vault hunter
[0:36:56] Darkwytchcraft: you know you literally are talking about learning how to make things as well as using them.  For some people this stuff takes TIME and I do have difficulty figuring out how to use the mods.
[0:36:57] loading0110: hydrovoid is FAR too rare
[0:36:58] redstonedad: How's Wu feeling?
[0:37:00] BigPoppaHouse: The issues I have are because I don't know enough about the vault design, as in where dungeons are likely to be, or where POIs are likely to be.
[0:37:00] RifleQueen1: Nah, who cares? Pros for hammer - fast. Cons for hammer - junk. There, if you like it use it. Why all the hate??
[0:37:03] infinite083: Hello
[0:37:09] waysidescroll: Guys the hammer is an example
[0:37:09] grossjr20: The best tool for the job. hammer time!
[0:37:09] Ramzi65ok: vien minner is less durability effecient
[0:37:10] seraphinx_iii: I think it's more how much of a handicap it is. If not that much then should still be okay then you can use other tools. All about balancing the negative with what you gain without a hammer
[0:37:11] thevoidknight430: @Croseven I think thats proof as how a hammer can improve your runs, but you don't need a hammer to be good
[0:37:13] mrsupersmore: haven’t you said before that you don’t like it when there is something that is objectively the best way to do something?
[0:37:15] waysidescroll: Its not the only tool but its a good tool
[0:37:16] untruthfully: @jimi_dean even so the point is to minimize rng so if you do get ores it would be the most efficient way of doing it
[0:37:18] el3l_: maybe the tension is, it feels like you see scav as only for full meta players, and it would be nice if its just a fun objective that everyone wants to play
[0:37:19] MaraudingBacon: Something I dont understnad is why people ALWAYS wont other optoins? hammers are great and a nice addition to the game. why must you have ANOTHER one as well for sake of it
[0:37:20] soupisthegood: iskPumpkin
[0:37:20] vibecisco70: i hate hydro void tbh
[0:37:20] moreno175: hydrovoid is bad atleast for me on a chest breaker
[0:37:22] lofi_tofuu: can you hydrovoid void liquid?
[0:37:22] zolek06: will update 13 include more quests?
[0:37:23] the_whtvr: Well, doing a mine room without a hammer might be not the best use of someone’s time :p
[0:37:23] Naraka00: its an advantage
[0:37:24] Verrandath: math
[0:37:25] bhavyajain05_: i mean since you can have multiple ways to play the game. all you have to do is find your way to play the game of example iskall plays better with hammers
[0:37:27] lordsfave: it’s not a gate, it’s a min max thing
[0:37:28] Nightbot: www.youtube.com/iskall85 | www.twitter.com/iskall85 | https://youtube.com/@vodskall85
[0:37:28] Darkwytchcraft: Mostly I'm frustrated because it's hard to figure out what a person's intent is from what they type in. I can get your intent because you're talking to me.
[0:37:28] Tinokk85: Hammer allows you to mine more types of blocks at once. Hammer > Vein Miner for scavs.
[0:37:29] OrangyLive: saying a hammer is gatekeeping is like saying axes are gatekeeping minecrafts because you don't want to cut down trees with an axe
[0:37:29] lynx235: you can not use a hammer and it will be slightly harder but a hammer will help but it is also preference of which you prefer to use
[0:37:29] applesaregreen0: !nomic
[0:37:29] microwavebruhh0: it’s all about strategy
[0:37:31] Nightbot: i am chilling and have very little to no mic, voice needs resting :D
[0:37:31] Zinoba: I feel like at some point you gotta stop wanting options of options. it's also AN OPTION to not use any tools at all and just UI loot, but nobody is even discussing how tools in general are meta and OP
[0:37:31] isonia0: is it to convince etho to use hammer ?
[0:37:33] Tyler_Rose_94: I just feel like the focus is on hammer and I don’t understand why. because at the end of the day the scav object is what will determine the difficulty of it, if you get all the chests or a high amount of items needed but you don’t find the right chests - that’s the rng element of it
[0:37:38] babiedino23: Its like having an objective to mine 100 stone and then using a shovel. Like the shovel is doable but not efficient
[0:37:38] soulstealer0902: Its a main part of your puzzel so its good for you
[0:37:39] Tjidobo: Mining ores take more time without a hammer, because you have to target them individually
[0:37:39] SebastiaanO: hallo
[0:37:39] Megaking202: he is saying that is you don't love the hammer, since you don't have any other way to mine ores faster, you have to paly the game in a way you don't like
[0:37:40] Darkstar159: Remember we're talking about an objective which is recognised as the hardest objective, and gives the highest rewards accordingly
[0:37:40] rytional: same as if you have a magnet, or a chest breaker or anything else. it all helps
[0:37:42] kibaz_x: It's all about speed,
[0:37:42] cyberwolf139: Love the update 13 btw , haven't played it yet , waiting for curse but i love the additions
[0:37:43] JRAT24: how is that any different than vanilla tools being better at mining certain block.  if you choose not to use the most efficient tool that’s a knowledge difference or a choice.
[0:37:45] irynhawk: if you are successful in what you do, there is nothing wrong with what your method is.
[0:37:46] DanimalsBetch: I for one will take this advice, as I am currently slow at breaking up ore POIs. Does it keep me from completing the scav?? maybe....maybe not. But why NOT make a hammer just to see if it helps me?
[0:37:47] Ice1Berrgg: A lot of your game is opt in / out look at wands and fireball builds the TTCPOI is lower because the "effort" is lower to kill imo
[0:37:48] damnsecci: you have a higher efficiency breaking blocks and chests, which makes the chances of you getting all the stuff needed, makes sense right
[0:37:49] bestbla: you can make hammer but what about wings what if u don't get any mobility trinket early on as u are lvl 84 and still have some trinkets unlocked
[0:37:50] baambopanda: I don’t see why you wouldnr want to use a hammer
[0:37:51] loading0110: make sure to claim the bounty btw
[0:37:54] zinou2019: min max is pog
[0:37:58] HGnep: but play styles can differ per person. For you a hammer is most efficient, but it doesn’t have to be for everyone. If you’re used to a hammer, of course you’re slower without
[0:38:00] enne0404: not a bad thing though
[0:38:01] Ramzi65ok: maximizing rng rolls
[0:38:03] superethan_1875: Yo yo yo
[0:38:03] zolek06: Will you add more quests to update 13?
[0:38:04] Plaeymaker: @iskall85 hammers should get a durability nerf to make it more fair with vein mining?
[0:38:04] stephaniebutton23: has false always been such a snippy person? i stopped watching her stuff years ago but dont remember this attitude
[0:38:05] BigD_Tiny420: Im going to lose my mind if i have to hear any more of these nonsensical conversations.. The options are there, pick one and play the game.. People need to understand they cant have everything they want..
[0:38:10] pst0808: The goal of any dungeon crawler is literally min maxing everything
[0:38:11] phantomvault: Hi skall
[0:38:11] lordsfave: if you’re doing in 100 days you would need to I think
[0:38:12] genmonoxide: 1 raiders from genmonoxide have joined! 
[0:38:14] HazzaBazza9: this is the most mic’ed no mic stream I’m ever seen
[0:38:18] LilJagty: Min maxing gives you a better chance, who said you NEED it to win 🤦‍♂️
[0:38:19] soulstealer0902: Isnt that what you work up to false?
[0:38:19] lenjenben: why has no one said strategy yet
[0:38:20] Skywalker8510: I guess you could add a speciation in vein miner that allows it to vein mine ores along with the stone that would give a second option to hammers. I think the current problem people have with it is that there is t any other option for something like that
[0:38:22] zinou2019: you should not finish every scave
[0:38:22] damnsecci: @stephaniebutton23 chat doesnt always show a 'tone' of someone :)
[0:38:26] TechJosh: is it a matter of conveying knowledge of how to make up for not being an Etho sweaty boi?
[0:38:26] zerogiven: There is always going to be a "most effective". Doesn't mean you can't enjoy vaults without min/max'ing.
[0:38:27] Darkest9469: man’s miced 🤣
[0:38:28] Ramzi65ok: in optimal play you should try to
[0:38:30] EldritchDigger: No False, you shouldn't have to miin-max the game to compllete. But, you will finish it faster if you do.
[0:38:32] Verrandath: min max = faster not only
[0:38:34] Vlazmanian_Devil: You should have to min-max to complete 100% of scavs and vaults in general. IT IS OKAY TO ESCAPE VAULTS.
[0:38:36] Darkest9469: also hi Iskall miss u dude
[0:38:39] romdow: yes, you should have to min-max to at least some degree to complete the harder pbjective - go in to a scav in iton armor if you dont agree
[0:38:42] Cychadopi: You can use the veinminer void specialization and not need a junk identifier for instance, you have multiple ways to achieve the same goal
[0:38:43] jmommers98: Remember that it is intended to sometimes not complete
[0:38:45] kibaz_x: Hammer makes it faster, chest breakers make it faster, 100% trap disarm make it faster, better gear makes it faster, then you have more chances to complete
[0:38:48] TheRedBrain: min-maxing may not be necessary for game completion but it reduces rng it makes the game completion easier
[0:38:48] goofyme: Play as you want, there are so many options
[0:38:49] stephaniebutton23: @damnsecci even in voice chats for runs shes joined recently, her playfulness sounds fake half the time
[0:38:51] Colebot17: since scavenger is the hardest objective, you should have to do a little bit of min maxing if you want to complete as often as you do on other objectives
[0:38:52] Darkwytchcraft: Not everyone is saying it's mandatory to have it their way.
[0:38:53] MaximumLiberty: My bounty says otherwise
[0:38:53] whocares_15: I minmaxed for attack damage, but now my whole build is so focused on that, that I cannot run without a gearpiece 20 levels lower than my current level because of bad rng rolls on gear. sadge
[0:38:54] lpandamoniuml: hammer simply allows you to move through pois and rooms faster regardless and scavs have a higher chance to complete the faster you can move
[0:38:56] dyniss_: Are scav items scaled with armour prefixes etc? If so isn't it all Abt being wise enough to know how to create your armor so that makes ur playthru easier
[0:38:56] waysidescroll: @Vlazmanian_Devil This is 100% right
[0:38:57] Megaking202: nah false, I get it
[0:38:58] cyberwolf139: What is min-maxing?
[0:38:59] Zach010: I think the hammer and wings might be too meta then
[0:38:59] Sicketjr: I’m so confused what all this fuss is about haha
[0:39:01] angelfoxruby: Chat calm down, don't be negative
[0:39:01] Ramzi65ok: no we like hearing from someone who's commited to the game at this level
[0:39:02] Halo_Xmas: I think its down to the fact that failure is ok
[0:39:04] zolek06: Update 13 gonna have more quests?
[0:39:06] NGw7_: The only one who is mean is her
[0:39:10] Ice1Berrgg: False doesnt bite guys
[0:39:10] loading0110: I think we just dont understand her point lol
[0:39:10] superethan_1875: Aggressiveness
[0:39:12] JashinFanatic: there's a LOT of mean in chat
[0:39:13] Sveta08: You good
[0:39:14] angelfoxruby: There are a few peeps being negative
[0:39:16] stephaniebutton23: @nichtg amen
[0:39:18] MaraudingBacon: I actually agree with false on most things
[0:39:19] Buggyhoser: false is great buggyh1Heart
[0:39:20] EldritchDigger: I didn't mean iit mean, False. Sorry
[0:39:21] VogelVrouw: there have been some jerks yes...
[0:39:21] charlesjhnfrtz: min max is for geeks and for people who take time in order to feel like gods inside vaults
[0:39:22] kot7k: we need a !false as we have a !stress
[0:39:23] itsaspacestation: itsaspacestation subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 47 months! 
[0:39:23] seraphinx_iii: In scav, it was a knowledge issue. I didn't know what mob to get the black mob essence from. I only know about assassin types from watching streams
[0:39:23] tymac300: having played up to level 100 a couple times with multiple different playstyles, scavs are by far my favorite objective in all cases. The RNG feels great and the feeling of completing a scav never gets old
[0:39:24] kot7k: !stress
[0:39:24] Nightbot: Stress has been hugged 17961 times! Gotta luv ‘er!, ya monsta!
[0:39:25] cazz9444: cazz9444 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 3 months! 
[0:39:26] Zach010: No the chat was being really rude about false
[0:39:27] enne0404: Great shout
[0:39:27] TheOnePercentGotMyMain: hasL False
[0:39:29] Tyler_Rose_94: false is just trying to explain that Iskall is only looking at scavs from ONE play style. I think you should be able to complete scavs with various play styles and skill levels. part of this can be fixed by lowering vault difficulty but still doesn’t scale the difficulty of the scav objective itself
[0:39:30] kot7k: !false
[0:39:30] zerogiven: Discussing differences of opinion can get so toxic.
[0:39:30] LillyDaemon: LillyDaemon subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months! 
[0:39:30] Ramzi65ok: we changed the wording from "bailed" to "survived" for that reason
[0:39:31] PremieressS: @JashinFanatic agreed alot of nasty comments towards false for no good reason at all
[0:39:31] soulstealer0902: Its nice to see other views false
[0:39:32] Svennonontwitch: False is the best.
[0:39:32] Darkest9469: hi false. love u girl ur great to watch. very much enjoyable
[0:39:33] verqix: To min max the game put it on easiest, get the loot multiplier and install an xray mob to scan for poi's and another map mod, way more efficient!
[0:39:33] SebastiaanO: the beauty of VH is that you can play it however you want, there's no right or wrong.
[0:39:34] clairebearstare: false is the best <3
[0:39:34] grossjr20: hearts for false iskHeart iskHeart iskHeart iskHeart iskHeart
[0:39:36] Cychadopi: !stress
[0:39:36] Lutzio: NightSkall!!
[0:39:36] Kastumoem: If you want 100% completion I absolutely recommend elixir
[0:39:37] Kasszi_: Dylan we don't be rude to False.
[0:39:39] Ramzi65ok: I remember when it said bailed
[0:39:39] alex_needs_coffee: <3 <3 <3
[0:39:41] Zinoba: iskHeart
[0:39:42] zichor: Iskall u cant say it but I can people need to get better at the game
[0:39:43] mattertec: I think that the feeling might be that people FEEL like the scavs are balanced around a min-max strategy and they wish that non min-maxing would have a higher completion rate
[0:39:44] melonhunt: !stress for !false iskHeart
[0:39:45] zolek06: Wil update 13 bring new quests ?
[0:39:47] damnsecci: I love how dedicated False is btw - love that she is online always when iskall is streaming
[0:39:48] rad_ju: have you thought about changing the xp curve? I think xp is slow at 90+, but fine at low lvls
[0:39:48] sabrina1202r: don't see the negative false we are also here
[0:39:50] damnsecci: dedication!
[0:39:51] Darkest9469: everyone put hearts in chat for false
[0:39:55] Darkest9469: iskHeart iskHeart iskHeart iskHeart
[0:39:55] basteyos: We have better manners than that Dylans...
[0:39:55] LilJagty: why can’t people accept that a harder objective is fine?
[0:39:57] Buggyhoser: buggyh1Heart buggyh1Heart buggyh1Heart
[0:39:59] thevixen38: @nichtg having a different opinion doesent make someone mean. sorry if you were always surrounded by yes men...
[0:40:01] Kasszi_: Her tone may not come across correctly to you, but they are friends and she knows how to talk to Iskall.
[0:40:01] jommehs: highwi10Kirbyheart highwi10Kirbyheart highwi10Kirbyheart
[0:40:03] Verrandath: there is no wrong way to play, so it is a great game
[0:40:04] Hyweed_: for now
[0:40:04] snowyowl369: <3 <3 <3
[0:40:05] pinner1985: Isn't the game designed for whatever play style u choose
[0:40:06] damnsecci: listen to the man without mic!
[0:40:06] MottlyMC: exactly hence why etho had his difficulty uped
[0:40:07] iisquirrel888: iskHeart iskHeart iskHeart iskHeart iskHeart
[0:40:08] MaraudingBacon: @mattertec honestly why though. some thinkgs should just be harder
[0:40:08] cyberwolf139: Wait idk what min-maxing means?
[0:40:08] muppification: whos chat, i only know dylan
[0:40:08] Ghost_Formen: hammer is not only making scave esay to compleate but also elixir but i understand the dislike for hammer whit a bad pouch set up
[0:40:08] dcptcncrescendo: iskHeart iskHeart for false
[0:40:10] Darkwytchcraft: You made this game and you gave some of us a way to enjoy the game. I have been enjoying it immensely. But when I was younger I was very competitive and I sometimes find it frustrating that I can't get better at a thing even though I'd like to. I've made this point before elsewhere.
[0:40:14] HFBalanann: how can i listen up if you have no mic? :)
[0:40:14] Svennonontwitch: Why so mean to Harold
[0:40:16] sil3nt_m3ow: 💓 💓 💓
[0:40:17] CoconutTiim: I just min max because I’m addicted not to complete LUL
[0:40:19] dragon_kitsune69: <3 <3 <3
[0:40:20] infinite083: how many days left btw?
[0:40:22] stephaniebutton23: the game has endless options, shes not doing the smarter options and upset others are maybe playing better? little toxic eh
[0:40:23] FishTWiT: No mic!? daveguyHmm MiniK
[0:40:27] arctrooperCLAW: !nomic
[0:40:28] ranger1332: Hallllo
[0:40:28] TheOnePercentGotMyMain: I think the real issue is the same issue as always, its the docs, as someone that just watches it feels like people dont have enough knowledge and are blaming the wrong things
[0:40:29] damnsecci: @infinite083 14 iirc
[0:40:30] Nightbot: i am chilling and have very little to no mic, voice needs resting :D
[0:40:30] sarinablueberry: Isn't part of the game just to challenge yourself and make yourself better so scarves are a way to challenge yourself to get better
[0:40:31] FreeZe1k: guys chill... false is great she is not beeing mean. she is just arguing and trying to explaine herself :) that doesnt mean she is bad person or arogant
[0:40:32] Tinokk85: Scavs used to be my least favourite objective for the longest time.... but then I got better gear, and better tools and improved my TTK. Now I complete them 80% of the time and it's exciting
[0:40:32] knightrali: good evening
[0:40:34] whatitiz9: Min max is addicting
[0:40:35] kay_0822: objective completion is overrated, loot is the goal, because it takes you further in the future
[0:40:37] ExplodinEmeraldsLIVE: what does Vanilla Immortality and Pulverizing do? I'm still trying to figure out jewels...
[0:40:39] angelfoxruby: I think if there is something you are good at in the game, strengthen that build. There is no one build to be great at the vault. While a hammer may improve efficiency, it's still not necessary.
[0:40:39] NGw7_: @thevixen38 Im not talking about her opinion. Im talking about her behaviours and personality.
[0:40:41] r4sta1138: I love scavs. Best challenge in the game. And challenges are fun.
[0:40:42] basteyos: Harold mustve done something bad to iskall.
[0:40:44] lordsfave: its almost like its a well designed game with multiple paths of victory
[0:40:49] InflatablePanda: of course you should have to minmax if your objective is MAXimising how many vaults you complete LUL
[0:40:49] strainjp: With wings improves my win rate by a huge factor but took me 40 levels to find one
[0:40:52] loading0110: Brazier is going to be SO easy to grind artifacts
[0:40:56] Darkwytchcraft: False is a good person, not sure how she got into this mess lol
[0:40:57] stephaniebutton23: @lordsfave word
[0:40:58] soulstealer0902: The main goal is to have fun people do that different ways right?
[0:40:58] ZaackLaChevre: scavs way too fun not to do it
[0:40:59] timmolaa: Its about choosing a build with tools to suit ones own style of play. For me a casual player thats slow in the vault, I enjoy scavs, scavs I think are part skill, part knowledge with a little bit of luck thrown in. I like not winning all objectives, it makes the one I win that little extra special. (Excuse and spell fails, watching off my phone)
[0:41:07] tgrs126: What is your completion rate stats Iskall?
[0:41:07] el3l_: Right, of course. But it's fun to have variety along the way and it feels like some of the variety is difficulty gated
[0:41:10] tre_2018: Imagine if Twitch put an ad in as Iskall started explaining xD
[0:41:10] Attackeight: @loading0110 yea, for sure!
[0:41:15] JashinFanatic: @iskall85 going back to difficulty modes, you may be getting a skewed perspective. You're running in normal when your skill level is probably way higher from played time alone.
[0:41:15] statsnerd1550: goodnight Iskall. am excited to see the rest of thai tomorrow
[0:41:16] Kasszi_: False Sadge
[0:41:17] Ramzi65ok: @timmolaa love this take
[0:41:17] JJFIREBLAST101: !nomic
[0:41:18] Darkest9469: cheer500 Hearts in chat for false. we all love false as well as everyone in the Hermitcraft vault hunters server. and yes that does include Iskall (love u dude)
[0:41:19] wes76544: Maybe add a feature where each vault gives you a shard and all the shard together makes the center artifact?
[0:41:21] zolek06: New quests for update 13?
[0:41:21] Attackeight: gn False!
[0:41:22] zinou2019: min max is fun in content creation
[0:41:23] batt3ryac1d: having a min-max meta always gets boring so fast
[0:41:25] VogelVrouw: <3 false
[0:41:25] Nightbot: i am chilling and have very little to no mic, voice needs resting :D
[0:41:29] lenjenben: <3
[0:41:30] Mnecraftenjoyer: hello
[0:41:34] Kasszi_: Chat was being tone deaf and not knowing False.
[0:41:36] piso112: What does min max mean. Asking as foreginer
[0:41:39] lofi_tofuu: having difrence of opinion is how things improve
[0:41:43] Ice1Berrgg: Iskall townhall
[0:41:45] Darkest9469: TTS off :((
[0:41:46] photiccc: she was playing devils advocate and chattermans didn’t like it
[0:41:46] jimi_dean: In the end.. the point of VH isn't even to complete. It's to have fun. I haven't completed, and I have a great time. Players can set their own objectives if they want a goal to complete to feel accomplished.
[0:41:47] zerogiven: My vault completion is probably 10% because I am potato but I still enjoy vaults.
[0:41:50] mattertec: @MaraudingBacon I'm not saying that they're right. I think scavs are in a good place personally. I can see some argument that they are too challenging for the average person who can't dedicate every day, but I don't have that opinion myself
[0:41:53] bestbla: trinkets are a problem  if u don't get any mobility trinket (ur lvl 84 ) and u don't have all the trinket that make it harder too
[0:41:54] Attackeight: Yes TTS is off
[0:41:54] ValueTown: hard is the difficulty iskall balance the game at isn't it?
[0:41:55] sabrina1202r: chat is somewhat mean in middle
[0:41:56] Ramzi65ok: pete and etho have gone crazy on min maxing and i love it
[0:41:57] goofyme: False not anymore right
[0:41:57] Darkwytchcraft: and that is what some of your chats are saying is that we're challenging your thoughts about how the vault game works for some of us
[0:41:57] ZaackLaChevre: @piso112 optimising everything, close to perfect gear etc
[0:42:01] redstonedad: rizzomFHeartRave False
[0:42:09] phillykd11: There were some people in chat that were being a little rude about Stress… it too many people, but I did see it
[0:42:09] strainjp: Please try without wings as movement is huge in scavs and I struggled to find wings
[0:42:13] tre_2018: TTS is off....yet mic is not. Iskall logic. LUL
[0:42:14] DanimalsBetch: the fact that people are complaining about scavs to begin with is...weird. there are plenty of options for everyone to have fun! maybe people LOVE scavs. I don't because I get nervous doing them and I don't like that feeling. BUT I also know that I do not need to complete the objective.
[0:42:15] zolek06: WIll update 13 have new quests?
[0:42:17] loading0110: remember to claim your bounty Iskall
[0:42:18] VogelVrouw: @piso112 min-maxing is when you try to get the most use out of something, like getting everything as perfect as you can
[0:42:18] Megaking202: it is like if you don't love using a hammer, you either nerf yourself, or use it, and play the game in a way you don't want to
[0:42:27] Ramzi65ok: vault hunters can be compaired to optimizing a speedrun of minecraft, random seed, mastering different aspects
[0:42:29] Darkest9469: @tre_2018 🤣 🤣
[0:42:34] Skywalker8510: what exactly is min maxing
[0:42:34] loufo_21: I feel like minmaxing your storage and stuff on the overworld to make it faster and better for you to do stuff inbetween runs is more exciting than minmaxing for inside the vault
[0:42:35] Zach010: I feel like the wings/hammer being a little too meta
[0:42:38] TheOnePercentGotMyMain: To play Devils advocate again, if Piece of Cake is for casuals, why are you worried about making it more casual
[0:42:38] Nightbot: For everything Vault Hunters, check out the website! https://vaulthunters.gg/
[0:42:40] microwavebruhh0: i like the new update with all the changes that’s been made
[0:42:40] f0uad01: The beauty of vault hunters is the skill ceiling and that you don't have to be a super gamer to be able to finish it and have a good time
[0:42:42] ranger1332: Literally in a pub with friends rn, but Iskall is live so gotta be here😁
[0:42:42] cyberwolf139: Can you explain what min maxing is?
[0:42:43] Sveta08: I like the braser update. Me, my Smite and Charm stuff will be much appreciated for it. It isn't as hard, but I'm not aiming for maximum challenge
[0:42:47] lordsfave: relics should make the vault longer but also scale objectives with the aditional time
[0:42:48] the_weerdo: Hey, everyone of you guys is an amazing person
[0:42:50] Bubblebutt2816: people hating on false perma ban these idiots
[0:42:51] Darkwytchcraft: You'd have to say something pretty awful for it to be taken as rude.   Otherwise we're trying to chat but you know what, it's hard sometimes to convey in a chat , what you can in words
[0:42:52] tgrs126: Hard should increase more than mobs IMO, because minmaxed weapons will easily overcome it.
[0:43:02] Ramzi65ok: @lordsfave that would not be good as theres no way to turn them off atm
[0:43:04] DanimalsBetch: hammer is not a necessity.
[0:43:04] Svennonontwitch: Killing mob is a knowledge. How you kill them are skill.
[0:43:05] loading0110: frog > wings imo
[0:43:11] zolek06: Will new quests be added for update 13?
[0:43:11] Smurfz87: If locked was still a thing, I'd complain about scavs. Now they are fun ^^,
[0:43:13] bouke1: Hallo
[0:43:14] Darkest9469: @loading0110 noooo
[0:43:15] Ramzi65ok: pickarang!

[0:43:19] FreeZe1k: @nichtg well maybe you dont know her that well... you just see messege "thats toxic FR" and take it as attack or something... just chill out :)
[0:43:20] dcptcncrescendo: Hammer is not a necessity. You can do what you want
[0:43:20] el3l_: since it's hard to be balanced in every chat, saying for the record that I really love the game
[0:43:22] thrall__owen: I have poor game skill I play on piece of cake and really enjoy myself. I just play to have fun. iskHype
[0:43:22] MaraudingBacon: QUESTION: WHY is a hammer being necassity a bad thing?
[0:43:23] babyinastr8jacket: I dont play with a hammer.  I have vein miner
[0:43:26] Kastumoem: You could just Spam vein Miner if you don't want to use a hammer you'll go through tools quicker but I have a villager just kicking out silk touch tools or something
[0:43:26] goofyme: I don't think it's a nerf, vien miner would work
[0:43:27] alexmurrin: Yeah I feel like there are more options then hammer
[0:43:29] lenjenben: I cannot run wings AT ALL. I go feather.
[0:43:34] italopussi: I know VH is better player on multiplayer. But why doesn't scale scav on multiplayer?
[0:43:36] LilJagty: please stick to your guns on scavs. Leave challenging objectives in the game! I agree that it gives players reason to try harder to learn more about the game and improve their skills/gear.
[0:43:36] Kasszi_: Plenty of people don't use hammers and play the game just fine
[0:43:37] Darkwytchcraft: I did go vein miner because it's rather new and neat to me
[0:43:37] Zinoba: ok what if i hated using tools in general. would it be a worthy discussion to have why you have to use tools
[0:43:37] loading0110: @Darkest9469 it feels so clean to run with frog though D:
[0:43:41] strainjp: Good trinket gives a huge win rate improvement but I've been unlucky as a casual player finding them
[0:43:42] miraculousmultifan: i personally dont have an issue with the difficulty of scavs. i play on easy and casual mode bc im not very good at pve, but the only reason i dont complete many scavs is bc im not fast enough. my issue, not vault hunters itself
[0:43:46] Tyler_Rose_94: wait are pickarangs still a thing?!
[0:43:48] Kasszi_: Zinoba lol
[0:43:49] Nightbot: Watch iskall85’s VOD’s at https://youtube.com/@vodskall85
[0:43:50] HFBalanann: i think etho proves a hammer is not "necessary" @iskall85
[0:43:50] Lashings: Can you put Vein miner on non-hammer tools like +hammering is on hammers
[0:43:50] Tnord001: I'm bad at the game, but i love it. I appreciate that I have options to challenge myself at my level
[0:43:50] tonTeufel: "you're nerving yourself if you don't use dash"
[0:43:53] soulstealer0902: I want party hats
[0:43:53] Nightbot: Support the devs & the pack.  https://www.patreon.com/VaultHunters
[0:43:53] tgrs126: Lol, try 11x11 hammer with lvl4 vein miner... vault get destroyed..
[0:43:54] Zach010: That's why she wanted you to run without a hammer, so you can show how you'd complete it without one
[0:43:57] DanimalsBetch: @miraculousmultifan this
[0:43:58] iamfranklydead: Are frills still a rhing
[0:43:58] jmommers98: But Iskall, I don't want to wear pants
[0:43:59] h2ikco: no mic? LIES!
[0:43:59] NeptonX: I don't run with trinkets, cause it's too expensive to buy out when I die...lol
[0:44:01] asimithehero: Make helmetless viable :(
[0:44:02] zimpinto: zimpinto subscribed with Prime. 
[0:44:02] symonsters: people probably just want more support with the knowledge of what is possible and what features are available (like for example the possibility to make a large hammer)
[0:44:05] Ice1Berrgg: The game has been beaten for years without hammers LOL
[0:44:07] Buggyhoser: I’ve never used a hammer but I want to try it
[0:44:09] piso112: Don't u think that focus and wand is worse than shield shouldn't they get buffed ?
[0:44:10] Verrandath: @piso112 min max is maxing out skills that are useful to your build and neglecting skills that don't help that build
[0:44:11] sabrina1202r: lol
[0:44:12] damnsecci: i run nakd and afraid because i didnt create my skin for nothing kek
[0:44:12] Nightbot: Everything in VH 1.18 is very under development & things might change.. Just Trust the Process-- iskall & Devs
[0:44:13] Darkest9469: @loading0110 nah I’m so used to running level 85 vaults with an elytra when I finally u locked wings it was second nature
[0:44:15] Attackeight: LUL
[0:44:16] thevoidknight430: @strainjp also as a casual, I never use wings, really don't have great trinkets. It hasn't affected me much
[0:44:18] jeaninius: I’m very confused by the arguments against using a hammer. What is the downside of having another tool?
[0:44:18] TheOnePercentGotMyMain: @symonsters I feel like this is the real issue
[0:44:21] enne0404: casually mooning everyone
[0:44:23] alexmurrin: Would be funny to do no shirt no shoes runs
[0:44:23] tre_2018: Nah you're good
[0:44:24] Kasszi_: resting his voice
[0:44:25] el3l_: no, you're good
[0:44:27] Kastumoem: I have 64 silk pics in my backpack at any given time I could absolutely just vein my way through a mine or anything
[0:44:27] Darkwytchcraft: What I feel is lacking in the game, is some tutorials in the mods for those of us struggling with the mods. It's why I'm excited for a vanilla = ish version
[0:44:27] CoconutTiim: @damnsecci LUL
[0:44:29] Kasszi_: says the man with no mic
[0:44:29] Jehosaphat697: you can lower the game level to make it fun for you
[0:44:32] DanimalsBetch: "resting my voice" has been talking for 30 minutes straight
[0:44:33] sabrina1202r: you're good
[0:44:34] Attackeight: "Good Shout" kekw
[0:44:37] runtels: Using a chestplate is a nerf
[0:44:37] Mnecraftenjoyer: wait are you gonna make cake vault  uncraftable? if so i personnaly do not think u should nerf them because they become much more difficult / rarer to get so it balances it out but what your take?
[0:44:37] damnsecci: this is podcast skall
[0:44:39] xverion_: its relaxedskall
[0:44:40] Darkwytchcraft: good I love a good debate
[0:44:41] momaggie1273: The only thing that I didn't like about hammers was the excess junk blocks. Now that I have a junk pouch, it's not as bad
[0:44:43] FreeZe1k: @miraculousmultifan been chilling
[0:44:43] TheAmateurQueen: All good here Iskall. Love to hear your perspective
[0:44:47] LeoTheLeopardNZ: My problem is wanting wings for flight, but also my Velara's petal for that regen because otherwise I just keep dying lol
[0:44:47] spike_p321: I think of it like chestplate and elytra and you can choose whatever works for you
[0:44:50] kaasmanmeneer: if you compare vh to aa AAA game, then it is crazy on how well vh listens to the  comunnity
[0:44:51] randommisao: @damnsecci LUL
[0:44:52] Haelthing: How many days are left?
[0:44:55] kinghingle: late night VH! wooooo!
[0:44:57] el3l_: I think one of the things you're really good at is having productive discussions
[0:44:58] TAxels: you've definitely improved my outlook on some of the stuff I was feeling bad about
[0:44:59] enne0404: @spike_p321 Exactly
[0:44:59] clairebearstare: it's a higher level discussion than many players are at. I have so many skill issues affecting me way more than hammer or no hammer, i'm just out here having very slow fun mostly surviving scavs lol
[0:45:00] microwavebruhh0: my battery is 85% haha
[0:45:00] mixedmesss: realest out there 🫶🏽
[0:45:01] k1d_zomb1e: I feel like I've heard the word Hammer too much, it's starting to sound weird.
[0:45:01] goofyme: False sounded annoyed, i like these talks
[0:45:03] JashinFanatic: I feel like there's a latent issue on the game where growth cannot be stopped even in softcore. You cannot go back to easier levels to improve because the vault scales up as you do
[0:45:07] ExplodinEmeraldsLIVE: wish I could get A mushroom Helmet on my single player world
[0:45:08] redstonedad: I like debates but hate arguing
[0:45:11] Drackst_Gaming: Hey the first livestream I've caught of yours. Usually just watch Vodskall
[0:45:13] Darkest9469: @darkwytchcraft there are books you can craft to run you through the mods. for example modular routers has a book that runs u through which helps me understand it because at first I had no clue
[0:45:16] Zach010: Stop the false toxicity chat comeon
[0:45:17] thrall__owen: Th
[0:45:17] kinghingle: i think there are several running economys in VH, its good and healthy
[0:45:17] Halo_Xmas: Iskall I just want to say these debates are nice
[0:45:17] samsam21amb: I don’t like the excessive junk blocks that gather in your inventory from a hammer, that’s why I don’t use a hammer, I’m like level 32.
[0:45:18] BigPoppaHouse: STOP! Hammer time! lol
[0:45:22] basteyos: Are mining lasers still usable in vaults tho?
[0:45:22] Sharust: Elytra vs chest plate is a good parallel to hammer vs other
[0:45:23] damnsecci: @Drackst_Gaming wooo vodskall vibes!
[0:45:24] Darkwytchcraft: New question, where would one apply to work on helping with the next generation of the game?  I'd like to volunteer
[0:45:25] tre_2018: The TTS or "Breathy Tara" as I call her is certainly resting her voice tonight. LUL LUL
[0:45:27] timmolaa: Scavs have been in VH for ages, why are people moaning about it now?
[0:45:27] Meena4578: sorry gotta go…
[0:45:27] JashinFanatic: so you cannot choose to go back levels before continuing to climb without heavy investment
[0:45:29] italopussi: VH is better on multiplayer. But why not scale scav up when multiple players are within the vault?
[0:45:31] ZaackLaChevre: don't forget that 90% of us don't even think about what would be good for the game, we just enjoy playing and just chill <3
[0:45:32] oDtEoDoA: people taking normal conversations and different personalities as anger. internet communication issue
[0:45:32] enne0404: @Drackst_Gaming Welcome!
[0:45:32] piso112: Is there limit for hammer size ?
[0:45:33] damnsecci: hey guys we still need a playbutton for vodskall
[0:45:34] strainjp: Yeah @thevoidknight430 I think so. I'm getting better every vault which is the point. I like a game that you gradually get better at which VH is!
[0:45:34] thrall__owen: Thought the puzzle was to have fun
[0:45:35] Bubblebutt2816: and so you should sir the problem is you can’t please everyone and some people gave different skill levels and different amount of times you can play end off it’s not you being toxic
[0:45:35] damnsecci: !vods
[0:45:36] Guybrrush: Guybrrush subscribed at Tier 3. They've subscribed for 38 months, currently on a 38 month streak! Hallo o/What's up?
[0:45:37] Nightbot: Watch iskall85’s VOD’s at https://youtube.com/@vodskall85
[0:45:42] Mnecraftenjoyer: wait are you gonna make cake vault uncraftable? if so i personnaly do not think u should nerf them because they become much more difficult / rarer to get so it balances it out but what your take?
[0:45:42] Drackst_Gaming: @damnsecci Vodskall is the best
[0:45:55] sgt_susman: same thing with wings, if you want to be faster in the vaults max out speed talent, maybe run an empower build, you can use potions to add even MORE speed, feather to quickly go up and down in rooms, frog to buff your empower build, many options that’s what makes the game so good.
[0:45:56] thevixen38: @oDtEoDoA yeash its sad
[0:45:58] angelfoxruby: People were being mean to false
[0:46:01] redstonedad: rizzomFHeartRave
[0:46:01] Zach010: Chat was being toxic, it was a decent handful
[0:46:04] batt3ryac1d: YAY! somehow I fixed 7tv POGGIES
[0:46:04] sabrina1202r: People were mean
[0:46:05] 0of1est: People didn't like the devil's advocate ig
[0:46:09] vimick: Sorry your chill stream devolved into you having to defend your game design once again
[0:46:10] jarivd03: Yeah, there were some people
[0:46:11] elraj85: Would you consider making some slower moving videos talking more about what gear you recomend and how to set up your pouches and stuff to give some advice to players that need more input? Continue the good work Iskall. I love the game Cheer100
[0:46:11] sgt_susman: there were a lot of toxic chatters
[0:46:11] Ramzi65ok: @damnsecci thanks for going crazy on that channel! been loving the vault snips
[0:46:15] valkojam: #playbuttonforSecci
[0:46:16] Kasszi_: Dylans were complaining saying that she was too rude and snippy and had a bad attitude. Which they are wrong, ofc. It was a few of them.
[0:46:19] DoctorEccle: I have a fear of speed bumps but I'm slowly getting over it
[0:46:23] HazzaBazza9: my friends are great at games, great shooters great aim, I am not, my addition to the team in I read ever wiki and know the games so can give me knowledge and planning. knowledge is still a gaming skill
[0:46:28] thatswiminduck: Hi chatters
[0:46:28] mattertec: @JashinFanatic This is definitely something that I've thought about. The 2nd part of it is keeping at a certain difficulty has been mitigated by plunderers, but used to be a concern
[0:46:30] damnsecci:  if u haven't subscribed to vodskall yet now is your time - packed with CONTENT https://youtube.com/@vodskall85
[0:46:32] Darkest9469: False deserves no disrespect. she is one of the loveliest person you could watch. if anyone disrespects people they deserve no mercy
[0:46:33] Verrandath: yeah the skill of the hammer is to know how and why to make it, not that completing the vault with the hammer takes skill
[0:46:33] damnsecci: @valkojam bless
[0:46:34] phillykd11: Iskall, you are right, I’m pretty bad at running vaults…if I had really amazing gear and abilities I think I still wouldn’t be able to complete “easy” vaults like that.
[0:46:37] tre_2018: @Kasszi_ Sometimes it's hard to pick up tone from text. :/
[0:46:38] CopperCent: Its learnable skills but takes patience and attention to get
[0:46:40] piso112: Will there be any changes to elixir vaults?
[0:46:41] lynx235: there kinda two skills used in vault hunters the problem solving of tools pouches and the movement and attacking
[0:46:41] kinghingle: it cant be helped if someone wont tunr their difficulty down, u can only show them the water
[0:46:46] batt3ryac1d: Yeah you gotta be careful you don't get one guyed by a whiner in chat though SkillIssue
[0:46:47] CoconutTiim: I gotta big problem with this game…. way too addicting
[0:46:49] phillykd11: To be clear I don’t mind that it is like that for me
[0:46:54] soulstealer0902: Cheer100 Cheer100 Iskall man can you make us party hat slots so that helmetless is viable NODDERS
[0:46:56] Ramzi65ok: we want to have a goal and difficulty to beat
[0:46:58] ZaackLaChevre: i can only play some hours a week, and the game feels perfect to me
[0:46:58] thatswiminduck: Interesting discussion this was
[0:46:58] mejeree: I think at some point there just isn't a reason to respond to the extreme comments anymore
[0:46:59] spike_p321: I am making totaly rude complaint bla bla bla because im not good
[0:46:59] LowKeyChemist: There's more than one way to play and be successful. There are lots of different builds that work with different play styles
[0:47:00] kajigaming25: kajigaming25 subscribed at Tier 1. 
[0:47:01] tre_2018: But yeah didn't think False was being rude really, just asking him
[0:47:02] damnsecci: freud is level 79 with 1 hr a week if i have to believe latest vod! lel
[0:47:04] Darkwytchcraft: game balancing is never easy but it's always worth it ;)
[0:47:04] Lymmoo: My personal pain with scavs is that they are in the same pool as other objectives for regular crystals, when they are considerably more challenging. Maybe taking scavs from regular crystals and increasing the rewards would have been better no idea
[0:47:12] Kasszi_: @Kasszi_ even if people are taking the tone wrong they shouldn't talk badly about iskall's friend in chat, ESPECIALLY when she can easily see it since she's obviously listening to the stream
[0:47:14] henryt__: I play VH since mid Season 2 of VHSMP and spent over 1000 hours. Man you are doing a dang good job. Cheer500
[0:47:20] basteyos: Airplanes are not real, they just keep going over my head.
[0:47:21] jmommers98: Knowing the game is so amazing, makes me accept that I'm not getting all the content with my 3 vaults per month
[0:47:24] R_The_Viking: If people have problems with the game or how it plays, then maybe they shouldn't play it and find something else
[0:47:25] sneakypete55: let’s run some vaults
[0:47:25] Seraphim_Mae: Ad
[0:47:26] Xarallon: Iskall, have you seen Richard Garfields lecture "Luck versus Skill", great insights on luck
[0:47:26] Nightbot: Twitch Tiers 2 & 3 subs & Patreons Diamond level & above can now sign up to play on the Vault Hunters servers. Join iskall's Discord at  discord.gg/iskall85 & sign up https://vaulthunters.gg/server-status Patreon https://www.patreon.com/iskall85
[0:47:28] strainjp: I'm totally obsessed with the game and I have a low success rate in scavs but its part of the adrenaline!
[0:47:29] CopperCent: Soul flame currency should be charred souls
[0:47:30] angelfoxruby: I hate fantasy football ad
[0:47:30] VogelVrouw: idek what the discussion was about before the hammers
[0:47:32] timmolaa: You should give a 'get good' transmog if u fail 20 scavs
[0:47:32] CeleiteStreams: Difficulty pushes players to get better at the game. When I fail I look at what I can do better, what I can change. Sometimes you get unlucky and being able to recognize that you need to exit a vault instead of trying to complete is another skill.
[0:47:33] tgrs126: For Prp-Players I think difficulty should scale objectives, not just mobs
[0:47:33] asimithehero: Thank you for not making the soul flames meta :)
[0:47:36] piso112: Is there limit for a hammer size?
[0:47:36] loading0110: lol one second ad jumpscare
[0:47:38] leniad016: Wait, are you changing cake vaults???
[0:47:40] sarinablueberry: Cheer1000 I am low level skilled but I loved the vaults and I love the way it challenges me and it also makes me a better player
[0:47:40] fabbitheapple: oh i taught this was going to be an no mic stream
[0:47:41] zinou2019: what happened go soul flame ?
[0:47:43] enne0404: @henryt__ Pog
[0:47:43] InflatablePanda: @Lymmoo now u can apply brazier or elixir seal if you dont want a scav?
[0:47:46] tabkobza: tabkobza subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 10 months! 
[0:47:47] varaaq: The game gives you a slew of different tools to solve a slew of different challenges.   Im not sure there is a ton of value in having an intense debate on this -- the reality is that Iskall and the team have done a spectacular job of providing a bunch of different tools to accommodate all sorts of playstyles.  Lots of different solutions to the puzzle.
[0:47:47] LilikoiLucy: I think you’re taking a very balanced approach for the greater audience
[0:47:47] rochygamer10: Hey Iskall
[0:47:56] Poghorn2: It's okej iskall, you can remove the no Mic tag now!
[0:48:00] matjea: @Knew_It_Owl forgot to thank you for the sub last week
[0:48:03] varaaq: Gear quality and tool quality are both important components, but a player that is more skilled, in their movement for instance, can compensate for having poorer equipment or fewer resources.  Vein miner is an alternative to a hammer for instance, but it has a higher durability cost.  You gain an extra slot on your hotbar and one less thing to manage, but you do lose a benefit.  You can make that call for your playstyle.
[0:48:03] Ramzi65ok: Movement hasn't been brought up enough as a skill based mechanic
[0:48:03] kapazamo: I think vh is balanced.  But the thing I  think is important to play as you enjoy.
[0:48:04] goofyme: I like the challenges the modpack gives ya, although i can play some hour in the week. But playing together is so much more fun
[0:48:04] DraamaQ: i would argue that gaming is more fun when it’s not easy. yeah it’s pretty satisfying playing on arcade mode with autocompleted crystals for example, but I’m only satisfied for a second. but playing on a harder difficulty means that that I’m more proud of my own progress and therefore it gives me more satisfaction longer to make my own crystals or not being able to complete EVERY vault
[0:48:05] SebastiaanO: i prefer the term learning curve over skill
[0:48:11] Darkwytchcraft: @R_The_Viking that is exactly the sort of thing we didn't need to hear.  Get good is not for everyone but this game CAN be
[0:48:13] VogelVrouw: yeah
[0:48:13] jeaninius: it takes time to get good at anything. I think people watch professional Minecraft players and think they should progress at the same rate.

[0:49:09] kinghingle: the amount of resistance u get to obtain that same amount of stuff is so much lower
[0:49:09] CoconutTiim: the mobs are there to stop you from getting them items
[0:49:10] thevoidknight430: it wouldn't be fair for rng to be local, gear being local to scale makes more sense
[0:49:12] samsam21amb: Ads
[0:49:15] DElyMyth: Just to understand how bad I am, how does it scale to "Easy"?
[0:49:16] Ramzi65ok: fragged early game is crazy!11

[0:49:35] f0uad01: If ppl want scaling difficulty then what about and item you craft and put on crystal that make the abjective harder like more scav items or more elixir
[0:49:48] kinghingle: Clap
[0:49:53] spike_p321: But i watch every vod tho and all vids
[0:49:53] lenjenben: Iskall not only did you bring us vault hunters you brought us etho in vault hunters. coping for a team Canada play thru at some point
[0:49:55] GooseLeeMague: these are so many words for this late at night
[0:49:57] NGw7_: Can u put Unbreaking on Trinkets?
[0:49:58] beefy_booty: I just completed my first scav! (I am noob)
[0:50:02] miraculousmultifan: i play on easy and casual and i dont find an issue with objective scaling! if i cant complete a scav, its bc im not looting/killing mobs fast enough
[0:50:05] rupov777: Omg a video on stream time @vodskall85 enjoy
[0:50:07] Ramzi65ok: I feel like people who play on peice of cake just can't move their cursor fast enough or can't run through minecraft fast enough
[0:50:07] Darkest9469: @nichtg no
[0:50:08] Darkwytchcraft: that's why I came here to ask that question, I didn't make the game I don't know how your scaling etc works when I don't know something I'm OLD school, I ask :)
[0:50:11] kinghingle: also true
[0:50:12] piso112: Smb said : If ppl want scaling difficulty then what about and item you craft and put on crystal that make the abjective harder like more scav items or more elixir
[0:50:14] microwavebruhh0: i think people just need to play a easier difficulty if they want to be toxic about scaling vaults
[0:50:16] clairebearstare: it's an addictive game even as a skill-challenged player. i don't complete a lot of scavs but tbh it makes it super exciting when i do. i don't feel like it's hindering my fun
[0:50:17] Svennonontwitch: You need diffrent levels. If you need more challange, go up a level.
[0:50:17] batt3ryac1d: Try reinstalling windows tbh half the time it's just brokey
[0:50:18] Zinoba: that falsely assumes equal skill in movement, but you are right in principle
[0:50:18] kajigaming25: I dont believe a hammer is needed i complete 90% of my scavs at lvl 67 with vienminer and a good pick I have only played on hard even in a singleplayer world i think its very well balanced you just have to slowly work your way up to the skill lvl just like any other game. Cheer1000
[0:50:32] shagman007: He sounds tired. Lol
[0:50:35] ligands_: Do scav objectives scale with the number of players? They're a lot harder in single-player without being able to trade with your party, and I bet most people that complain about it (including myself) are playing single player

[0:51:00] Teeldove: I love that there is a level option and game mode option for different situations because my life changes so quick. Sometimes I want just vaulting. And sometimes I want the farms and building  structure and farms. And there are times I can play alot but most of the time it is very little. Either way this game is addicting. This game is so versatile. Thank you iskall and team.
[0:51:00] kinghingle: yea because thats the persons subjective enjoyment factor not happening,
[0:51:08] VogelVrouw: as an easy player that does still not complete often: i totally get it, i know that i do just need to Get Gud
[0:51:09] DanimalsBetch: makes perfect sense
[0:51:10] Darkest9469: @kajigaming25 the thing is that vein miner on a paxel for example takes a lot of dura whereas if u have a high level hammer it takes less durability
[0:51:14] microwavebruhh0: yea
[0:51:18] Romlekidd: 100% agree
[0:51:20] rytional: makes sense the way it is
[0:51:21] Halo_Xmas: What if you made an optional seperate slider for mob difficulty and vault objective difficulty where if someone wants to play double easy they can
[0:51:21] kinghingle: i think its still valid to scale objectives, but i see how u do it at the moment
[0:51:22] waysidescroll: I thought it was semi self explanatory
[0:51:25] TorqueSquirrel: I feel like dungeons play a large part in me completing scav vaults
[0:51:27] thevoidknight430: having objectives not scale also probably helps to get better
[0:51:27] evanx4: in my opinion I would say majority of objectives are doable, but for some vaults you gotta focus on it more than others vaults
[0:51:27] jarivd03: Make it look easier but tweak the rates :)
[0:51:28] justaguynexttoyou: yep
[0:51:30] valkojam: That is a clear explanation cert

[0:51:42] DystarPlays: "emotions are irrational"
[0:51:45] Mnecraftenjoyer: @iskall85  wait are you gonna make cake vault uncraftable? if so i personnaly do not think u should nerf them because they become much more difficult / rarer to get so it balances it out but what your take?
[0:51:46] Pavcl5: But if they are playing on lower difficulty it probably means they are worse at the game so basically the time to kill mobs is the same
[0:51:48] LilikoiLucy: oh to be a Vulcan
[0:51:48] DystarPlays: but yeah, they're not meant to be
[0:51:49] grossly1: yes
[0:51:51] el3l_: understood, and I think you have a good point. Have you considered how big a difference movement skill makes? I think that's a much larger component of not top tier player's time
[0:51:51] Ice1Berrgg: Illogical
[0:51:52] kinghingle: no but hardly anything is logical
[0:51:52] DanimalsBetch: it's like you've said, vaults aren't designed to have 100% completion rate. regardless of difficulty or objective.
[0:51:53] soul_ksa: iskall this mod is so good you and your team did a great jop 👏🏻
[0:51:54] toaster42010: Oblivious?
[0:51:54] Darkwytchcraft: I mean I am not tryin to insult you, I'm just trying to find out what I don't know about.  What's frustrating is the barrier that chats give you.  Also trying to be seen in a room that is crowded
[0:51:58] ExplorerCan3: love is blind
[0:51:58] GooseLeeMague: in one ear and straight out the other kekw
[0:52:01] rupov777: @iskall85 hallo??? Video up on vodakall85 <3
[0:52:01] enyo81: like if i say i don,t get as much loot as iskall, well yer coz even at level 50 i can only get about 5/7 rooms done, so why should i be getting loot like iskall who can make me dizzy by hoe fast he is. this is also the reason i don't get as many sav's or other done. i fail more then any thing but this is my prob ,not a game prob
[0:52:02] tonTeufel: Imo for piece of cake you should just give in and do direct objective scaling. It has basically no downside
[0:52:03] rythmyr: I'm not sure that's true. On hard, you kill what, 8 mobs with chaining at once? It's exactly the same on piece of cake, same number of sword swings to kill. Difficulty makes no difference if everything dies in one hit
[0:52:03] lenjenben: I grinded to get better. I sucked before. don’t nerf the sense of achievement of getting gooder
[0:52:08] occathereptil: tbf that is something you are working on and have noticed it is not a finished game
[0:52:09] Buggyhoser: emotions are illogical HypeLUL
[0:52:10] timmolaa: Embrace the ledditors. Give a 'get good' transmog to any player that doesnt complete 10 scavs in a row
[0:52:11] apepaconda: I am new to the game. So far the only negative i can see in the game is the death system. If you die several times in a row your deaths get expensive and it becomes impossible to vault with no gold and no gear
[0:52:13] Ramzi65ok: imageine a hypothetical world where you wern't told how many of each item you needed, so you just had to keep turning them in until they went away
[0:52:14] swiss_fighta: Players get to choose what game mechanics to use ( difficulty level, hammer or no, wings or no, etc.) You provide methods for players to beat the game that align with the different choices players make. Seems good to me.
[0:52:14] verqix: With the number of mobs, would it help to scale in smaller steps to give players more time to get used to more mobs? It feels like currently there are large jumps in number of mobs
[0:52:14] Pavcl5: @iskall85  But if they are playing on lower difficulty it probably means they are worse at the game so basically the time to kill mobs is the same

[0:52:38] kajigaming25: i know relics are being changed to not give bonus time but are they still in the game i loved the fun of hunting to complete them all as a fun nside thing to do in the vault. Cheer100
[0:52:39] bikaryn: i thimk this is my first stream
[0:52:39] kinghingle: i'm on the fence for lootable only cake seals, i could take it or leave it
[0:52:43] Ice1Berrgg: I think you can help by making relics and cake seals only appear in Treasure chests or Completion crates
[0:52:43] Pavcl5: @iskall85 But if they are playing on lower difficulty it probably means they are worse at the game so basically the time to kill mobs is the same
[0:52:48] Ghost_Formen: iskall i think there is some thing you don't think about but you can't do eny thing about the scaleing is that the player that play on har or frag lvl is better at playing minecraft in general than the player that are playing on esay mode Cheer100
[0:52:57] Xarallon: instead of scaling objectives, you could scale drop rate of scav items, amount of elixir gained
[0:53:00] batt3ryac1d: If you do make cake vaults uncraftable they should have a good % to show up in market.
[0:53:00] wolocake: do u know when update 13 is gonna be released?
[0:53:02] elraj85: Would you consider making some slower moving videos talking more about what gear you recomend and how to set up your pouches and stuff to give some advice to players that need more input? Continue the good work Iskall. I love the game Cheer100
[0:53:05] PremieressS: @Ice1Berrgg shhhhh thats too rare, I want craftable cake seals lmao
[0:53:10] TheOnePercentGotMyMain: I agree with your logic, but looking at it from the other side, I play Piece of Cake, I want casual fun once a week, I enter my one Vault for the week and it looks Impossible, I picked the casual mood and this does not match my expectations
[0:53:19] Nightbot: Vault Hunters Reddit for you to check out! https://www.reddit.com/r/VaultHuntersMinecraft/
[0:53:20] tgrs126: What is your completion rate Iskall? Just curious.
[0:53:21] UniversalShadows: why does title say no mic
[0:53:29] sgt_susman: !u13
[0:53:38] saycl0ne: All this point cuz people dosent choose to not play scavs? And the. Whine about
[0:53:40] Ramzi65ok: @elraj85 i feel like a prompted guide makes  it so people would follow iskall for the meta instead of figuring it out
[0:53:42] Kasszi_: @UniversalShadows bc iskall is a silly man
[0:53:43] kinghingle: its not entirely a 1 to 1 scale with completion rate
[0:53:43] sabrina1202r: iskall even tho I am on your side I want to argue the fast that not all people are efficient as much so the passive way to make it easier is not helping them
[0:53:43] MaraudingBacon: Thats a great shout
[0:53:43] Neon_Shadow_Live: I was going to go to sleep. But now I vault lol . This is such an addictive, fun and ever evolving game.
[0:53:46] Darkwytchcraft: I play piece of cake, with arcade settings. I play piece of cake because of my DISABILITY not because I'm a bad player of games.
[0:53:49] Darkest9469: @universalshadows it was a no mic but I’m guessing Iskall had a few comments to reply to in chat about in game mechanics
[0:53:49] VogelVrouw: yeah thats a good point
[0:53:54] spike_p321: I dont watch my phone often the only vids i watch are iskals and music
[0:53:57] Zinoba: this is exactly the point people are making i think
[0:53:58] CoconutTiim: I think what everybody needs to remember is that there’s nothing wrong with being bad at a game, it’s just about having fun is all
[0:53:59] soulstealer0902: Thats why they play on easy
[0:53:59] Ice1Berrgg: @PremieressS nooooooo
[0:54:01] Darkstar159: @TheOnePercentGotMyMain No shade - at some point you gotta recognise that a game isn't for you
[0:54:06] TheOnePercentGotMyMain: The other thing is a Piece of cake player is also likely not moving efficiently through the vault
[0:54:06] tonTeufel: @Pavcl5 yeah, and you can complete on hard with that time to kill, so if a worse player takes similar time to kill on piece of cake, they can still complete
[0:54:09] dcptcncrescendo: I mean, there's ***ason to put thorns on a build

[0:54:17] TheOnePercentGotMyMain: @TheOnePercentGotMyMain So why does piece of cake exist
[0:54:17] tgrs126: Noob will lose 99% of time on movement, not on fighting mob
[0:54:21] LeoTheLeopardNZ: I'm really happy with the progress my friends and I have made on our little server, we started on christmas eve and we've got people in like... levels 85-95, with 2 artifact slots left, and it's really enjoyable
[0:54:23] Sharust: They're not 90% worse. At some point a game isn't for you
[0:54:25] hi_there56: Just so you know Iskall, incase the cake seals are uncraftable, i have 50 seals crafted and waiting at my base

And I think most people want 90% of the game to be done easily and not have that feeling of going into a vault and seeing a hard scav. Also with completion requirements on scav, some people will feel like they are missing out because they feel they are impossible. (By the way, I think the vaults are perfect (ish) but just saying how I think some people feel) Love you iskall iskHeart
[0:54:43] Svennonontwitch: Yes, i see this between you HC players here aswell.
[0:54:45] Ice1Berrgg: I truly cannot imagine someone being so bad that they miss that many times in a row this is an interesting perspective you have to look at though, as a game developer @iskall85
[0:54:46] el3l_: tbh I don't mind the hammer meta, I know I can do almost as well with a pickax. The meta I notice way more is elytra; I think movement diff is way bigger, and movement is very skill based
[0:54:47] Kastumoem: Honestly the time to clear the POI Moore has to do with how quickly the waves come like all four of them at level 100 for The horde mobs where you'll clear each one and then there's like a second or two between when all those are gone and the next one comes
[0:54:52] miraculousmultifan: yeah im not very good at pve which is why i play on easy. i dont think thats why i dont complete many scavs though
[0:54:52] Darkwytchcraft: my skills have diminished with my AGE can we not assume Piece of cake is being used by just "low skill" and sometimes by those of us with a disability who want to enjoy the game
[0:54:52] DanimalsBetch: not a hypothetical player, it's me lmao
[0:54:52] beefy_booty: I miss so many times when I'm panicking 😂
[0:54:54] Darkest9469: @hi_there56 mate I’ve done the same 🤣. I love the new cake vaults so I want to run as many as possible
[0:54:59] zimpinto: Better players,
[0:55:02] GnariZZar: what happened with [no mic!]
[0:55:06] thrall__owen: I'm horrible at games piece of cake easy to kill mobs but I move slower through vault
[0:55:08] Zinoba: you underestimate how bad i am. have you accounted for the time i spend falling down after getting scared. this is not a skill issue copium
[0:55:10] MaraudingBacon: @Sharust i dissagree with you here. i really love that iskall is really tring to give VH to everyone
[0:55:17] matadoo_: Its also harder to min max armor and weapons for the casual player if they play less, so the true difference is probably not actually 9x
[0:55:18] zimpinto: Better players play more so have better gear
[0:55:20] clairebearstare: i feel like playing on low difficulty makes it equal to my skill, which is low, vs trying to make it 'easier' for myself. so taking the same amount of time feels right to me
[0:55:24] MiniBloxiaJukersonYt: hey I keep being sick not been sick for a hot minute hru
[0:55:27] lalorsa1: Maybe a worse player isn´t only "bad" at fighting, but also about movement. Therefor I understand the request of scaling the objectives.
[0:55:27] VogelVrouw: @Zinoba relatable!
[0:55:30] InflatablePanda: what if you up the hidden numbers a little (e.g. piece of cake is 20% not 10%) and lower the shown numbers a little (scav with a few less items on piece of cake) so it is visibly easier but not overscaled?
[0:55:32] hi_there56: @Darkest9469 yea I got a farmer villager to make the process easier
[0:55:35] mattertec: I don't think that's quite accurate iskall - there are also other things to consider: movement timings, as well as efficiency in targeting. It's not quite as simple as less health is directly proportional to less time spent
[0:55:40] loufo_21: Have you thought about buffing tank/thorns builds because that solves a lot of those problems
[0:55:49] kinghingle: i think scaling objective for thoe who want that would be such a feel good for them for sure
[0:55:50] f0uad01: The passive scaling is perfect but if some hardcore player wants a harder objective why not add a cheap item you craft and put on your crystal that makes the objective alittle harder like more items for scav or more elixir needed so the normal players aren't effected and the ppl wanting scaling objectives will be happy and that will be wini win
[0:55:50] TheImmortaldonut: The point about easier difficulties probably applies to me because I'm on my first playthrough, but it's hard to not compare yourself a little to players like you and Etho who have loads of time to play. I do appreciate you sharing your viewpoints on the design of the game, and it has changed my opinion on things before
[0:55:51] SkarmerBillias: think your office has sprung a leak
[0:55:56] Darkest9469: at the end of the day. it’s night :)
[0:56:00] Todumbtodie: :D iskall called me smort
[0:56:07] Ice1Berrgg: Whoever is out here missing a group of horde mobs really needs to play on a mode easier than "Piece of Cake" nah they need a whole bakery
[0:56:13] Darkwytchcraft: it always has
[0:56:24] Coralotl: Easy to learn, hard to master
[0:56:26] beefy_booty: With cake seals, I really like the idea of them being findable. Makes them more desirable
[0:56:27] el3l_: that does make sense
[0:56:30] redstonedad: I hate being called a sweat
[0:56:32] HC_Shako: Hey dude. Love what you are doing with the game. Also the vodskall vids with the gang are great. Cheers dude!
[0:56:32] Ramzi65ok: it has felt that way
[0:56:34] iPassiive: basically saying the game needs a "skill ceiling"
[0:56:35] MaraudingBacon: @iskall85 just make a pete and abe json file. we know its needed
[0:56:36] soulstealer0902: cater towards those who really want to play or not?
[0:56:42] k1_setae: yes true
[0:56:49] nounou26x: yes
[0:56:53] el3l_: fair
[0:56:57] Mnecraftenjoyer: fair
[0:56:57] Aylabar: thats why I always play scavs now
[0:56:57] Zinoba: yes. as a bad player i agree to let pro gamers have some more things
[0:56:58] spike_p321: Ok hear me out . Make pickarang a craftable tool in tool bench
[0:56:58] Ramzi65ok: i don't like keeping stuff when i die, but i don't want to make the world hardcore
[0:56:58] Darkwytchcraft: I like the idea that skilled players have their thing.  But people whose skills are lessened by age etc, can still play
[0:57:01] borkbork_bork_: I also play less...
[0:57:03] SirBobtheCasual: Can we have another "not always complete" objective?
[0:57:06] jeaninius: HBomb wants to play on fragged
[0:57:07] Ramzi65ok: dying was the biggest resource sink in the game
[0:57:08] PogaafThe2nd: haunt the potatoes
[0:57:15] Nicola_002: true thegame become so boring after 85, sadly
[0:57:15] AutumnArts_: also, at some point you cannot make the game easier, if someone misses 90% of their swings then that person should also practise their gameplay skills
[0:57:16] dcptcncrescendo: @iskall85 , apparently I watch so much streaming, my two year old recognizes your voice. She comes in the kitchen and says 'iskallman!!'
[0:57:18] hamisharms: @iskall85 I also think that people see you play (who can play for hours and hours). But they cant and feel like its a lot more of a grind than they realized.
[0:57:20] Mnecraftenjoyer: @spike_p321 wouldnt that be too op?
[0:57:24] italopussi: VH is better on multiplayer
[0:57:26] tre_2018: THIS! Or they gotta finally do something different with the block puzzle room
[0:57:27] lenjenben: don’t scale objectives
[0:57:27] Ice1Berrgg: @dcptcncrescendo Awwwwwwwwww
[0:57:32] Darkstar159: If lack of time to play is the issue, you're gonna have way more troubles than just the vault. Building farms, tools, rolling gear - everything will be harder to complete
[0:57:35] kinghingle: i think thats y soul flame being a personal achivment thing is so good, because u can pour sweat into that as hard as u want and it'l only get harder as u go
[0:57:38] Darkstar159: and no amount of difficulty settings is going to fix that
[0:57:41] Darkwytchcraft: with arcade I can skip the scav, when you spend an hour getting things for a crystal it might be a tad more frustrating lol
[0:57:42] majzadravec: Scavs are easy
[0:57:42] thevoidknight430: scav was totally a diffuclty check, it took several weeks before I got comfortable to play them
[0:57:45] londonb2008: Hi
[0:57:45] tre_2018: Dangit twitch
[0:57:45] VogelVrouw: i do agree, im a bad player but i still want the chalenge, i want to try hard and work for the completions
[0:57:46] HFBalanann: i think you have dont a great job from VH2 to VH3 around new players and next evolution could be towards the higher end players
[0:57:46] italopussi: Why not scale scav up on multiplayer?
[0:57:50] thebeaz2: 100s of swets vs 1000s of others though
[0:57:54] kunfudragon: Impulse he don't play every day
[0:57:57] GnariZZar: 2hta if u scale everything with the difficulty on the server/world?
[0:58:03] waysidescroll: You are 100% correct
[0:58:03] kibaz_x: VH isn't for everyone, and that's 100% okay
[0:58:06] MaraudingBacon: scab should have failure
[0:58:07] Ice1Berrgg: @thebeaz2 what issue would we have if they miss us 9 times
[0:58:07] el3l_: I've seen it more as variety - there's a long way between 0 and 100, and variety is nice along the way. Not saying it has to be compleatable
[0:58:10] Darkest9469: If you play a game too much you get burnt out. It’s not a case of it’s too easy it all depends on how much time you put into a game which will see how easy you find it. like I play about 5-6 hours a day and in about 2 months I got level 78. it’s all about how much time you put in
[0:58:10] peppa_j: hi chat!
[0:58:12] f0uad01: @iskall85 do you think a double objective vault will be fun
[0:58:12] VogelVrouw: the fails make the completions feel so much better
[0:58:16] PogaafThe2nd: use Create to Haunt the potatoes
[0:58:19] Darkwytchcraft: can we make scavs a deliberate choice?
[0:58:20] Verrandath: Losing makes winning all the better
[0:58:22] jbkaner: you have create for potato’s
[0:58:22] spike_p321: @iskall85 am me stupid or make pickarang a tool that can get jewels on it so it can be an alternative from hamba
[0:58:26] Cloudetix: I think it's important to remember to separate difficulty for grinding. I think a lot of people think things are too time consuming rather than too difficult.
[0:58:26] manithoro: mabye it would be better is scav could only be craftet not gotten randomly
[0:58:28] Darkwytchcraft: *sigh*
[0:58:33] kinghingle: i dont know what the facination with 100% completion is, i use to only net 40% of scavs and i felt fine with it
[0:58:34] sophistic_ated: Would you consider a gamemode like classic VH so players can choose between hoard mobs or classic mob style spawning? 🤔
[0:58:35] Julio_Brz: scavs are hard, you are supposed to be on the brink of not finishing every time
[0:58:35] ShapNine: Completing is not required, you still get loot
[0:58:36] player3977047: what about having some kind of modifier that you can add on your crystal to make the base objective easier/harder (and nerf/buff the crate)
[0:58:36] kurtiswatson01: LUL
[0:58:39] tonTeufel: I think there should be a crystal scaling mode between free and normal, with lower numbers and a reduced pool
[0:58:43] Ice1Berrgg: Peaks and Valleys
[0:58:46] soulstealer0902: But thats 10 hours a  vs 1
[0:58:48] MaraudingBacon: @Darkest9469 i disagree with oyu on this. some times hours dont matter. some times its just too hard or not hard enough
[0:58:50] Kasszi_: if you always win its boring
[0:58:51] dakewafel: I think you have to break the taters for poisonous potato
[0:58:52] stephaniebutton23: it's so very obvious that you care deeply about making the game fair for different levels of players. don't beat yourself up
[0:58:52] markbudjames: could you make it so theres an gamerule option which lets you choose from one of three scavs when you enter so the player can set the difficult of each vault depending how they feel at the time.
[0:58:53] lenjenben: you’re saying you don’t want people to feel bad for failing but don’t forget the feel good of getting gooder. scaling objectives will effect that
[0:58:54] damnsecci: ok ima crash in bed but before i do dylans lets make a deal
[0:58:54] occathereptil: I love scavs and find them challenging my completion rate is definitely on the lower side but I love the challenge of them and they are very fun to run with friends
[0:58:55] Ice1Berrgg: !watchtime
[0:58:56] Zinoba: never too many!
[0:58:58] futureimagineer13: not enough
[0:59:00] Ice1Berrgg: !followage
[0:59:00] Xarallon: many, not too many
[0:59:01] Ginjajewfro: Unsure if this is a bug or a feature, but can you try mapping your right-click to spacebar then bonemealing your crops? You can harvest them incredibly quickly!
[0:59:01] CoconutTiim: could haunt the potato’s with create @iskall85
[0:59:04] kinghingle: very fair, i just done it for easy loot
[0:59:04] Guybrrush: As long as I can make a fancy Create Vault Portal, I don't care about the balance of the game ^^
[0:59:04] VogelVrouw: exactly
[0:59:05] beefy_booty: I won my first scav today and it felt great! It felt like I accomplished something LUL
[0:59:07] rytional: same
[0:59:08] angelfoxruby: Mono are boring to me
[0:59:10] penzouille: same actually
[0:59:13] el3l_: but is that difficulty or the way that it plays?
[0:59:13] Ramzi65ok: people just want the high of completeing something difficult without it being difficult
[0:59:15] sabrina1202r: yep same
[0:59:16] dndgay: as a person who enjoys easier gaming- i think by having keepinv options and easy difficulties- its okay to try to make it harder, as long as there are alts for those who want it
[0:59:18] rad_ju: and do you enjoy completing braziers?
[0:59:19] LeoTheLeopardNZ: Nobody LIKES losing, but it makes winning feel great
[0:59:21] lynx235: same
[0:59:23] Chandler86_: As a bad player, I have
[0:59:23] sgt_susman: I enjoy the crate that’s it though
[0:59:24] Darkwytchcraft: half the time with monoliths as they were , you spent most of the time trying to get the things  then loot with time left
[0:59:25] matjea: You need botany pot for potatoes
[0:59:27] ZaackLaChevre: @Ramzi65ok this
[0:59:27] mczimo: co-op vs single scav is big difference
[0:59:28] apepaconda: Do you enjoy the brazier vault?
[0:59:29] TheOnePercentGotMyMain: If I was in work and we were having this conversation Id really want some Data, this is such a data driven decision
[0:59:29] Ice1Berrgg: Light the monoliths is as exciting as blowing out dinner candles 💀
[0:59:32] Ccbeemee: look, in the end Vault Hunters is a video game. Play how you want with what's available to YOUR enjoyment. If you're not having fun, this may not be the game for you.
[0:59:33] angrrrrydad: Hallo iskall sir , i guess i'm late to the party
[0:59:34] Darkest9469: @maraudingbacon that’s fair mate. nah your point is valid.
[0:59:35] kitp1324: If you win all the time, the loses feel really bad. If you lose all the time, the wins feel great
[0:59:36] lenjenben: secco what’s the deal
[0:59:37] TAxels: the braziers are awesome and it feels like a nice transition to using catalysts
[0:59:39] thevoidknight430: I agree with elixer, i never run it doesn't feel like you do anything.
[0:59:40] DeweyBoys: scav vault’s definitely give the most satisfaction for completion
[0:59:41] DanimalsBetch: played a solo monolith vault with 11 monoliths just yesterday. not fun.
[0:59:42] Mnecraftenjoyer: @iskall85 quick reminder about the uncraftable cake and should you nerf it or not?
[0:59:43] Zinoba: now imagine how good you would feel completing a brazier if they were included in ascension!
[0:59:47] clairebearstare: i've only completed one scav but the high i felt when i did!
[0:59:48] timmolaa: If vaults are designed to have a 100% win rate, is it really winning?
[0:59:49] Guybrrush: "Everyone like winning, but how many of us like training?"
[0:59:50] 11doggie11: @iskall85 could u make it where you can chose the difficulty of the vault when u craft the crystal so it makes it harder for the people who want the challenge??
[0:59:53] damnsecci: so dylans, enjoy the silence of the strem iskTroll it has been delivious
[0:59:54] thebeaz2: I was referring to ratios. no matter, this gamer dad gonna keep playing not matter what.
[0:59:56] serrmardan: the best part about games is the challenge, no matter what it is, games are supposed to be enjoyable, yes, but they shouldn't be so easy that its mind-numbing and no longer engaging
[0:59:57] casonalsup: Hallo
[1:00:03] whocares_15: @iskall85 i've been getting unlucky with current gear rolls for my build (hard focus on attack damage) and am running with 20 lower level gear pieces. i'm starting to have a lot of difficulty with damage i take now. would you recommend switching to a different build or to just roll more gear?
[1:00:04] BlueBKDD: I thought monos are a good teaching objective, but maybe disappear after lvl 10
[1:00:04] batt3ryac1d: @iskall85 An elixir can be fun when you don't have a good glorp source
[1:00:05] damnsecci: good timezones and bbbbye o/
[1:00:07] sabrina1202r: iskallMan
[1:00:09] Ramzi65ok: i've def ran into situations where 2 friends complete and 1 has to bail
[1:00:10] feroxinator: Hi i dont realy chat but wanted to say smth. I feel like a lot of the last streams iskall is just defending himself/the game against people who just dont like aspects of the game. I feel like iskall shouldnt have to do this always. people forget that the game is in open alfa or not finished. its like they think that iskall and his team dont think over these things before they implement things. that was my rant :) love everything and also i see the value of these conversations ofc.
[1:00:11] Ice1Berrgg: 5
[1:00:12] Ice1Berrgg: yes
[1:00:15] bamboozled_today: mic hmmmmmmmm
[1:00:16] matjea: i enjoyed the first ones, but i don't enjoy running around for 11 monoliths
[1:00:18] BigBlueHawk87: 5
[1:00:18] tgrs126: 93 vaults 39 completed for me... you are don't enjoy them because you are so good at the game..
[1:00:18] chad_masters: As someone that juggles games like plates in a circus act and as someone that only has a small amount of time to dedicate to each individual one. I would still rather play a tougher version of the game rather than choose the lower difficulty. I can see where tangofrags is coming from saying the game is going in an easier direction.
[1:00:19] Ice1Berrgg: 5 w/o fruit or hunter
[1:00:30] VogelVrouw: @11doggie11 you could just change the difficulty with the commands
[1:00:33] lenjenben: @damnsecci thanks for keeping the tag up, it’s been great iskCOOL iskSkull85
[1:00:37] Eracyhw: I don't like scavanger due to not being able to complete because of my play style.
[1:00:37] Aylabar: I feel like scav is just the objectve for people that want more of a challenge and you need that in every game bc you have 3 objectives that are not that hard
[1:00:41] kinghingle: u dont need to hear it sir,
[1:00:41] floppypidgen: been loving all this vh content! Is vh opensource? I'd love to contribute and try to fix bugs!
[1:00:42] Sharust: 5/5
[1:00:43] jeaninius: monolith vaults were my least favorite to watch too. the braziers are a great improvement
[1:00:44] mattymatix: hi isgall
[1:00:50] zacowen1936: Hi
[1:00:51] Ice1Berrgg: me when someone tells the game owner what they can and cant say about their own game 💀
[1:00:53] Bestywolf1122: @chad_masters I am in the same spot and I fully agree
[1:00:55] Darkwytchcraft: I came here to find out some information, I got some.  That's all I was after. I'm an OLD WOMAN and I just want to understand the game and how it works.
[1:00:55] dayle1989: Could you have profe
[1:00:57] haze_deadline: @feroxinator well said!
[1:01:06] Darkstar159: There are casual gamers and sweaty gamers. There are casual games and there are sweaty games. VH is working HARD to balance for both and imo doing a great job
[1:01:08] lynx235: yeah the coop scavenger especially early scavenger runs if done with coop are achievable quite easily
[1:01:09] clairebearstare: @Darkwytchcraft lol SAME
[1:01:15] nazzatazer: i kinda want iskall to get a hard scav so we see how he deals with it
[1:01:17] timmolaa: I hate getting poisoned potato in alter lol
[1:01:17] Darkstar159: you can't expect VH to be candy crush
[1:01:18] mattertec: What do you think about completion rate across different difficulties iskall?
[1:01:21] esinadmoonshadow: SAME Dark
[1:01:22] LeoTheLeopardNZ: Wait do people really think you don't actively play and test the different parts of the game you are making?
[1:01:25] hufflfump: I FINALLY MADE AN ISKALL STREAM!!!
[1:01:25] SirBobtheCasual: I don't use hunter and still complete some scavs
[1:01:26] Katsanity_: do u not have the fan to make poisonous potatoes?
[1:01:34] sagittarius_greenbow: have an exam tomorrow gtg. Goodnight Iskall and Dylan
[1:01:35] Ice1Berrgg: @LeoTheLeopardNZ Its redditors
[1:01:35] Verrandath: exactly
[1:01:37] Ice1Berrgg: what do you think
[1:01:41] dayle1989: Could you have proficiency levels for each vault type that scales the difficulty, you get points for each you complete
[1:01:42] Ice1Berrgg: they dont do anything
[1:01:43] 0of1est: Screw all this discussion, hardest objective is getting poisonous potatoes
[1:01:44] toasty_ryebread: can you not use the blue fire and fan to get poisonous potatoes?
[1:01:45] Ramzi65ok: can you get scavs at level 10?
[1:01:46] Mnecraftenjoyer: @iskall85 quick reminder are  you gonna make cake vault uncraftable? if so i personnaly do not think u should nerf them because they become much more difficult / rarer to get so it balances it out but what your take?
[1:01:46] kinghingle: well u can choose to increase ur chance of a scav win with hunter or spend points else where can gain subsequent power elsewhere, its choice
[1:01:49] andyketogymi: yayVaultHunters
[1:01:51] P3pp3rF1y: before you have chest breaker there are no scavs
[1:01:59] VogelVrouw: hahshs
[1:02:02] unknownrek: But the question is. What alternative is there to hunter? I think the game lacks some variety in some ways like that. But it's awkward to find something that will serve the same purpose
[1:02:02] thebaintrain69: what happened to bosses that their used to be in vaults?
[1:02:04] ShelobsLair_: @andyketogymi o/
[1:02:05] Xarallon: there's create and blue fire
[1:02:10] lynx235: do you not t hold down for bonemeal
[1:02:10] matjea: CAKE
[1:02:10] andyketogymi: @ShelobsLair_ Hallo!
[1:02:10] TAxels: the wings is the only RNG advantage you're using all the others are available
[1:02:11] bestbla: what about mobility trinkets wings frog feather what if u have yet to get one of those
[1:02:12] kinghingle: sure, i have no opinion on it atm
[1:02:13] Pwnater267: you should use EVERY advantage/opportunity the game give you to see if it's too hard, rather than remove until too hard for yourself / current setup
[1:02:14] Darkwytchcraft: I have as yet to play a CAKE vault :(
[1:02:14] andyketogymi: CAKE
[1:02:14] Chandler86_: Yep
[1:02:15] nazzatazer: iskall has soo many knowledge stars, maybe time to invest in vault altar automation...
[1:02:16] elraj85: Would you consider making some slower moving videos talking more about what gear you recomend and how to set up your pouches and stuff to give some advice to players that need more input? Continue the good work Iskall. I love the game. Greetings from Norway Cheer100
[1:02:17] Ice1Berrgg: for iskall the hardest modifier would be no monitor
[1:02:17] Ginjajewfro: Iskall, wanna see something cool? Map right-click to spacebar then try bonemealing your crops
[1:02:19] bigtowza: dont forget u have create for potatoes
[1:02:20] peppa_j: why not haunting potato?
[1:02:20] speed0sound7665: you can haunt potatos with create to get poisonous potates
[1:02:23] zebrainap: Sadge
[1:02:23] gwaneer: The dang poisonous potatoes!
[1:02:23] tgrs126: Time to craft 1000 cake seals for storage!
[1:02:26] tonTeufel: @P3pp3rF1y can you not seal a lvl 0 vault with a scav seal? It'd be a dumb thing to do but I think it's possible
[1:02:26] thevoidknight430: are old seals getting deleted
[1:02:26] Nicola_002: YAYYY
[1:02:27] Attackeight: ARE YOU CHANGING CAKE VAULTS!?
[1:02:28] TheRedBrain: yes
[1:02:29] tre_2018: WutFace WutFace WutFace
[1:02:30] alexmurrin: I think uncraftavle cake vault makes sense
[1:02:30] lalorsa1: didn´t you use the create stuff to poison potatoes?
[1:02:30] TheRedBrain: nice
[1:02:31] seraphinx_iii: Will the cake seal I purchased from black market unusable?
[1:02:32] Darkwytchcraft: will they be easy enough to find somewhere? lol
[1:02:33] ramnite_tv: @unknownrek Goggles trinket, sight javelin to some extent
[1:02:34] Sicketjr: craft all your cake deals now peeps
[1:02:35] Darkstar159: I really thought cake seals were uncraftable already LUL
[1:02:36] rad_ju: time to craft them
[1:02:37] Nightbot: For everything Vault Hunters, check out the website! https://vaulthunters.gg/
[1:02:37] lynx235: sad but fair
[1:02:38] Lutzio: I like the idea of not being craftable. I want them to retain the power I've seen in your recent streams
[1:02:38] BingusMcGuffin: im glad they will be uncraftasble
[1:02:40] sabrina1202r: wait you are changing cake vaults
[1:02:46] Darkwytchcraft: I think I used to get them on the black market
[1:02:47] shaydeejay: good change imo, becomes more of  a treat
[1:02:49] angrrrrydad: time to make 100 cake seals
[1:02:52] redstonedad: Does that mean the ones I already have won't work???
[1:02:53] dingllleberry: I’ve bought 2 cake seals in black market recently
[1:02:57] littlepepperbutt: I'm so okay with that
[1:02:58] romdow: Issue with them being uncraftable for me is that i will never run them because i'll always be saving the seals i find for later, later, later...
[1:03:04] kibaz_x: That's for the better, I see them already a lot on black market
[1:03:06] littlepepperbutt: Yeah there ya go
[1:03:07] Nightbot: To add your alias to VHSMP-- Go to the official VH Discord https://discord.gg/vaulthunters  & add in the alias-request channel found in the VHSMP Category.  shorturl.at/ekxLX
[1:03:08] unknownrek: @unknownrek That's just worse hunter. That's what i mean, variety, not really the same but different
[1:03:09] Sicketjr: I think it makes sense
[1:03:11] Ice1Berrgg: @speed0sound7665 now where on the world are you going to find a ghost who wakes up and goes "I want to haunt a potato today"
[1:03:12] bestbla: time to stack them
[1:03:14] BingusMcGuffin: @shaydeejay lol like a cake would be
[1:03:15] Karlamaris: hola
[1:03:15] SirBobtheCasual: Iskall advising CHEESE!?
[1:03:20] Lutzio: Yeah they look great!
[1:03:21] DanimalsBetch: so it'll just be random if you get one?
[1:03:25] matjea: i crafted 5 to make a before after when the update drops
[1:03:25] LeoTheLeopardNZ: What's the method of getting Cakes now?
[1:03:26] littlepepperbutt: So excited!!!
[1:03:26] Ramzi65ok: I can't wait to play with them, consistent cake pedistals makes it feel like an auto completed vault so they shouldn't be crafted
[1:03:28] Nightbot: Watch iskall85’s VOD’s at https://youtube.com/@vodskall85
[1:03:29] TheChelzorz: @iskall85 slightly off topic: would you consider adding music for inside the vaults? The minecraft music doesn't really fit with the vibes, just wondering if it's something on the list
[1:03:36] mattertec: @romdow Sounds like you just need to spend your resources instead of hoarding them dolphinBongo
[1:03:38] Teapout: making them craftable is a good idea, like chaos catalysts, its a great feeling finding them in quests/bounty table
[1:03:39] Ramzi65ok: make treasure rooms great again
[1:03:42] Sicketjr: omega pog per seal Nodders
[1:03:42] el3l_: I'm good with that
[1:03:43] Chandler86_: Good idea
[1:03:47] shaydeejay: love that
[1:03:48] enyo81: i dont use seal i just get what i get am happy just to get out alive objective are just a bonus if i can get it done
[1:03:49] matjea: OMEGA POG to make a cake seal ?
[1:03:50] rytional: champions?
[1:03:51] stephaniebutton23: completion crates?
[1:03:51] kibaz_x: Noice
[1:03:52] TAxels: that sounds fair and fun
[1:03:53] Darkwytchcraft: when is the update coming btw
[1:03:55] sattosttv: that is a good tradeoff
[1:03:55] Ice1Berrgg: 💀
[1:03:55] Nightbot: Support the devs & the pack.  https://www.patreon.com/VaultHunters
[1:03:58] sabrina1202r: I totally agree. When you make a thing rare you see it as a valuable and makes it exciting
[1:03:58] Pwnater267: I like not being able to craft cake seals but it is a little confusing that only one type of seal is not craftable
[1:03:58] jessmay121_: I agree
[1:04:04] Ramzi65ok: the treasure scroll is an amazing goal
[1:04:05] batt3ryac1d: I was supposed to be doing something before I got distracted watching Iskall now I forget what it was.
[1:04:06] Nightbot: Everything in VH 1.18 is very under development & things might change.. Just Trust the Process-- iskall & Devs
[1:04:06] Darkstar159: @romdow VH is one of the few games which actually works well against that mentality. Whatever you use up will give more value in the long run than saving up
[1:04:08] Lutzio: Absolutely
[1:04:12] peppa_j: fair
[1:04:13] mixedmesss: always listen to etho
[1:04:14] CoconutTiim: chase items are amazing
[1:04:17] PadWar354: PadWar354 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 41 months! Love the work Iskall and VH Team. cannot wait to jam out to the new update!
[1:04:22] mrsupersmore: I really like this idea cause I don’t craft seals much so it gives me more incentive to do it when I find one
[1:04:22] Aylabar: I like the decision makes them more like chaos a fun op vault you can run for a change
[1:04:24] kinghingle: very fair, be ur own boss
[1:04:30] vaalwater: Well had to hop on here since my wife is watching.
[1:04:32] Ice1Berrgg: most rare items in the game for update 13: cake Seals > Treasure Scrolls
[1:04:35] Cloudetix: Are cake seals going to be in the black market?
[1:04:41] lynx235: can you make them slightly more lightly in the black market but cost more
[1:04:42] Xarallon: Etho on chase items with his probably now about 6 treasure chests
[1:04:44] VogelVrouw: like you talked about in an earlier stream, people will get angry if you gibe them power (cake seals ) and then take it away
[1:04:44] Sladious: The best way to play vault hunters is the way that is the most fun for you.
[1:04:48] wilbor79: too much cake only slows you down anyway. :p
[1:04:50] kibaz_x: "Tough" is the only viable answer for them lol
[1:04:50] Verrandath: that is a healthy point of view iskall
[1:04:53] miraculousmultifan: play whatever way is fun for you
[1:04:57] batt3ryac1d: Spawning in stuff in single player is barely cheating tbh it's time saving Chadge
[1:05:09] Ice1Berrgg: some of these redditors probably ate all of the cakes you collect during cake vaults
[1:05:09] sgt_susman: I’m actually so excited to run the new came vaults, feels like a good replacement for the feel of how the bonus + cascade era of chaos crystals was, super loot gaming, but super difficult,
[1:05:10] rad_ju: you still don't have the new bounty auto selection in your version?
[1:05:12] shaydeejay: so true
[1:05:15] Darkwytchcraft: I'll probably make one at least so my daughter and I can enjoy it.
[1:05:16] sattosttv: i've done slightly chesty runs in the past
[1:05:18] shaydeejay: i think keys are boring IMO
[1:05:25] sattosttv: cheaty^
[1:05:32] matjea: had a rabbit foot early in my skyvault, gave them in creative because i didn't want to spend 3 hours for a farm
[1:05:32] spike_p321: Snickers bar
[1:05:34] Darkstar159: @iskall85 can you add black market vendoors? I think it could balance out the heavy gold usage I keep hearing about
[1:05:39] batt3ryac1d: @shaydeejay Keys are fun if you carry like 10 of them on you all the time LUL
[1:05:39] PaodeMistura: its raining in your base man
[1:05:39] Ramzi65ok: I think altars should give xp like before
[1:05:43] shaydeejay: i think cakes would help a lot
[1:05:46] loverearth: I love keys
[1:05:48] chrisw333: Keeps the game always exciting
[1:05:48] melonhunt: why is altar chest is still in completion window?
[1:05:52] Kriskiki89: love keys
[1:05:55] skierbrenn: I love the keys but they are so expensive if you die
[1:05:58] thrall__owen: mmmm steak
[1:05:58] Frog_Annihilator: I have been loving the status/update videos you have been doing. It's fun to listen and read all the comments that people have. Much love to you and all your team!
[1:05:59] Mnecraftenjoyer: @iskall85 Wait will they not appear in guilded/ornate/living chests?I really do think u should allow them to spawn in those chests but make them extremely rare???
[1:06:04] Ccbeemee: I LOVE treasure doors! they're fun and making keys is part of the chase, and I like the chase
[1:06:05] microwavebruhh0: imo i don’t mind the changes i just like the game
[1:06:06] matadoo_: once i put jewels in my junk table, gilded were much more enjoyable chests
[1:06:10] shaydeejay: personally a great choice
[1:06:10] Ice1Berrgg: can we talk about colorblindness and the door colors being replaced by unique symbols @iskall85
[1:06:10] Kasszi_: i think its a good idea
[1:06:10] Ramzi65ok: it needs to be
[1:06:11] mejeree: I like the idea of making cake seals obtainable similar to chaos catalysts
[1:06:13] kinghingle: i think the statement u made on that is fair honestly, but i also see people being upset about it
[1:06:16] DanimalsBetch: treasure doors are cool. but I get scared to carry more than 1 key bc if i die I won't be able to afford my body. so I hardly ever get the rooms
[1:06:16] littlepepperbutt: There are so many things to chase and have fun with in vault  hunters
[1:06:17] ValueTown: will you remove cake stuff from bounties if the recipe isn't craftable?
[1:06:18] dingllleberry: I love treasure rooms
[1:06:18] Kriskiki89: too many people going to precraft seals
[1:06:19] occathereptil: I love it when I find a key and a door I can open
[1:06:19] mejeree: I think Chaos Catalysts are at a good spot right now
[1:06:20] xGhostAB: game rule for craftable cake seals?
[1:06:21] Colebot17: I'm all for making them uncraftable because it means that they will be more rewarding
[1:06:22] TheChelzorz: I love that cake seals not craftable, finding them will be so exciting
[1:06:23] VogelVrouw: people dont want their toys taken away
[1:06:24] waysidescroll: ITs such a silly thing for people to get mad at
[1:06:25] chrisw333: I think it's the right way to go
[1:06:25] unknownrek: cakes looks very good. I'm down to being a special thing to get. How will they be obtainable?
[1:06:25] Cloudetix: Are treasure doors less likely to spawn after the introduction of dungeons and vendoors?
[1:06:26] bashleyyyyy: They're pretty powerful
[1:06:27] futureimagineer13: More at steak in cake vaults? What does meat have to do with pastry?
[1:06:27] rytional: good for you IskallMAN
[1:06:27] sattosttv: as long as there is a way it get the cake seals then all the better
[1:06:28] etherealonegames: Nah, I think it’s fine with how much they have been buffed.
[1:06:30] Verrandath: push back is life i suppose
[1:06:30] zinou2019: its a good change i agree
[1:06:31] soulstealer0902: It will be interesting to see
[1:06:32] w00kiet0sser: w00kiet0sser subscribed at Tier 2. They've subscribed for 30 months! 
[1:06:33] CoconutTiim: it’s just going to make getting my cake transmog even more satisfying
[1:06:33] Teapout: are you ever going to make special transmogs/plaques for other achievmenets, like completing vaults/bounties/treasure doors etc?
[1:06:34] oliverthegreat93: I don’t blame you, it’s going to be better that way
[1:06:35] tre_2018: you can't please everyone so it is better to be okay that the ledditers exist
[1:06:35] Ice1Berrgg: @xGhostAB This is a good idea
[1:06:36] rad_ju: @xGhostAB you can make script or datapack
[1:06:36] GnariZZar: do it like a toggle optin in the world setting ? isnt that possible?
[1:06:37] DeweyBoys: if you have seals before the update, do they get erase
[1:06:37] ShelobsLair_: @ValueTown This is a good question
[1:06:39] Ramzi65ok: oh true @iskall85 can you remove complete a cake vault from bounties?
[1:06:40] peppa_j: i love the idea of another exciting  purchase
[1:06:41] matjea: if cake vaults are way better, people just want the powercreep
[1:06:42] MottlyMC: Dare we say...trust the process ;P
[1:06:45] littlepepperbutt: iskHeart iskHeart
[1:06:48] PremieressS: I want them craftable but I'm not gonna hate on you for it
[1:06:48] redstonedad: Imo it's good to make them uncraftable like chaos catalysts
[1:06:51] toasty_ryebread: hunter
[1:06:52] Darkwytchcraft: cheat them in bleh, rather craft em early lol
[1:06:52] Ice1Berrgg: listening ears on
[1:06:53] Zach010: As long as you don't scale the rarity of chaos/cakes based on etho because he's just too omega.
[1:06:54] HoY_82: I agree with you 110%. uncraftable. its just too powerful and before you do this update cake is just a challenge rather than useful.
[1:06:54] LeoTheLeopardNZ: If the man making the game says cake seals shouldn't be crafted, I trust him
[1:06:55] alenaaa_: I love it, I don't craft them now, makes me excited when i see it in the black market. Makes it feel like it's something special
[1:06:56] whocares_15: would you ever make a mystery seal that you can roll? @iskall85
[1:06:57] Ice1Berrgg: Tru
[1:06:59] Ice1Berrgg: yep
[1:06:59] rytional: boom
[1:07:00] Attackeight: tru
[1:07:00] kibaz_x: I like iskall putting his foot down
[1:07:01] iPassiive: chills
[1:07:01] dingllleberry: cant wait for this update <3
[1:07:02] toasty_ryebread: respec hunter
[1:07:02] batt3ryac1d: @iskall85 time to make a super rare Chakeos vault combining cake and chaos chadd
[1:07:02] microwavebruhh0: yes
[1:07:03] littlepepperbutt: Truuth
[1:07:03] FavChuck: Would making a cake alter similar a gods alter be a thing you would think about? When you complete a cake alter you get a cake seal.
[1:07:03] Darkstar159: I fully agree with uncraftable cake vaults
[1:07:04] Lashings: What about adding cupcakes where if you find 5 it gives you a bonus cake charge.
[1:07:04] thevoidknight430: tell them
[1:07:06] microwavebruhh0: respect
[1:07:06] leinadplp123: press alt f4 for free minecoins
[1:07:06] esinadmoonshadow: true
[1:07:06] VogelVrouw: yes papa
[1:07:07] futureimagineer13: OOoooooo
[1:07:07] Zinoba: okay flexing hryFlex
[1:07:08] Frog_Annihilator: "mic drop"
[1:07:08] sadge_Boris: iskDab
[1:07:08] Colebot17: true
[1:07:08] Lutzio: I want to T_T
[1:07:08] unknownrek: Rude mr iskall. But ture
[1:07:08] Ice1Berrgg: IskallMAN spicy boom on them redditors
[1:07:08] enderaii: Trust the process
[1:07:08] mixedmesss: put them in their place haha
[1:07:10] Verrandath: true true
[1:07:10] chrisw333: Drop the mic
[1:07:10] starbuck7244: True
[1:07:10] wes76544: <3 <3 <3
[1:07:11] hermitcraft6789: true
[1:07:11] lynx235: how likely are they in treasure chests
[1:07:15] microwavebruhh0: absolutely
[1:07:15] bashleyyyyy: iskHeart
[1:07:15] dakewafel: Imagine if chaos catas were crafable
[1:07:15] PrismaticPixieDust: so cake seals will be uncraftable?
[1:07:16] brittany4466: trust the process they know what’s coming and we don’t
[1:07:19] chad_masters: Have you run them with the fixed cascading?
[1:07:19] zinou2019: weird flex
[1:07:19] Nicola_002: word
[1:07:20] k1_setae: important:cake transmogs fixed?!?
[1:07:20] StrangePanthers: Can't wait XD
[1:07:22] Ice1Berrgg: "How to humble redditors by Iskall"
[1:07:23] tgrs126: Way to rub in the salt!...
[1:07:23] moshner: I love this because cakes aren't required either
[1:07:24] TheChelzorz: iskHeart iskHeart iskHeart
[1:07:28] Kasszi_: its probably good for servers too KEKW
[1:07:29] waysidescroll: @ShelobsLair_ No they will be in bounties, back market, treasure rooms, and vendoors
[1:07:30] haze_deadline: I agree with making them uncraftable - but totally just went and made 30 of them because I'm going to want to do a lot of them right away :D
[1:07:32] MellowMen: i put a nice suggestion on how to obtain cake seals in the discord
[1:07:32] DeweyBoys: has newest cake update been dropped?
[1:07:33] Attackeight: u11 u mean?
[1:07:33] PurplePhoenix5: mic!
[1:07:34] lynx235: what if you made a testing version
[1:07:35] rad_ju: this has same energy as this feels good to me and being completely broken
[1:07:37] moshner: it's an extra feature. go for it!
[1:07:37] Diggles11: Scarcity makes it more fun when you do run a cake vault
[1:07:38] manithoro: what about making skavs craftable only so more casual players dont have to play it if they dont want it.
[1:07:38] Nightbot: www.youtube.com/iskall85 | www.twitter.com/iskall85 | https://youtube.com/@vodskall85
[1:07:39] BlueBKDD: I trust the process
[1:07:41] kinghingle: yea the nature of their role has change and so has their availability, i think its entire justified
[1:07:43] PurplePhoenix5: !nomic
[1:07:43] Nightbot: i am chilling and have very little to no mic, voice needs resting :D
[1:07:44] Ramzi65ok: the old archatech vaults were like that 5% chance to encounter
[1:07:44] squarertrout41: !nomic
[1:07:45] elemelonnn: hunter
[1:07:46] TheOnePercentGotMyMain: Idk how possible it is but it could be cool to give everyone a cake or two so they realise why its been made uncraftable
[1:07:48] miraculousmultifan: is it weird to think everyone gets more upset bc the game changes? vh is basically open beta right? its not finalized just yet, things will change
[1:07:51] blossom42069: goodmorning
[1:07:53] ShelobsLair_: gamba?
[1:07:54] luckyboy21: @iskall85 you highlight minority too mutch. And it feels that only negativity is around
[1:07:55] Attackeight: gm gm gm
[1:07:57] ariddesert1: cake vaults are changing???????? Does etho know
[1:07:59] occathereptil: I understand the logics of making the cake seals uncraftable as from what I’ve seen they are really powerful, and I’ve been waiting for the update to run them
[1:08:00] sabrina1202r: like everyone disagreed with mojang when they made enchanted golden apple uncraftable. But now after the change we understand how it made the thing valuable and gets us excited to find them.
[1:08:00] Ccbeemee: too much hand holding in games lately have made gamers soft imo. they complain that games are too hard instead of looking at the game to try to figure out a solution
[1:08:00] xverion_: now cakes look absolutely awesome
[1:08:02] sgt_susman: cakes not being craftable is the best part of the new cake vaults, if you could craft them, unless the recipe was very expensive they would throw off the entire feel of the game, you’d get too much loot and the other objectives would simply be lesser
[1:08:03] gwaneer: watching you run them, the amount of chests you get after so many cakes, its way oveer powered to just be able to craft and run just them
[1:08:07] Attackeight: @xverion_ tru
[1:08:09] phonybologna9: hah diorite in mystery box vibes
[1:08:09] littlepepperbutt: Hell yeah
[1:08:12] Darkstar159: @iskall85 could we add black market venDOORs?
[1:08:13] zebrainap: ez scav
[1:08:15] Lutzio: bad theme D:
[1:08:16] angelfoxruby: Another snow theme?
[1:08:16] Nightbot: Want to host your own Vault Hunters server? Check out https://bisecthosting.com/vaulthunters , use code: "VaultHunters" for a 25% discount on your first month of hosting
[1:08:17] dingllleberry: <3 <3
[1:08:19] benjdaug: what if cake vaults changed to cupcake vaults???
[1:08:21] matjea: Because cake vaults are powerful, people want the powercreep
[1:08:22] peppa_j: bruh, gamba of channel points is a gimmic...we live for this lol
[1:08:22] thevoidknight430: even with the higher scarcity, i will be running so many more cake vaults
[1:08:26] Metalgav: I think Update13 will put every vault objective in a good place. I think Elixir vault will became the dull one.
[1:08:31] Kasszi_:  GAMBA IS UP
[1:08:34] Ice1Berrgg: You will never treasure treasure if it is around every corner
[1:08:36] angrrrrydad: imo all seals should be a reward from a completion crate and not craftable
[1:08:37] Darkwytchcraft: I've been gaming since you were in diapers probably. Don't make assumptions about some of us please and thanks
[1:08:38] tre_2018: Oh free ice!
[1:08:39] kinghingle: yaya
[1:08:41] el3l_: yep
[1:08:41] wizardthewormzard: YES
[1:08:43] thevoidknight430: yea
[1:08:44] mejeree: I think game design has gotten lazy in a lot of ways and relying on people looking things up online rather than creating intuitive ways to learn
[1:08:45] LowKeyChemist: good game
[1:08:45] dakewafel: Yes
[1:08:46] microwavebruhh0: no
[1:08:48] Ramzi65ok: @Metalgav elixer has it's neiche, you can look while not worrying
[1:08:54] valkojam: Yep pretty simple
[1:08:55] lil1taly: I LOVE slay
[1:09:01] Romlekidd: ascencio,j
[1:09:02] batt3ryac1d: man my channel points are brokey I've been stuck on 0 here for like a month
[1:09:04] soulstealer0902: Its difficult isnt it?
[1:09:06] Verrandath: sea of thieves is easy and hard
[1:09:09] el3l_: agree
[1:09:10] drDaesereg: I have reached Ascension 20
[1:09:11] oDtEoDoA: the challenge is doing big numbers to the heart
[1:09:17] wizardthewormzard: also celeste! tons of accessibility and tons of difficulty
[1:09:18] drDaesereg: Damn hard game at A20
[1:09:23] Ccbeemee: not difficult...challenging...LOL
[1:09:25] Ice1Berrgg: like someone is going to complete VH in 1 sitting
[1:09:31] sgt_susman: also it’s not like people were even running cake vaults in u12, now they will, regardless if it’s uncraftable and rare, you will be running more cakes
[1:09:45] peppa_j: non believers gonna get big payout
[1:09:46] Wolfsweb: ah iskall  may want to change title u got mic!
[1:09:48] spike_p321: @iskall85 i have an idea to overhaule puckerangs and i will be making a reddit post. But my idea is making them a tool like the other vault ones with teirs so they can be modded and possibally very late game if you mave 150 mining speed or suntin u can break cheats so that way its a very late game thing. I think they would be cool and you can add things like hamba jewels to them for omega tools and this could be an alternitave to a hammer like an elytra is an eternative to cheastplate
[1:09:48] Darkstar159: I watched hundreds of hours of StS gameplay before buying it myself. I still sucked horribly at it but it doesn't make me dislike the game itself at all. still a 10/10
[1:09:51] Cloudetix: Hot take, Darks souls isn't difficult. *dives for cover*
[1:09:53] rabidities: easy to play hard to master
[1:10:01] littlepepperbutt: Your doing such a great job iskall iskHeart
[1:10:02] Ramzi65ok: minecraft is easy, the most technical skills are water buckets
[1:10:05] Guybrrush: bragging rights
[1:10:07] Knew_It_Owl: I don't like the difficulty of dark souls, but I do like that it doesn't hold your hand and lets you figure things out on your own
[1:10:09] Neon_Shadow_Live: I have a question about trinkets.  Would you ever make i possible to use as many as you want in the overworld with a bag type item?
[1:10:10] VogelVrouw: i havent thought of that perspective
[1:10:11] MaraudingBacon: no it does. the game is just riskier
[1:10:14] gwaneer: @sgt_susman I agree. I only run them, when I get them on lost bounties
[1:10:16] zebrainap: makes it more tedious
[1:10:18] tonTeufel: Minecraft is incredibly inaccessible if it wasn't for the fact that everybody already knows how to start it
[1:10:18] sabrina1202r: just the risk
[1:10:21] Trouss: it make the player play differently
[1:10:23] Darkwytchcraft: makes it more thoughtful
[1:10:25] oliverthegreat93: it just adds the fear, game is the same
[1:10:25] eightspades940: !update
[1:10:25] tonTeufel: the game doesn't guide you at all
[1:10:27] Ramzi65ok: i agree, bring back inventory loss death
[1:10:28] Kasszi_: it makes you feel like there is real risk and its a bit exciting
[1:10:29] Chandler86_: LUL
[1:10:29] tre_2018: What is the point of skyblock?
[1:10:30] Drackst_Gaming: It makes healing harder
[1:10:32] valkojam: Just mitigation of risk
[1:10:35] player3977047: hardcore makes you think before you act when you play
[1:10:37] vaporize_xl: I was completing 95% of vaults so I increased my difficulty and now I feel the game is better
[1:10:37] LowKeyChemist: hardcore gives you a permanent consequence for dying
[1:10:37] Xarallon: hardcore have the same numbers as hard mode
[1:10:37] randqmized: its risk as i know of, hard is same as hardcore in terms of difficulty
[1:10:38] Ccbeemee: I think it's both because it's risk vs reward
[1:10:41] TheAmateurQueen: Very true
[1:10:41] Ice1Berrgg: UHC is the hardest version IMO
[1:10:41] Frog_Annihilator: the "harder" you make any game, the more it will allow someone's skill and abilities in the game to shine more
[1:10:44] ddSqueeze: makes MC more tense
[1:10:46] GnariZZar: !nomic
[1:10:47] Nightbot: i am chilling and have very little to no mic, voice needs resting :D
[1:10:53] sabrina1202r: adds the fear factor that if you die you loose everything
[1:10:54] ahmadhafez21: Just play iskall please
[1:10:54] TAxels: patch 14: zombies throw rotten flesh, blinding the player and rooting them to the floor
[1:10:56] thebeaz2: iskal, you seem a bit down. I know you take this so seriously and we’ve all benefited because you and the team have created a great game so thank you.   Know you are greatly appreciated
[1:10:57] Kasszi_: "little to no mic"
[1:10:59] dingllleberry: true
[1:11:01] Darkstar159: @tonTeufel Lol yeah I remember it was so unintuitive to chop a tree with your fists
[1:11:05] Mnecraftenjoyer: @iskall85  will they not appear in other chests? In my opinion u should allow them to spawn chests but make them extremely rare because if it only spawns in treasure chests wouldnt it be a bit to hard also the value would skyrocket a bit too much like how much will they go for in auction room????
[1:11:06] shadowwolfheck: @Kasszi_ Clueless
[1:11:09] vaalwater: About the scav vaults. They are complete able. Like everything else you gotta practice. Use the tools avaliable to you. Yeah some can be really hard but some are also super easy.   Like elixir vaults, sometimes items don't give any and you have to find the right thing. When I first started everything was difficult but the more I play, the more skill I gain.
[1:11:09] moshner: This episode should be called "Deep Thoughts by Iskall"
[1:11:09] Darkstar159: @thebeaz2 !nomic
[1:11:09] evanx4: hardcore also gives a better since of accomplishment I think since it’s all done in one life
[1:11:11] batt3ryac1d: @Kasszi_ Mods are so toxic Kappa
[1:11:14] jn_mk: it is harder  because you can actually lose in it
[1:11:15] ddSqueeze: his stream
[1:11:16] tre_2018: take the ice? lol
[1:11:17] rad_ju: this is peak vault hunters gameplay
[1:11:18] littlepepperbutt: I don't even wanna lose my inventory. I can't handle losing the world
[1:11:20] kinghingle: LUL owned chatter
[1:11:20] secondfifth: "no mic stream" lol
[1:11:20] eightspades940: any update on the update?
[1:11:20] Xarallon: I love devSkall
[1:11:23] Kasszi_: @Kasszi_ he gets what he gives!
[1:11:24] Poghorn2: Lol "no mic" "I'm here to chat"
[1:11:25] clairebearstare: as a low-skill player, i embrace the freedom of cheating whenever i want. it's great. can't afford to buy my body back? yes i can. it's a game that's very easy to customize to my skill level
[1:11:26] VogelVrouw: here to chat.... in a no mic stream
[1:11:26] TaliZero: Please just do exactly what you want @iskall85 moon2SMUG
[1:11:28] oliverthegreat93: get ‘em iskall
[1:11:28] death_phenix: why don’t u do many challenge rooms as much just wondering
[1:11:29] Ramzi65ok: just uncut vod would be nice
[1:11:29] pixel_maker95: Hello
[1:11:29] Verrandath: we love chatting with iskall
[1:11:30] Ice1Berrgg: Podskall 85
[1:11:31] italopussi: 40 cakes should be ideal? Isn't too much to an average gamer?
[1:11:33] goldfish_paradise: I think hardcore just gives a purpose to vanilla Minecraft
[1:11:36] skierbrenn: i love your honesty! its so nice to see!
[1:11:38] whatitiz9: Cakes shouldn't be craftable, it makes finding them so exciting! Like chaos
[1:11:39] twolfen2009: Rehhhhee
[1:11:39] TheAmateurQueen: I love these talking sessions. Helps to see more "behind the curtain"
[1:11:47] xxxqaz124: How is wutax?
[1:11:48] Lutzio: Ppl is gonna get bonkd
[1:11:49] NGw7_: Ur have logical thinking Iskall as do I and I like it. But u talk too much and my head is starting to hurt 😂
[1:11:49] LeoTheLeopardNZ: Minecraft in Hardcore is just Minecraft in Hard difficulty but you can die permanently
[1:11:50] jmommers98: @damnsecci Maybe add a disclaimer that he won't talk so much LUL
[1:11:53] stephaniebutton23: is it 40 cakes is the aimed average even for people playing on easy?
[1:11:54] kibaz_x: Is wutax feeling better?
[1:11:54] Ice1Berrgg: @italopussi d i f f i c u l t i e s
[1:11:55] StrangePanthers: Glad he's feeling better
[1:11:56] Kasszi_: Classic Wutax
[1:11:59] littlepepperbutt: Yayy!
[1:12:01] 20egemen04: iskall running around in circles is making me dizy
[1:12:01] eliovertime: How do you plan on changing Relics in the future? Will there be any other way you can extend time in the vault other than Vault Fruits?
[1:12:05] Teapout: thoughts on making special transmogs/plaques for other achievements, like completing vaults/bounties/treasure doors etc? would be cool to have constant trophies to work on building up
[1:12:06] suspenders92: Wutax just be busy with ze bugs
[1:12:06] Ccbeemee: will update 13 include more quests?
[1:12:08] sgt_susman: @gwaneer yeah lmao it’s like, if people get mad they are uncraftable it’s like getting mad at losing something you didn’t even use, understandable for the peeps who actually enjoyed and ran the u12 cakes but they don’t have to update
[1:12:09] NerdMomOfBoys: I've played Minecraft since it began, but have also gotten bored with it. What you're building is amazing. I am 45 and addicted. Thank you for all the hard work you and your team have put into Vault Hunters.
[1:12:14] Darkstar159: 8 wishbones seems tough
[1:12:15] littlepepperbutt: Letttsss goooo
[1:12:16] zebrainap: very easy scav imo
[1:12:17] Ice1Berrgg: Iskavenger
[1:12:21] spike_p321: Venturing deep into thoughts and vaults

[1:12:27] nanatsunotaizai000: Iskall I've been having issue with the dungeon... Sometimes there is a block on the UN mineable area near the door... Do uk anything about it??
[1:12:30] angrrrrydad: hellfire still awol?
[1:12:33] futureimagineer13: watching a "no mic strem" Iskall "I'm here to chat. if you don't like that, go watch someone else"
[1:12:35] rachs224: Good things come to those who wait
[1:12:37] symonsters: nerf your movement by not using wings trinket
[1:12:40] RobUrHood: I voted no, not because i think he loses, but it was like 92% yes
[1:12:51] mattertec: @RobUrHood Exactly LUL
[1:12:55] tre_2018: @RobUrHood Same. I want bointers
[1:12:56] Lashings: You know what is kind of crazy about vanilla minecraft. It is basically the only full loot game that people find acceptable to be full loot
[1:13:02] HighlyRatedYT: does item rarity and quantity effect scav items?
[1:13:11] antegravity: @HighlyRatedYT nope
[1:13:11] mattertec: @HighlyRatedYT I don't believe it does
[1:13:12] waysidescroll: @HighlyRatedYT No it does not
[1:13:14] Darkstar159: @Lashings what do you mean by full loot game?
[1:13:28] babyinastr8jacket: This theme is unusually common today
[1:13:29] vaalwater: Paper is free? That's always my hardest for some reason. I get omega items more often XD
[1:13:30] grady6l38: iskall taunt does not work on the green bar mobs like snappinf turtles :(
[1:13:32] matjea: do you think you'll unspeck vein miner ?
[1:13:38] Ccbeemee: @iskall85 would it be possible to make the icons of where to find the scav items a bit bigger? I'm old and have to strain to see what those little pics are :D
[1:13:41] lil1taly: zombie arm seems difficult, the rest seems not too bad
[1:13:47] soulstealer0902: Could we perhaps have an option for slower longer vaults @iskall85
[1:13:54] Lashings: @Lashings I mean full loot drops on death
[1:13:58] lil1taly: classic creeper eye before
[1:14:04] Darkstar159: @Ccbeemee +1
[1:14:05] loading0110: skill
[1:14:05] rabidities: it is all three
[1:14:06] VogelVrouw: thats just having eyes
[1:14:09] antegravity: Creeper eye?????
[1:14:12] Kasszi_: i still miss having wooden rooms
[1:14:12] kablaq: knowledge of the POI location, skill to see what spawned
[1:14:15] qerutar: all of the above
[1:14:15] Verrandath: all of the above kinda
[1:14:20] TAxels: Knowledge allows for higher skill expression to overcome RNG
[1:14:20] Ramzi65ok: room knowlage is def something
[1:14:20] londonb2008: Ok
[1:14:21] SebastiaanO: i have trouble playing MC because it's so easy and has been getting easier every update, i like being challenged and have pretty much stopped playing games because the type of games i enjoyed are now no longer a challenge.
[1:14:25] izeplaysGames: sounds good for "no mic" Kappa
[1:14:28] dingllleberry: obviously
[1:14:31] Thriler98: @iskall85 knowlege is a skill to know your stuff
[1:14:31] freshy21t: to me knowledge of a game is a skill
[1:14:32] thevoidknight430: rng is where all the emotions are at with scav, thats the issue
[1:14:32] Roxas_Strife626: I feel like Scav is a lil bit of everything
[1:14:34] ratsxed: its knowledge that you reconized the living chest.. skill that you made it through that hole in that shot of time
[1:14:35] tre_2018: IF you joined late, Iskall is doing a lot of talking for someone with [no mic!] in his title lol
[1:14:40] rad_ju: I think knowledge in subset of skill
[1:14:42] Xarallon: Luck is not opposite to skill. I also think knowledge and skill are different
[1:14:42] niitrolol: niitrolol subscribed at Tier 2. They've subscribed for 6 months! 
[1:14:43] valkojam: Practice makes progress helps a lot with scav.
[1:14:43] wizardthewormzard: its not stupid, its nice
[1:14:44] Ramzi65ok: shout out to the one person in chat
[1:14:45] spike_p321: Good eyesight
[1:14:45] Zach010: I think having item rarity/quantity effect scav items (even if it's less strong) would be a great way to give players a choice while not making the objective easier
[1:14:46] Colebot17: It is definitely helpful
[1:14:48] lil1taly: its not fair to say scav is rng, because everyhing has some rng to an extent
[1:14:50] JustARegularRhino: *no mic* has mic
[1:14:51] batt3ryac1d: The thing with RNG is you get enough rolls you get what you need. SO HAUL CHEEKS and win baby.
[1:14:51] StrangePanthers: It is helpful
[1:14:52] Balen13: if you don't know how it works then it would appear to be all rng
[1:14:53] bashleyyyyy: I enjoy hearing your thought process
[1:14:56] shadowwolfheck: see my problem with/the reason I don't like scavs is because usually I need to focus certain chests and I don't like doing that lol I like looting everything and clearing out each room before moving on even if its not optimal
[1:14:58] apepaconda: Being open to the mindset helps us 100% its appreciated
[1:15:00] mattertec: Definitely helpful to hear the thought process and how it differs from my own watching the scav
[1:15:00] lazypandaman: we love to see inside of iskalls brain
[1:15:06] spike_p321: Not being coulor blind is what i would call it
[1:15:18] mefallit: 64 raiders from mefallit have joined! 
[1:15:21] Jackkabuki: Scavs are fun. Maybe add an expertise that decreases the maximum objectives you can get. Like in scavs it subtracts something.
[1:15:22] mefallit: mef raid!  mefall1Getmefd   Bringing over lots of love GET MEF'D  mefall1Getmefd
[1:15:23] Tifferz898: Iskall!!! Yay!!!!!
[1:15:24] EladJenkins: #Get Mef'd! RAID  TombRaid    TombRaid
[1:15:25] Ramzi65ok: @shadowwolfheck it's definatly meant to shift your play style, making each vault not mundane
[1:15:28] futureimagineer13: Hallo mef!
[1:15:29] bashleyyyyy: iskHeart iskHeart iskHeart
[1:15:30] RobUrHood: Well, I've noticed a lot of people like to kill every single mob and loot every single chest, especially when watching other hermits
[1:15:30] NGw7_: Well, Scav is a complete RNG but if ur good at the game and have enough knowledge, the RNG is not that big of a problem
[1:15:31] Ccbeemee: maybe you should make "How To ..." videos? eg: How to do Scav Vaults
[1:15:34] The_Experience_Network: mef raid! mefall1Getmefd Bringing over lots of love GET MEF'D mefall1Getmefd
[1:15:34] occathereptil: honestly I think the transparency is helping me understand scavs a bit more and thinking of ways I can improve my own runs
[1:15:35] sabrina1202r: it's definitely helpful. I am fairly new so I have no idea with most parts but still watching becoz it's super fun
[1:15:35] lazypandaman: hye @mefallit
[1:15:37] kot7k: hydrovoid here would help ngl
[1:15:38] Tifferz898: <3 tiffer10Face tiffer10LOVE tiffer10Face tiffer10LOVE tiffer10Face tiffer10LOVE tiffer10Face tiffer10LOVE tiffer10Face
[1:15:39] LeoTheLeopardNZ: Hearing a thought process is great because it helps you prep your own vaults later
[1:15:39] TheRedBrain: it's quite helpful for sure, but it's also always enjoyable to watch an expert at work
[1:15:40] mejeree: I absolutely hate playing the frozen theme vaults
[1:15:41] mentosdoes: how can u tell it’s an ore room just by entering it?
[1:15:47] dingllleberry: putting hydrovioid is very helpful
[1:15:53] xxxqaz124: 2 wishbones.
[1:15:55] Poe_thirteen: mef raid!  mefall1Getmefd Bringing over lots of love GET MEF'D mefall1Getmefd

[1:16:10] Nightbot: i am chilling and have very little to no mic, voice needs resting :D
[1:16:12] VogelVrouw: @mentosdoes he just knows the shapes and alyout of the rooms
[1:16:19] rad_ju: @mentosdoes just remember the layout, there are only 3 or 4 ore rooms
[1:16:27] HC_Shako: HC_Shako subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 77 months! Hey dude. You are doing great with vault hunters  I am enjoying all your videos and love that you are always working to make improvements and not settling. Love ya dude.
[1:16:28] Ramzi65ok: I feel like coin piles don't get enough love from atributes like item rariety and quantity
[1:16:37] mattertec: @RobUrHood Very true. A lot of the hermits also tend to be overly cautious which tends to result in lower loot quantities - but that might just be my perspective
[1:16:39] sabrina1202r: welcome raiders
[1:16:40] mefallit: iskHA iskLL iskO
[1:16:41] batt3ryac1d: @VogelVrouw It doesn't take long to memorize ore rooms they're pretty distinct and there's only like 3 types.
[1:16:41] thevoidknight430: the water is a downside to hammer
[1:16:47] bashleyyyyy: iskHeart iskHeart iskHeart
[1:16:52] dingllleberry: hallo
[1:16:52] k4t3rt0t: what does PY stand for?
[1:16:53] littlepepperbutt: iskHeart iskHeart iskHeart
[1:16:55] braydenpiag: Ooh
[1:16:57] braydenpiag: a VenDOOR
[1:16:58] futureimagineer13: @mefallit welcome to the most mic'd "no mic" strem ever
[1:16:58] Ccbeemee: who do you think is the best VH player?
[1:17:00] thembat: thembat subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 4 months! <3
[1:17:03] batt3ryac1d: Did he just admit Barry is better Kappa
[1:17:08] braydenpiag: Ignoring the VenDoor D:
[1:17:08] MarkDatter: @k4t3rt0t you mean like POI? its 'point of interest'
[1:17:09] Poe_thirteen: Cheer100 Cheer100 Cheer100 Cheer100 Cheer100 mef raid!  mefall1Getmefd Bringing over lots of love GET MEF'D mefall1Getmefd
[1:17:10] tomatoasted: what about adding Ore dungeons?
[1:17:10] mefallit: @futureimagineer13 its fine
[1:17:11] Cloudetix: Barry godmode player
[1:17:12] melonhunt: @k4t3rt0t its POI, point of interest, where the chest are
[1:17:17] LukeNeverShaves: Going fortune is the downside not the hammer itself.
[1:17:20] moshner: I love the variety of mobs that you've put into the game. It's amazing
[1:17:25] rythmyr: does hydrovoid kill the water from broken ice? or only after its in water form?
[1:17:33] zebrainap: not good enough to do pacifist is kapp
[1:17:40] Drackst_Gaming: Did he miss the dungeon?
[1:17:53] rad_ju: why cdr and not haste? haste would be better at lower values and you wouldn't need to hard cap it
[1:17:54] RobUrHood: @mattertec I don't want to name names, but i saw one person get a trapped chest, then spend like 2 minutes looking for a stuck wild mob. like, ????
[1:17:55] futureimagineer13: @mefallit not saying I have a problem with it. always great to hear Iskall's voice
[1:17:57] idontgiveabug: aren’t you normally playing in quak pro ?
[1:18:02] braydenpiag: is that another VenDOOR
[1:18:02] Zinoba: every time he says mana mana-gement i have to think of the muppets
[1:18:04] motku: !poi
[1:18:04] Nightbot: PoI are points of interest. Places where you can get loot and fight mobs.
[1:18:05] braydenpiag: How common are vendoor rooms?
[1:18:09] wizardthewormzard: I love hearing your thoughts on the rooms!
[1:18:14] peppa_j: poi dps aoe joint command
[1:18:17] Ccbeemee: so this is a dumb question, but are the Hermits playing on a different version of VH than what's on VH3?
[1:18:17] StrangePanthers: Oooh
[1:18:26] Stormtalon42: Cheer500 I'm not good enough to be full pacifist -- but with heavy thorns and retriibution mana shield I can be passive-aggressivist
[1:18:27] zebrainap: is that also in nether/void?
[1:18:27] tre_2018: *notes that down*
[1:18:29] hokey0416: hey iskall! this is the first stream ive been able to catch in a while, seeing as time zones and stuff. seeing as i normally catch them as vods, i was wondering if watching the vods on twitch or watching just the runs on vodskall supports you more than the other?
[1:18:29] mentosdoes: how can u tell layouts of rooms
[1:18:35] braydenpiag: lol its like an avalanche of zombies
[1:18:36] RobUrHood: @Ccbeemee they are playing the upcoming update
[1:18:36] Kasszi_: when poi already exists KEKW
[1:18:36] Sladious: That definitely changes my perspective of ore POIs
[1:18:56] CeleiteStreams: @Ccbeemee There's an update coming out soon, but it's already on the server. So yes.
[1:19:13] braydenpiag: another vendoor?? are these a 1 each room thing?
[1:19:18] braydenpiag: PAGGING
[1:19:39] wizardthewormzard: I like tutorialskall
[1:19:40] Ccbeemee: @Ccbeemee okay, but like I don't have dungeon doors in my game. I have the key doors, but not the other ones.
[1:19:41] tre_2018: Tutorialskall
[1:19:42] mefallit: iskall tutorial dude
[1:19:44] unknownrek: wait you aren't my tutorial guy?
[1:19:47] Mnecraftenjoyer: sounds good
[1:19:49] futureimagineer13: @braydenpiag each common room if I remember correctly
[1:19:49] Roxas_Strife626: Tutoriskall
[1:19:50] strandberggg: ur bad at resting it
[1:19:53] Chandler86_: It's very helpful
[1:19:53] melonhunt: u sound chill, finee
[1:19:55] Jehosaphat697: the vault hunters survival guide
[1:19:57] tre_2018: Hmm resting it real good XD
[1:19:57] NGw7_: You sound normal, dont overthink it
[1:19:59] JD_Sweets: played this theme earlier today and  had three bows spawn on me when i stone fell to a floor. My lvl 17 vaulter never stood a chance lol
[1:20:00] Ice1Berrgg: What is the challenging living room/?
[1:20:00] Xarallon: you might do, but you are giving examples of skill and knowledge
[1:20:01] batt3ryac1d: "resting" Kappa
[1:20:02] littlepepperbutt: You sound normal!
[1:20:02] mattertec: Am I just blanking on what the living  challenge room is? I feel like there isn't one
[1:20:03] shulls4: @iskall85 one tip that really helped me with ore rooms is that ore rooms have now water
[1:20:03] Thriler98: u sound normal
[1:20:04] Ccbeemee: @Ccbeemee okay, gotcha
[1:20:06] Ccbeemee: thanks
[1:20:07] braydenpiag: @braydenpiag PogU huge
[1:20:07] Kasszi_: you're fine sir
[1:20:07] secondfifth: you sound chill. that said i don't know if you're resting your voice exactly
[1:20:07] nottheyoko: !nomic
[1:20:07] TorqueSquirrel: You sound tired
[1:20:07] Nightbot: i am chilling and have very little to no mic, voice needs resting :D
[1:20:08] MaraudingBacon: @Ccbeemee they have a level requiremnt. it might be you are not the right level to see them
[1:20:08] lil1taly: is there mushroom on that timer to explore for challange rooms tho
[1:20:09] MarkDatter: voice sounds good, more chill than usual but that's not an issue
[1:20:10] rachs224: Gotta gooo good night x
[1:20:10] Ramzi65ok: silk touch makes you keep the ice
[1:20:12] wizardthewormzard: I think you judge your tone too harshly. you dont sound negative
[1:20:13] apepaconda: You sound good dude,
[1:20:16] zebrainap: berry bushes ReallyMad
[1:20:17] grossly1: I've been hearing mostly positive things
[1:20:22] Zach010: I think it would be nice if you could break down the number of vault completions/survivals/deaths by objective type in the player menu
[1:20:23] CoconutTiim: I hate this theme, sweet berries drive me insane
[1:20:23] darkwolfhunter4: what inspired you to make vault hunters
[1:20:28] Ccbeemee: @Ccbeemee I'm level 58
[1:20:32] Xarallon: chill you say
[1:20:34] batt3ryac1d: Those berry bushes make me so Madge ahah
[1:20:37] TAxels: you sound sad
[1:20:37] oDtEoDoA: Chillskal
[1:20:42] Glitched_Dragon_07: this is good enouth to be a vid
[1:20:43] 0of1est: Happy Wednesday
[1:20:43] mburger34: Such a hard theme iskBumbo
[1:20:45] Poe_thirteen: Iskall's single player served as my tutorial, and what got me interested in VH in the first place almost 2 years ago
[1:20:49] Kasszi_: i think hes just not going to get a new computer until this one just doesn't turn on
[1:20:50] VogelVrouw: yeah theres always people assuming youre angry or depressed
[1:20:52] loufo_21: Whats the swords transmog?
[1:20:55] tre_2018: I'm often used to Iskall's voice in 2x speed
[1:21:01] izeplaysGames: chillskall
[1:21:04] Darkstar159: @tre_2018 same lol
[1:21:13] Verrandath: also knowing how to manage the clutter from the hammer and dealing with it is skill\knowledge
[1:21:18] romdow: i dont like armour
[1:21:20] peppa_j: @tre_2018 lol, gotta get through the content
[1:21:23] rytional: 100% agree
[1:21:25] Zinoba: yeah i asked the same
[1:21:27] melonhunt: yeah, i get u, same with chest breakers
[1:21:28] littlepepperbutt: It doesn't make sense!
[1:21:29] Treity: No abilities, no armor, no tools, lets go
[1:21:29] kinghingle: cave dewller vaults - no technology or skills
[1:21:31] Poe_thirteen: @kasszi_ it's been limping along since before season 3 launched, so you're probably right
[1:21:37] Mnecraftenjoyer: @tre_2018 fr lol
[1:21:40] wizardthewormzard: yeah
[1:21:42] thrall__owen: Good night Iskallman and gnight Dylan
[1:21:50] Pwnater267: don't interact with the idea at all, it's in the game, it's a great feature, just enjoy and optimize
[1:21:54] VogelVrouw: i really dont think hammers are forced, they make it easier for me but probably not for everyone
[1:21:59] Gandai_Gaming: LATE MEF RAID mef raid!  mefall1Getmefd   Bringing over lots of love GET MEF'D  mefall1Getmefd
[1:22:03] TheImmortaldonut: The only valid arguement I could make against hammers is if it's meant to be a choice as a way to play, but it becomes the only workable meta
[1:22:04] thevoidknight430: i feel like hammer is a playstyle thing. there are lots of ways to best use tools for yourself
[1:22:05] phonybologna9: i think the only reason it was suggested was for a similar reason that you aren't using hunter, testing for players who haven't completely figured out the puzzle yet
[1:22:06] el3l_: right; I care more about being able to try different styles rather than not use things at all
[1:22:06] MrMuxxer: Last time i caught a live stream, i asked for vanilla hermitcraft. ever since that i only seen VH. you guys made an awesome game 👏🏻
[1:22:07] Colebot17: It's up to you as the gamemaker; if people don't like using a hammer but the game requires it, it will be too difficult and they will quit the game
[1:22:08] motku: Players need to resist the desire for immediacy
[1:22:13] antegravity: living or guilded dungeon would be awesome
[1:22:19] Mnecraftenjoyer: @antegravity fr
[1:22:19] kibaz_x: It's like your no heal challenge on skyvaults, heal makes it easier and faster but it's still 100% doable
[1:22:22] moshner: The best way to test the game is to play it. I think just getting update 13 out to 'regular' gamers. That will help you learn a lot more than forcing you to not use certain features of the pack.
[1:22:22] Ramzi65ok: trap disarm has become increasingly relevant and i like that
[1:22:23] Ccbeemee: I know that you like hammers, but I don't think you should push the narrative so strongly. I think everyone needs to find their own path
[1:22:24] Cloudetix: Well isn't the sane argument you are making for hammers aply to relics as well?
[1:22:25] rbdj36: i think you're pretty much locked in one play style if you want to finish scavs efficiently
[1:22:27] Jehosaphat697: if you want to put restrictions on yourself, then play at a difficulty that makes it fun.
[1:22:30] grossly1: In the beginning I had a hard time finding the exit to a vault but now I'm all good
[1:22:30] littlepepperbutt: Kek
[1:22:33] MaraudingBacon: Im playing POE right now and that sentence was so bizare to me
[1:22:34] SSlotts: Hey @iskall85 was it a design decision or just a accident but it seems like the overworld doesn't hold much value in VH. An example I can think of is mining gadgets takes vault ingredients but can't be used in the vault. Why not have the recipes there use overworld and nether materials and a bit of vault materials instead of it being mostly/all vault materials?
[1:22:38] futureimagineer13: Iskall, this is your playthrough, of your game, on your channel. Don't focus so much on pleasing snalyd. Just have fun
[1:22:38] batt3ryac1d: @Mnecraftenjoyer LUL If I don't 2x the videos I accidentally fall asleep. It's my fault for watching the videos snuggled up in bed with the cats though
[1:22:41] unknownrek: To be honest i do think you've let some comments get too under your skin, not sure if there's any1 in the team keeping you in check
[1:22:41] runtels: You need a hammer with high mining speed and enough hammer levels to clear an entire room by just walking down the center of the room.
[1:22:41] soulstealer0902: Iskall make sure to try to not make everything meta at once change it on purpose to see your communities response
[1:22:44] Nightbot: www.youtube.com/iskall85 | www.twitter.com/iskall85 | https://youtube.com/@vodskall85
[1:22:44] lazypandaman: but i also think that a lot of modded minecraft packs don't focus at all on armor which makes vh special
[1:22:45] karabahk: I think the only real thing you shouldn't use is trinkets because they change the game so much and they are rare and you can't guarantee to have the one you want until very late game
[1:22:50] manithoro: what about making skavs craftable only so that casual players dont have to play it if they dont want to
[1:22:54] matjea: RNGesus is against you
[1:22:54] Ramzi65ok: it's about the overworld not being useful
[1:22:59] Kasszi_: ill get it
[1:23:03] jeremy__btw: are treasure rooms effected by quant and rarity?
[1:23:05] armagon2399: you should add more cosmetics
[1:23:13] RobUrHood: @runtels think only like 53 mining speed to insta mine ores
[1:23:15] Mnecraftenjoyer: @batt3ryac1d lol
[1:23:17] unknownrek: Mr iskall do you think you may have let some comments get under your skin? For example for jewel cutting
[1:23:18] bigtowza: maybe on tool quest line could be make pick and hammer?
[1:23:18] dingllleberry: I <3 vault hunters
[1:23:23] grom301: at the end of the day scava are just RNG which can get annoying
[1:23:26] moriquendi197: All I know this everything I wish Minecraft could be. There is no adventure reward left in Minecraft for me now.
[1:23:30] Nightbot: Vault Hunters Reddit for you to check out! https://www.reddit.com/r/VaultHuntersMinecraft/
[1:23:33] kibaz_x: More like bad Dashision
[1:23:34] mattertec: Well - when you preface your question with "most efficiently complete scavs" then it's tough to dispute because hammers are slightly more efficient. But I understand why people like Etho are hesistant to use a hammer because of the excess junk and like to be more precise with vein miner
[1:23:40] tre_2018: Mob party going down
[1:23:45] whocares_15: iskall plays how i play when i have the 10 seconds invincibility at the end lol
[1:23:45] tallywackkerr: Hey @iskall85 I've loved the consistant posting of videos. you're amazing thanks!
[1:23:47] darkwolfhunter4: @iskall85  what was the inspiration behind vault hunters ?
[1:23:52] mefallit: how many days left for hermitcraft vh?
[1:23:53] ajmarvin: ajmarvin subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 15 months, currently on a 15 month streak! Ello
[1:23:55] jenn_jennnn: @SSlotts i am not sure why building gadgets and mining gadgets were banned from the vault, VH2 had it, its alot of something that made it fun,
[1:23:56] occathereptil: I’m lvl 55 and only just built my first hammer not because I needed it per say but because I figured it would be faster, although it is a bit of a learning curve to get used to
[1:24:02] Nightbot: For everything Vault Hunters, check out the website! https://vaulthunters.gg/
[1:24:06] Alfie2978: is their a chance we can get vault eneration similar to season 2's? personally the theme's are getting boring, getting caves most of the time. season 2's was so fun, with so many rooms, designs and target focusing.
[1:24:15] queenshazza: It would be good if any major changes, like to tools or trinkets, were part of a higher difficulty level. That way those of us who are not as quick or just like playing for fun can still use those items, but if someone wants the challenge they can go to a higher difficulty level.
[1:24:23] CapraDiCollina: Any news on the next season of the smp? mmmmhhh
[1:24:32] Darkstar159: @iskall85 scav check?
[1:24:32] omegatitanshark: hey Iskall
[1:24:35] RobUrHood: @occathereptil you're going to want the junk identifier soon. I recommend 7x7 or 9x9 max
[1:24:47] Buzzengbarth: Iskall I have been loving playing and cant wait for new update love you
[1:24:48] RobUrHood: @RobUrHood for hammer size i mean
[1:24:48] batt3ryac1d: Even when I'm ignoring mobs I spite kill those magmatic bastards LUL
[1:24:51] antegravity: obknockshis hah
[1:25:00] matjea: Gonna lose all my channel points
[1:25:06] unknownrek: No Noting emote Sadge
[1:25:13] pocketnemo: What does min-maxing mean?
[1:25:16] wendymoto: hi hi dylans
[1:25:23] Moon_FaLL: @iskall85 do you think you guys have enough time to beat this series ?
[1:25:24] jazjax1: @SSlotts I believe it was because people was cheesing the game with them
[1:25:32] unknownrek: Ledditing
[1:25:33] tallywackkerr: @iskall85 thanks for how consistant you've been with posting videos! <3
[1:25:33] TAxels: you can pause?
[1:25:33] 0of1est: We <3 Spider Soul Charms
[1:25:40] peppa_j: 1 scroll
[1:25:56] GerbilOfWolves: you can never make it so that everyone will like it, so i think it is important to really consider whose oppinion you listen to
[1:25:57] DerTomDer: 14 raiders from DerTomDer have joined! 
[1:25:57] Ramzi65ok: it's helpful to know that dash also bases off of your current momentum
[1:25:58] matjea: get berry emotional
[1:26:02] bigtowza: does item rarity affct scav items?
[1:26:13] unknownrek: @bigtowza nope
[1:26:14] MarkDatter: @bigtowza the scav items arent affected by item rarity and quantity
[1:26:16] batt3ryac1d: fr whoever put the berry bushes in this theme should stub their toe Smadge
[1:26:17] Glitched_Dragon_07: this has to be one of my lest favret theams
[1:26:19] actionandross: love your point about “if you want to run a cake and just spawn one”.  I personally don’t have time for the crystal grind for rare items so I spawn them in so I can get in a vault  because that’s what I’m here for
[1:26:21] braydenpiag: was that a dungeon?
[1:26:32] mrjackal85: People play worst when they are stressed lol. Maybe that could be a factor? Lol
[1:26:40] Zach010: I think it's okay to be emotional too. Don't forget the emotions towards the game matter as well as the logical reactions
[1:26:40] DerTomDer: Good evening. Greetings from a little german vault hunters streamer. Hope you're having a great run
[1:26:50] FailLior: no mic? lyingskall
[1:26:50] Grandwigg: @pocketnemo historically, taking extreme negatives to go even higher on the chosen positives. origins in D&D type stuff. like a guy having a mute character to have a bit of extra strength or dexterity.
[1:26:52] nowthatisprettyepic: first stream in a while yippe
[1:26:53] Xarallon: all those living dungeons
[1:26:54] drhallofduty: I hear mic
[1:26:56] ruffboiMags: this is the chattiest no mic stream I've ever been on XD
[1:26:56] CeleiteStreams: I think both the issues being discussed are part of the game. Finding a way to make your playstyle work is interesting, and recognizing when you can't complete a vault is a skill as well.
[1:27:02] Cloudetix: I think the frustration comes from the percieved inaility to affect the odds of what you pull from a chest in a scav. When in reality, you can affect it by focusing the right chest, being more efficient with your movement, lots of things that just translates to general vault skill
[1:27:03] antegravity: Do fireworks and rockets work in vaults?
[1:27:07] redstonedad: Imo raging at a game is a good thing as long as you're having fun
[1:27:14] kibaz_x: Sure there's a mushroom room... or isn't there mush room?
[1:27:20] Kasszi_: KEKW
[1:27:21] MarkDatter: @antegravity I dont think so. You should be able to use Dash in the same way though
[1:27:29] wes76544: !noic
[1:27:32] wes76544: !nomic
[1:27:32] Nightbot: i am chilling and have very little to no mic, voice needs resting :D
[1:27:33] melonhunt: @kibaz_x no......
[1:27:37] MarkDatter: (unless you spec'd into Dash: Warp)
[1:27:38] antegravity: @MarkDatter Yeye
[1:27:41] mefallit: chat take care yourself, it is getting late.
[1:27:42] phonybologna9: what is the logic behind the decision to not use hunter for these tests? (not snarky just curious)
[1:27:46] FailLior: almost level 85 pag
[1:27:48] Kasszi_: good night mef!
[1:27:49] mefallit: Good night
[1:28:00] ruffboiMags: @mefallit night!

[1:28:06] batt3ryac1d: wooden obj always sneak up on me I'm all like "oh yeah I should get some wooden" then I check and I have 40 books KEKW
[1:28:07] Glitched_Dragon_07: like etho with the dungens
[1:28:09] Ramzi65ok: I was like I wonder how bad barterer was for people not to take it with the old vendor room system, then i saw 45%???
[1:28:11] Mnecraftenjoyer: wait is there still ghost walk or whatever its called?
[1:28:16] VogelVrouw: yeah some people know where everything spawns its insane
[1:28:19] matjea: smartest zombie ever
[1:28:20] MarkDatter: @Mnecraftenjoyer still exists yeah
[1:28:29] Petrix12: Whats the chance of guardian pylon spawning in room in hunt the gurdians @iskall85 ?
[1:28:31] FailLior: watching iskall at 1am is so cozy
[1:28:38] Mnecraftenjoyer: @MarkDatter is it still as good as before or did they nerf?
[1:28:41] MarkDatter: wow that POI with ores is so much quicker to loot with that hammer
[1:28:41] drsong1: Wow I caught iskall live! That never happens!!!
[1:28:57] kot7k: 3 zombies, u done
[1:28:57] zebrainap: 3 zombie arms

[1:29:12] antegravity: 3 Zombie arms leshgo what a beautiful day it is
[1:29:14] DraamaQ: 3 arms sir
[1:29:18] SMO_SG: hii
[1:29:19] Stanbroek: wtf i was promised no mic
[1:29:28] VogelVrouw: @Stanbroek just mute lmao
[1:29:34] Alfie2978: @Cloudetix i dont think its really vault skill when you need say, 2 ornate rare items with 10 minutes left so you hard focus them, speeding through rooms checking and dont get anything. wasiting 10 minutes of vault and not getting a completion. (happens to me more than i like, to the point i hate scavs)
[1:29:37] Stanbroek: Good idea
[1:29:38] notorangepatchee: ARE THERE NO OMEGa rooms
[1:29:50] batt3ryac1d: @notorangepatchee They're omega rare
[1:29:50] SMO_SG: no mic???? but i can heir you
[1:29:58] Mnecraftenjoyer: @notorangepatchee omega room bad for scav
[1:30:08] matjea: Scavs w/o wooden are harder
[1:30:09] jjxd2024: hola
[1:30:11] batt3ryac1d: @SMO_SG He's using brain controlled text to speech Chadge
[1:30:18] FailLior: @SMO_SG no u can't
[1:30:19] candidcrafter: What if , there was an objective difficulty scaling that makes chests to drop scav items 100% times ? That will make it easier for newbies to complete it and feel good
[1:30:26] Ice1Berrgg: Armor dura is low
[1:30:27] fangedzeus: what would you suggest to someone that doesn’t know much about mods but wants to get into them without getting burnt out?
[1:30:32] jjxd2024: ?
[1:30:35] SMO_SG: @batt3ryac1d ahh i see
[1:30:41] unryzen39: can we expect update 13 before the end of january?
[1:30:50] FailLior: btw if anyone can hear iskall he's not talking you're just hallucinating
[1:30:57] batt3ryac1d: He's getting good at threading the needle with those wings
[1:31:00] Cloudetix: @Alfie2978 The ammount of times Iv'e seen bad players say they're focusing gilded and then immediately turn around and hit a single wooden chest is astounding. It's a mental thing.
[1:31:04] HoY_82: it wasnt even that long ago
[1:31:05] Robbie0301: @FailLior good to know, thanks
[1:31:14] alexandrospent: That was legacy tho
[1:31:29] Hillowder: How close is the artifact completetion for the final boss?
[1:31:30] gibberish_kris: Yes
[1:31:32] the_undeaddit: is scavs still the hardest vaults for you iskall ?
[1:31:32] matjea: kek
[1:31:36] Mnecraftenjoyer: btw did he get the armor off camera cuz  was looking for the vod and couldnt find it one had bad armor next one had amazng armour so ye im confused

[1:32:32] motku: sSlots: "Hey @iskall85 was it a design decision or just an accident but it seems like the overworld doesn't hold much value in VH.

[1:32:33] haze_deadline: I wish I was as good at flying as Iskall, I switched from frog yesterday and constantly whack into everything :D
[1:32:40] RobUrHood: i did a level 52 vault with a friend whilst level 90 and couldn't complete it
[1:32:42] VogelVrouw: i would do bad with wings, i would die so much
[1:32:42] ReptileFountain: Do we not think that every scav is completable anymore?
[1:32:43] zebrainap: prismatic feather is so nice
[1:32:43] Dadel2400: Frog ftw
[1:32:44] Lutzio: And scavs have a good gold reward
[1:32:45] shaydeejay: prismatic feather is goated
[1:32:47] Alfie2978: @Cloudetix sure, but they are them. i wouldn't consider my self bad by any means, i go pretty sweat but when there is absolutely nothing i can do its just frustaiting.
[1:32:47] thevoidknight430: as someone focusing on completion I always do scavs over elixer because it just FEELS more worth my time
[1:32:48] loading0110: WOOOO FROG

[1:33:01] Ginjajewfro: It was a tiny change, but I adore how Elixir vaults are now the first variety you see!! It means that early level players can focus solely on looting
[1:33:02] ramnite_tv: Much faster, yeah
[1:33:02] Zach010: Maybe you could do a video with a bunch of different builds to complete vaults/scavs
[1:33:03] RobUrHood: I run feather and phylactery
[1:33:05] nystadt: Any release date of the update?
[1:33:07] Stormtalon42: loot goggles are my go-to Blue
[1:33:09] candidcrafter: What if chests dropped scav items at 100% instead of 50% at easy difficulty?
[1:33:11] dingllleberry: I love feather

[1:33:44] Mnecraftenjoyer: @iskall85 Hallo will the cakes not appear in other chests? In my opinion u should allow them to spawn chests but make them extremely rare because if it only spawns in treasure chests wouldnt it be a bit to hard also the value would skyrocket a bit too much like how much will they go for in vendoor????
[1:33:44] pb_b: have you made divine paradox?
[1:33:44] frizzylizzy70: false sells skulls
[1:33:48] manithoro: are u going to have a vault type were u have to defeat a boss like in the original vault hunters
[1:33:54] chibiplaysgames: I love the different colored storage shelves

[1:34:00] LeoTheLeopardNZ: I had a crystal like an hour ago that was asking for 2 nether stars

[1:34:07] motku: KEKW
[1:34:10] Cloudetix: @Alfie2978 I don't mean to call you bad, but then maybe you could be better. Just because you sweat doesnt mean you preform. Trying hard isn't thes same thing as doing well

[1:34:14] Kasszi_: @batt3ryac1d im not sure what the issue would be
[1:34:15] flypig07: @iskall85 Could you add some text in the jewel applicator quest that tells how much mining speed is needed to instant mine wooden chests, ores, ect.?
[1:34:17] speed0sound7665: i think the ascention change is great

[1:34:38] lil1taly: i had a 4 skull crystal the other day, i was confused between ispawner and easy piglin, it made my mind up quick
[1:34:43] LeoTheLeopardNZ: to be fair I'm level 92 and we're playing on a multiplayer server with plenty of automation
[1:34:53] MrMuxxer: there is so lang themes in vaults. why aint there a water theme any longer (earlier vault hunter had a water room)
[1:35:04] motku: PepeLa
[1:35:09] RobUrHood: computer can't be used in vaults either and needs vault items
[1:35:10] stutte_: gear almost ded :/
[1:35:14] Poe_thirteen: I love my mining gadget
[1:35:21] Petrix12: @iskall85 whats the chance of objective spawning in room in hunt the guradians?
[1:35:24] tonTeufel: Mining gadgets are so much worse than hammers with the "new" tool system
[1:35:26] Kastumoem: They are great for making packed ice
[1:35:34] batt3ryac1d: @batt3ryac1d I was thinking maybe you could give me literally 1 point and maybe it unbrokeys goodge
[1:35:41] devo431: Apples
[1:35:41] Tana01: Plus then the upgrades for mining gadgets get very expensive very fast to have it get even close to a hammer
[1:35:42] chibiplaysgames: Just wanted to say how much I love the procedural generation of the vaults.  They are so gorgeous.
[1:35:48] skierbrenn: What tier of tools are worth crafting? like all the way up to the level 90 tools?
[1:35:58] batt3ryac1d: @batt3ryac1d probably not though no more gamba for me KEKW
[1:36:00] DanimalsBetch: The digital miner costs an omega pog lol
[1:36:02] ShapNine: Remember building gadget in the big lava room
[1:36:15] ddSqueeze: The point of them taking vault materials tho is to incentivize the player to do what this pack is about - run vaults

[1:36:42] moshner: thanks for the stream I have to go. gnight
[1:36:46] Alfie2978: @Cloudetix i'm trying not to sound like a doosh, which is makes it hard to defend my performance in a vault. i find personally there is veru little i could actually improve on in my skill.
[1:36:48] el3l_: yeah, I think that's fair
[1:36:53] GerbilOfWolves: you said you will change the stream message?
[1:36:53] hamisharms: @iskall85 If you could change one big thing about VH (Game design, community, popularity, anything etc) what would it be ?
[1:36:53] Zach010: Would you do a video with a bunch of different builds to complete vaults/scavs
[1:36:55] CoconutTiim: oh yea thats even a bit cheap imo
[1:36:55] Petrix12: @iskall85 thank you, I just went trough 20 rooms without finding one LUL
[1:36:56] Glitched_Dragon_07: is all this scaling and leveling info open to accese?
[1:37:00] devo431: Hat may break iskall85

[1:37:32] soupisthegood: iskEagle
[1:37:33] w00kiet0sser: whats your thoughts on jewel cutting where the feeling is that you are gating this mechanic for cutting behind expertise and it feels it is a meta to take expertise points into it?
[1:37:35] champeman22: Just reached level 100 today in my 2nd playthrough! Excited to run some super vaults now!
[1:37:35] dingllleberry: I agree that one block solution are bad. take out botany pots iskall!
[1:37:41] SSlotts: But what do I spend those materials on? Feels like very little use diamonds as an example
[1:37:43] vibecisco70: digi miner is like a 4 block solution kek
[1:37:45] 20egemen04: isn't the rainbow furnace a one block solution?
[1:37:46] Darkest9469: my message didnt send but there was nothing wrong with it?
[1:37:49] el3l_: fair; it's also super expensive, I suppose not many people use it
[1:37:57] Lashings: Do you like the current way a Scav bag works or would you want to change it
[1:37:59] wendymoto: its weird seeing you at this time of the day for me LUL

[1:38:25] 20egemen04: good point

[1:38:27] TAxels: life has a rainbow of furnaces
[1:38:28] Croseven: LUL
[1:38:28] Darkstar159: one block solutions < time gating
[1:38:32] Stanbroek: Did you finish the last 10% on your machete?
[1:38:32] lufrha1: lol
[1:38:32] Darkest9469: mods are you able to review my message as im not sure what was bad about it?
[1:38:33] StrangePanthers: Lol
[1:38:34] speed0sound7665: Like a rainbow
[1:38:39] 0of1est: "I hate one block solutions... unless it's smelting"
[1:38:42] GhostlyMarrow49: so you must hate 1 block smelting solutions :)
[1:38:43] bigtowza: animal pen 1 block also
[1:38:44] Cloudetix: @Alfie2978 I suggest you do a comparison. Look at your scav completion and note how many of each chest you mine compared to the other objectives and see how much they differ. Then at least you have a metric to base it on. Then make an effort to focus and see if you are "improving"
[1:38:45] valkojam: Plus it looks cool
[1:38:46] mefallit: one block solutions are the best LEDDITING
[1:38:49] dragonninjaa199: how do you keep junk from filling your jewel pouch with the pickup upgrade
[1:38:54] Stormtalon42: @rytional well, there's the Applied Mechanistics mod that lets QIO see AE stuff and AE see QIO -- but it would completely imbalance away from RS
[1:38:54] hamisharms: I want a one block solution for life
[1:38:55] mentosdoes: what are your strategies for completing scav vaults, I have never completed one and could use all the help I can get
[1:38:55] candidcrafter: You could build auto smelter with 64 furnaces
[1:38:57] dragonslayerx453: Yay frog
[1:38:58] angrrrrydad: smelting on tool = 1 block solution .. oh wait its not a block
[1:38:59] Guybrrush: Create smelting is so much fun
[1:39:00] SunflowerMead0w: boggy the froggy!

[1:39:04] TheChelzorz: @iskall85 have you considered adding different music for inside the vaults?
[1:39:04] Grandwigg: @0of1est well, its one action. just bulk.
[1:39:06] bashleyyyyy: DinoDance
[1:39:06] rad_ju: ould you enable create autocrafting if it would work with the vh research system ?

[1:39:10] speed0sound7665: @bigtowza yah but lag lmao
[1:39:15] MattKi: This seems more like a mic stream rather than no mic :D
[1:39:15] lazypandaman: would you think now having more then 100 % trap disarm is good must result in jewels with higher percentage trap disarm is needed
[1:39:16] notorangepatchee: What does frog do
[1:39:19] motku: Why are there, so many, songs about rainbows, and what's on the other side?
[1:39:20] Lutzio: You can scrap that hourglass
[1:39:20] FreudPlays: ETHO
[1:39:21] Mnecraftenjoyer: @iskall85 Are the cakes not gonna appear in other chests other then treasure rooms? In my opinion u should allow them to spawn in chests but make them extremely rare because if it only spawns in treasure chests wouldnt it be a bit to hard also the value would skyrocket a bit too much like how much will they go for in aution room anything over 60 i think is a bit too much but on the other hand some ppl will say that because its in the treasure chest its worth that much????
[1:39:22] kot7k: oh frog was the old feature that i dont remember the name, i just loved it

[1:39:48] Kasszi_: hi wendy
[1:39:49] truthatoxin303: It's so cool that you've created this whole new modpack that promotes so many different things, and is applicable with so many different types of players.
[1:39:50] Banshee624: Banshee624 subscribed at Tier 2. They've subscribed for 41 months! Finally caught a stream. Nice to see you Sir Iskall and Dylan.
[1:39:54] Kastumoem: Give it to champions
[1:39:55] wes76544: ETHO
[1:39:55] BigD_Tiny420: @iskall85 Have you thought about adding to expertise points.. Like a chance of stacking blessings at lvl 3 of devine, or more bounties with hunter if you dont make it infinite..
[1:39:57] 20egemen04: oh no not etho not now, the stream will last 5 more hours and I won't sleep
[1:40:06] P3pp3rF1y: keys are crafted using rare materials
[1:40:12] vibecisco70: co op with etho hmm...
[1:40:19] batt3ryac1d: @20egemen04 suffering from success NotLikeThis
[1:40:20] pb_b: how common though?
[1:40:21] Jackkabuki: How about Cake vaults seals can come from completion crates in the cake theme?
[1:40:27] Darkest9469: 6000?
[1:40:34] pb_b: because they are fun to run
[1:40:35] Colebot17: maybe in a crake completion there is a chance to get the seal back kind of like augments
[1:40:35] zebrainap: 6k??? you can get chaos for like 3-4k?
[1:40:38] tragedygaymer: Hey Iskall- My family has a server and we just recently beat the Harold. We noticed that you can't place blocks to get to the final arena which essentially pigeons holes someone into either using dash (with elytra since you can't use rockets) or triple jump (which removes a trinket slot) to get there. Any thought on the ability to add blocks or another method of getting there aside from these two options?
[1:40:39] matjea: that's cheap
[1:40:40] devo431: How are you iskall your sounding very quite
[1:40:41] randqmized: 6k is a bit much??
[1:40:41] VogelVrouw: yeah thats do-able
[1:40:41] Robbie0301: is it gonna be the same price as chaos catalysts?
[1:40:47] lazypandaman: @iskall85 would you think that scaling the percentage trap disarm on jewels would be better now that having higher trap disarm is good?
[1:40:48] SunflowerMead0w: brb gonna craft a stack of cake seals
[1:40:49] SMO_SG: @iskall85 did you make so sky vault use sweets instes of breed?
[1:40:49] phonybologna9: how does the price of a cake vault compare to that of a chaos catalyst?
[1:40:49] 20egemen04: @batt3ryac1d it is late enough for me already
[1:40:51] matjea: have 50K shards in my pouch
[1:40:53] chad_masters: Whats your reason not to put them rarely in completion crates for scams only kek
[1:40:56] MarkDatter: 6000 sounds a bit much at first, but we'll see how it feels in-game
[1:40:58] Caren9593: I’m really looking forward to your divine paradox video. I haven’t seen someone run the vault fully
[1:40:59] zebrainap: are cakes stronger than chaos vaults?
[1:41:00] littlepepperbutt: I just bought a trinket for like 8 or 9k soul shards
[1:41:01] Dadel2400: Will it have a comparable drop rate to chaos catalysts?
[1:41:02] FreudPlays: time to batch craft seals :)
[1:41:06] VogelVrouw: 6k is gettable if you just do some cleanup
[1:41:07] Darkest9469: 2.4k vault diamonds makes me jealous
[1:41:07] Kriskiki89: can you block old seals from working
[1:41:14] chuckleslaughed: iskall when are you going to do your divine paradox?
[1:41:15] P3pp3rF1y: also 6k isn't that hard to get given the option of burning stuff
[1:41:16] grynd3rfl: Maybe make sure old cake seals don't work so someone can't make a bunch before the update
[1:41:19] jmommers98: Totally unrelated, but would it be cool to add a black market to the VenDoors?
[1:41:20] bigtowza: i thought cake seal already in blackmarket tho
[1:41:22] randqmized: me
[1:41:22] shaydeejay: 100%

[1:41:36] red_mask333: yep
[1:41:37] BigD_Tiny420: True

[1:41:37] littlepepperbutt: Yupyup
[1:41:37] Tanryn1: 100%
[1:41:37] JashinFanatic: I do, but I'm not specced into black market
[1:41:38] Drackst_Gaming: Occasionally
[1:41:40] wendymoto: i want soul chance but i want the others more
[1:41:40] TorqueSquirrel: Soul Chance ALL THE WAY
[1:41:42] MrMuxxer: there are so many themes in vaults, why is there no water theme? I remember there was a water room in earlier season.
[1:41:42] speed0sound7665: love soul shards
[1:41:44] peppa_j: I LOOOVE soul chance
[1:41:44] randqmized: i havent gotten high enough levvel where black market is really useful
[1:41:46] VogelVrouw: @zebrainap omg thats amazing
[1:41:47] Colebot17: true
[1:41:48] speed0sound7665: and soul chance
[1:41:49] Aylabar: me and I still have enough soul shards
[1:41:50] Colebot17: that makes sense
[1:41:50] ramnite_tv: Dedicated soul set, other than that, item quant all the way
[1:41:52] Darkstar159: @iskall85 can you add sould shard vendoors?
[1:41:54] littlepepperbutt: iskHype
[1:41:55] matjea: i take a 40% sould chance over a 8% item quant
[1:41:55] etherealonegames: 6k is easy tbh. and that’s without focusing soul chance
[1:41:56] judgywudgy: I get so many soul shards from vault junk I don't need any from mobs
[1:41:57] masterchef2214: I’m personally obsessed with the black market so I see soul chance as a bonus
[1:41:57] Jackkabuki: i got a legendary soul chance gear piece early on and it got me thousands of shards early on
[1:42:00] k1d_zomb1e: I think you need to make a soul build to prove to chat
[1:42:00] BigD_Tiny420: Ooooooo
[1:42:00] the_whtvr: I bought a chaos catalyst for 11k soul shards today, worth it for sure
[1:42:04] ariddesert1: I have my legacy soul chance set with ~1400% soul chance on it lol
[1:42:05] MarkDatter: maybe cooldown reduction or mana regen, but i havent really gotten to the point of focusing on item quant/rarity or soul chance
[1:42:06] chad_masters: Put them in scav completion crates iskTroll iskTroll iskTroll
[1:42:07] speed0sound7665: have a gear set that gets 606% with two legendarys
[1:42:07] Lystiel: Good Evening Iskall, I have really enjoyed your take on the scavs....I knew it was a skill/speed thing, but you have done a couple things that I did not think of. Looking forward to trying them out. Also, are the trinket slots fixed on the update. I am not good with changing back end stuff to make them accessible to me. I have 3 I cannot equip at this time.
[1:42:08] RyACreigns: I dont think i even engage with the Black Market more than 1 or 2 times every 10 levels
[1:42:08] dingllleberry: I love soul chance and I bought cake seal today! so fun <3
[1:42:09] sharkastic_shark: Will existing seals work for the new cake vault
[1:42:10] ggamito: I roll my pieces to soulchance ALL time LUL
[1:42:14] Lashings: What if it also made mobs give more exp
[1:42:17] futureimagineer13: I be grateful for what I'm given by the vault gods. prayers in the name of father greedskall
[1:42:22] JashinFanatic: we don't have as many chances to interact with a black market without the expertise for it to be relevant
[1:42:22] SSlotts: I think mining gadgets threw the question off but there are a lot of ways to get overworld materials but no real way of spending them. Feels like everything cost vault diamond and nothing uses overworld diamond
[1:42:23] lil1taly: is there a soul chance trinket?
[1:42:24] red_mask333: we already have ways to get a lot of soul shards so the soul chance doesnt seem good imo sometimes
[1:42:27] TorqueSquirrel: I love the feeling of buying an artifact from black market
[1:42:27] pb_b: but how common would the seal be? like could you in theory go weeks without ever getting one?
[1:42:29] Romlekidd: what is the point/use of soot
[1:42:35] peppa_j: i think soul chance gets worse as you get higher level coz u get more smeltable loot
[1:42:41] zebrainap: @VogelVrouw yeah it is pretty insane, a very good vault nets me 22k+ soul shards, i have two legendary soul shard gear pieces tho and lvl 90
[1:42:42] Nightbot: For everything Vault Hunters, check out the website! https://vaulthunters.gg/
[1:42:44] speed0sound7665: @lil1taly idonas pendand
[1:42:44] tensazangetsu003: Sounds like DevSkall made the soul shard price make players think about wardrobe changes for different builds.
[1:42:45] CoconutTiim: @romlekidd just to build with or smelt for soul shards
[1:42:51] batt3ryac1d: I have hella stuff from old updates in my computer that's rarer/not necessarily in the game anymore that is worth hella soul shards so I'm set for life on them LUL
[1:42:52] SMO_SG: @iskall85 can you make so sky vault use sweets instes of breed?
[1:42:53] Darkest9469: soot ew
[1:42:53] speed0sound7665: doubles your current soul chance
[1:42:54] SunflowerMead0w: yeah i've already gotten very rich off the night market soul chance is v good
[1:42:57] Cloudetix: Go crazy with soul chance, make it increase by 200% per gear piece
[1:42:58] fursten001: teh sutt?
[1:42:58] dcptcncrescendo: Crafted some ahead of time for my wok
[1:42:58] braydenpiag: LUL
[1:42:59] ramnite_tv: Very soot-hing
[1:42:59] Alfie2978: @Cloudetix how would that have any metric on 'improvement'? how many chests i get, is  purely luck no matter anyones skill. when i do scav's i consistently get less loot as i usually get close to completion and decide to focus the last items i need, and don't get it no matter how hard i focus, perfectly scout a room. In the end i usually don't get them, and leave having wasted time and regreting i ever even bothered. i dont see how theres 'improvement' to luck.
[1:43:01] FreudPlays: who are you and what have yo udone with @iskall85

[1:48:56] Zen0ku: Is there a date for 13 to come out?
[1:48:58] Cloudetix: @Alfie2978 Just because there is luck doesn't mean its the only factor. Yes It's luck if you loot one chest. But your chance to loot what you want improves per chest you loot. This is just how statistics work and I don't think I need to explain that.
[1:48:58] xShadowWxlfChloex: Iskall did you find it difficult starting up on VH, running the first few vaults?

[1:55:15] stephaniebutton23: i live in such a small place i go to movies with like 5 other people most of the time
[1:55:16] sirbinx: the covid years were easy for us introverts lol
[1:55:18] babyinastr8jacket: I want to go and see inside out 2
[1:55:25] aletijeras: i don't usually go but i think it is still a thing
[1:55:29] vibecisco70: i mean i just have to go with 3+ people so i can sit in the middle not next to randos
[1:55:30] xerminator2k: !nomic

[1:56:04] sideburns_of_fire: oooh late night vaulting? Pag!
[1:56:04] DaddyBonesMC: Need to start attending VH Anonymous meetings.
[1:56:08] hamisharms: I feel like iskall is my girlfriend recently with how much time I spend watching videos and playing his game
[1:56:11] futureimagineer13: The theaters are the REAL way to do it. I still remember watching Frozen in theaters, and the entire theater gasping at once during the twist
[1:56:13] tre_2018: @sirbinx I was like "I've been training for this for years." XD
[1:56:14] Grandwigg: @sirbinx ironically, i went out more in covid years for my regular doc visits for my back than i did in the few years leading up to it. and still was home more than most other folks, hahahah.
[1:56:17] SunflowerMead0w: i blame iskall for my back problems cause i shouldnt be sitting but i cant stay away from my server lol
[1:56:18] fursten001: bruh they are soo tasty.
[1:56:20] braydenpiag: what's the plan for axes?
[1:56:24] batt3ryac1d: AgorophobiaSkall
[1:56:24] t_h_e_chief_: i dont like the commercials before the movie.  you pay  and have to watch commercials
[1:56:26] lukewr101: Hello
[1:56:27] MasterElementsCommissions: I've managed to dodge covid so far and plan to continue to. Cinemas are a no go for me
[1:56:28] el3l_: yes, agreed
[1:56:32] jenn_jennnn: i LOVE the archives too
[1:56:33] el3l_: archives are great
[1:56:33] pb_b: @braydenpiag javelin wands?

[1:56:35] haze_deadline: so excited for new dungeons
[1:56:36] angelfoxruby: DinoDance DinoDance DinoDance
[1:56:36] littlepepperbutt: So pumped for new dungeons
[1:56:37] Kasszi_: faab
[1:56:40] wendymoto: fabbbyyy
[1:56:41] lil1taly: do you have any clue what build you want to use for herald yet
[1:56:44] MaximumLiberty: iskHeart
[1:56:46] braydenpiag: @pb_b dolphinSus
[1:56:55] batt3ryac1d: SUPER EXCITED for the new dungi
[1:56:56] BigD_Tiny420: iskHeart iskHeart iskHeart
[1:56:57] SkyForze_: !update
[1:56:57] Grandwigg: you could say they look Faabulous
[1:57:02] skierbrenn: Can anyone tell me what a pheonix feather does?
[1:57:07] jenn_jennnn: if i have to give any critism about the archive is i wish the alchemy ones had more stuff to discover
[1:57:09] Xarallon: more big dungeons are a good way to buff chance of archieve
[1:57:14] tre_2018: Popcorn in Vue cinemas in UK is pre-popped and delivered in giant plastic wrap. At the end of the day they collect what wasn't sold in a black sack then put it out the next day. WutFace
[1:57:15] Darkwytchcraft: all the maps have come a long way from the original one I played in
[1:57:18] xShadowWxlfChloex: @motku tbh I don’t really understand the big deal of bringing your own food to watch a movie as long as you clear up after yourself when the movie ends
[1:57:21] ramnite_tv: @skierbrenn About the same  behaviour as totem in vanilla iirc
[1:57:22] darkwolfhunter4: @iskall85  do you think trial chambers  took  inspiration from  vault hunters ? jw
[1:57:24] rytional: overconfidentskall
[1:57:25] Lutzio: Yeah you commented that
[1:57:25] batt3ryac1d: @skierbrenn triple jump isn't it?
[1:57:27] littlepepperbutt: Focus!! iskHeart
[1:57:28] el3l_: @skierbrenn revives you once when applied to a crysta
[1:57:29] antegravity: Don't we have step up in this play-through????
[1:57:32] Cloudetix: @Alfie2978 If we agree that a good player will be more likely to complete a vault. And we agree that a better player will loot more chests of the correct type, and we agree that more chests = better chance to complete scav. Then that should mean that more chests looted = highers skill, then if you track your looted chests you should be able to get a metric (not a perfect metric but something you can track) on how good you are.
[1:57:34] ramnite_tv: @ramnite_tv Just a one time use*
[1:57:46] lil1taly: we did get sidetracked with not only dinosaur talk but also inssulting etho
[1:57:51] jbtjeee: So this is what no mic sounds like? I like it
[1:57:53] skierbrenn: @skierbrenn Oh apply it to a crystal?
[1:57:53] l___Nick___l: I know that item rarity doesn’t affect scav items, but does item quantity affect them? If it increases the amount of slots in a chest are filled, does that increase the chance for a scav item?
[1:57:53] batt3ryac1d: @batt3ryac1d no wait that's the trinket lmao
[1:57:55] angelfoxruby: DinoDance
[1:57:58] Diggles11: how many different common rooms are there?
[1:58:02] Darkwytchcraft: I haven't had a chance to really play the first VH or 2nd but VH 3  the dungeons are beautiful
[1:58:03] hamisharms: Is 1.18 considered as Alpha ?
[1:58:04] Cloudetix: @Alfie2978  I cannot explain it better than that. Please don't ask me again. It's just logic.
[1:58:04] queenshazza: I love the themes
[1:58:06] angelfoxruby: I like themes
[1:58:07] stephaniebutton23: its been so cool watching the game develop, i remember you teasing little things before announcing it. thrilling!
[1:58:07] skierbrenn: @skierbrenn Thanks @el3l_
[1:58:08] Lutzio: themes are grea
[1:58:08] braydenpiag: :(
[1:58:08] Grandwigg: i love the theme idea
[1:58:09] Darkwytchcraft: same with this
[1:58:10] loading0110: themes are great
[1:58:11] grafpa1: Yeah you were right about the themes
[1:58:11] motku: The themes were the best change
[1:58:11] elio_saratsis: The themes are pag
[1:58:14] SunflowerMead0w: i love the themes so much it was so monotonous last version
[1:58:14] aletijeras: the themes are amazing
[1:58:14] magimaster101: i like the themes
[1:58:17] oliverthegreat93: people had to adjust
[1:58:17] Kasszi_: ive always loved the themes
[1:58:19] speed0sound7665: themes are so good
[1:58:19] braydenpiag: no LUL
[1:58:21] strandberggg: VH only snow theme
[1:58:22] valkojam: No, jardoon hated it.
[1:58:22] samsam21amb: I can’t imagine vh without the themes
[1:58:24] jenn_jennnn: i like the themes, but i do wish there was alot more silly rooms
[1:58:25] PogaafThe2nd: I do miss some of the old rooms but they would look weird now
[1:58:26] dingllleberry: when themes came out that’s when I knew I wanted to play!
[1:58:28] Tana01: The themes are fantastic, they absolutely make the vaults all feel exciting.  Except the snow themes lol
[1:58:33] SunflowerMead0w: i miss some of the rooms but only the good ones like the sewerts
[1:58:34] Lutzio: and let's you make interesting things like echos in viod theme
[1:58:34] Colebot17: I also wasn't sure about the themes when they were released but now I can't believe what it would be otherwise
[1:58:36] motku: Nostalgia is a toxic desire at times
[1:58:38] braydenpiag: it was very "oh, not an OMEGA room? RIP Vault"
[1:58:40] Ginjajewfro: Which was your favorite version of VH, as a player?
[1:58:41] antegravity: Yeah I used to be against it just after 1.16 but now I think it's absolutely for the better
[1:58:41] TheRedBrain: themed vaults feel so much more polished
[1:58:41] kot7k: ngl i loved VH 2 and i spended hundreds of hours on it
[1:58:42] magimaster101: it was fun back in the day, but i could never go back lol
[1:58:44] Zeolith_: Should make a joke theme that is just greyscale or manila coloured.
[1:58:45] GenJopariGaming: The variety makes it better to fun Vaults back to back. Less mind numbing
[1:58:45] TAxels: first time seeing a dragon room felt legendary
[1:58:46] Caren9593: my opinion of the themes changed. I love then now
[1:58:46] TheSilver_Kitsune: themes and POIs are one of the reasons i started playing.
[1:58:47] Lizerdman87: Vault hunters has only improved over time
[1:58:49] 20egemen04: rooms were colorful though and I only miss that
[1:58:52] phonybologna9: the game has come a long way from traders and arenas in season 1
[1:58:52] MasterElementsCommissions: I started in VH3 and I love the themes
[1:58:56] AmethystVicious: I was skeptical at first- but I really have come to love the themes!
[1:58:56] speed0sound7665: pag
[1:58:58] xsmilesx: Cheer100 Cheer100 can you add something to archives for when you have found them all? like a gold reward or something for any you find in the future?
[1:58:58] tre_2018: Never regretted buying a gaming laptop just to play this mod pack on java.
[1:58:59] pocketnemo: The only thing i miss from the previous VH is the boss fights.
[1:58:59] queenshazza: Part of the fun of VH3 is searching for POIs in each room, and the themes contribute to that
[1:58:59] tonTeufel: the themed mobs made the themes a lot better and they weren't in the inital release
[1:59:01] pb_b: but some old rooms were great
[1:59:03] alexmurrin: Yeah people were nuts with the themes.
[1:59:05] milanvdzanden: I hated the armor tiering
[1:59:07] antegravity: Think we got another nice magnet just now
[1:59:08] batt3ryac1d: I do think it would be cool if some more of the rooms got brought in some looked cool. But I love the themes
[1:59:09] oliverthegreat93: people are negative, gotta get guud
[1:59:15] sideburns_of_fire: it's crazy going back and watching your old VH2 videos now and seeing what changed and what stayed the same to now
[1:59:24] Grandwigg: agreed
[1:59:30] alexmurrin: Idk I love it- especially with the new pois- they are so fun and cute!
[1:59:35] valkojam: I like it. And you can always dip out.
[1:59:35] pb_b: have you considered adding some of the special rooms to the new version?
[1:59:38] antegravity: Thank goodness for fizzle spawners though, they changed the game
[1:59:39] cheekymissy: That hammer is an absolute beast lol
[1:59:41] pb_b: like the fish tank
[1:59:43] VogelVrouw: Negative reactions aren't fun but it does show how many people really love this pack
[1:59:45] magimaster101: all your north america viewers get a chance today thx
[1:59:46] oliverthegreat93: the flesh club theme is my favorite
[1:59:53] matjea: classic
[1:59:53] fursten001: yes otherwhise i would be broke on echo gems
[1:59:59] peppa_j: do piercing javelin have less knockback?
[2:00:04] FireHorizon0: IskallMAN
[2:00:08] jenn_jennnn: and i kind of miss those rooms that have the lave pit at the bottom level and then like has those incomplete pathways making them dangerous
[2:00:13] MarkDatter: @peppa_j they definitely do i think
[2:00:13] speed0sound7665: i dont think piercing has knockback
[2:00:16] Alfie2978: @Cloudetix its biased logic set in an ideal world, not accounting for real world situations. skill has a limit, skill is a curve of starting slow, to fast to platoing. you're failing to acount for gear, rolls, luck, builds, and just the rooms and theme's you get. all of those change how many of each chests you get, and a percieved 'skill'.
[2:00:19] futureimagineer13: To anyone with constructive criticism, go right ahead. And to anyone with destructive criticism. Screweth Youeth. No one askethed.
[2:00:22] mrjackal85: No knock back on piercing
[2:00:29] loading0110: I go around with a 6x hammering lol
[2:00:31] vibecisco70: i think your hammer needs to be bigger tbh
[2:00:31] Stormtalon42: hehe -- no such thing as too big -- +7 hammering or bust!
[2:00:32] CeleiteStreams: I'm excited for the unique items, I think it'll be cool to figure out builds with them, and they also serve as a completionist/collector thing.
[2:00:34] axolotine: scav is so engaging
[2:00:37] oliverthegreat93: did Iskall take out the flesh club theme? :/
[2:00:41] motku: !poi
[2:00:42] Nightbot: PoI are points of interest. Places where you can get loot and fight mobs.
[2:00:44] wendymoto: LUL etho
[2:00:49] sideburns_of_fire: @antegravity true that
[2:00:51] Darkwytchcraft: so  by getting distracted did you basically nerf yourself? :)
[2:00:53] peppa_j: the knockback on regular javelins is terrible, but i like the damage
[2:00:53] elemelonnn: what are the ice spirits?
[2:00:55] batt3ryac1d: Etho flexing again LUL
[2:00:57] Cloudetix: @Alfie2978  No im not. It should average out over time.
[2:01:00] Therank2100: I made my omega hammer recently on my ingle player and i think even with +3 hammering (i think 4 total for a 9x9?) is still a litle too large for me
[2:01:00] lil1taly: what is a sprawling poi
[2:01:14] Arvom: I wanted to try VH for so long but couldn't cus it was just too difficult, now i'm loving it and as u said already being challeging is part of the fun
[2:01:17] batt3ryac1d: @elemelonnn just a random item that spawns in pedestals it doesn't do anything
[2:01:17] braydenpiag: infinite mana for 5 years
[2:01:18] braydenpiag: LUL
[2:01:23] nowthatisprettyepic: yib
[2:01:24] elemelonnn: @batt3ryac1d ah lmao
[2:01:25] Diggles11: the murderificate pylon
[2:01:25] jenn_jennnn: @lil1taly the ones that look like they are apart of the room and can have really good amount of chests or very little
[2:01:30] goggs1212: its easy he says proceeds to not complete it for 12 mins
[2:01:34] MarkDatter: I do wonder if Iskall has ever considered using the Lucky Hit spec for Battle Cry
[2:01:36] mrjackal85: I want a weapon that shoots as fast as the piglins crossbow.
[2:01:37] hamisharms: skill issue
[2:01:39] RobUrHood: Hypno made an interesting choice on full crit lucky hit. no cleave or anything.
[2:01:47] valkojam: What is Mr. Slab up to?
[2:02:05] norvillesdingus: I am way to aggressive in vaults. I don't like to move rooms till everything is dead. I'm trying to change to be faster
[2:02:05] Cloudetix: @Alfie2978 Im just giving you a way to track the improvement. That's all. It's not perfect, its just something you can do if you want to.
[2:02:07] motku: iskHeart iskHeart iskHeart iskHeart iskHeart
[2:02:07] Alfie2978: @Cloudetix well not in my experience, the world doesn't owe you anything to average out even if statistics say other wise
[2:02:08] alexanderite_254: The only update I had a little bit of dislike was the magnet one because of how i like the telleporting magnets but then in my current world i found the anchor which allows me to play at my full speed... with that said i think that things have always been getting better
[2:02:10] wendymoto: on hiatus?
[2:02:11] valkojam: Sabbatical
[2:02:17] Kasszi_: I miss Hell Sadge
[2:02:26] magimaster101: sadge :(
[2:02:32] Nightbot: For everything Vault Hunters, check out the website! https://vaulthunters.gg/
[2:02:39] gbusha: What happened to Hellfire?
[2:02:43] Xarallon: roadmap with and without hellfire should really be different
[2:02:45] redstonedad: That's too bad. I like Hellfire
[2:02:46] Grandwigg: Life is life,
[2:02:54] speed0sound7665: life is indeed life
[2:02:55] jenn_jennnn: dont worry Iskall you are doing a very very good job! :3
[2:02:55] cyalaterao: Just curious iskall what keybind do you use for vein miner?
[2:03:00] CeleiteStreams: What's the concept behind the greed stat?
[2:03:03] motku: May hellfire get the rest they need

[2:04:14] batt3ryac1d: @iskall85 you should let Dylan plan out one of the uniques that'd be fun
[2:04:15] SunflowerMead0w: when would catalysts be changed?
[2:04:18] melonhunt: tru, why have we not removed the eternals? it feels left out

[2:05:01] Hyweed_: inventory clear?
[2:05:06] OneTrueSpry: Heck yeah, and your not disappointing anyone iskall. Even if certain things aren't someone's cup of tea they can just opt out of whatever they dislike. But your keeping this place alive and putting your heart and energy into this game you worked so hard to make.
[2:05:08] cyalaterao: Hey Iskall just curious: Whats your keybind for vein miner?
[2:05:08] gbusha: Why did hell fire stop working on the mod?
[2:05:21] motku: Yes, the secret difficult scav
[2:05:21] sideburns_of_fire: can't wait to donate 20K bits to change the scav items required LUL
[2:05:28] Darkest9469: hunter?
[2:05:39] goggs1212: spec the thing that shows cchests
[2:05:42] JellyBeans59: any confirmation when update 13 is planned for?

[2:05:55] Darkwytchcraft: first time I've seen red brick in a dungeon
[2:05:56] norvillesdingus: ever thought of having set bonuses for gear. that would add an extra layer to transmogs
[2:05:58] Cloudetix: @Alfie2978 Given enough attempts, the statistics will allways average out.
[2:05:58] axolotine: windows 95 rat maze dungeon
[2:05:58] futureimagineer13: @OneTrueSpry YES! THANK YOU! The snalyd are so loud, that the dylans get overrun. He's too harsh on himself
[2:06:04] axolotine: does anyone know what I'm talking about

[2:06:39] Zeolith_: All this lucky hit, but still no luck.
[2:06:41] Cloudetix: @Alfie2978 If you don't believe me, toss a coin 100 times and find out for yourself
[2:06:42] jenn_jennnn: its because of the washedup.json
[2:06:44] GerbilOfWolves: hunter?
[2:06:46] goggs1212: spec into ornate
[2:06:47] pb_b: spec ornate?
[2:06:53] freddyb8: freddyb8 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 15 months! Hello sir, I've been loving VH. I'm so excited for the new update to come out. VH has been helping me with my mental health, and I thank you for that, sir. #nevereverleaving
[2:06:54] Kize_Gaming: Are you still planning on update 14 to have a 1.20 vanilla (ish) version ?
[2:06:57] batt3ryac1d: Too much sack NotLikeThis
[2:06:59] sabrina1202r: no hunter chat
[2:07:06] sabrina1202r: he is doing a challenge
[2:07:17] littlepepperbutt: Healthy!
[2:07:26] jenn_jennnn: oh i LOVE scav
[2:07:29] Darkest9469: missed an ornate
[2:07:37] suspenders92: I LOVE Scavs
[2:07:37] kibaz_x: Wand, classic
[2:07:39] 20egemen04: missed one sir
[2:07:40] Nightbot: www.youtube.com/iskall85 | www.twitter.com/iskall85 | https://youtube.com/@vodskall85
[2:07:41] Sicketjr: scavs are fun
[2:07:42] Alfie2978: @Cloudetix but it also can not. if you flip a coin statistics say 50/50 which is generallyu true but you can also go 100 tollses all tails, and keep going. there is a chance to never even out. its the nature of it. especially when on about something as complex as a vault run with so many variables let alone a simple coin flip
[2:07:44] SunflowerMead0w: i love scavs! especially now i'm on a server, theyre so fun!
[2:07:44] mortualiaa: late night? what time is it for you?
[2:07:47] melonhunt: @Kize_Gaming its not for u14, its for october i think
[2:07:49] littlepepperbutt: I like the firmness!
[2:07:50] Caren9593: where are the jars
[2:07:53] p5yy: scavs are the best
[2:07:53] magimaster101: Scavs are hard, but they are one of my favorites
[2:08:01] peppa_j: nah u dont need hunter
[2:08:06] player3977047: you missed ornates in the corner
[2:08:07] jbtjeee: Do scavs scale with vault difficulty?
[2:08:10] jn_mk: scaf isnt bad but sometimes its really frustrating when you get unlucky and those are the situations that stay in humans mind which makes people hate them  cuz they dont remember the regular ones that they completed only the bad ones
[2:08:12] dingllleberry: I <3 u iskall try not to worry too much about redditors
[2:08:13] SunflowerMead0w: also scavs give you bonus soul shards from scrapping the items you dont use

[2:08:17] Xarallon: hunter or dungeons it seems
[2:08:22] VogelVrouw: You can always just choose to not focus on the completion
[2:08:22] suspenders92: its also that feel good when you get an easy scan you're like 'ohhhh hell yeah!'
[2:08:24] etherealonegames: scavs are the most fun because they’re the most difficult. all the others are easy imo
[2:08:28] batt3ryac1d: Dammit my 7tv broke again what the heck
[2:08:32] lil1taly: my thought is if you dont like scavs, you can not run them, you have the freedom to craft any other vault type, its a waste of energy to complain you dont like them if you dont have to do them
[2:08:36] RomanEmpireThe2nd: Such a late stream
[2:08:40] cheekymissy: Played a different modpack the other day and it really made me appreciate all the time and effort that has gone into vault hunters. It felt so unbalanced, repetitive and unnecessarily grindy for no reason. People may leddit but you and the dev team have really created something special here.
[2:08:41] Kasszi_: @batt3ryac1d mine too
[2:08:47] sideburns_of_fire: that's an extra 4 jars
[2:08:48] motku: Yes
[2:08:48] VogelVrouw: Yes
[2:08:49] FireHorizon0: thats true
[2:08:50] futureimagineer13: yes
[2:08:53] skierbrenn: yes
[2:08:53] sideburns_of_fire: yeppers
[2:08:53] goggs1212: 3
[2:08:54] loupdrag: yes
[2:08:54] Skipadoo: the difficulty of scavs makes the dopamine rush when you complete one so much better
[2:08:57] ramnite_tv: Yes! There is skill expression in scavs
[2:08:59] wendymoto: scavs are fun for me because if it seems difficult and i actually clutch it i feel so good
[2:09:01] Bestywolf1122: Scav is the best obj and the fact that they are hard makes em that way. Its like playing a raid from Escape from Tarkov, survival isn't guaranteed so it gives you a nice little feeling
[2:09:01] futureimagineer13: and we're proud of you iskall
[2:09:02] Grandwigg: scav has RNG, but its more resource and time management
[2:09:03] pb_b: to some extent
[2:09:04] mejeree: It does get hard to like Scavs when every scav vault I do is 20* ripped pages or 9 pottery shards, and you'rs is 12 ripped pages >_<
[2:09:05] batt3ryac1d: @Kasszi_ must just be down then that's a little relief
[2:09:14] Cloudetix: @Alfie2978 Yes. it's possible. Just unlikely, and if you had that outcome if you kept flipping the coin you would eventually end up with a 50/50 split since it is just as likely that you get heads 100 times in a row. Now please just go learn how statistics work and stop arguing for the sake of arguing.
[2:09:16] matjea: hunter now ?
[2:09:23] fursten001: no skill expression => no fun imo
[2:09:28] Paakiihoro: is the pack big or heavy on computer
[2:09:30] OneTrueSpry: Scavs I would say are one of the best game modes to play when trying to learn and get better at this game.
[2:09:30] Hyweed_: +1
[2:09:41] Hyweed_: how many left? 🤔
[2:09:55] Darkwytchcraft: which may in itself be why some are frustrated, not being able to memorize a map
[2:09:58] Alfie2978: @Cloudetix says u, but each to their own. no need to push this all onto me. u think how u think, i think how i think based off my life experiences
[2:10:00] killerdayve: streaming when I’m not working / sleeping!!! yayaya
[2:10:04] motku: Oh, I played the odds. Cmon scav, be tough.
[2:10:04] VogelVrouw: I had a scav run where I got super close to completing but ended up dead bc of time (no more health for kiwis) it was upsetting but still the rush I felt that last minute was great
[2:10:08] skierbrenn: what about playing the field ;)
[2:10:12] killerdayve: I am doing the 100 days challenge with you but alone
[2:10:13] phonybologna9: how are the rooms oriented when generated? Is it relative to north-south-east-west or relative to the portal or random?
[2:10:15] matjea: can't complain if you don't try
[2:10:15] zRaiu: zRaiu subscribed with Prime. 
[2:10:17] aletijeras: yei, math
[2:10:19] magimaster101: echo machete paggers
[2:10:22] killerdayve: I’m at level 87
[2:10:22] Cloudetix: @Alfie2978 as Iskall says. It's math.
[2:10:24] norvillesdingus: I blame my lack of skill
[2:10:26] Xarallon: that's a good one too
[2:10:27] Kasszi_: "this is a free scav"
[2:10:31] Lashings: You have to create the opportunities to succeed in games with a lot of RNG. That is how good players thrive
[2:10:31] Cloudetix: @Alfie2978 Good night.
[2:10:33] Darkest9469: 1 min warning fruit at the ready
[2:10:35] elemelonnn: just came back from some business, how is the scav going?
[2:10:39] batt3ryac1d: it'd be cool if at the end there was a stat that tracked the % of the vault you explored.
[2:10:40] Alfie2978: @Cloudetix good night
[2:10:45] motku: Trixiest free scav
[2:10:45] bashleyyyyy: How many days are left on the challenge?
[2:10:49] Zeolith_: Scavs limit test and push the player to think creatively on their build and "if" they should optimize what they have.
[2:10:50] JashinFanatic: @iskall85 have you thought of an option to explore the vault in spectator after you die? to check pois you may have missed and learn
[2:10:50] erinlynn82: erinlynn82 subscribed at Tier 2. They've subscribed for 14 months! love this game
[2:10:54] mihea13: Time
[2:10:54] ThunderTubs: don't go chasing waterfalls...
[2:10:59] lorcan_oilcan: !nomic
[2:10:59] Nightbot: i am chilling and have very little to no mic, voice needs resting :D
[2:10:59] cheekymissy: The first time I completed a scav solo, clutching it in the last few seconds, it felt so amazing. So many games aren't a challenge any more, and I love that VH still pushes you
[2:11:06] Kastumoem: Elixir is just scav without the 50/50 and the amount of elixir is like the distribution of the rarity on the scav items
[2:11:09] mattertec: @mejeree I'd be willing to bet that if you looked at how many ripped pages he finds in total in a scav, it's probably around that number you're saying
[2:11:20] Skipadoo: hunter
[2:11:21] Kastumoem: Everything is just kicker
[2:11:21] shibubbles1417: Both!
[2:11:22] matjea: both
[2:11:22] drhallofduty: I haven’t been playing the game for a long time but I feel that scavs are doable in most situations. there’s the occasional ones I don’t finish but they’re still a lot of fun to play because they are challenging.
[2:11:23] tre_2018: Hunter
[2:11:24] Darkest9469: hunt
[2:11:25] StrangePanthers: Fruit
[2:11:28] peppa_j: neither
[2:11:28] sideburns_of_fire: must be close on jars now?
[2:11:29] axolotine: I'm a bad person to ask I love rng heavy games
[2:11:32] loading0110: fruit, your gonna die otherwise
[2:11:33] futureimagineer13: whatever saves my points?
[2:11:38] try_hardjosh: why does it say no mic next to ur title Mr iskall

[2:11:48] tre_2018: Hunter hunter hunter
[2:11:49] LeoTheLeopardNZ: I don't blame much on RNG, but when I do, I'm making a big blacksmith architect vaullt, and it makes the crystal unmodifiable at like 40% completion
[2:11:49] Zach010: No hunter. Just fruit
[2:11:54] krux702: fruit hunter
[2:11:55] ddSqueeze: Why are game sounds so low?
[2:11:57] MarkDatter: @try_hardjosh probably planned to have no mic, but its still less mic than usual
[2:12:04] nowthatisprettyepic: noooo
[2:12:07] Skipadoo: can kinda hear it in his voice he sounds tired
[2:12:17] try_hardjosh: @markdatter oh ok thanks
[2:12:20] Ginjajewfro: What's the philosophy of using a machete over a sickle?

[2:12:38] Nightbot: i am chilling and have very little to no mic, voice needs resting :D
[2:12:38] Darkwytchcraft: reason why I came here, was to find out how we ended up with such a tough scav so early in the vaulting , sometimes you gotta ask if you want to find out why or how things are designed, and the disabled community does like to challenge the mindset of regular playersand the devs of a game, please try to remember for my community it can be incredibly hard to feel included in a game.
[2:12:39] Zach010: Fruit us something everyone has, but it does make things riskier
[2:12:40] Myri_Sea: iskall pls my channel points :(

[2:13:51] EricMTGCast: I’m not good enough to finish many scabs but I accept that. as someone not a high skill problem it is hard to understand when you balance at higher than my skill because I don’t experience it. I see you as a player with a top level skill but you say you are not. that can be hard to accept.

[2:16:16] Grandwigg: hahahaha
[2:16:16] futureimagineer13: 2+2 does not equal an opinion. It equals 4
[2:16:18] VogelVrouw: Um actually maths doesn't exist, it's just copium
[2:16:18] elemelonnn: as mark twain said, there are three types of lies: lies, damn lies, and statistics 👺
[2:16:20] krux702: "well that's like just your opinion man"

[2:16:30] Hyweed_: a statistic is that in very big numbers it will happen o.O you can't cope on a small sample
[2:16:30] oliverthegreat93: they really just said facts aren’t true
[2:16:31] valkojam: Dang @coconuttiim

[2:16:36] aletijeras: x said it math ain't real it's the government
[2:16:37] Lutzio: math debunked, it was all an opinion
[2:16:38] ddSqueeze: someone went to school in the modern math era
[2:16:44] tre_2018: Math is a conspiracy created by aliens
[2:16:45] Jason_vK: When are you removing phantoms?

[2:17:18] zRaiu: i didnt mean it as math is fake, more like if something is said to have a 50% chance and you take that chance 10 times, you arent guarenteed to "win" 5 times
[2:17:24] pb_b: passive aggressive build seems great
[2:17:32] jaronnthechosen_arcetect: !shaders
[2:17:32] Nightbot: Iskall is using Complementary shaders, his settings file can be found in the VH discord here: https://tinyurl.com/mwah8naj
[2:17:33] l___Nick___l: I know that item rarity doesn’t affect scav items, but does item quantity affect them? If it increases the amount of slots in a chest are filled, does that increase the chance for a scav item?
[2:17:35] JustAlecz: update on vault trinkets bring combined? haven’t read or heard anything if it will still be upd 13

[2:17:44] sagittarius_greenbow: Too soon
[2:17:44] peppa_j: sadge
[2:17:44] Alfie2978: its a personal experience, someone can go their whole life getting 70/30's when its a 50/50. even if the statistics will eventually even out to 50/50 if they dont experiuence it, they don't experience it
[2:17:44] EnslavedMoist: bro who is dylan I'm so confused
[2:17:45] Zarey_z: too soon

[2:17:55] tre_2018: @EnslavedMoist we are all Dylan

[2:17:59] valkojam: Could keep rolling
[2:17:59] Grandwigg: @EnslavedMoist you are. and so am i.
[2:17:59] Zach010: Just extended pretty please, if all the hermits want to keep playing you might as well keep going ;P
[2:18:03] ddSqueeze: @zraiu that’s probability, not statistics

[2:18:12] AmethystVicious: @enslavedmoist we are Dylan
[2:18:13] EldritchDigger: I actuallly hate that iit's ending. I had hoped that Mumbo and Grian would pllay as well.
[2:18:13] LillyDaemon: I wish it would continue. I love seeing you have this much fun.
[2:18:14] az1mmer328: i need more
[2:18:15] EnslavedMoist: @tre_2018 understandable
[2:18:18] smash7711: Forgot hermit craft. Vault craft iskall man
[2:18:22] SparrowDotNet: @iskall85 Vein miner, heal, and dash seem to be must haves. Is this a bad take? Are there alternatives in the game or planned?
[2:18:23] tonTeufel: 3.5 weeks off with a vodskall video every other day LUL
[2:18:24] lorcan_oilcan: i think it would be very fun to keep it going after the 'end' and i cant imagine too many people would disagree
[2:18:26] motku: Thanks for the late strim @iskall85 iskHeart
[2:18:29] jackattack_657: Please do a season 2
[2:18:30] peppa_j: @Skipadoo ^this
[2:18:34] CeleiteStreams: Gonna miss Hermitcraft VH when it's done, one of my favorite series I've ever watched
[2:18:35] loverearth: have a vault hunter portal in the new hermit craft server, like you did to the empires world last season
[2:18:42] wometing: just tuned in why do you sound sad
[2:18:46] OneTrueSpry: Cheer100 Cheer100 would it be better to post room suggestions here or in discord?
[2:18:47] ValueTown: @iskall85 is there any chance you can spin animal pens off into it's own mod so other modpacks can use it to save the frames?
[2:18:47] red_mask333: well good things end quickly and continue those good times, make more NEW fun things
[2:18:52] robertf28: hallo iskall how is one of my favorite vault hunter
[2:18:55] BKJ133: it was nice to see wellsnight enjoying himself
[2:19:02] Darkest9469: @wometing he is tired its 1am for poor iskall
[2:19:02] Ginjajewfro: Quick question: Why use a machete over a sickle?
[2:19:11] VogelVrouw: @wometing chill voice resting tired stream
[2:19:20] Diggles11: can you get legendary modifiers on crafted gear?
[2:19:22] killerdayve: guys I got a legendary rampage legging today, plus 4 to rampage. 1 shot challenging dungeon movs!
[2:19:22] norvillesdingus: I don't watch you guys for the 100 day challenge. As long as people still upload videos, I'm happy!
[2:19:26] matjea: i get lots of knockback resist kegendaries
[2:19:28] VogelVrouw: @ginjajewfro to break wood in poi's
[2:19:35] flypig07: @iskall85 Could you add some text in the jewel applicator quest that tells how much mining speed one needs to instant mine wooden chests, ores, ect.?
[2:19:41] zRaiu: well aside from my silly comment, im glad to finally watch! havent been on twitch in a hot minute
[2:19:42] Ednoria: @BKJ133 I've loved watching welsknight!
[2:19:43] futureimagineer13: @zRaiu i mean, firstly, that's a pretty small sample size, and secondly, odds are chances, not guaruntees. that's the whole reason of odds. If odds were guarunteed, that would destroy the purpose of any random event
[2:19:44] jackattack_657: @iskall85 what are the chances of a season 2
[2:19:44] sparrow1720: Yeah, same thought as loverearth, have a season in tandem with next hc season
[2:19:50] goggs1212: did he complete the scav
[2:19:58] venatusrex_: venatusrex_ subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 14 months! 
[2:20:02] Felver08: @Ginjajewfro To break the occasional wood trapdoor in front of chests
[2:20:04] SSlotts: As a follow up to my previous question I think mining gadgets threw it off but there are a lot of ways to get overworld materials but feels no real way of spending them. Feels like everything cost vault diamond and nothing uses overworld diamond.
[2:20:05] Xc4liber_playz: I love the ISKALL
[2:20:08] its_just_belle: I just started playing vault hunters, thanks for the mod iskall!
[2:20:13] sideburns_of_fire: RenDog's King Story, VintageBeef's Card Game, Tango's Decked Out 2, and Iskall's Vault Hunters, these last two years have really seen the Hermit's not only branch out but come together to support each other, what a great community! iskHeart
[2:20:13] tre_2018: "Keep your chin up...and the other one."
[2:20:14] cyalaterao: Hey Iskall just curious: Whats your keybind for vein miner?

[2:20:24] oliverthegreat93: can the flesh club theme be more frequent?
[2:20:31] Gabinska: dont worry about chances, they are just numbers for people to cope with
[2:20:33] nelly2606: Are you surprised by any of the other hermits playing VH
[2:20:33] littlepepperbutt: iskHeart
[2:20:35] Kasszi_: @oliverthegreat93 heheh

[2:20:55] OneTrueSpry: Between hermit craft season 10 and vault hunters smp is gonna take up alot of time.
[2:20:56] loading0110: season 10 of hermitcraft is just vaulthunters? I wish

[2:21:15] red_mask333: The "I will I will" reminds of what i would say to my mom about cleaning my room. I would clean a bit and then foreget about it and then create more mess again
[2:21:16] matjea: mumbo tries vaulthunter (i get he might not like this type of game so isn't in this SMP)
[2:21:16] lazypandaman: and etho right
[2:21:17] Skipadoo: the iskall-etho dynamic is unmatched

[2:21:24] themortdigger1: Ethos?
[2:21:25] nys8902: Will Etho be joining the SMP?
[2:21:26] Darkwytchcraft: Please remember that not all of us are trying to bite your head off.  Sometimes it can be a context issue when doing chats.
[2:21:27] killerdayve: and maybe etho hehehe
[2:21:28] Darkest9469: love u buddy
[2:21:29] Grandwigg: I'd say overall iskall has shown a great example of how to keep a healthy outlook. its great to see.
