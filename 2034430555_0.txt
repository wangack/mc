[0:33:10] icedeno7: its consistent unless it doesnt work
[0:33:12] gottesgesandter: One thing I never got about From's old games is why they make so many good bosses optional and a lot of bad ones mandatory to beat the game @GinoMachino

[0:33:46] AtomicAziz: hi
[0:33:47] icds_nutz: @gottesgesandter what do you mean specifically by "old games"? Elden Ring does it too, the only Fromsoft game where all the good bosses are mandatory is Sekiro IS ending

[0:45:54] Mister_Witty: so on this route you have 3 spell  slots and in your other video you only had 2
[0:46:38] Mister_Witty: normally you dont get the third slot until after iron king so you only have yearn and dark weapon for skellies
[0:46:55] idogecuh: is dark fog just a better poison?
[0:47:03] Mister_Witty: and you get the third slot for soul appease for tseldora
[0:47:28] Easy_ww: dark fog you did on sotfs ab LUL
[0:47:49] Mister_Witty: if you need extra souls just do sinner before skellies
[0:48:24] Easy_ww: there's no point sinner earlier
[0:48:30] Easy_ww: rotten is faster
[0:48:43] idogecuh: could you save skellies for when you have a +10?

[0:51:23] Aevee: @Rsuu ds3
[0:51:53] BenderZGreat: @Rsuu probably whichever one you're most comfortable with
[0:51:56] Easy_ww: so, craftsman hammer without counter hits you need a +3
[0:52:09] Hob_play_Hitman: ds2 is not even a proper souls game. It wasn't made by Miyazaki, he and all other fromsoft OGs were working on bloodborne at the time. ds2 was made by a team of interns who implemented questionable ideas with questionable quality. ds2 is a souls-like, not a Souls game, despite its name.
[0:52:18] idogecuh: how do you get craftsman hammer?

[1:52:07] boyoboyo343: what's baby jump?
[1:52:14] Axx____: @jajaskink YEP -50€
[1:52:15] sinnerredacted: and maybe try YouTube as well. I found Gino from YouTube
[1:52:22] JayReezy00: i never realized that the range of the jump can vary
[1:52:35] kuczaq: is it like a second jump in elden ring?
[1:52:38] disukedark: no im decent maybe not godlike like gino but i can hold my own maybe thinking of a no hit or sumthin but idk howq long that would be im skilled but yes i lack some skill lol so i guess that can be a pointer
[1:52:48] boyoboyo343: is it random?
[1:52:49] icds_nutz: gg
[1:52:49] MachinoBot: docnotL
[1:52:51] NightSathe: Helloo
[1:52:52] matt_aot: gg
[1:52:55] jajaskink: Baby jumps are hilarius for casual playthrough, but can be anoying, and for any run like this or speedruns, is absolutly ass
[1:53:02] kiel_ok: clapped
[1:53:08] kuczaq: @disukedark i dont mean gaming skill, prob more like social
[1:53:15] maguslion: Throw head= instant dead LUL
[1:53:18] jajaskink: Reminds me of the baby jump in farum azula in the god run 3
[1:53:27] Easy_ww: do it
[1:53:30] Mister_Witty: which jump in Brume?
[1:53:36] nerefwow: almost said god run 3 level 1
[1:53:38] matt_aot: monakS jump
[1:53:40] disukedark: when you dont have audience to chat with how can my social skill even improve? start talking to myself?
[1:53:47] kuczaq: yeah
[1:53:56] kuczaq: and yt videos
[1:53:58] boyoboyo343: isn't there an invader here?
[1:54:03] matt_aot: on scholar
[1:54:06] JayReezy00: does the jump distance depend on joystick input? i played ds2 on mnk
[1:54:28] thaewrapt: @JayReezy00 It's possible on both.
[1:54:29] disukedark: i would post my YT link but i know others dont like advertising on their streams XD
[1:54:38] Easy_ww: you should also do the second jump in brume COPIUM
[1:54:40] thaewrapt: @thaewrapt *babyjump I mean
[1:54:50] jajaskink: You shouldn't really Risk the jump, It seemed to be safe if taked really slowly in brume tower, but of course is your run, is not on me
[1:55:04] JayReezy00: @thaewrapt i never noticed... thats weird
[1:55:14] boyoboyo343: the bow really seems like such a great ho hit run weapon
[1:55:27] Easy_ww: it's not a bad idea when is 100% consistent GIGACHAD
[1:55:29] BenderZGreat: @boyoboyo343 in this game yeah, not so much in other games
[1:55:45] motoboy1803: Adult jump
[1:55:51] boyoboyo343: @boyoboyo343 i've seen people use it for weak enemies in ds1
[1:55:53] boyoboyo343: the zombie dude
[1:55:54] disukedark: sorry didnt mean to complain here ill stop XD this is indeed a great looking practice though im sensing a record for the master run
[1:55:55] boyoboyo343: s
[1:56:12] BenderZGreat: @boyoboyo343 yeah it's got some good uses in DS1 but you basically never see it in DS3
[1:56:21] kuczaq: @disukedark all good man
[1:56:28] FredGets: whoa, this is vanilla? not scholar right?
[1:56:29] thaewrapt: @JayReezy00 It's not that noticable but it's enough to fail some skips and die in the runs.
[1:56:37] Easy_ww: yes i do, there's also a video with a really good line explaining the jump
[1:56:38] matt_aot: https://clips.twitch.tv/FunnyAveragePterodactylOMGScoots-YqMfEl04-BfJ2iWr

[2:03:17] motoboy1803: @kuczaq isn't it in the pocket edition?
[2:03:20] jajaskink: Easy said that the archer have a small chance of shoting you first, soo It wouldn't be strange that the archer thing hapened
[2:03:23] Thenastyraven: @JayReezy00 Bonk them with the old knight hammer
[2:03:32] Ironkuma: gino just out here "my chat sure is quiet today"

[2:04:58] kiel_ok: greenscreen haircut?
[2:05:00] icds_nutz: no achievement for Smelter Demon YEP
[2:05:11] jajaskink: Belfry luna is somehow needed for achievment right ?
[2:05:30] jajaskink: *belfry sol
[2:06:00] Tarnished_from_Poland: slowly but Shirley
[2:06:32] toxicboa: ds2 jump looks so floaty wtf
[2:06:54] lordptk: @toxicboa way better than DS1/BB/DS3 jump
[2:07:38] toxicboa: the witcher 3 jump looks so unnatural and goofy bc you just stay in the same spot while your legs go really high up
[2:07:50] Komugi_: What dictates if you can do a big jump or a baby jump?
[2:08:02] jajaskink: The amount of run request is pretty hefty PepeLaugh, of course no Rush needed, the fact that you have no hit runs request enabled is a crazy idea
[2:08:14] disukedark: why not jump over some enemies? a couple i see doable but im sure your not with good reason i dont know about XD still fresh to speedrun community XD
[2:08:17] matt_aot: gg
[2:08:17] MachinoBot: docnotL
[2:08:32] vectorb0i4: I forgot how impeccable the sound design of this game is
[2:08:43] KoenigOne: @jajaskink one day they'll become 0 Shirley
[2:08:45] kiel_ok: @komugi_ usually your age and height LUL jk I don’t know the actual answer
[2:09:00] jajaskink: @disukedark this is literally the polar oposite of a speedrun, this is a no hit, which is needed to be taken very slowly
[2:09:21] Tarnished_from_Poland: Is explorer most optimal class for nohit?
[2:09:23] toxicboa: the ds2 ui looks so fancy compared to other games, atleast given its time frame
[2:09:31] disukedark: @jajaskink ah thats the reasoning i was assuming but had to ask for the knowledge XD
[2:09:38] fredferd: Oh shit, fire giant next?
[2:09:41] lordptk: @jajaskink you still want to be quick, the longer your run is the more time is lost when resetting
[2:09:42] matt_aot: these pants KEKL
[2:10:05] BenderZGreat: best fashion
[2:10:24] jajaskink: @lordptk that's kinda true, and having nuclear damage, i think i was kinda wrong
[2:10:34] toxicboa: holy shit you DO go flying with that jump
[2:10:49] jajaskink: I love that jump soo much
[2:11:27] debit_1: hello
[2:11:39] KoenigOne: aim
[2:11:44] jajaskink: Grabing the key for the brume tower DLCin SOTFS is soo awful, with those horrendous salamanders enemies that could be a bit of a problem in a no hit run
[2:12:18] spleen17: firstGarf
[2:13:20] motoboy1803: What was your first souls game?
[2:13:43] HeroOfThyme: KEKW
[2:13:47] matt_aot: the lever messed him up
[2:13:47] KoenigOne: OMEGALUL
[2:13:51] BenderZGreat: om
[2:14:06] Mister_Witty: maybe pull lever then shoot him
[2:14:16] disukedark: oh you pull the lever wait for plat then shoot big turtle since he doesnt have a path to you till plat is in place
[2:14:16] Tarnished_from_Poland: Garf
[2:14:16] MachinoBot: garf
[2:14:23] kastrels: the color scheme isnt great
[2:14:30] enteplease: can you rank the games? @GinoMachino
[2:15:12] motoboy1803: So you would not recommend it?
[2:15:23] lindersen1: Ds1 had the map structure ds2 had the ost ds3 had the combat imo
[2:15:24] disukedark: oh you pull the lever wait for plat then shoot big turtle since he doesnt have a path to you till plat is in place
[2:15:33] matt_aot: Chatting
[2:15:51] MachinoBot: BOW ONLY ALL BOSSES NEW VIDEO https://youtu.be/yAxAOGgV04g
[2:16:06] WhatButtonDoiHit: why not do the jump?
[2:16:19] lindersen1: Gael Pog
[2:16:37] ordealMaru: hey gino
[2:16:39] shinytrashcan: Gael was really fun, Midir was the bane of my existence
[2:16:47] WhatButtonDoiHit: True. Never had a problem with that jump, but never did a no hit run so ya
[2:17:01] gottesgesandter: ds3 was too depressing but it felt the best out of the trilogy
[2:17:05] ordealMaru: is it guaranteed that the big guy burns to death?
[2:17:17] pravus___: true less moving parts (aka hard tech) makes things more consistent and easy
[2:17:18] lindersen1: Same here however it cant be denied that midir is fair and def the best dragon boss in souls
[2:17:36] lindersen1: Hated him though
[2:17:42] matt_aot: the jump seems safer KEKL
[2:17:54] shinytrashcan: idk,  felt he was obnoxious with the camera
[2:17:59] Easy_ww: that archer is Concerned
[2:18:23] pravus___: my issue with midir is just that he moves so much for me
[2:18:34] maohayato: midir is mid
[2:18:39] pravus___: like even staying in front of him he moves so much
[2:18:58] nazmoza: Midir is annoying. only DS3 boss i struggled with
[2:19:00] axrykaoun: do you use savestates for ds2
[2:19:07] nazmoza: i actually love DS3 aesthetic
[2:19:31] ssjtramm: Is there a VOD of Gino's first plaything of elden ring?
[2:19:37] nazmoza: i guess its more "generic" in retrospect
[2:19:47] nazmoza: in terms of unique world
[2:19:52] matt_aot: @ssjtramm sadly not, he also didnt stream the whole thing
[2:20:18] WhatButtonDoiHit: Gino not goth enough KEK
[2:20:31] lordptk: and DS3 is a bit samey, I like how varied and inspired many of DS2 areas look
[2:20:40] onsguren: whats your favourite gino?
[2:20:52] lindersen1: I mean it makes sense though since ds3 and bloodborne both are at the climax of a dying world
[2:20:55] Mister_Witty: gino claims his first elden ring playthrough was lost in the ether but we all know it was a corporate conspiracy to cover it up. Miyazaki had to pay a lot to get rid of it
[2:21:07] ssjtramm: @matt_aot dang. The earliest I found was a no hit run. Is that right?
[2:21:13] disukedark: @MisterWittyTV facts
[2:21:21] chaoskiller05: @lordptk I just like how much variety exists in the weapons and builds, and with enough knowledge you can take so many different routes through the earlygame
[2:21:23] matt_aot: @ssjtramm i guess so
[2:21:34] chaoskiller05: in DS3 most builds are one trick ponies and your route is a straight line
[2:21:39] Heytherebrotherwhatsup: murakumo pvping on iron keep bridge was the shit in this game
[2:21:46] ibeiji: Is this Dark Souls?
[2:21:56] KoenigOne: @ibeiji Elden Ring DLC
[2:22:02] lordptk: @ibeiji it is Dark Souls 2
[2:22:13] DankeJolash: sniffthenewchatter

[2:22:17] MachinoBot: docnotL
[2:22:24] ibeiji: @lordptk Thanks, bro
[2:22:49] gottesgesandter: ds3 is focused on being a nextremely balanced linear bossrush experience and excells at that
[2:22:54] Easy_ww: ptsd menu Deadge
[2:23:06] FredGets: does it seem to happen usually after you've aimed with a bow?
[2:23:14] chaoskiller05: @gottesgesandter it really does, but the sacrifices to variety and freedom are undeniable
[2:23:20] rowballforever: what’s up Gino just got outta work happy to see you streaming
[2:23:26] WhatButtonDoiHit: @ibeiji the game a streamer is playing is always listed in their info
[2:23:27] Taoisman: Bro the cam fuckery in DS1 just yeeted me into the New Londo water. Just moves on its own because you passed a column or some shit
[2:23:52] motoboy1803: Avatars or tree spirits?
[2:23:54] chaoskiller05: @Taoisman you can turn that off with an option called camera auto recovery or smth
[2:24:09] kuczaq: GIGACHAD logic
[2:24:12] Taoisman: Yeah booted it on a different PC and it was reset LUL
[2:24:15] KoenigOne: 7
[2:24:29] lordptk: DS3 has this running through theme of final decay, of things coming o an end, and it doubles down on that, a litle bit to the detriment of variety
[2:24:30] matt_aot: with baby jump its free
[2:24:41] matt_aot: mod*
[2:24:43] crackedlantern: cant tell you how many hob runs I've seen fail that jump lmao

[2:25:22] crackedlantern: I don't know if it was during all bosses, but I've definitely seen him die to that in brb's. Probably older runs

[2:40:24] thaewrapt: Yeah, powder bois strat is cool but very random.

[2:41:42] dolos6331: plus 4 rapier is tragic dude
[2:41:45] thaewrapt: Is Big guy yearnable?

[2:42:51] Skull_Prime: Oh, they load the thing on YouTube, right?
[2:43:13] mastergecko2: The hype for elden ring was pretty intense
[2:43:19] Skull_Prime: Honestly, if you said something else was more exciting I'd unfollow and report
[2:43:22] Heytherebrotherwhatsup: given from's track record with DLCs this ones gonna be crazy good

[2:43:59] dolos6331: Sadge
[2:44:03] dolos6331: FeelsBadMan
[2:44:03] TheDarkL2p: @motoboy1803 yeah because you dont need to do 2 keys combo to do things like a parry for example
[2:44:07] dolos6331: WHYGOD
[2:44:09] KatAttackk: Oh boy I sure can't wait for the release of the greatly anticipated Hollow Knight Silksong Kappa
[2:44:25] TheDarkL2p: but i feel like its overrated how more easy it is on controller compared to keyboard
[2:44:25] Skull_Prime: @motoboy1803 keyboard is harder to master but it is better actually. It is more precise and the menu is faster
[2:44:26] kuczaq: can't you cast yearn on the big guy with binoculars after you dropped the barrel guys?
[2:44:27] BestGuyShadow: Gideon ng+7 is fucking me upppp lmao

[2:46:03] motoboy1803: @skull_skull_skull I find it really hard to parry on pc
[2:46:06] AZCollins: Amazon would never allow that
[2:46:33] hy96x: ds2 all bosses no hit has never been achieved before wtf

[2:46:47] dolos6331: true
[2:46:53] thaewrapt: You can also try from the other spot (the guy with the firebombs) but not sure if that would help.
[2:47:02] hy96x: boatyDeleteImmediately
[2:47:04] Skull_Prime: @motoboy1803 you will need to rebind the keys until you find a good setup for you

[2:50:46] madmanPecos: elden

[3:37:14] AnAbsoluteManiac: AnAbsoluteManiac subscribed with Prime. 
[3:37:14] Easy_ww: you bb in the stairs
[3:37:42] motoboy1803: Is lies of p hard game?
[3:38:02] vhaisman: Did you not say earlier that it would be in release order?
[3:38:13] madmanPecos: gael as the final boss would be a sick ending if ds3 is game 3
[3:38:17] yayeet42069yayeet: magic with mods
[3:38:21] Wisepii: Isnt ds3 more dangerous?
[3:38:28] cosmic_octopus: @motoboy1803 yes
[3:38:31] Norrec451: YEAH, conjurer stealth archer
[3:38:48] kalibula123: illusion is not bad, make enemies kill each other
[3:38:57] AnAbsoluteManiac: dude your awesome your the reason im doing a lvl1 elden ring stream and i dont think i would have been able to get as far as i have without watching you. im just about to the godskin duo
[3:39:08] motoboy1803: @cosmic_octopus is it worth playing?
[3:39:33] cosmic_octopus: @motoboy1803 yes, everyone who's played it likes it
[3:39:41] Tarnished_from_Poland: FirstTimeChadder
[3:39:44] amelhade: easiest and by far the clunkiest
[3:40:08] chandlergraham21: Good luck Brandon! Dyck down these bosses.
[3:40:29] motoboy1803: @cosmic_octopus thanks i just wanted others opinion because it's going to be my next game
[3:40:34] Norrec451: so many random dogs in normal ds2
[3:40:34] puptime: moistLove dviperWicked whatifBeg whites69Hi dviperShy
[3:40:59] Mister_Witty: doxxed
[3:41:08] cosmic_octopus: @motoboy1803 it was made with love
[3:41:48] motoboy1803: @cosmic_octopus a hard game made with love sounds fake
[3:42:21] Easy_ww: tbh you don't even need bb for gargoyles, with counter hits is 2 r1, or you can do 1 r1 and 1 r2
[3:42:36] Easy_ww: but not sure with +9
[3:42:39] cosmic_octopus: @motoboy1803 I'd say Sekiro is also hard and made well
[3:42:47] Norrec451: I mean compared to Lost bastille in ds2 Scholar
[3:42:57] Easy_ww: but should be enough
[3:43:10] motoboy1803: @cosmic_octopus already finished it and you're right
[3:43:19] Norrec451: I've seen like 4 dogs that I don't remember in my most recent run
[3:43:20] SpyderNookie: SpyderNookie subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 3 months! machinoHi
[3:44:25] DogsHeadCigarettes: Last time I played DS2 I tried to fight Bonfire Ascetic'd Bell Gargoyles for the ring they drop and got absolutely clapped.
[3:45:04] Norrec451: So cathartic to watch you utterly destroy this boss
[3:45:14] Norrec451: heckin gargoyles
[3:45:20] KoenigOne: Is it possible to do a run where you kill every single ER enemy and make the world empty?
[3:45:23] Mister_Witty: Ez Clap
[3:45:26] Easy_ww: the fall damage you take from the first drop (pharros lockstone room) + this other drop is enough for rtsr
[3:45:51] MachinoBot: BOW ONLY ALL BOSSES NEW VIDEO https://youtu.be/yAxAOGgV04g
[3:46:00] motoboy1803: What's that "nostalgic ahh" background music
[3:46:13] IyaJenkei: if they ever do a ds2 remake i hope they overhaul a lot of the bosses and make them better. only thing the game lacks imo
[3:46:13] Norrec451: coldplay
[3:46:26] Norrec451: rule the world I think
[3:46:34] IyaJenkei: except covetous demon. keep it the same
[3:46:51] Mister_Witty: the drop off ruin sentinels platform is something else to consider
[3:47:36] IyaJenkei: even just something like giving the bosses 3x the health would go a long way
[3:48:05] chandlergraham21: pretty crazy how big this community has gotten because of Elden ring. the dlc better be badass
[3:48:08] Norrec451: @IyaJenkei Yeah, give all these gargoyles 3x more hp
[3:48:10] Easy_ww: i've been doing this for the last 3 years, i can remember only a few times i got hit
[3:48:16] Norrec451: that'll go over well
[3:49:11] Easy_ww: they can shoot you sometimes
[3:49:13] Easy_ww: very rare tho
[3:50:14] motoboy1803: @easy_ww 10% chance of happening is too much for a no hit run
[3:50:34] Easy_ww: it's not 10% LUL
[3:50:39] chandlergraham21: at this point Gino’s next run will be all bosses all achievements god run 3 no hit while blindfolded hands tied behind his back
[3:51:04] blaise_: a yearn
[3:51:04] SirBingusSouls: do you think DS2 is as bad as everyone says it is?
[3:51:44] blaise_: such patience
[3:51:55] IyaJenkei: i cant wait until he "accidentally" get the run while practicing. again.
[3:51:57] motoboy1803: @easy_ww LUL
[3:52:16] N1to_0: do you think DS2 is as bad as everyone says it is?
[3:52:22] motoboy1803: @easy_ww so is it near to none?
[3:52:31] Norrec451: ds2 is fine, though I wish the game was more forward about iframe mechanics
[3:52:38] Easy_ww: @motoboy1803 yes
[3:52:53] TastyAMG: DS2 is one of the most underrated games of all time YEP
[3:53:02] chandlergraham21: would it be possible to do no hit RL1 all bosses in Elden Ring.
[3:53:05] DarkAm1r: it is pretty flawed tho
[3:53:09] madmanPecos: dlc COPIUM
[3:53:13] kuczaq: i still think the PVP was the best in ds2
[3:53:18] motoboy1803: @easy_ww it actually happened to me twice in a row
[3:53:24] AbassAli092: I keep checking the steamDB page
[3:53:37] shinytrashcan: are they huffing weapons-grade copium again, or are there legit news on the DLC?
[3:53:37] MachinoBot: YesYesYes
[3:53:52] Jorgerg49: !requests

[3:56:49] skavengutterrunner: Hey i just wanted to ask i heard Gino recently mention that he play skyrim no dmg run idk if on stream or vid but is there way to acces video from it?
[3:57:33] shaken_blake: Sup gino! love the youtube vids. you look like a younger Dr. King Schultz from Django
[3:57:57] DaBig_Cheese_: I cant believe I can say this
[3:58:08] DaBig_Cheese_: but I have officially finished my first from soft game
[3:58:14] blaise_: grats
[3:58:15] DaBig_Cheese_: finally done with Elden Ring

[3:58:23] ThighsExprt: @skavengutterrunner he posted the video on youtube
[3:58:33] DaBig_Cheese_: but like 150 hours total
[3:58:35] hotsonofmom: wait so why is scholar slower
[3:58:37] blaise_: only 50 hours on first souls game wtf
[3:58:44] DaBig_Cheese_: this game made me quit TWICE
[3:58:50] blaise_: is this scholar? I remember it looking better
[3:58:52] kuczaq: @DaBig_Cheese_ only 50? that's pretty good for the first souls game
[3:58:52] skavengutterrunner: @ThighsExprt i was looking for it but couldnt find it i will try again
[3:58:59] DaBig_Cheese_: @kuczaq Is that good?
[3:59:04] madmanPecos: more enemies to clear out in scholar
[3:59:09] DaBig_Cheese_: well it wasnt my first save
[3:59:14] DaBig_Cheese_: I had played elden ring before
[3:59:18] ThighsExprt: @skavengutterrunner look up ginomachino skyrim on youtube
[3:59:20] DaBig_Cheese_: but then I quit out of frustration
[3:59:21] kuczaq: i dunno, i take about 80h to mostly clear eldenring
[3:59:24] skavengutterrunner: @ThighsExprt yeah got it now thank you
[3:59:27] Easy_ww: i would just go with stored quitout
[3:59:30] DaBig_Cheese_: and came back to finish the game
[3:59:31] KoenigOne: OMEGALUL
[3:59:41] DaBig_Cheese_: 125 level total
