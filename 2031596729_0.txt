[3:47:57] erikaidkk: @animeboy691 its defo not the most popular smp though, in its prime smpearth smplive dsmp and qmsp are arguable bigger.on par with it
[3:47:58] xNynth: @runebacca took me 8 months 🙃
[3:48:15] runebacca: oh god hopefully it doesnt take 8 months
[3:48:39] ToolFool: I heard last month that my previous job layed off 30% of their workforce. I'm glad I left when I had the chance.
[3:48:57] xNynth: good luck runebacca 🤞 mine probably took that long because i wanted to work remotely so i can travel to visit my gf in the UK for prolongued times
[3:49:30] divinepx: @erikaidkk hermitcraft definitly the biggest especially since its vanilla not alot of people watch modded content. hermitcrafts get millions of views to the likes of dream also

[3:50:36] erikaidkk: @divinepx i have to disagree in its prime dsmp for example was averaging 100-600k LIVE viewers and millions of views on youtube, hermitcraft is big but defo not the biggest
[3:50:44] 大綿津見神: You seem to be missing someone from a stall
[3:51:13] divinepx: @erikaidkk dream smp lasted ayear hermitcraft going on its like 12th years. get serious
[3:52:18] erikaidkk: @divinepx how long it lasted doesnt deminish how insanely popular it was? qsmp is also highly popular atm,, i never said hermit craft wasnt popular i just said it wasnt the most popular

[3:56:47] 大綿津見神: High school is too small of a place.
[3:56:58] 大綿津見神: There's a much bigger world out there!
[3:57:16] divinepx: @erikaidkk imo 12 years of consistent massive success makes something more popular than a 1 year fad that had massive numbers. but thats me, to each their own tbh
[3:57:17] iamcrazyhehe: I should stare out the window alot and daydream in highschool and people said I looked scary staring out NotLikeThis
[3:57:20] jiminly25: yes
[3:57:26] kalaksed: I went to... i think 5 high schools? My family moved a lot. 38 states in 20 years
[3:57:37] jiminly25: I try to block out my high school years
[3:57:46] divinepx: high school is such a short time in life none of it matter! dont worry its way better once youre out

[3:58:03] Binnbe: still not whitelisted for gta?
[3:58:11] kalaksed: Oh yeah. My siblings and i dealt with it different ways. Either being super loner or super social to make friends fast

[4:00:28] erikaidkk: @divinepx thats fair enough! i wouldn't say 12 years of consistent success is true more like 6-8, if you asked most people about minecraft i belive most would say the dsmp which imo defines the most popular
[4:00:29] heyitshaven: I'm so excited to see you play it!!!
