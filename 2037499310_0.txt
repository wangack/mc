[1:48:59] Mayangel442: no wayyyyyyy
[1:49:05] blyurr: I’m someone who wants to do architecture but the only reason is so that I do Minecraft irl
[1:49:45] Mayangel442: what thats amazing, I'll have to check it out
[1:50:19] themoonducks: I wanna studie architecture just because my fav character is a architect #silly
[1:50:43] blyurr: moonducks ur so real for that
[1:50:47] meadflo: I want to study history cause I’m gay
[1:51:25] oshmusic42: catJAM catJAM
[1:51:29] CallicoCatLover_69: i want to study architecture to make pretty houses but I’m afraid of math
[1:51:32] 00atlas0: im a graphic design major cause i like colors
[1:51:38] quesachilla: im studying art therapy so i can make ppl in hospitals have an accessible form of self expression
[1:52:12] quesachilla: didnt u only go for a semester
[1:52:38] theshrekrepublic: what was your major!
[1:52:43] 00atlas0: WHAT
[1:52:57] quesachilla: esp when the teachers all expect a part time jobs worth of artwork a week
[1:53:03] 00atlas0: i cant even comprehend trying to do that
[1:53:14] fatiguedkitty: idk why so many people try to tell me that it is but school is already stressful enough i could only imagine school + work
[1:53:22] blyurr: wait you can go to collage without a major?
[1:53:49] quesachilla: they usually make you choose after sophmore year
[1:53:55] 00atlas0: NODDERS i started undeclared
[1:54:09] 00atlas0: WHAT
[1:54:41] 00atlas0: thats so shitty
[1:54:53] theshrekrepublic: wait you apply for college in January?
[1:55:18] 00atlas0: yeah usually
[1:55:30] theshrekrepublic: is early action only available in some areas?
[1:55:37] oshmusic42: depends on the school
[1:56:12] skaidaive: why would you apply without a subject in mind?? here in the UK you have to pick a subject when aopplying
[1:56:38] quesachilla: @skaidaive uk and us college are very different
[1:56:42] 00atlas0: college has gotten out of hand with costs
[1:57:18] skaidaive: @quesachilla yeah i know that! but surely the point of going is to study a specific subject
[1:57:23] fIea21: the cost of education is so crazy with no promise of a high paying job after graduating
[1:57:23] theshrekrepublic: as someone in the U.S., the college system is absolutely wild compared to other countries
[1:57:24] fatiguedkitty: its so cute
[1:57:33] themoonducks: lemon
[1:57:45] 00atlas0: in my experience with private schools the sticker amount isn't true cause my school gives out INSANE scholarships and grants
[1:57:55] quesachilla: @quesachilla you have to do general education classes so you can just get them out of the way and then stuff ur last 2 years w core major classes
[1:58:08] meadflo: when i found out people apply to like 25 diff college
[1:58:09] madi_i_guesss: helloooo <3
[1:58:20] theshrekrepublic: isn’t the US also on a harder grading scale?
[1:58:48] skaidaive: @quesachilla ohhh that's weird to me!! i went to uni specifically to study anthropology with modules only in that area!
[1:58:50] quesachilla: i applied to two bc i forgor to apply to my top school lmao
[1:59:04] 00atlas0: per school and per professor
[1:59:23] fIea21: @theshrekrepublic technically but uk exams are typically harder so a good grade is like 50-70%
[1:59:33] quesachilla: grading in the us is rly stupid,,
[2:00:04] fatiguedkitty: i remember having to take a cambridge pre-aice exam and i wanted to cry
[2:00:07] theshrekrepublic: performance based measurement?
[2:00:19] skaidaive: i've never understood what a gpa is cause in the UK it depends on the subject what grade you get
[2:00:24] themoonducks: the build reminds me of a lemon
[2:00:42] 00atlas0: thats so cool
[2:01:12] fatiguedkitty: i wish it was like that where i live
[2:01:31] robbothebobbin: i feel like thats better than just memorising

[2:02:01] meadflo: hi raiders <3
[2:02:03] theshrekrepublic: @skaidaive In the US we have a system that like depending on the difficulty of the class you take a certain number is included in the average
[2:02:16] oldplyr: I spelled it wrong - and it took more than 1/2 my viewers to another channel - F
[2:02:22] theshrekrepublic: so ab academic class is 4, honors is 4.5 and AP is 5
[2:02:37] meadflo: in the uk you can kinda fail your schoolwork for years as long you do well in your final exams
[2:02:37] theshrekrepublic: and each letter grade it decreases by 1
[2:02:41] skaidaive: in the uk in some subjects it's a combination of skill based and memory because we have to memorise everything then apply it correctly to the exam situation
[2:02:44] 00atlas0: OMG
[2:02:49] robbothebobbin: zess
[2:02:54] skaidaive: @theshrekrepublic ohhh that makes sense!!
[2:02:55] robbothebobbin: yess
[2:02:59] blyurr: are we actually gonna put cats here StinkyCheese
[2:03:07] 00atlas0: full stop if i had unlimited money i would hire u to design a town and then id build it
