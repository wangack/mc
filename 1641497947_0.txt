[4:08:47] ErgoMageSteph: @MacTimiT im pretty sure he knows, pls stop spamming
[4:08:48] deadmanifest: if they keep dying it would make sense that they would all end up back at spawn together

[4:13:59] redoc_77: JUST GO TO AN END CITY
[4:14:02] TheSaltyMelons: Piston pushes you underneath end portal, you get teleported to your overworld coords inend @SmallAnt
[4:14:02] just_puffin: you've spent as long looking for goats as end city would take
[4:14:03] Maxur1: they will finish the end city goal before anyone finds a goat
[4:14:07] scorchty_79: did you know that you can get laid by using ARSON?
[4:14:08] Chromosphere_: @tripski27 if they were functional then they wouldn't be fake would they

[4:14:33] Naret03: 4 people looking for a goat for hours and nothing lmao
[4:14:34] UnderdoneElm77: If a piston pushes you into the end portal then you get teleported to the wrong coord. If you do it leave most of your stuff in a chest and brign an ender pearl with you though, because you likely get placed above void
[4:14:36] theboiaction: i am saving for spevial discord role
[4:14:37] BatridYT: never would have guessed
[4:14:37] notorious_bunny6: Forget the end city. Go to the goat city

[4:14:46] awsmrs: @qqaim 6 effects
[4:14:46] CelestialAngel0: when you under the end portal, and push yourself with a piston, the game registers you moving after you jump and enter the end, and it then takes you to the relative coords of the push
[4:14:47] seoi_: the fake pportal room is made of wool

[4:15:15] Fawkes_the_fox: Is the game tied?
[4:15:16] autumnleaf00: get a bed at the village
[4:15:18] FTC_gaming2: directly under the portal in the strong hold make a piston push you to the block to under the center of the portal. This can teleport you do the void though. I basically just transfers you overworld coords to the end
[4:15:19] IneptTV: @biggishbread743 don't spoil
[4:15:23] MacTimiT: Atsign is diggin to the end
[4:15:24] PopplioPal: !lockout
[4:15:24] Nightbot: Players are given 25 goals/tasks to complete in the game. Once one team completes a goal, the other team can't. They are all in the same world with a compass that points to each other. First to 13 goals wins! Here's the list of some of the goals: https://bit.ly/LockoutKey
[4:15:24] awsmrs: @kirascendant it's actually just 6 effects not neccasarily potion effects

[4:15:31] RayDuck299: Crafty got goat
[4:15:31] hackxxcker: WiseTree
[4:15:32] ramen_beast: at that rat youre gonna have full netherite first
[4:15:33] KapOsiris: Its almost ovre
[4:15:33] B4n4n4zrgood: Stand under the portal once activated then use a use a piston to push you to the side then you teleport to the coordinates in the end that you are in the overworld.
[4:15:33] randomchocolatecake: What's the longest lockout time so far?
[4:15:36] Naret03: I saw crafty's stream he found an end city, hurry with the goat!
[4:15:38] Dralin_Koushi: UUUUGH
[4:15:38] Suntix_: You can respawn the dragon and go through an end gateway. those dont get destroyed

[4:15:49] KlumpenBlade: worse than before to be honest
[4:15:50] TheRealPounds: What's with the basalt deltas nether spawns today??
[4:15:52] KaratFeng: ugly biome
[4:15:52] TushAvi: why do you prefer to take a lava bucket over a water bucket for the nether?
[4:15:53] mattp_12: basalt YEP

[4:16:54] ChargingFurret: @HiroTD then you don't have to wait for the water to drain after you finish, its actually faster due to that
[4:16:54] TushAvi: get the wheat for the goats from the village
