[0:07:04] EhelLive: I need to place my trading hall further away from the breeding setup. I think, even though they can't reach the bed there anymore, it's still reserved for them.
[0:07:08] ozzynakashima: I’ve now reached a twitch baby!
[0:07:41] GingerTheLily: @ozzynakashima OzzyRiffs?

[0:12:30] poisso3: A trading hall is on my list of buildings to build...and probably sooner than later. I am having villagers walk very long distances away from their beds and workstations and then pair with a different workstation.
[0:12:30] saphiraugen: I like to have decentralized villager traiding. Gives me a reason to travel around in my world and enjoy my building progress in different areas.

[0:15:36] zsigmons1: This is epic
[0:15:36] maybonics: When you're finished with the ship, you should make a Bare Fist Steve statue

[0:16:17] ozzynakashima: @theicelandicpolitician09 make them into barracks? smaller interior walls could also break up the larger rooms too

[0:19:29] GingerTheLily: @GingerTheLily And a Ballroom
[0:19:42] ozzynakashima: @theicelandicpolitician09 keeping in the theme I suggested, perhaps turn one into an indoor dueling arena/stadium
[0:19:55] theicelandicpolitician09: @ozzynakashima good idea
[0:20:08] dashmax1214: The enderman could be behind you Pix

[0:22:23] klauzy14: good morning everyone!
[0:22:27] VoidedMirror: Lapis has the problem of being a 'polished' textured block so it doesn't really connect with itself well enough

[0:55:25] dankdantae: there really needs to be a way in game to turn enderman from picking off.
[0:55:35] AlsoSopranoCat: a lot of people overlook the cleric, but usually I end up with so much rotten flesh is seems a great emerald trade
[0:55:58] pammy9588: @alsosopranocat true!!!
[0:56:14] TopMinotaur: thank you
[0:56:22] abi__m: @dankdantae there is! Do /gamerule mobgriefing false
[0:56:35] AlsoSopranoCat: @dankdantae google Vanilla Tweaks, they have an option there

[0:56:41] TheWormbo: Fortress-related farms are definitely best situated in warped forest or soulsand valley. The latter even allow you to suppress skeleton/ghast spawns by saturating the area with striders.
[0:57:00] althaf_888: Hey pix! Long time no see
[0:57:06] ThatTahitianGuy_: I tend to trade with the Cartographers once I have Librarians who trade glass. So paper to glass to glass panes.
[0:57:16] Axynim: Endermen: They're passive until they steal gravel or grass from my storage room.
[0:57:19] GingerTheLily: @althaf_888 Hi!
[0:57:22] headstandingpenguin: I think a netherite torch that blocks enderman specific griefing in an area (128x128) would be great
[0:57:28] TheWormbo: Striders only work for that in the soulsand valley, not in warped forest.
[0:57:32] bigfanoflove23: cartographers are my go too as well
[0:57:33] sneezypuma: Maybe a stack 64 of carrots
[0:57:35] firefalcon2_0: cant you put down withered rose to only get withered skeletons?
[0:57:57] King_Omar_Little: are you excited for the new hermitcraft SX?
[0:57:58] TheWormbo: No idea why they are not in the spawn potential for the forests.
[0:58:08] alexblackhole: At this point, I can't play a long term world without a data pack for enderman griefing
[0:58:23] firefalcon2_0: oh ok
[0:58:33] ThatTahitianGuy_: Isn't there a new GameRule for the Endermen?
[0:58:35] LitesLAB: @gopsalem are you playing super flat on bedrock or Java?
[0:58:41] VoidedMirror: Speaking of Gnembon's Ghast farm that's where i found out that nether portals uses the position of the entity for position calculations not the portal block itself
[0:58:48] dankdantae: @abi__m Unfortuntely I don't have cheats turned on in my world. @AlsoSopranoCat I'm going to look into to that.
[0:59:07] mpsteel95_: Have you ever seen the sped up footage of endermen in one chunk
[0:59:14] Grue_bait: Didn't they record cats for some of the ghast sounds? Might explain some things
[0:59:14] Another_JT: I thought the only difference in ghast spawns is they can't spawn close to another ghast
[0:59:15] BeccaStareyes: For me, I built in a meadow, and notice the occasional different sort of flower in the fields.
[0:59:23] alexblackhole: My first long term world I didn't notice the blocks missing from the terrain, like you. Until I entered a cave under my base with 50 blocks of grass spread out through it
[0:59:31] TheWormbo: @alexblackhole At least a data pack can allow you to disable enderman griefing selectively to let them be your melon harvesters :P
[0:59:32] GingerTheLily: Melons and punpkins?

[1:12:33] GingerTheLily: @Seadubbs11 It would be constantly buzzy
[1:12:34] mcwheesus: i thought I heard the composter sound when he was over there a minute ago thats why I asked -- but i might be wrong
[1:12:56] Rob_42: am I the only one craving a soda after those brewing stands?
[1:13:01] zoeshawl: what profession do you think they should add Pix?
[1:13:07] ThatTahitianGuy_: The crane is not ready for the new delivery.
[1:13:14] Another_JT: I like how stubbornly un-useful the fletching table is
[1:13:35] skycruiser00: Do the deals get cheaper when villagers have los with other adjacent villagers?
[1:13:56] Axynim: Leather worker? shots fired, sir!
[1:13:56] ganderian: I still want the woodcutter but that's about it
[1:14:06] ThatTahitianGuy_: What are your thoughts about the villager trading update that's going to happen at some point?
[1:14:10] Seadubbs11: yahhh the bee keeper is the only thing i can think of and maybe 8-10 items TRUELY make sense

[1:14:15] Rob_42: coppersmith is the only one I can think of, but the utility would really be blocks only
[1:14:19] help_me_im_twitching: Line of Sight I'm guessing
[1:14:22] Axynim: A Miller would be great, each could buy and trade logs for bits, like fences and things
[1:14:27] Another_JT: Yeah, Beekeeper would be interesting, but need more items.
[1:14:29] RageKitsukii: los = line of sight
[1:14:35] skycruiser00: line of sight?
[1:14:42] peeyushkothari05: Can you show your floating island
[1:14:49] mcwheesus: there was a baby wasnt there?
[1:14:56] pammy9588: Beekeeper would be interesting!
[1:15:15] headstandingpenguin: I hate it, it forces exploration and as someone who usualy works 41h per hour anything making the game less easy to farm ressources is a major blow  to me liking to build big in survival
[1:15:17] alexblackhole: @mcwheesus I saw one
[1:15:19] firefalcon2_0: there was a baby
[1:15:27] Axynim: @Another_JT I dunno, Honey Bottles, honeycomb, honeyblocks, blocks of honeycomb, candles could be a trade, they could buy string, dyes
[1:15:29] mcwheesus: yeah it was jumping on the bed
[1:15:42] Axynim: or even trade in some flowers, similar to wandering trader
[1:15:54] Axynim: Something striped, like a Crimson trap door
[1:15:55] Another_JT: @Axynim sure, and you could throw in campfires and shears
[1:16:02] RageKitsukii: Cherry trapdoor maybe?
[1:16:05] Vinka90: maybe the yellow froglights?
[1:16:12] ThatTahitianGuy_: I think the exploration would be very fun! Collecting villagers from all over the world and everything it entails.
[1:16:14] RageKitsukii: on the honeycomb block
[1:16:38] dog_man_jack: N
[1:17:18] ThatTahitianGuy_: I play on peaceful so the game is harder in some aspects, but horses and donkeys are my friends :)
[1:17:45] theid0: The new style village trading makes it more tedious, putting some experienced players off who are already not enthused about the breaking and replacing of workstations
[1:17:59] ThatTahitianGuy_: The lack of gunpowder are a killer for travelling without portals, yes.
[1:18:05] RageKitsukii: @thattahitianguy_ don’t forget to get a cat so you can get phantom membrane

[1:18:44] LitesLAB: so are saying we need more ways to travel in the game?
[1:18:47] GingerTheLily: @barnrazor Hello and welcome in!
[1:19:04] Seadubbs11: magenta "glazed" terracotta is what he meant surely lol
[1:19:07] jonny_blaze269: I switched to normal mode to get some blaze rods and then right back to peaceful
[1:19:27] ThatTahitianGuy_: @RageKitsukii I can't get an Elytra without Blaze powder, so I don't need them much unless I brew potions.
[1:20:00] 64bit_link: @theid0 i mean getting a swamp villager is way more fun than breaking a lectern a couple hundred times
[1:20:01] Axynim: Balanced? I'd say efficient, reliable, interesting
[1:20:12] thumblines: Keep thinking bout your Spy of Ender idea Pix, has anyone from Mojang said anything?
[1:20:18] Seadubbs11: elytra on horse surely......
[1:20:20] LitesLAB: yes! I agree completely, been saying for ages MC travel needs an overhaul
[1:20:21] 64bit_link: like the villager rebalance has some problems but i think it's going in the right direction
[1:20:24] ThatTahitianGuy_: I travel by boat, horse and minecart usually. Maybe enderpearl highways like Etho's.
[1:20:27] ganderian: At this point I'm team "make existing features better," not "add more features"
[1:20:38] visionszd: @Seadubbs11 pegasus armor, let's go
[1:20:38] Another_JT: Minecarts could use an update as much as anything else
[1:20:39] Jade1459: I mean, if you have the right seed (a full end portal specifically) and you’re willing to leap into the void, you do have the option of elytra and Shulkers in a peaceful world. gun powder becomes your pinch point for rockets and tnt (so you really do rely on and look forward to the wandering trader coming around)

[1:21:19] GingerTheLily: Twins!
[1:21:21] orestes_: Anyone got any tips for farming pointed dripstone?  I've got 64 of them hanging from stone for hours and no new dripstone has formed.  Does it always take this long, or am I doing something wrong?
[1:21:25] barnrazor: Nice

[1:21:41] Tehbeard: Powered rails were added in Beta 1.5 (2011), and rails haven't really changed since.

[1:22:33] orestes_: Thanks!
[1:22:48] Another_JT: water above any block over dripstone, with a cauldron underneath will fill up the cauldron though.
[1:23:51] LitesLAB: Imagine if Minecraft bees hit like those bees in Shrouded, I’d have an army of them, lol
[1:23:53] ThatTahitianGuy_: Maybe a block in the back if you have a froglight as the second block? Or behing the Cleric's head?

[1:28:44] Big____Tasty: It’s a lot more work when you build creatively.  I just slam my villages in a stone cell.

[1:34:13] EvilShadoww: the fate of those baby villagers is pre-determined. NotLikeThis
[1:34:14] vegeta_2001: yeah, I mean basically moving villagers far far away doesn't always take away their claims to beds and workplaces, it's usually this which causes issues
[1:34:29] ganderian: Good point, one of the former babies might still be linked to that bed
[1:34:30] RageKitsukii: empty nest syndrome, poor villager 😢

[2:24:53] orestes_: I've been playing around in the new snapshot and the auto crafter is quite nice.  I've only been using it for single ingredient recipes atm, but it's still nice to come back and find stacks of kelp blocks precrafted, or being able to leave your iron farm for a while and being able to just grab stacks of iron blocks all in one go.

[2:27:09] Axynim: could live wild and use bamboo block...

[2:34:51] minibear3: Backpacks to me seem easier to get or make. I'm not super ocmfortable with the end so having a backpack made out of leather and such would be nice.
[2:35:03] Violet_WSM: woo hoo, I made the live
[2:35:07] mitchmethinks: What are you thinking for your stair case to the up stairs
[2:35:09] Roteiro115: Maybe bit of a dumb question - I'm guessing the reason for having multiple of the same job type villager is so you get different trades across them all?
[2:35:09] Burninator57: I probably missed half the discussion, but I just wish potions were stackable (even up to just a few). Combat is not easy in minecraft, and juggling inventory while in combat sucks.
[2:35:14] npbeans: Happy Tuesday!  Had to miss the stream today. :(  I'll have to catch the VOD.
[2:35:18] GingerTheLily: @Roteiro115 Hello and welcome in!
[2:35:31] Axynim: I appreciate the principle of the bundle, but it's not a good enough solution for pocket space
[2:35:41] GingerTheLily: @gnral2008 English only in chat please
[2:36:10] Dan_Grice85: BOP
[2:36:19] canada_raz: how come the places for them are more in the center than the others?
[2:36:24] Axynim: I use bundles to store crafting table, stone cutter, ender chest, and leads or ladders and various 1 offs
[2:36:56] npbeans: Does a trading hall not need beds?
[2:37:10] PretzelRocks: Now Playing: Angel Eyes by Strehlow -> https://prtzl.io/1kHlV5Y3PVDB6VfY
[2:38:32] LadyHespeth: yeah chat asked about the cubby holes lol
[2:38:52] DiscoQuill: I let my villagers free roam the village, does get hard to find the right one sometimes. I may need to follow suit and build a hall.
[2:39:00] mpsteel95_: What if there was an inventory slot just fort bundles and when one was placed in that slot, a second inventory GUI appeared to be interacted with
[2:39:25] AmperSandworm: there's also shroomlights, they might look nice
[2:39:35] poisso3: Mardi Gras colors...green, yellow, purple
[2:39:37] daisymae28: Looks like Mardi Gras :D

[2:41:14] Chobble_1: do you have any projects planned for this world
[2:41:21] GingerTheLily: @bean_boy7984 Hello and welcome in!
[2:41:28] GingerTheLily: !plan
[2:41:28] Nightbot: If your question is anything to the effect of, "are you planning on building insert-thing-here in Survival Guide," then the answer is, "yes, eventually, most likely."
[2:41:44] prettygoodiguess: the minecraft survival vibe - no plans, just hang
[2:41:45] Another_JT: Ooh, just found the perfect village for getting jungle villagers, it's crossing the border between plains and a jungle edge.
[2:41:57] jenny_b14: its purpose is to look awesome.
[2:41:59] Dravot: Keep it simple....Do everything in Minecraft.   lol
[2:42:03] npbeans: Are you going to share your rendition with the artist?
[2:42:23] Chobble_1: how do you get inspiration for playing minecraft after a few days of playing i keep losing inspiration
[2:42:31] bambigeek: I have a savannah jungle/swamp village
[2:42:34] GingerTheLily: I had a Taiga/swamp village last season...
[2:42:50] DrkJazz: I found 1. Swap, Jungle, Savana. I call my Swavungle Village
[2:42:50] nishustreams: would you play another blind bingo again soon?
[2:42:58] MusicFreeGaming: I saw @MandaLin find that in her world. A plains villager was right between a jungle and a swamp.
[2:43:03] Fraggo10: @prettygoodiguess That's about how I play in my Minecraft world, no plans, just vibes.
[2:43:04] npbeans: Fair enough, I would think as an artist it would be cool to know my work inspired someone else.
[2:43:07] jonny_blaze269: I have a spot like that I could create a village at mangrove swamp jungle and flower forest all together
[2:43:12] jenny_b14: what if you tell him he inspired you to make the Minecraft build?
[2:43:15] mitchmethinks: i think it depends how they feel about minecraft
[2:43:19] lordandy1258: found a jungle/swamp village once

[2:43:45] prettygoodiguess: @Fraggo10 yes lol! maybe what i like most about the game
[2:43:46] npbeans: @mitchmethinks Good point. :D
[2:44:06] Chobble_1: what is your favorite build you have done
[2:44:08] canada_raz: do you have a plan. for a staircase for the second floor of the storage hall?
[2:44:15] Fraggo10: @prettygoodiguess That's what I like about it, though I have started into modded
[2:44:18] Vinka90: sometimes all it needs isa few stacks of food
[2:44:24] kyredle: 20k channel points burning a hole in my pocket. For the next bingo game
[2:44:41] jonny_blaze269: I'm playing with the exp villager changes and found naturally generated swamp villagers about 650 blocks from spawn
[2:44:52] capsicaprimero: or a piston elevator :P
[2:44:54] Freakcker: do the different food types have different value for feeding villagers?
[2:44:55] Chobble_1: what about a spiral staircase in the middle of the bridge
[2:45:00] mitchmethinks: minecart elevator?
[2:45:00] jenny_b14: I love a water elevator I have them everywhere
[2:45:03] GingerTheLily: @kyredle Lol, I am having fun with the predictions.... oh the power!
[2:45:04] TiniSpicy: slime block elevator pixlriSQRT
[2:45:05] d_luna: does it make a difference whether the villagers can see each between the booth?
[2:45:08] Chobble_1: i mean base not bridge

[2:45:55] jenny_b14: ok now I need to see a slime launcher
[2:46:01] Chobble_1: i thought this was a faily friendly stream then pix decides to be a peeping tom
[2:46:15] Chobble_1: my words are not wording
[2:46:23] GingerTheLily: @Axynim was that a link? Automod starred it out...
[2:46:24] Axynim: More scientific, right bean boy. Studying, observation

[2:47:06] GingerTheLily: @Axynim LOL, I reckoned :D
[2:47:17] Chobble_1: what about a stair case made of cake
[2:47:27] GingerTheLily: @bean_boy7984 a staircake?

[2:48:02] Another_JT: designed your storage system around riding a pig
[2:48:05] phisig: They haven't given a date for 1.21 yet have they ?
[2:48:06] TiniSpicy: snow layer staircase, one layer up every step ;))
[2:48:09] YoItDanny: haven't seen a minecart elevator in a while, might be interesting
[2:48:13] LadyHespeth: any plans to add lighting? storage room looks a bit dark in certain places
[2:48:14] Axynim: Storage Pig!
[2:48:23] GingerTheLily: @phisig no, they generally don't until very close to the time
[2:48:28] Valois_Fulcanelli: The return of Piggslriffs!
[2:48:36] djfibre: Why didnt you make a auto-breeder
[2:48:41] jonny_blaze269: @gopsalem pretty sure pick axe is for glass too
[2:48:42] shanesunil: @GingerTheLily That should be Pix's build for his next birthday, like the redstone using cake episode which he released on his birthday
[2:48:47] Axynim: 15 year anniversary, Minecraft beta launched May 17, 2009

[2:50:25] Another_JT: the only thing not infinite about this setup is the feeding
[2:51:24] Axynim: oh my.. you could have 1.21, 15 year anniversary of MC released ON your birthday. It's a friday...
[2:51:25] LitesLAB: only 47? just a pup yet :)

[2:53:30] phisig: So the world spawn will keep your farm going when you leave, but if I build in another spot I have to be near is that correct? So still learning the game
[2:53:34] Valois_Fulcanelli: They're playing carrot-pong
[2:53:40] Lacal: @Doskias that's a good idea
[2:53:44] Dravot: tossing food to the little guys as they fall down the hole.  They are worried the little guys might be hungry.
[2:53:48] Axynim: maybe it was getting late
[2:54:02] Axynim: tired, headache, cold, too full from supper?
[2:54:04] poisso3: @GingerTheLily sorry😞
[2:54:11] TheWormbo: the villagers can't path to the additional beds, so they don't count for breeding
[2:54:17] Lacal: maybe they're nervous with 600+ people watching
[2:54:18] GingerTheLily: @poisso3 pixlriGood
[2:54:20] Axynim: eek, imagine having to deal with keeping villagers like a Sim
[2:54:23] dab2014: Villagers are a strange bunch 🤔
[2:54:25] TiniSpicy: ah the struggle of villager mechaniks
[2:54:33] zoeshawl: I’m back on. Are the villages still being stupid with breeding?
[2:54:39] poisso3: @GingerTheLily i'm old enough to know better
[2:54:39] Axynim: @Lacal probable. he'll cut stream and have 15 babies waiting. Somehow
[2:54:41] Neongod_22: pixlriWut
[2:54:55] Big____Tasty: Villagers are the worst.  He must have said something to make her mad before he could close the deal.
[2:54:57] phisig: Thanks
[2:55:07] GingerTheLily: @poisso3 yes :D but older doesn't always mean wiser!!
[2:55:16] TheWormbo: @phisig Basically, don't rely on the spawn chunks, they are unreliable for almost everything.
[2:55:46] poisso3: @GingerTheLily not when i'm a kid at heart, but adult in brain.
