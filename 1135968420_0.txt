[0:24:05] daemonaedryn: @F0xyTheFox Same, especially since I dont enjoy poe KEKW
[0:24:06] darknotch: Fun fact: Max XP in runescape is because of the 2147m 32 bit integer limit. Since xp is stored with one decimal place. But they rounded it down to 200m because that was nicer
[0:24:09] Monty0x: you can probably find that information online and theory craft it now, then practise it in open beta
[0:24:11] Dagmoo: i mean if we boost you for bait/rods then its EZ win

[0:25:01] Reudl_: now people go for 200m which is technically level 126 in each skill
[0:25:04] Dagmoo: how do you kill that which has no life OMEGALUL

[0:28:39] Thulen: This is one of my fav vr games, its pretty insane
[0:28:42] MrArrig: wide as a lake deep as something bit deeper than a puddle now?

[0:28:50] CorSPACE: @daftMOOSE NMS has no dlc
[0:28:51] dadish: What is the point i NMS? The story is non existent.
[0:28:53] GenerlKat: I love that the company fell short on so many promises at launch and then just kept going and full fillled all and more of those promises
[0:28:54] Narcotical: No Man's SimCity?
[0:28:56] MaxPainAlchmst: I think NPC Settlements
[0:29:03] omar_i_: props to them, they've apologies for their mistake with those massive free updates/expansion GG NoManSky Clap
[0:29:08] forsc1: drops i think
[0:29:12] Scojan: I wonder how big NMS would be if it released in the state it is now
[0:29:18] daftMOOSE: @CorSPACE cool so if you buy NMS all the extra content that they've released is included.
[0:29:20] Trofel: they improved base building A LOT in this update , i'm so excited about this
[0:29:20] supersemir: its like PoE, free content every few months
[0:29:32] Staramus: imagine this combined with satisfactory
[0:29:35] CorSPACE: @daftMOOSE ya like all the updates to minecraft are
[0:29:37] OneLickAway: so its a fallout 4 update
[0:29:37] CMDR_WeeJet: i just wish NMS ship gameplay was actually made good. its borderline just a loading screen minigame really
[0:29:40] ChilledNightmare: If they had done good from the start I'm sure it wouldve been much easier to have paid DLC @DaemonSzyman
[0:29:40] ninopanda: @F0xyTheFox in the beta the store was all cosmetic, and they say it is how it is going to stay
[0:29:41] TheRealNinjada: it should be live right? because i had a patch
[0:29:41] Cutekuuh: only thing I don't get is how they make money off this
[0:29:42] darknotch: And this game is cheaper now than @ release
[0:29:43] radiocabea: NMS is pog
[0:29:46] Andersxa: Populated Sky pog
[0:29:49] SupaStevo: @corspace DLC stands for "Downloadable content", and no man's sky has released a ton

[0:29:55] DejaDrew: all Free
[0:29:56] DejaDrew: :D
[0:29:58] Dagmoo: yeah its been all free DLC

[0:30:18] shadowoflight_: to be fair, they set that bar low considering how bad it started lol
[0:30:24] 13hunteo: Internet Historian did a really good video about it @Giantwaffle
[0:30:24] Tahj____: Every time a game company releases a bad game they say they're gonna "no man's sky" it, and most of the time they don't
[0:30:25] Dagmoo: well i guess i know what im playing until NW now :)
[0:30:28] CorSPACE: they just worked hard
[0:30:38] F0xyTheFox: @ninopanda  they need to make that more clear because most of the players won't find that statement YEP
[0:30:42] Cutekuuh: it has 93% rating rn

[0:30:57] JojoPowerRanger: No Man's Sky is on PC gamepass
[0:30:57] daftMOOSE: I wish CP2077 would turn around like NMS has.
[0:30:58] SupaStevo: i think it's just them doing exactly what they said they would do before gamers freaked the fuck out
[0:31:00] ForzaBlueNY: cough...wow.... cough
[0:31:00] CMDR_WeeJet: @shadowoflight_ setting the bar low is high praise for how bad it started LUL

[0:31:13] フリクリ: Realm of the Mad God peepoSad
[0:31:14] Coffeeworld: Story was that the game was complete before release in its current state, but major fire destroyed years of work and they released it as an earlier product
[0:31:17] Jukettaja: Well some games never repair that image even after a lot of good work
[0:31:24] F0xyTheFox: @ninopanda  Can't find it YEP

[0:31:56] SupaStevo: kinda like where Destiny is
[0:32:02] Narcotical: You either build the game the people want or you build the game you want
[0:32:05] shadowoflight_: I think it's good that they connect, but they also need their own direction
[0:32:10] FloodRacer: well if a game start's shitty, the bar is kinda low for improvements
[0:32:10] 13hunteo: cyberpunk is less likely to recover imo
[0:32:15] omar_i_: Whats the plan for today Wafful if i may ask? Project Zomboid?
[0:32:15] Grumbagz: a little under a year
[0:32:17] 0sem0: november right?

[0:32:30] supersemir: witcher 3 was also mess on release and now its one of the best games
[0:32:32] Andersxa: no way cyberpunk recovers
[0:32:33] Chronoes: November 17 was the initial planned release I think
[0:32:33] Turbologic: @Ji_nX had great potential but i think they released it 2 years earlier..
[0:32:34] isfil: watch internet historian video about no man sky

[0:32:56] daftMOOSE: CP had so much potential to be the most amazing game.
[0:32:58] CMDR_WeeJet: like elite dangerous. thats a perfect example of a game in the middle ground of them wanting to make the game they want to make and trying to do what the community wants @Giantwaffle
[0:32:59] FoXsTeRDOTA: Trackmania with Shorty modCheck
[0:33:04] CorSPACE: @TechNaOkami no idea, havent been following it

[0:35:00] Reginald_4: @Giantwaffle Where did you get your desktop background from? Its sooo satisfying
[0:35:05] VrtniPatuljak: CMDR_WeeJet think Yamiks is a good gauge. they added nothing significant just more grinds and engineers ruined balance

[0:45:54] ba_nanananananana: I mean accidents happen especially if you stay up all night

[0:51:39] daemonaedryn: @ninopanda The contraption went with me aswell
[0:51:44] Arthur_Jan: why want to remove automatic mining though?
[0:51:46] Deathu: every moving machine WAS bugged on the last soft launch server (basicly the inventory of a machine was deleted any time the machine stoped) @Giantwaffle

[0:51:56] Benzad: yes
[0:52:00] Benzad: with deployer
[0:52:01] hbboia: @ninopanda I dont think so, it flags as a flying entity and since flying is disabled on the server it kicks the player off
[0:52:02] algoroth_: dam waffle dosent like recourse automation
[0:52:06] Deathu: Yes @Giantwaffle
[0:52:08] ItsSABER_: its just so many resources so not having vein miner or mechanical drills kind of stinks
[0:52:11] ninopanda: Deployers can break blocks
[0:52:19] daemonaedryn: Not just rails,
[0:52:21] Benzad: deployer can hold a pickaxe
[0:52:25] CorSPACE: you need the deployer for reciples
[0:52:26] ninopanda: @hbboia yeah i may check
[0:52:34] Mapleton: deplorer can work just like a drill
[0:52:35] Deathu: I started up a server on my onw pc and it it was fine same modpack same everything so it was probably the server @Giantwaffle
[0:52:35] ItsSABER_: true fair point

[0:52:40] F0xyTheFox: @DaemonSzyman  Why doesnt he just ban people that grief ? YEP
[0:52:42] Alimber: right click with a wrench
[0:52:44] ninopanda: yes
[0:52:48] Benzad: yes
[0:52:49] Alimber: and it will break blocks instead of placing blocks

[0:53:00] Mapleton: if you get rid of the deployer the mod pack is worthless
[0:53:01] daemonaedryn: @F0xyTheFox Cause he'd need to find everyone that griefs, whereas he could just stop possible grief instead waffleD
[0:53:02] ninopanda: exactly what i was saying in the #mods

[0:53:44] caopradog: bro, just disable mining :)

[0:58:56] mattymosh580: Mattymosh580 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 11 months! just disable the rail cart thing
[0:59:02] Fuzze_Wuzze: Something seems wrong with a giant fisting robot going across your map on rails
[0:59:10] ninopanda: true
[0:59:13] Spirevipp: imo i would rather u disable the rail than the drill stuff
[0:59:16] daftMOOSE: If we just added mining dimension it would solve all these issues...
[0:59:16] Mapleton: you can use shafts instead of rails @ninopanda
[0:59:20] IronGajeel: that cat almost ripped her butthole KEKW

[0:59:41] Deathu: just make the drill super expensive? @Giantwaffle
[0:59:44] Spirevipp: disable recipe, and let people "buy" them and log who has them
[0:59:47] Runarsben: Mining world?
