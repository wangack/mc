[0:24:05] daemonaedryn: @F0xyTheFox Same, especially since I dont enjoy poe KEKW
[0:24:06] darknotch: Fun fact: Max XP in runescape is because of the 2147m 32 bit integer limit. Since xp is stored with one decimal place. But they rounded it down to 200m because that was nicer
[0:24:09] Monty0x: you can probably find that information online and theory craft it now, then practise it in open beta

[0:28:51] dadish: What is the point i NMS? The story is non existent.
[0:28:53] GenerlKat: I love that the company fell short on so many promises at launch and then just kept going and full fillled all and more of those promises
[0:28:54] Narcotical: No Man's SimCity?
[0:28:56] MaxPainAlchmst: I think NPC Settlements
[0:29:03] omar_i_: props to them, they've apologies for their mistake with those massive free updates/expansion GG NoManSky Clap
[0:29:08] forsc1: drops i think
[0:29:12] Scojan: I wonder how big NMS would be if it released in the state it is now
[0:29:18] daftMOOSE: @CorSPACE cool so if you buy NMS all the extra content that they've released is included.
[0:29:20] Trofel: they improved base building A LOT in this update , i'm so excited about this
[0:29:20] supersemir: its like PoE, free content every few months
[0:29:32] Staramus: imagine this combined with satisfactory
[0:29:35] CorSPACE: @daftMOOSE ya like all the updates to minecraft are
[0:29:37] OneLickAway: so its a fallout 4 update
[0:29:37] CMDR_WeeJet: i just wish NMS ship gameplay was actually made good. its borderline just a loading screen minigame really
[0:29:40] ChilledNightmare: If they had done good from the start I'm sure it wouldve been much easier to have paid DLC @DaemonSzyman
[0:29:40] ninopanda: @F0xyTheFox in the beta the store was all cosmetic, and they say it is how it is going to stay
[0:29:41] TheRealNinjada: it should be live right? because i had a patch
[0:29:41] Cutekuuh: only thing I don't get is how they make money off this
[0:29:42] darknotch: And this game is cheaper now than @ release
[0:29:43] radiocabea: NMS is pog
[0:29:46] Andersxa: Populated Sky pog
[0:29:49] SupaStevo: @corspace DLC stands for "Downloadable content", and no man's sky has released a ton

[0:30:24] 13hunteo: Internet Historian did a really good video about it @Giantwaffle
[0:30:24] Tahj____: Every time a game company releases a bad game they say they're gonna "no man's sky" it, and most of the time they don't
[0:30:25] Dagmoo: well i guess i know what im playing until NW now :)
[0:30:28] CorSPACE: they just worked hard
[0:30:38] F0xyTheFox: @ninopanda  they need to make that more clear because most of the players won't find that statement YEP

[0:30:57] daftMOOSE: I wish CP2077 would turn around like NMS has.
[0:30:58] SupaStevo: i think it's just them doing exactly what they said they would do before gamers freaked the fuck out
[0:31:00] ForzaBlueNY: cough...wow.... cough
[0:31:00] CMDR_WeeJet: @shadowoflight_ setting the bar low is high praise for how bad it started LUL

[0:32:02] Narcotical: You either build the game the people want or you build the game you want
[0:32:05] shadowoflight_: I think it's good that they connect, but they also need their own direction
[0:32:10] FloodRacer: well if a game start's shitty, the bar is kinda low for improvements
[0:32:10] 13hunteo: cyberpunk is less likely to recover imo
[0:32:15] omar_i_: Whats the plan for today Wafful if i may ask? Project Zomboid?

[0:32:59] FoXsTeRDOTA: Trackmania with Shorty modCheck
[0:33:04] CorSPACE: @TechNaOkami no idea, havent been following it

[0:35:00] Reginald_4: @Giantwaffle Where did you get your desktop background from? Its sooo satisfying
[0:35:05] VrtniPatuljak: CMDR_WeeJet think Yamiks is a good gauge. they added nothing significant just more grinds and engineers ruined balance

[0:40:41] TritonXXXG: nino did it
[0:40:45] Fooker: Moo
[0:40:52] daemonaedryn: @AshtynHolic Just to play, create structures, just generally have fun. Minecraft is the type of game where the game provides you the means to make your own fun
[0:41:01] thulle: @seba766 no, market only goes up Kappa
[0:41:04] OMICRON: NOP
[0:41:18] daemonaedryn: Wouldnt it be better if someone else claimed the chunks?

[0:41:34] Turbologic: HACKERMANS
[0:41:50] Movinggun1: its the ftb teams menu
[0:41:56] daftMOOSE: @Giantwaffle You'll be able to break the block if they're your chunks. You need to test if with someone else's claimed chunk.
[0:42:01] Deathu: I think the menu isn't complete yet so its very messy rn @Giantwaffle
[0:42:06] daemonaedryn: @AshtynHolic I mean the goal is usually made by the player, but it usually something like make a nice looking base, automate some things, defeat the bosses
[0:42:09] ChilledNightmare: this music is very peaceful

[0:44:12] ba_nanananananana: are you trying to disable all grieving or will you allow Ci to have some fun
[0:44:14] Deathu: you need someone @Giantwaffle
[0:44:16] Andersxa: why not?
[0:44:16] Benzad: that will stop block breakers for cobblegen no?
[0:44:27] kyanpeppaa: if you do that allow fake players would that break all other automated shit?
[0:44:30] Allmostdone: Well that would be me. 100% fake player

[0:44:48] ninopanda: yeah i will ban idiots KEKW
[0:44:50] Sirgevz: someone could accidently do it
[0:44:50] F0xyTheFox: @Mapleton  You are to late we already got him YEP
[0:44:50] JamesySmithy: some troll could get gifted a sub though, then could just grief everyone
[0:44:51] Fooker: Only allow 12month + subs Kappa

[0:45:07] PepperIsUnderrated: "Accident" Kappa
[0:45:07] daemonaedryn: What if you accidentally leave the autominer on

[0:45:21] Sirgevz: PogChamp part 24
[0:45:22] aeadon: isn't this what a separate mining dimension is for?
[0:45:26] silv: "oh no i ran into your base, oops i didn't know :tf: "
[0:45:32] ninopanda: @F0xyTheFox only if you do bad things
[0:45:40] AshtynHolic: This is the stuff that‚Äôs hard to me
[0:45:42] cammyl1: !modpack

[0:45:43] iconium_: wtf is this fov
[0:45:54] ba_nanananananana: I mean accidents happen especially if you stay up all night
[0:45:59] CorSPACE: since we arent allowing chunk loading and render distance is low, the miner wont be able to go far without the player, so if something does go wrong the player should be able to stop it
[0:46:21] MJ711: I love this mod

[0:51:36] TritonXXXG: the server has vein miner so it doesn't need auto mining
[0:51:37] RoninStorm: makes sense
[0:51:39] Mapleton: @ninopanda a lot of people did
[0:51:39] daemonaedryn: @ninopanda The contraption went with me aswell
[0:51:44] Arthur_Jan: why want to remove automatic mining though?
[0:51:46] Deathu: every moving machine WAS bugged on the last soft launch server (basicly the inventory of a machine was deleted any time the machine stoped) @Giantwaffle
[0:51:49] BuIkpowder: I feel like you are kinda destroying the modpack
[0:51:50] F0xyTheFox: @Giantwaffle or you can just ban idiots that grief YEP

[0:51:56] Benzad: yes
[0:52:00] Benzad: with deployer
[0:52:01] hbboia: @ninopanda I dont think so, it flags as a flying entity and since flying is disabled on the server it kicks the player off
[0:52:02] algoroth_: dam waffle dosent like recourse automation
[0:52:06] Deathu: Yes @Giantwaffle
[0:52:08] ItsSABER_: its just so many resources so not having vein miner or mechanical drills kind of stinks
[0:52:11] ninopanda: Deployers can break blocks
[0:52:19] daemonaedryn: Not just rails,
[0:52:21] Benzad: deployer can hold a pickaxe
[0:52:25] CorSPACE: you need the deployer for reciples
[0:52:26] ninopanda: @hbboia yeah i may check
[0:52:34] Mapleton: deplorer can work just like a drill
[0:52:35] Deathu: I started up a server on my onw pc and it it was fine same modpack same everything so it was probably the server @Giantwaffle
[0:52:35] ItsSABER_: true fair point
[0:52:40] daemonaedryn: yes
[0:52:40] F0xyTheFox: @DaemonSzyman  Why doesnt he just ban people that grief ? YEP
[0:52:42] Alimber: right click with a wrench
[0:52:44] ninopanda: yes
[0:52:48] Benzad: yes
[0:52:49] Alimber: and it will break blocks instead of placing blocks
[0:52:58] Deathu: You can just make the mechanical drill more expensive to make @Giantwaffle
[0:52:59] theyoungboywonder: !modpack

[0:52:59] Yumzoi: Wait why aren't we going to use mechanical drills?
[0:53:00] Mapleton: if you get rid of the deployer the mod pack is worthless
[0:53:01] daemonaedryn: @F0xyTheFox Cause he'd need to find everyone that griefs, whereas he could just stop possible grief instead waffleD
[0:53:02] ninopanda: exactly what i was saying in the #mods
[0:53:03] caopradog: use the deployer as a drill KEKW
[0:53:06] CorSPACE: you cant disable the deployer, its required for recipes

[0:53:12] Drunten1337: it takes durability of the tool though
[0:53:12] daftMOOSE: But then couldn't you just replace the drills on the front of a mining rig with deployers?
[0:53:16] TritonXXXG: ONE PUNCH
[0:53:25] Andersxa: disable pickaxes :)
[0:53:31] Alimber: yep can still make a mining machine with deployers
[0:53:34] lange__: Aint it just like, people who grief gets banned
[0:53:36] lange__: end of story
[0:53:39] Yumzoi: It's a sub server can't you just trust people not to grief with this stuff?
[0:53:44] caopradog: bro, just disable mining :)
[0:53:46] F0xyTheFox: @DaemonSzyman  just hand pick people  YEP and if they break rules ban them from discord,mc and twitch chat YEP
[0:53:50] daemonaedryn: Can we make mechanical drills ONLY work in our own chunks?
