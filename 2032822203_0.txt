[2:46:32] ScytheDot: ITS NOT WORTH
[2:46:33] notevendavid: that was my mistake in OW
[2:46:35] Syncitrix: Team Poom for VCT
[2:46:49] the_pebbs: @rfournier09 I got to ask cuz it's been itching my brain for months. are you from Montreal? KEKW I had a friend in my childhood called Raphael Fournier and your name is bugging me so hard lmao
[2:46:53] GRILLED_o7: i would go in person to see team poom in vct
[2:46:53] BlueTry88: are youyou saying you’re too old to compete?

[2:47:23] jem_taylor: ignoring the grind to get there, would you rather live the lifestyle of a content creator or pro player
[2:47:26] fadeddeath2524: @Keeoh i never knew your name was joey keeohF2 keeohF2
[2:47:27] ScytheDot: to go pro @MailiRyann

[2:48:26] rfournier09: someone stole kj from me cause i was in here and not on my game

[2:48:31] bnzy18: that's going to youtube lol
[2:48:41] MailiRyann: @ScytheDot LMAO
[2:48:44] Chrosteellium: For sure. I used to actually try and aim only, but since my movement was so bad (I literally would fully stand still and shoot). It led to me always dying. either cause id get one tapped or the enemy player had better movement and that made hitting my shots just slightly harder that I was an easy target.
[2:48:45] LuckyTimTam: @rfournier09 play cypher too keeohM
[2:48:49] GRILLED_o7: @rfournier09 jett throw time
