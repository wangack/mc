[0:31:07] bawnorton: ontop works
[0:31:08] BertPotato: You just shouldn't stop for berries at all so they don't have time to spawn
[0:31:08] lynnie_thelurker: Most of the time, spiders cave is safe

[0:31:20] JayMaximum: don‚Äôt u need a pressure plate rail?
[0:31:24] jundotpng: You can punch the spiders
[0:31:27] jeaninius: spiders path is good, but you have to get up and thru it fast
[0:31:35] 1SherlockSpock1: yeah, sometimes when ravagers are in the way, you just need to take spiders
[0:31:46] woagopossum: if you stop for the berries before the spiders it gives them more time to spawn, if you just rush in there might not be any
[0:31:48] 1SherlockSpock1: also yes, you can punch them
[0:31:50] factorization4: Spider is good for exiting
[0:31:56] tyranno66: The spidey path doesn't always spawn spiders, you were just hazarded

[1:03:00] Aeyolistic: bounding is the most overpowered card, I love it but it shouldn‚Äôt last as long and should be more expensive
[1:03:08] The_Scared_Gamer_: Using crowns in the shop can help
[1:03:20] factorization4: If you have stronger treasure cards (like +10 or +13), they have negative tradeoffs
[1:03:21] 1SherlockSpock1: That's enough crowns for an ethereal. an ethereal is a good idea if you want to try deadly :)
[1:03:25] jedi_iwakura: warm
[1:03:38] astra_aria: @1sherlockspock1 SHERLOCK!!!
[1:03:52] slimecubeboing: @Aeyolistic people say bounding should be a rare, and the uncommon version should be shorter (like 30sec) or conditional jump boost or have a downside
