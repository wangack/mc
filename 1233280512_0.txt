[0:21:36] heatedblankit: Merv
[0:21:40] manoarts: @bolt7th same. did you find a solution?
[0:21:49] jsteele726: Filter that thick, it's amazing even air could flow through it.
[0:21:50] heatedblankit: :0
[0:22:05] brenner1265: MERV 8 is basic filter, 13 is higher quality filtration, 15 is clean room/hospital grade
[0:22:15] bolt7th: manoarts yes i got mad and copied from the solution thread on reddit KEKW
[0:22:23] sweaty_lips: you actually want a lower rating  doesn't hurt the fan
[0:22:24] RpidFrTommyGun: @BearWatcher Metabo is Japanese. Formerly Hitachi but changed to sound more "American"

[0:22:51] SmoothBlizzard: is that your mask ?
[0:22:56] Hemigod: thicker filters can add stress to the furnace blower
[0:23:03] GFQPR1882: worth waffleD
[0:23:03] brenner1265: But higher MERV also is higher pressure, can make your fan louder @Giantwaffle
[0:23:06] Stillglade: be careful though because lots of homes won't get enough airflow with those high number MERV
[0:23:11] complexprotein: Yea my furnace won't handle the high ratings, it'll overheat
[0:23:15] yancy1333: yes
[0:23:15] Coffeeworld: your furnace needs to be rated for the merv rating
[0:23:16] Larklen: there is
[0:23:17] Johnnyquick1: watch out with bacteria/virus filtration.  if you don't kill it first it will grow through the media
[0:23:17] BearWatcher: @RpidFrTommyGun you are kidding me, right??? Metabo is from germany... It actually stands for Metallbohrdreher, which was one of the first tools - get your freakin facts straight bro
[0:23:18] manoarts: I tried that with a solution from reddit too, and the first one gave me the same solution as my code KEKW @bolt7th ...
[0:23:20] 8bitbarbarian: yes, it makes the system work harder
[0:23:25] jsteele726: Wouldn't the fan potentially burn out faster because it has to work harder to pull air through?
[0:23:33] EZL1190: Have you heard about Log4J / Log4Shell?
[0:23:37] Stillglade: if you notice your heat cut out but the fan keeps blowing cold, you'll know why
[0:23:48] bmoneysmafia: probably if its too thick you will burn out our compressor
[0:23:52] FairePlaie: more Merv is up more the size is small ( particules size)
[0:24:18] jsteele726: Bro, just call an ac/heat repair company and ask them. They'll be the ones expert enough to answer.
[0:24:19] bolt7th: KEKW love it when that happends
[0:24:20] Mapleton: Sadge IceCold it's so cold
[0:24:24] Larklen: think of wire gauge chart but in terms of apply it to MERV filtration KEKW
[0:24:29] complexprotein: It can cause it to short cycle due to overheating, since it has less airflow
[0:24:32] Allmostdone: Merv 10k
[0:24:33] Larklen: wait MONKERS
[0:24:35] MakerOfThingys: I'm working in my garage now and this cold is burr

[0:25:10] FairePlaie: for a best practice you need mesuring delta pressure of the filter

[1:44:02] iriskcriesinbed: stone house is so worth it
[1:44:03] Deenoga: why do you have such a big roof? just for looks?
[1:44:29] Soul12eaver: build a stone house at the start of the prospect? nah, just shit pants every 20m a storm rolls in and almost destroys the house
[1:44:36] gamerman88: thatwindstorm remind me of what's happening in California
[1:44:37] RodriCraft93: wait you need to make a new house? cant you just upgrade the wooden one?

[1:45:32] daemonaedryn: Oo just found a MC seed that looks absolutely sick on tiktok, not sure if it fits your requirements though
[1:45:35] korsk_: stone house in 30 mins if you have the 1% deposit perks makes gathering mats super fast only smelting takes time for iron nailes
[1:45:44] Jamie7Gs: I build the houses narrow and long to help limit fires from spreading. Works pretty well
[1:45:50] daemonaedryn: NODDERS
[1:46:06] BigDumbAnimal: Yes 1.18.1
[1:46:14] HostileLogOut: @Giantwaffle are you gonna do Better minecraft modpack? for well just better then default minecraft?
[1:46:46] kaos4666: this game looks gorgeous, shame the devs cant make it playble and more fun
[1:47:23] ike2ike: Tarkov with shorty?
[1:47:25] Tech: Whatcha mean?
[1:47:39] john_kosta01: yeah
[1:47:41] lcePops: I think that it would work great if your world was persistent
[1:47:48] Tech: Nah, agreed
[1:47:50] kaos4666: true
[1:47:56] Tech: I think Eco nailed the game time
[1:47:58] HostileLogOut: @Giantwaffle tbh it would have been better if they did not copy Ark/Rust etc.
[1:48:05] john_kosta01: repeat cycle
[1:48:08] ba_nanananananana: chess where pawns only can move backwards means there's only knight + 2 pawn movements Oo.
[1:48:11] korsk_: if higher tier buildings could persist it would make teching up worth it @Giantwaffle
[1:48:21] Aarimous: Maybe one main base you build up and then you leave to prospects.
[1:48:23] Tech: a few weeks is perfect to build up your base, enjoy your time, but move on to a new world
[1:48:26] GFQPR1882: im bk did i miss anything
[1:48:31] exidex: its like starbound it was better in the beginning, but then they ruined it with quests for me
[1:48:53] john_kosta01: that would be nice
[1:49:04] harrobert: yeah I also wish the game was that way
[1:49:07] Myekos: the game looks like it's intended for speed running
[1:49:08] aliceoface: like rust?
[1:49:24] Delta134: There's outposts right where you can do that
[1:49:37] harrobert: because the game is fun, but doing everything over and over again gets old
[1:49:38] gamerman88: they should add yetis :-)
[1:49:40] Jamie7Gs: haha i'm glad i'm not the only one who runs away the moment i place that equipment.
[1:49:51] kaos4666: i still can play my old Update 2 in Satisfactory KEKW

[1:50:01] Chernobyl26: yeah it feels almost like a punishment to build big bases lol
[1:50:02] verbal_cz: you can even live in cave and dont build house at all
[1:50:05] harrobert: you get xp, but there is no dangerous wildlife

[1:51:11] kiegh_: @Giantwaffle they could do what you're saying and make it season based. then when the season ends, you can't win any progression rewards anymore for that season, but maybe the world is still available locally?
[1:51:14] Delta134: D:
[1:51:14] RamseyRinehaus: thats my only gripe w valheim as well, it feels punishing to do mega builds
[1:51:17] Deepcast: when u get everything unlocked then u can do the 30 day missions and take ur time
[1:51:18] kaos4666: i mean the world is 10/10 beautiful

[1:51:37] Moobot: You can find Waffle's Youtube channel here - https://youtube.com/giantwaffle
[1:51:46] TheWumbologist101: its like you have to rp playing the game to play the game unneficiently
[1:51:53] RodriCraft93: would you rather have a seed with mountains or villages nearby for 1.18.1 ?
[1:51:56] Gliderman: but there isn't a 30 mission, there are no goals in those
[1:52:11] Schismed: Should have just made it all one game, not seperate portions
[1:52:26] BlueConfetti: That's how I feel about path of exile Sadge
[1:52:37] Scojan: It should have been one world with continuing missions
[1:52:39] harrobert: I also don't like that there is almost nothing "alien" on this planet
[1:52:41] kaos4666: i dislike the fact that they insist the game is finished

[1:52:47] ArsiN23: It has so much potential
[1:53:06] ItsaSin88: yea this with the whole map unlocked on a dedicated server where resources respawn would be great!

[1:55:10] daemonaedryn: https://clips.twitch.tv/SpookyCredulousLouseRlyTho-AINEO5K-sz1Hbpr5
[1:55:16] HeyItsADK: They explain it a little better on one of the live action trailers for the game on why the exotics arenât worth much on the space station
[1:55:17] Slymph: You dont die, you pass out, and magically you wake up in your bed YEP
[1:55:23] Deenoga: is the cold symbol red?
[1:55:28] spicebroth: water bone deer meat = new body
[1:55:36] Orin_The_Sly: They should add a "Drone" that recovers your "Unconscious" body so debuffs make sense
[1:55:40] harrobert: it's basically an asset flip from rocket, I don't think there is ANY lore behind what they did. it's still fun to play though, and I hate that I like it
[1:55:42] Akiron_rafa: Its a clone Kappa
[1:56:06] mahajimbo: WheelDark WheelLight
[1:56:17] Orin_The_Sly: Tho, why dont the drone take you shit?
[1:56:24] Gliderman: clearly this is asset flipped space engineers lol
[1:56:27] aliceoface: oh well , it's not even 3ft,  to me he just miss by 1 ft
[1:56:38] daemonaedryn: Nah nah, this is clearly asset flipped DayZ Kappa
[1:56:56] kiegh_: that must be your pain
[1:57:02] harrobert: I think it is, why would they insert wolves, bears, deer etc on the planet when the trailers showed strange alien wildlife
[1:57:17] daemonaedryn: I guess maybe the "broken bone" debuff affects all bones? For some reason?
[1:57:26] SnackableGames: !COTD

[1:58:05] lcePops: Why don't you delete your other character
[1:58:06] Gliderman: I thought aliens were hunted at in the trailer
[1:58:09] rofl1436: cant you remove your old character?
[1:58:11] Chronoes: it feels really weird how it's an alien area but the animals are completely Earth-like
[1:58:12] babergLOL: That's a consistent bug, I get 2 reports, first one empty, second one has my money
[1:58:13] Orin_The_Sly: NODDERS
[1:58:14] kaos4666: they terraform it makes sense in that @Giantwaffle
[1:58:15] daemonaedryn: One thing I definately dont like this game is that they went all spacey and sci-fi... then went pure basic human shit for everything
[1:58:15] Gliderman: I mean, there are cave worms
[1:58:16] SnackableGames: No COTD?
[1:58:19] hashbringer: the graphics are nice but the world layout and filling is pretty bad, 95 pct of missions is walking simulator with nothing happening
[1:58:22] HostileLogOut: @Orin_The_Sly hell ye its a great game :D
[1:58:25] Mandorake: this game has the same enemy variation as new world

[1:58:39] ChromeSDK: Isnt there a big ass sandworm?
[1:58:48] daemonaedryn: If your terraforming a planet, wouldnt you try to design it to be optimal for humans? So no bears or anything that can legitimately kill humans?
[1:58:59] kiegh_: oh well you'll remember this when you get further along
[1:59:05] n8level: etalHowdy
[1:59:07] ArsiN23: I wish the world was more alien kind of

[1:59:10] kaos4666: you cant repair it
[1:59:10] zuckenderblitz81: there are some sort of aliens in the intro video.
[1:59:21] Zuiuzz: COTD in 1 minute
[1:59:24] stormlord89: are there pickaxes and hatches there ?
[1:59:30] Gliderman: @daemonszyman true, but also having a balanced ecosystem is important
[1:59:34] ChromeSDK: The DLCs though are more geared towards the alien side of the planet
[1:59:38] Stillglade: maybe try an outpost build

[2:00:46] stormlord89: maybe one fast one for suit then something longer
[2:00:53] 0omkins: Doesn't Deep Vein unlock exotics?
[2:01:05] ItsaSin88: you do have  waht you need

[2:06:27] AmericanMeat: they could do like 200 or 300 for full respec and i would be ok with it
[2:06:35] TrupaJay: I think they said it'll cost exotics when they add it
[2:06:57] SquarePlate: yeah
[2:06:58] goosfraba121: both options would be nice
