[0:28:25] Tolnin: @cizuss kinda OP vs non-bosses, ESPECIALLY OP vs human sized bosses
[0:28:28] ylyxaa: Deathblight is basically frostbite but also -50% status resistance
[0:28:38] priyanshu14286f: Oh i was hearing Shitness Shell lol

[3:05:08] Paetun__p: the heirloom could be their great rune
[3:05:10] jdesrochers23x: Not being able to give Radahn the gold unalloyed needle is such a missed opportunity
[3:05:21] casique2812: DinoDance
[3:05:33] rigby__rigby: have you played ascended mod?
[3:05:35] problemsolvaaa: @carmelodc same tbh, those minifigs would look so amazing
[3:05:36] nevadasieera: @jdesrochers23x i think the dude is beyond curing
[3:05:50] 63topher02: @ginomachino what class are you using
[3:06:06] MrInsideOutSocks: I wonder if 2 handing the Ashe of War increases the stagger damage?
[3:06:23] Miistt: malenia would send you to mohg to get miquella
[3:06:23] rigby__rigby: @GinoMachino have you played ascended mod?
[3:06:23] jdesrochers23x: @nevadasieera to be fair the needle doesn't exactly "cure". It blocks a god's influence on a person and since the Rot comes from a god we don't really much about, the needle would still block the rot's influence on Radahn
[3:06:26] KoenigOne: Malenia mentioned wideSNIFFA
[3:06:36] dxdouglax: or a practice combat
[3:06:39] croompley: this was in ds1 with the nito covenant
[3:06:44] ixvoodooo: once you have learned all you can challenge them
[3:06:46] Slothlord__: like rykard and volcano manor then? you do things for tanith and get rewards but you can still fight richard at the end?
[3:06:48] Osman_iac: wideSNIFFA
[3:06:49] adamnave: like that you "CAN" fight them its just not the intended progression?
[3:06:51] notyourdadsai: How about to get the final tier of spells you have to fight the teacher
[3:06:51] MachinoBot: 9 hours
[3:07:02] MeloBro999: @problemsolvaaa i keep picturing the Ranni minifigure in my head and it looks cool af
[3:07:08] spleen17: passive Malenia wideSNIFFA
[3:07:22] nevadasieera: @jdesrochers23x :O easy there man. i believe you
