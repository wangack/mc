And it has come to my attention that you have a train transporting endangered animals. Now I don't know where you will be taking them, but I know damn sure that train doesn't have a proper ventilation system, that is a huge animal health issue. You will receive a letter from WWF soon. And no I don't forget about handrails, or the lack of them. SusgeNote Cheer100

His friends, however, bore the brunt of his constant bullying, enduring his thoughtless pranks with reluctant laughter. In the end, CoolAid's careless antics left him with an empty circle of friends, realizing too late that laughter at the expense of others comes with a lonely price.
