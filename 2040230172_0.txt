[0:38:06] the_oreo_ott3r: can't decide if watching Warden wrangling or watching Karn die on his stream is more stressful BibleThump BibleThump
[0:38:08] dummyboar: @themidknightgamer yup pretty much
[0:38:31] beardysbeard: the best way posible
[0:38:32] allmozdergel: Is a brave way
[0:38:33] GaspsHiChat: at least it isn't to a baby zombie pearlieLOL
[0:38:38] revrich36: it would be an epic way
[0:38:40] preparedman: It'd be silly if you successfully escape the warden and then just trip over a baby zombie
[0:38:45] brian_of_farce: You got this Pearl! Ignore the haters pearlieDab
[0:38:46] Sparcles5: It would be a great way to die pearlieLOL But also sad
[0:38:47] bluubuns: Surviving this and then dying in a silly way would be hilariously painful
[0:38:49] chibiplaysgames: Joel almost died building his hardcore nether base, it was stressful
[0:38:54] TheMidKnightGamer: @gaspshichat we hope

[0:39:29] chickennuggsxx: Pearl I was wondering if you know if there is going to be another MCC or if it is over?
[0:39:36] alexyap0223: alexyap0223 is gifting 1 Tier 1 Subs to PearlescentMoon's community! They've gifted a total of 16 in the channel! 
[0:39:37] alexyap0223: alexyap0223 gifted a Tier 1 sub to HouseOfMeza!

[0:40:55] Headset_Hobo: @TheMidKnightGamer That's all part of the Hardcore process. Each time you do a bit better

[0:41:42] Kawaiitron_: @bluubuns Cats can definitely sense emotions, at least some emotions. I once had a nightmare and woke up crying, and Licorice came to me just seconds later to comfort me.
[0:41:51] cupofjasmtea: nuggie is as excited as we are for the warden

[0:42:19] xWildSlicerx: In my HC world, I went down into my mineshaft for a bit of mining... came back to a creeper chilling in my boat right next to my house. Creepers absolutely will find an AFK player :P
[0:42:22] chibiplaysgames: That’s okay!
[0:42:22] alexyap0223: pearlieLOL
[0:42:24] bluubuns: @kawaiitron_ Oh my gosh that’s so sweet of your kitty pearlieSad They’re so smart!
[0:42:28] dummyboar: we need a new mob that scares warden LUL
[0:42:37] kazriel_: big cry
[0:42:38] chibiplaysgames: it was a banger track
[0:42:46] tansyminecraft: it was both beautiful and bittersweet
[0:42:48] preparedman: It was moving
[0:42:49] thisjaid3n: I haven’t watched it yet, I mentally can’t until I finish the rest of the season
[0:42:50] lighttsoul: @kawaiitron_ that's adorable pearlieHeart pearliePearlLove

[0:42:54] Sparcles5: the animatic was a lovely way to finish it pearlieHeart
[0:42:55] adriann1234_1: This is my first time seeing one of your streams 👋
[0:42:57] arcanapopcorn: I almost lost my 200 day hardcore world the other day because an evoker behind a wall bugged out and just started spamming vexed so I had like thirty on me
[0:42:57] antalia_lotus: i did not cry at the last epsode .... ok i did cry to the cinematic BibleThump BibleThump pearlieSad pearliePepe
[0:42:57] comzic_cosmo: Yeah, because half the time your character dies
[0:42:58] chickennuggsxx: my dachshund is a sassy queen so she just stares at people and if you sit down it is cuddle time
[0:42:59] beardysbeard: very moving
[0:42:59] bluubuns: Goodbyes are always painful! Even if we know it’s coming
[0:43:00] Blue_Hamster11: i almost cried
[0:43:02] Kawaiitron_: @bluubuns He’s a very smart boy! Even taught him how to sit on command, but he really only does it if he sees a treat in his future. pearlieLOL
[0:43:12] TheJogMan: as a more technical player who has been playing this game for well over a decade at this point, i actually dont find standard hardcore to be challenging enough
[0:43:12] Sparcles5: I mean cinematic pearlieLOL pearlieHeart
[0:43:14] alexyap0223: pearlieSweat
[0:43:18] brian_of_farce: It inspired me to watch Grian's ending again.  Love seeing people appreciating others
[0:43:19] seibaby: HC is all about prep prep prep
[0:43:26] thisjaid3n: your esmp ending still makes me cry
[0:43:35] alexyap0223: pearlieGG
[0:43:38] xWildSlicerx: I'm new to HC minecraft... and I'm not an easy scare.. but this HC MC world has made me jump a handful of times already lol

[0:43:51] NoraTion__: I remember not playing hardcore since i thought i would be blown up by a creeper when mining the first tree
[0:44:08] seibaby: @TheJogMan same lol, it's easy enough to overprepare. Every MC challenge is just hard in the beginning
[0:44:09] TheJogMan: ive gotten too familiar with the limits of my skill and know how to back out of situations i can't handle, so hardcore ends up feeling like im just playing on hard, i have to turn off natural regen before i feel any stress
[0:44:10] TheMidKnightGamer: Lol
[0:44:11] lighttsoul: @kawaiitron_ dont do that to me!!!
[0:44:12] Hyper4rchy: brain rambling?
[0:44:36] yellow_cerber: Saaaaame
[0:44:46] arcanapopcorn: exactly!!!
[0:44:55] dummyboar: when creepers explode i don't fear for my life, i fear for my storage system
[0:44:59] bluubuns: For me it’s just too stressful! I play on Normal/Peaceful like a coward pearlieDed
[0:45:09] TheJogMan: @dummyboar so true
[0:45:11] TheMidKnightGamer: That's why I can't play hardcore...I'm a ten year Minecraft player and the nether still makes me itchy
[0:45:19] BaldBover: I would never speculate on new Hermits, but how are you feeling about being called Pearlie-Pop all next season?  :)
[0:45:26] GaspsHiChat: i've been playing minecraft since 2011 and still play on easy bc i get scared too easily
[0:45:32] Hyper4rchy: san diego was fun the first time but man why not new york or any east coast city
[0:45:33] chickennuggsxx: is there ever going to be a twitch con in Melbourne or Geelong in the future?
[0:45:37] Gene_Svifson: Do you have anything you planning to attend?
[0:45:42] Hyper4rchy: or even boston that wouldve been a really good place to hold it
[0:45:42] Kawaiitron_: @themidknightgamer Same here, about 10 years and I still can’t hardcore.
[0:45:47] TheOfficialAJZoomer: honestly its insane how long its taken you to get to 700K subscribers like in 2013 you had 6 subscribers
[0:45:49] hecategamer: OMG HI PEARL!!!
[0:45:50] Nightbot:  Be respectful - No spamming - No advertising - English only

[0:45:59] jc_crafty00: i think ive grown numb to hardcore scares after having to watch scar play his hardcore world that was a new level of stress 😂😂
[0:46:01] bluubuns: Byeee @kawaiitron_ !
[0:46:06] TheMidKnightGamer: I will play on hard for the challenge but that's as far as I'll go
[0:46:15] TheJogMan: @Hyper4rchy as someone from Massachusetts, i would absolutely LOVE a Boston TwitchCon, no travel costs
[0:46:25] Blue_Hamster11: @Kawaiitron_ Byee! pearlieWave pearlieHeart pearlieBoop
[0:46:28] alexyap0223: pearlieLOL

[0:46:43] seibaby: Well have something sweet to eat and chill under a blanket for a bit
[0:46:44] NoraTion__: Is it better to ask questions when the topic comes up or whenever the question pops up in the head?
[0:46:46] bluubuns: Was it negative instead?

[0:47:10] VoxKeys: just blame it on the sick brain
[0:47:10] Starrrdust8: nooooo
[0:47:11] TheJogMan: a NYC twitchcon would also be rather convenient for me, but i would still need a hotel if i wanted to attend more than one day
[0:47:12] Hyper4rchy: KEKW
[0:47:14] xWildSlicerx: Good practice. Lets roll it back and try again LuL

[0:47:21] Hyper4rchy: @Hyper4rchy boston would be amazing tbh
[0:47:22] Headset_Hobo: Also, you need to move the portal down again
[0:47:24] allmozdergel: Well...it was stone...
[0:47:25] 19_meg_91: pearliePalm
[0:47:27] dummyboar: @kawaiitron_ i play "fake hardcore": survival on hard but I must stay alive until beating the ender dragon, can chill afterwards
[0:47:32] TheMidKnightGamer: You only kept your word...it's a good thing lol
[0:47:32] brian_of_farce: You're doing amazing Pearlie!

[0:47:48] Algorab_delta: pearlieLurkies
[0:47:52] zsigmons1: Potion of the turtle master? You wouldn't go fast anyway while kiting the warden, and it could protect you from at least one hit.
[0:47:54] snowystar122: so the warden is happening today? :D
[0:47:54] battlegamma: smort, keep pearlo safe
[0:48:02] kozziollek: why no torches?
[0:48:02] TheJogMan: @Hyper4rchy another huge plus of having a convention in any north eastern city is that we actually have public transit around here
[0:48:05] WhoIsEpikus: Hi, what happening? Getting Warden in?
[0:48:11] seibaby: So what's the plan?
[0:48:14] alexyap0223: pearlieLOL

[0:48:53] Hyper4rchy: oh jolly that sounds like an amazing plan
[0:48:58] bluubuns: What are you naming it btw?
[0:49:05] xWildSlicerx: why would it be riskier to do it when its spawning and doesnt have a chance to hit you?
[0:49:08] Headset_Hobo: If you catch it while it's in the spawning animation, it can't attack you while you are doing it
[0:49:16] dummyboar: next goal, bring the ender dragon in the overworld LUL
[0:49:22] waarisdetaart: won't it despawn when going through the portal if not nametagged?
[0:49:22] Hopmeister: Hopmeister subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 15 months, currently on a 15 month streak! joined hardcore stream, first thing I hear is warden
[0:49:23] ekztermin80r: So...is pearl going to die today or not? pearlieThink pearlieThink
[0:49:24] chickennuggsxx: do you think there will be a twitch con in Melbourne in the near future?
[0:49:40] preparedman: Whatever you're most comfortable with
[0:49:41] thisjaid3n: @ekztermin80r Maybe
[0:49:41] WhoIsEpikus: @ekztermin80r don't jynx it /sar
[0:49:47] BaldBover: It won't despawn in the portal
[0:49:49] seibaby: It won't despawn as long as it's being kept busy by a noisemaker
[0:49:51] beardysbeard: spoders
[0:49:52] Stormi_Stik: no matter how it goes, you cant go out worse than secret life mumbo or double life grian lol
[0:49:52] ekztermin80r: pearlieLuL pearlieLuL
[0:49:53] Fal27leN: you think its small time windowbut you have at least 4 or 5 sec
[0:50:02] Headset_Hobo: Wardens despawn on a 60s inactivity timer, not the same mechanic as regular mobs
[0:50:02] zsigmons1: I think it will, if you go through a different portal
[0:50:11] alexyap0223: pearlieHeart
[0:50:16] TheMidKnightGamer: @stormi_stik pfft lol
[0:50:24] hecategamer: hello pearl! I'm so glad i caught this stream!! I've been watching you on Youtube for ages and you inspired me to start streaming and making content! i love you!! <3
[0:50:26] allmozdergel: Invite tango, and make him use the name tag
[0:50:27] the_graph_man: doesnt a nether portal load the other ide for 15 seconds?
[0:50:28] nivinog: Have you decided on a theme to build in for hermitcraft season 10?
[0:50:29] keshkup: Tango thought they would despawn, but they didn't
[0:50:30] Hyper4rchy: if it doesnt know where you are 100% thatll definitely be better
[0:50:51] dummyboar: water bubble column for quick escape
[0:50:57] pintobean77: Howdy everyone!  What's happening on the stream today?
[0:51:02] xWildSlicerx: Hermits basing together 👍
[0:51:05] thisjaid3n: @Stormi_Stik ”It was my own fence posts!!!” -mumbo 2023
[0:51:09] VoxKeys: @pintobean77 Warden Wrangling
[0:51:15] bookworm2692: ooooo. is this like the chunk idea suggested last time? with multiple themes?
[0:51:16] rain_9991: @xwildslicerx shh they don't know we know
[0:51:27] ekztermin80r: @thisjaid3n not that I really want pearl to die, but i find it fun to wager about it lol
[0:51:28] GaspsHiChat: i love the sound deepslate makes when you mine it
[0:51:31] zsigmons1: Yeah, but the chunk won't be loaded if you go too far away
[0:51:33] alexyap0223: pearlieLurkies
[0:51:38] NoraTion__: Did you pick the parts for your pc by yourself or did someone do it for you?
[0:51:48] startracker32: i’ve gotta go but i’ll be back
[0:51:49] Hyper4rchy: whys the cave sound more teerrifying than normal monkaS
[0:51:50] Headset_Hobo: If Doc can have 70 of them in his tunnel then despawning isn't an issue, because they aren't named, just hooked with a noise machine
[0:51:51] allmozdergel: Will not agro too fast with the interaction?
[0:51:54] dummyboar: raw iron block, nice texturing block pearlieHeart
[0:52:01] hecategamer: hello pearl! I'm so glad i caught this stream!! I've been watching you on Youtube for ages and you inspired me to start streaming and making content! i love you!! <3
[0:52:02] pancake_lover_333: HI PEARL hows warden wrangling doing?
[0:52:05] TheMidKnightGamer: @thisjaid3n omg y'all got me laughing out loud while my roommates are asleep quit lol
[0:52:11] brian_of_farce: "it'll be fine" *ominous noise intensifies*
[0:52:31] gamingnscience: Is the season 10 seed blind again (for as long as it takes Scicraft to reverse math it) or do you know it in advance?
[0:52:37] seibaby: I'd say the safest way is to have it spawn directly into a portal, and on the other side a noisemaker attracts it into a cage
[0:52:43] TheMidKnightGamer: Noise machine will definitely work
[0:52:43] WhoIsEpikus: So what are we naming the warden? I reckon, if it doesn't have a name idea yet "Moon Potato" or "Big Moon Potato"
[0:52:46] pintobean77: This a single player world?
[0:52:46] TobyLovesCatss: how much ram do you have?
[0:52:58] WhoIsEpikus: @dummyboar true dat
[0:53:07] antalia_lotus: hmmm pearlieThink
[0:53:13] chibiplaysgames: He’s gonna be a nugget I guarantee
[0:53:14] Headset_Hobo: I believe they path through them, same as if they are targeting a player
[0:53:17] TobyLovesCatss: Jesus Christ

[0:53:46] Hyper4rchy: once I upgrade I plan to splurge and get at minimum 128gb rqam if possible, the amount of chrom tabs ill be able to open without trouble will be golden
[0:53:50] xWildSlicerx: What mod are you using for this version of F3?

[0:54:15] allmozdergel: Berry bush + carpet? To block the path around the portal
[0:54:20] mustavariz: @phisig Yeah but she does record and edit videos so
[0:54:27] chibiplaysgames: I actually didn’t know you could still pop through the nether roof. For some reason I thought they’d patched that over
[0:54:47] xWildSlicerx: @Headset_Hobo Is it? My Better F3 clutters my screen far more than this.. is the info displayed customizable?
[0:54:48] chibiplaysgames: wooooooo

[0:55:59] preparedman: For those who don't know: the wardens in level 4 of decked out were all named after the pacman ghosts with Clyde being the only one not represented and that's why alot of us want the name Clyde. Essentially the missing warden

[1:14:45] thehiddenmeow: On twitter you said you had a trip to Melbourne City how far away from Melbourne are you? I just find it so cool how close I live to you!
[1:14:45] mustavariz: @phisig Btw you can't really acces the nether roof in bedrock so console for example
[1:14:50] idave4321: Joel and pearl are the 2 best hardcore players
[1:14:53] TobyLovesCatss: @phisig Just don’t go straight to the PVP community.
[1:14:57] Starrrdust8: I’m tired but I want to watch this aaa
[1:15:03] TheJogMan: @phisig i always love to hear about how parents and kids play minecraft together, its such a perfect game for it, and the complexity of the topics it can help a kid learn can grow with them
[1:15:14] ekztermin80r: @kylareth1 a bow would do the same thing i think
[1:15:22] TheMysticCrafter: there is a trick where you eat enchanted apple and then golden apple (or the other way around, can't remember atm) and you can accumulate lots of extra hearts and they will stack until you use them
[1:15:30] chickennuggsxx: although you got bored of phasmo! did you watch impulse, gem and skizz teaching bdubs how to play phasmophobia if not you should watch it to see sassy gem!
[1:15:35] chibiplaysgames: Yeah playing with kids is the best, their priorities are so crazy lol
[1:15:42] idave4321: I’m biased to be fair!

[1:16:04] dummyboar: @phisig mustavariz has a good point. Bedrock and Java editions are mostly similar but have a few very important differences
[1:16:08] arcanapopcorn: Philza!!
[1:16:19] chinook_a: i love fwhips hardcore world so much
[1:16:22] mustavariz: @gaspshichat Well you can technically play hardcore in bedrock just don't play anymore after dying
[1:16:24] VoxKeys: could wall it off just in case
[1:16:24] phisig: yea I am on 1.20.4 Java

[1:16:58] mayorplayz86: ello pearl
[1:17:00] TheMysticCrafter: make sure every pathway is 3 blocks tall
[1:17:03] TheBeeAndTea: @gaspshichat I feel like it'd be a possibility since they added spectator so we could spectate after death, it doesn't SEEM like it'd be that hard to code with the individual aspects of it there
[1:17:04] JustMadeNinjas: Ethos mad somewhere that your portal has missing corners
[1:17:10] Nightbot:  Be respectful - No spamming - No advertising - English only

[1:17:15] roflwotl: catJAM
[1:17:18] mulgara4: honestly the best noise machine is just a trapdoor next to a skulk sensor
[1:17:21] secret_agent4706: Maybe put a barrier just in case
[1:17:22] Kanavitas: catJAM
[1:17:26] m1gr3nA: @phisig then you are fine, just make sure you have a way to get back :D
[1:17:28] brian_of_farce: Pearl dropping beatz
[1:17:31] tr3b0r85: I would put up walls
[1:17:31] mulgara4: you just make one noise and its easy to set up
[1:17:33] ekztermin80r: @headset_hobo yep... He's definitely NOT joining another smp anytime soon...
[1:17:34] mustavariz: @gaspshichat Yeah also my mind wouldn't probably be strong enough to not play
[1:17:34] BaldBover: i'd do a barrier just to be safe
[1:17:35] waarisdetaart: you could block it off around the hole to be sure?
[1:17:35] thehiddenmeow: Any news of Season 10 of HermitCraft

[1:17:49] GaspsHiChat: @mustavariz same i'd get too attached
[1:17:53] TheJogMan: @phisig a really strong example of how minecraft can be a valuable learning environment even as a kid gets older is that modded minecraft is what got me into software development
[1:17:54] 19_meg_91: He will walk around, just watch LUL
[1:17:55] dummyboar: @phisig well you're in luck, most great tutorials/guides are Java oriented (and you can access the nether roof to travel more easily)
[1:17:57] botrenato: Block the sides
[1:17:57] castlebeki: yeah barrier to be safe maybe
[1:17:59] Headset_Hobo: @ekztermin80r I know right? The most uncryptic, cryptic message ever
[1:18:01] brumpc: maybe put walls on the side so he doesn't go around to get to the sound machine
[1:18:03] taylwillow14: block of the sides maybe
[1:18:04] Sparcles5: perfect strategy hopefully. good luck! pearlieLOL
[1:18:05] the_oreo_ott3r: Good plan!
[1:18:09] a_dangerous_klutz: with the 1 hole gap in the middle will he not decide to go around, since he can't path directly across? he may hug the edges

[2:18:44] Ciefiell: I still have plenty of channel points bring the second warden! pearlieCrazy
[2:18:48] TheOGSpaceDingo: because it wasn't player made, he wasn't insta-agroed. that's intended mechanics
[2:18:49] pastel_cottontail: taking our new pet on a little walk
[2:18:50] bluestrategosj: The one in the netter worked well
[2:18:55] Asterionm: no the nether roof side
[2:18:56] saleo37: What community challenge we gonna do next?
[2:18:56] vegeta_2001: Damn he sprinting
[2:19:00] arcanapopcorn: the noisemaker and walls were built on wool which blocks sound from wardens
[2:19:03] TheOGSpaceDingo: he would've worked his way on the noise machine alone given time
[2:19:07] JaimieeBoo: the wool around the noisemaker might also have made it hard for him to sense it cause the wool kept being slightly in the way
[2:19:09] arcanapopcorn: so he may have not been able to hear it
[2:19:20] alexyap0223: pearlieDeadshot

[2:19:44] JaimieeBoo: @TheOGSpaceDingo it was a couple times
[2:19:44] GhostGecko8: i think it was bc it wasn't a player
[2:19:49] TheOGSpaceDingo: it's intended mechanics acting less quickly than preferred
[2:19:51] kattituude: @brumpc Seriously! LUL
[2:19:52] the_mmx: Will named warden never despawn and hide in the ground?
[2:19:53] KendarTheOrc: Trying to capture an elder guardian would feel a bit fishy

[2:19:57] KayaWolfHorse: ender dragon pet when /j
[2:19:59] Cyber_Saurus90: He looks like he’s absolutely jamming to some fire music back there

[2:20:05] enderella3: hes coming for u to give you a hug
[2:20:06] LilleSpinat: did it make a difference that he had sniffed you first? so he was more interested in you?
[2:20:09] TheOGSpaceDingo: @JaimieeBoo back when he was wandering around the shrieker, too far away to hear anyways, yes. but he was too far away initially.
[2:20:12] secret_agent4706: @the_mmx yes named warden doesn't despawn

[2:20:39] zo_hna: Youll be transforming the temple with the warden inside?
[2:20:39] Kanavitas: direct attack gives more aggro, is why
[2:20:48] cattootler: how many blocks distance before the sonic shriek reaches you?
[2:20:48] Asterionm: hitting him aggros more right?
[2:20:48] waarisdetaart: how many blocks left to go?
[2:20:53] the_mmx: He tired running
[2:20:53] preparedman: Just taking your pet for a walk
[2:20:53] seibaby: Please build a little peg leg warden statue
[2:20:56] a_hyasinth: @MagicallyWeirdyt oh no I had that at one point and had to get new shoes
[2:21:00] yvbrenda: Lol warden is tired of the long walk
[2:21:01] vegeta_2001: Just make sure he doesn't sonic charge
[2:21:03] sapphicwhimsy: snowballs dont do damage
[2:21:03] BrokenWeeble: BrokenWeeble subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 38 months! run away!
[2:21:03] bluestrategosj: An enthusiastic walk
[2:21:04] TheOGSpaceDingo: @cattootler 20 onthe dot
[2:21:05] giannnovich: oh a real long one
[2:21:06] eyow189: Angy warden, dont pet the angy warden
[2:21:09] zer0ntt: Hit it directly, snowballs has no damage
[2:21:09] Kanavitas: not a problem, snowballs don't do damage, regardless of redness
[2:21:11] mulanv44: Seems like I came back from my walk at the best time PridePog what is the warden's name?
[2:21:12] 19_meg_91: @zo_hna the warden is more than 20 blocks down
[2:21:13] pastel_cottontail: snowballs do 0 damage
[2:21:14] VoxKeys: This isn't as stressful as it was earlier
[2:21:18] alexyap0223: pearlieExcited
[2:21:21] KendarTheOrc: "And I would walk 500 miles and I would walk 500 more"
[2:21:23] enderella3: days played:1137,point of the 100 days in hardcore challenge?
[2:21:26] TheOGSpaceDingo: @Kanavitas they do tho. 1-2 dmg. snow golems can kill.
[2:21:26] datguccipoochie: Pearl is one of the few people who would keep a warden as a pet
[2:21:31] preparedman: Getting your warden some exercise
[2:21:37] iCopperBonsai: will the ghast attack him?
[2:21:39] doc383: @kendartheorc 😆
[2:21:41] Sparcles5: @mulanv44 it is "Hi I'm Cleo" I believe
[2:21:48] alexyap0223: pearlieLOL pearlieLOL pearlieLOL
[2:21:48] cattootler: @TheOGSpaceDingo ok so Pearl's staying that distance away?
[2:21:49] Yuzz_underscore: @Kanavitas they'll die faster
[2:21:49] dead_crab_: next step: pet wither
[2:21:49] jasper_186: Dont Jinx Button like that
[2:21:49] xcbrj_games: I have a dragon as a pet
[2:21:50] Dan_K_84: especially totemless
[2:21:50] seibaby: any hardcore world should have 70 wardens ;)
[2:21:50] CrepesAreNice: Wardens are absolutely terrifying, doing this in hardcore is so wild
[2:21:50] azrafdaguy: I actually made it to the warden stream 🥳🥳
[2:21:51] dummyboar: pearl is a responsible owner, taking it on nice long runs
[2:21:53] datguccipoochie: it’s a very funny achievement yes
[2:21:55] arcanapopcorn: I’ll do it!
[2:21:57] a_hyasinth: its important to walk your warden
[2:21:57] johndrinkwater: is it really a pet if you don’t hug it often
[2:21:58] Lone_LadSSB: same
[2:21:59] Asterionm: thats definitely an achievement
[2:22:00] pastel_cottontail: pull a doc and get a pet dragon lol
[2:22:01] blueguineapig78: Ocean temple is definitely worse.
[2:22:03] DetectiveInspectorMe: Guardian as a pet next?
[2:22:04] ando_226: just pearl things
[2:22:05] DasAbsoluteDeuteron: Tango weeps with how easy you make it seem
[2:22:05] vegeta_2001: Wait you're scared of an ocean temple??
[2:22:06] TheOGSpaceDingo: @cattootler maybe double for safety margin
[2:22:07] Sparcles5: get a guardian pet next! pearlieLOL
[2:22:08] vegeta_2001: LUL
[2:22:08] Windfighter42: ocean temples are easy, just stock up on invis potions x3
[2:22:09] tildalovesthedoctor: using my physics skills to work out itll take 8mins to get home LUL
[2:22:09] GaspsHiChat: ocean temples are scary but warden wrangling isn't? i love the logic
[2:22:11] Blue_Hamster11: xD
[2:22:11] preparedman: Elder guardian next?
[2:22:16] dummyboar: 5am pearl peaking through
[2:22:16] JaimieeBoo: ocean temple is definitely a death trap though so it makes sense xD
[2:22:16] bookworm2692: it is logical. you simply have more warden experience than guardian experience
[2:22:19] azrafdaguy: Pet wither?
[2:22:19] alexyap0223: Pet walking pearlieLOL
[2:22:19] duzloo: Imo Ocean Temples are easy with Netherite, and tridents
[2:22:21] enderella3: if you could make the warden friendly pearl would it and than the warden would just be a giant teddy bear
[2:22:22] haggleslag: monuments are EZ with low render distance muchLurk
[2:22:23] pastel_cottontail: Pearl logic at its finest
[2:22:23] gamingnscience: I remember when Skizz build an entire world around this concept
[2:22:24] vegeta_2001: Pearl, you have to have a dragon pet next right??
[2:22:24] datguccipoochie: omg don’t mention the ocean temple lol, that fact blows my mind
[2:22:24] cattootler: @TheOGSpaceDingo yeah that would be me rofl
[2:22:24] toasterGhost00: stretching his hil legs
[2:22:24] RCMNexus: Pearl how do you do it I spawn a warden next minutes it’s in peaceful pearlieLOL
[2:22:25] Amaze_me15: Pearl, you’re insane!
[2:22:27] mulgara4: make a mob switch and then temples are easy
[2:22:27] bluestrategosj: Lets make a zoo with all the mobs
[2:22:29] KayaWolfHorse: ocean temples are super easy with good gear and water breathing tbh
[2:22:29] Gene_Svifson: Next get a dragon pet
[2:22:35] dummyboar: pet ender dragon when
[2:22:40] datguccipoochie: yes
[2:22:41] TheOGSpaceDingo: he broke the dragon's ai
[2:22:41] joytobake: Tango's next game should be a master guardian temple... pearl would be a pro!
[2:22:41] vegeta_2001: it's a complicated process
[2:22:41] giannnovich: doc just likes to break minecraft, like a lot
[2:22:42] saleo37: I mean you started now, you surely gonna get all the other boss mobs as pet, right??
[2:22:42] here_lies_hiroo: good asmr
[2:22:43] TheOGSpaceDingo: then duped it
[2:22:45] vegeta_2001: but very doable
[2:22:46] enderella3: Dragon!!!!!!!
[2:22:47] tildalovesthedoctor: so scawy
[2:22:53] KendarTheOrc: Would you rather fight 100 fish or one silly boi
[2:22:55] GhostGecko8: the thing about wardens is that distance can save u, i've killed several wardens in my world (ut isn't hardcore, but i also didnt die)
[2:22:56] TheOGSpaceDingo: then slimeblocked it
[2:22:56] waarisdetaart: i love how you talk to the warden like he's a toddler xD
[2:23:00] Jareddoink: Even just a stack of doors :P
[2:23:03] cattootler: me, I stick with a cat gtwsLol
[2:23:04] antiheld1800: bring Axelotls to the ocean temples!
[2:23:04] dummyboar: doors, doors are the key
[2:23:06] duzloo: I always go into an Ocean Temple to repair my tools, lol. No farm needed
[2:23:08] datguccipoochie: ocean monument trauma?
[2:23:09] vegeta_2001: There should be an achievement for killing the warden barefisted
[2:23:11] chinook_a: invis potions and just a trident works well
[2:23:17] giannnovich: he does walk like he's taking his  first steps
[2:23:18] zo_hna: he has the proportions
[2:23:19] here_lies_hiroo: a bring your pet to work day
[2:23:21] saleo37: Mooooom, wait for me!!!
[2:23:23] seibaby: ocean temples are absolutely free with invis, water breathing, and the tnt trick
[2:23:24] datguccipoochie: hehe he’s a cute warden
[2:23:24] mulanv44: Little angy boi
[2:23:24] Sparcles5: such a wobbly warden
[2:23:25] dummyboar: doors give air and hide you from prying laser eyes
[2:23:27] haggleslag: on the other hand prismarine looks good with desert colors sooo pearlieLurkies
[2:23:30] vegeta_2001: yup you gotta be quick
[2:23:34] TheOGSpaceDingo: @vegeta_2001 i dont think that's detectable (weapon type of kill on mob in advancement menu)
[2:23:36] bluestrategosj: Army of axoatls for the guardians
[2:23:36] dripandmocha: this is so scary just visually
[2:23:39] stormageddon07: doc blocked all the dragon’s spawn points
[2:23:43] BaldBover: Cubfan's speed-running technique for ocean temples is worth a watch.
[2:23:45] Asterionm: tango did punch 2 wardens to death while maintaining level 3 of decked out
[2:23:45] enderella3: jimmy againest jimmy= toy
[2:23:47] datguccipoochie: yeah you don’t wanna get fisted by the warden, that usually ends poorly
[2:23:49] JaimieeBoo: imagine if the warden actually is a toddler o-o then mumma warden comes looking for him

[3:04:33] tazdeville69: You could say Gemini and I, lol
[3:04:35] natceon: is she turning the desert temple symmetrical
[3:04:42] Minerva_246: Just got on Pearl, how has the stream been so far? How has the warden rangling gone?
[3:04:44] Dan_K_84: Most of my favorite Hermitcraft moments are improv.
[3:04:59] bluubuns: It was my first Hermitcraft episode and knew nobody except Gem, I was feeling the intimidation!!
[3:05:01] johndrinkwater: from experience of that welcome, what advice would you give to the new hermits to feel settled in?
[3:05:17] keshkup: Not the baby voice pearlieCry
[3:05:24] tazdeville69: You could say Gemini and I, lol
[3:05:29] expelliarmus4342: I need to go now Pearl, need to study. Good luck with your build!!
[3:05:34] ItsFineSlugline: I remember when chat wouldn't stop asking if Pearl would join Hermitcraft. LUL
[3:05:43] ByOrderoftheQueen: I actually discovered Hermitcraft via you and Gem last year
[3:05:50] Nightbot:  Be respectful - No spamming - No advertising - English only
[3:06:09] keshkup: @ItsFineSlugline Still wondering if she will
[3:06:14] Minerva_246: I'll have to watch your stream replay to see you in action

[3:06:35] chinook_a: its on fwhips stream bingocard
[3:06:38] Asterionm: pearl how long did you have to keep your joining HC under wraps after you knew?
[3:06:48] bean_ebabies: Hopefully I'll actually stay on top of watching Hermitcraft this season instead of watching it in chunks
[3:06:49] giannnovich: @chinook_a lmao
[3:06:50] VoxKeys: I feel bad for all the theoretical new hermits
[3:06:56] rere8585: she just set us up for disappointment on who is joining
[3:06:58] katmasterofcats: @chinook_a thats when you know its a little too much lol
[3:07:04] jasper_186: i would think its draining cause its out of your hands? since its by invite, its not your choice, untill after they decide?
[3:07:05] tansyminecraft: and make sure to send love to whoever joins, even if theyre not who you guessed!!
[3:07:07] bluubuns: Was it hard suddenly adjusting to a new audience from Hermitcraft?
[3:07:10] waarisdetaart: fwhip has addressed it multiple times
[3:07:10] eshaan: hello, has the wardern been captured
[3:07:12] GaspsHiChat: ShowLove25 i gave bits earlier talking about it a bite more but my heartrate is finally back to normal lol. went from 168bpm to 76bpm

[3:07:21] kattituude: @eshaan it has!
[3:07:23] simplydm_: well said tbh
[3:07:23] chinook_a: it happens at least 3 times during his streams, but now we can say hes been on HC LUL
[3:07:25] preparedman: But what if he's one of the new hermits? pearlieLurkies pearlieLurkies
[3:07:38] Amaze_me15: i’m hoping for someone in particular though not holding out hope
[3:07:38] ohio_ppp: I bet it's Tommy innit joining the server, he's known for his PG content right? 😂
[3:07:40] herbertthecow1: @preparedman lol
[3:07:45] 19_meg_91: @eshaan hi i'm cleo has indeed been captured
[3:07:46] giannnovich: yeah its a process
[3:07:53] rere8585: did  you and Gem get a vote on who joined, does everyone on hermitcraft, i thought thats the process?
[3:07:54] herbertthecow1: @ohio_ppp same as sausage
[3:07:56] chinook_a: @preparedman i would be so excited
[3:07:56] Code4Coffee: Can you explain why there is a warden beneath
[3:07:58] noelle_brooke: I don't remember how I found hermit craft but I was watching Joel at the time and probably found gem through the life series because of Joel but that was in june
[3:07:59] katmasterofcats: @ohio_ppp yep definitely haha
[3:08:04] ItsFineSlugline: <3

[3:09:05] swiz7790: And now who's the new 2members of Hermitcraft?
[3:09:06] Minerva_246: Yeah, I think whoever joins will be welcomed with open arms, I'm trying to avoid the speculations and fan guessing because it is a lot as a viewer so I can't imagine what it'd be like as the creator people are talking about.
[3:09:11] AnnaAsi: idk joels video on his hardcore world where he build the rapunzel castle seemed like an application
[3:09:11] mad_blue_duck: "everyone needs a friend" community challenge, another 10 million, for a second warden???
[3:09:28] MusicFreeGaming: You would tease chat?! I'm shocked! Shocked, I say!
[3:09:38] giannnovich: @Minerva_246 most valid take
[3:09:51] chinook_a: LUL
[3:09:54] sapphic_cassie: I feel like people tend to forget that SMps like Hermitcraft are invite only. Telling someone they should join when it's out of their control especially if they can't get in has got to be rough.
[3:10:01] revrich36: What are you talking about Pearl Never teases chat.
[3:10:03] gizmo__666: She wants to hear wardens, decked our really changed her xD

[3:10:29] waarisdetaart: @Minerva_246 I agree with you and it also helps to not get your hopes up so you won't be 'dissapointed' when it's someone else
[3:10:30] kinda_mediocre_gamer: I just want hermicraft back!

[3:11:11] GaspsHiChat: we need to welcome the new hermits and give them as much love as you would give to the people you wanted

[3:11:18] revaar61: That's a spoiler! the two people who are joining are amazing!
[3:11:19] Aistan83: We all know the new Hermits are gonna be 5AM Pearl and Poultryman
[3:11:20] Minerva_246: I think it'd be hilarious if the silhouettes were the Hermits pranking the community and it's because of how much the community is asking for certain creators to join
[3:11:21] miracleasl: I'm expecting 2 more PearlescentMoons to join LUL
[3:11:22] Cataura: Just happy to see some new faces!

[3:11:35] LowKeyChemist: I'm sure they will be two awesome people
[3:11:36] secret_agent4706: Also another thing is to not to judge if the hermits build smaller builds or large bases next season, saw Gem's tweet about it
[3:11:42] preparedman: I don't think I could be disappointed. It's new blood either way
[3:11:42] LilyMaiDarling: @Sparcles5 my feelings exactly!

[3:11:57] whynot864: i like the touch on the hermitcraft website, where there are two people greyed out on the image of all the hermits at the top
[3:11:57] rere8585: Pearl are you gonna build big or small in s10
[3:11:58] divathranir1504: that i know
[3:11:59] Nicklii: stop hyping us up Kappa

[3:14:31] waarisdetaart: it's always the loudest haters that ruin it D:
[3:14:33] xWildSlicerx: Gem's starter base was extremely cozy. I loved it.
[3:14:36] VoxKeys: i loved her starter base, I was just upset i couldn't do it in bedrock
[3:14:37] ByOrderoftheQueen: People are gonna nit pick no matter what you do
[3:14:39] Exirel: People are annoying.
[3:14:42] cattootler: it's most important that the hermits is happy with what they create
[3:14:43] antalia_lotus: ohhh what !! it was sooo cool
[3:14:44] NoraTion__: Just finished my workout, as i can see the warden is already in the temple, what did you name it?
[3:14:44] realfragments: whatever the hermits do will be great
[3:14:45] LilyMaiDarling: if someone is NOT enjoying their build idea it shows. You're better off building what you like & WANT to do and that energy will shine through the video
[3:14:45] Exirel: But also people are awesome.
[3:14:49] secret_agent4706: Some People are gonna be angry no matter what you do, just better to ignore them, they are a minority anyways
[3:14:53] herbertthecow1: @GaspsHiChat free sand rights pearlieYes pearlieYes
[3:14:53] omniscntreadr: @gamingnscience i mean both sides are mostly just very.. unhinged from what i've seen, it would've gotten muddied up sooner or later
[3:14:54] JustMadeNinjas: no matter what the hermits do there will always be people who get mad about it
[3:14:55] Gene_Svifson: I think the projects have to feel big, like Zedvancents
[3:14:55] brian_of_farce: I liked Cub's comment about micro-bases lol
[3:14:58] bluubuns: The loudest ones are the annoying ones unfortunately
[3:15:00] giannnovich: some people just will never get satisfied
[3:15:00] GaspsHiChat: i adore everyone's starter bases and love seeing what everyone does
[3:15:03] battlegamma: I gotta say mumble van was one of my favorite starter bases and that was basically 12x3
[3:15:03] realfragments: @secret_agent4706 yeah, just loud and annoying
[3:15:04] jessljjd: <333
[3:15:06] Minerva_246: I think that sadly the bad comments overshadow the nice hearts in the community
[3:15:07] Kawaiitron_: The trust exercise at the beginning of S9 lives in my head rent free, I need to work up the motivation to finish the animatic I was making of it.
[3:15:16] mustavariz: Some people are stupid some are awesome like you
[3:15:20] NBCoffeePrince: i found hermit craft because of the life series which is how i found pearl and then i found hermit craft through pearl lol
[3:15:21] glitchered: the season is touted to be less build heavy. so... anybody is welcome. :D
[3:15:28] simplydm_: I feel like mcyt audiences sometimes think they have more influence then they actually do
[3:15:30] Berserk_Loon: I want everyone to build what they feel inspired to create!. not just mega this or that. the base doesn't have to be huge!
[3:15:34] Sparcles5: I find that I enjoy hermitcraft more when the hermits are having fun. Doesn't matter if the build is big or small as long as they're having fun, I have fun watching it pearlieHeart pearlieHeart
[3:15:37] herbertthecow1: @NBCoffeePrince i did that but mumbo
[3:15:39] cattootler: @secret_agent4706 angry or dissatisfied - everyone's a critic.
[3:15:45] Dan_K_84: When you get a group of hundreds of thousands of viewers together they simply won't agree on everything.
[3:15:47] PineappleWarlord: tbh i think it's different people who want the hermits to build specific things vs the people who want the hermits to build what they enjoy
[3:15:47] jessljjd: yes i am doing okay! got a week off college so get to relax
[3:15:48] waarisdetaart: and also people tend to remember negativity better than positivity
[3:15:56] NoraTion__: Just finished my workout, as i can see the warden is already in the temple, what did you name it?
[3:16:00] waarisdetaart: oh yeah exactly what you said
[3:16:01] xWildSlicerx: ANd unfortunately, the negative side of things is what comes across on social media. Rarely does the positive side show up.
[3:16:01] giannnovich: The human brain is such a weird concept
[3:16:02] realfragments: yeah, that's a thing that brains do a lot

[3:16:04] KayaWolfHorse: that’s why it’s important to be vocal about your love and support when you can tbh
[3:16:07] burningsky17: You will remeber negative comments more than positive
[3:16:07] here_lies_hiroo: people will just be angry no matter what tbh
[3:16:09] d1n0ni: Its being human
[3:16:09] ohio_ppp: I lost my hermit virginity to grian
[3:16:09] glitchered: i'm not human. most of the time. positives vibes. LUL

[3:16:19] bluubuns: I think it’s unfair to say “don’t listen to negativity”, the responsibility should lie on the commenters, not on the creators!
[3:16:24] tyler_j_kovalskas: @jessljjd i hope you can get rid of the chronic pain and whatever causes it soon. Good luck with everything pearlieBoop
[3:16:25] cattootler: yep Scar says the same, he said he didn't know why one particular comment stuck with him.  But we cheered him up
[3:16:26] kattituude: It's just too bad because anyone that's willing to be openly negative about someone else's creation is just a negative person inside. It doesn't make sense to me
[3:16:28] thekey149: @antalia_lotus is that a heckin pun
[3:16:28] burningsky17: @ohio_ppp what is hermit vigrinity???

[3:16:50] lightlyylucid: when I think about what people ‘should’ and ‘shouldn’t’ do I think about someone like Ren who based extremely far and said he wished he hadn’t. I just want people to do what they WANT to do and stop catering so much to the masses.

[3:18:44] antalia_lotus: i loved bingo semt sooo fun pearlieHeart pearlieHugs
[3:18:45] dead_crab_: the bingo was a lot of fun to watch
[3:18:49] burningsky17: the person doesn't know what they are talking about
[3:18:51] Tirius82: it was lovely :)
[3:18:51] mashferef_wijafkjfa: your finale had me absolutely sobbing for a good 30 mins so i'd say you did a good job with it pearlieHeart
[3:18:53] mustavariz: I always love when hermits show tribute for TFC so that was my favourite part of the finale
[3:18:54] GaspsHiChat: bin go was so fun honestly. if i could somehow recreate it in bedrock and play it with friends i would. such an amazing minigame idea and executed perfectly
[3:18:54] bluubuns: They can go watch something else!
[3:18:57] herbertthecow1: pearlieYes pearlieYes pearlieYes pearlieYes
[3:18:59] ilvoeyoux: bin-go was amazing fun to watch :D
[3:19:00] xWildSlicerx: Is it the kind of negative that you can turn around into something productive or was it just rubbish negativity?
[3:19:01] ohio_ppp: Haters gonna hate
[3:19:01] seibaby: The Hermits enjoyed it, you enjoyed it. The proof is in the pudding
[3:19:01] KayaWolfHorse: bin-go was awesome! seeing everyone enjoy themselves so much was delightful
[3:19:03] burningsky17: @bluubuns correct
[3:19:05] giannnovich: BinGo has lots of potential for sure, even just in beta!
[3:19:06] kennediem: You know what determines if it's fun? You and the hermits. Not us
[3:19:06] LeafyHippoPlant: bingo was such a fun and silly little game!
[3:19:06] mustavariz: Bin-go is amazing
[3:19:15] bean_ebabies: The bingo was so silly to watch I loved it
[3:19:21] secret_agent4706: Bin-go was very  fun!
[3:19:22] shanesunil: Hopefully Bin-go is made in season 10 again
[3:19:27] GaspsHiChat: critique and condtructive criticism are so so so different from straight up hating and negativity
[3:19:27] detsub: Wait someone didnt like bingo? o.O
[3:19:32] waarisdetaart: ooo sounds fun
[3:19:33] antalia_lotus: ohhhhh pearlieExcited
[3:19:34] burningsky17: some people think they are able to make people change their opinion by being angry
[3:19:35] preparedman: Bingo seemed so fun I'd love it on a larger scale even. Having teams was so cool pearlieHeart
[3:19:35] Sparcles5: Exactly! So many of us love Bin-go!! It was so much fun!! Minigames and interactions are one of my favourite things about hermitcraft! pearlieHeart pearlieHeart pearlieHeart
[3:19:42] Minerva_246: Oh nice! cleoWo
[3:19:49] ohio_ppp: The PvP element was great to observe
[3:19:49] jadynfaye83: Pearl is going to build squid game lol
[3:19:50] LilyMaiDarling: There constructive criticism then theres just mean words. I personally loved the bingo chaos
[3:19:55] ashinoyubihiza: Cheer1000 I oppose bingo because you promised flaming lava hermit death,  and I didn't get it. So sad...
[3:19:57] PineappleWarlord: the bingo was great, even I ended up with ideas afterwards and I was only enjoying it second hand
[3:19:59] shanesunil: Oh no! Looking at how the hermits played Cleo's Red Light Green Light game, it is going to go horribly wrong lol
[3:20:00] PipperinClassic: Negative comments are sometimes not even regular fans, so catering to them is really a losing game
[3:20:00] rere8585: pearl did you watch the zedolympics?  there were alot of good games there
[3:20:02] Headset_Hobo: I'll admit, I didn't enjoy Bin-Go in it's current state, But it is a good concept and has so much space to expand into. Instead of being negative about it, I skipped that part of the video.
[3:20:09] antalia_lotus: ohhh stop the tesing pearlieCry
[3:20:21] herbertthecow1: is bin-go meant to be a play on words like trash-bin-go
[3:20:21] frostyfly31122: its that person's problem, they can quite easily watch something else if they dont like it gluShrug  my question would be is the cleaning lady coming back and if not how will it affect the game gluThink
[3:20:28] zer0ntt: Does this mean the cleaning lady will still reign? pearlieHeart pearlieHype pearlieHype
[3:20:32] brian_of_farce: Yeah he was the first to say the time should be shortened.  Grian is good at CC
[3:20:33] autum_mist_101: Don't take criticism from someone you wouldn't take advice from.
[3:20:41] Sparcles5: pearlieHeart pearlieHeart pearlieHeart pearlieHeart pearlieHeart pearlieHeart pearlieHeart pearlieHeart
[3:20:43] kennediem: But see, there are things you say and things you think. Like Bin-go was not my favorite mini game. Was it bad? absolutely not, but am I gonna just tell you it wasn't my fave just for fun? No, because it is someone's favorite because we all have differing opinions!
[3:20:55] ohio_ppp: Season 10 should be the cleaning ladies arch nemesis. The messy lady 😂😂
[3:20:57] revaar61: So if you are bringing back Bin-Go, does that mean you are keeping the Cleaning Lady Schtick?
[3:20:59] pastel_cottontail: sometimes it’s just in bad faith
[3:21:00] shanesunil: @PipperinClassic Best example - the hate comments towards Secret Life - surely the fans of previous life series loved it
[3:21:01] Dan_K_84: And I'm sure there are Hermits that can help figure out the redstone if you need it.
[3:21:08] PlzJustBreathe: PlzJustBreathe subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 39 months! 
[3:21:08] Minerva_246: Whatever you do next season will be stunning! You're awesome, never let those haters tell you otherwise and if something does happen and it hurts, call us your dogs of war and we will ride at dawn!
[3:21:09] Riff_Raff_: @autum_mist_101 That's good advice
[3:21:09] herbertthecow1: @ohio_ppp lizze
[3:21:21] GaspsHiChat: there were so many amazing minigames this season. my favourites were bin go and blood on the clocktower
[3:21:22] burningsky17: could it be because twitch users are probably more mature (yes this isn't fact checked)
[3:21:25] bluubuns: Some of the younger/immature people leave very inconsiderate comments, it upsets me even if it’s not directed at me oof
[3:21:35] tyler_j_kovalskas: Even if only 1 person says anything positive about something, that doesn't necessarily mean it's bad, considering it had a positive effect on at least that person. People should be kind, especially if they want something to be done differently, trolls don't change anything for the better
[3:21:41] joytobake: I loved Bingo
[3:21:41] ohio_ppp: @herberthecow1 😂😂😂 that's fair actually. She is a mess 😄
[3:21:47] Trevrep469: Peace luv n happiness to all
[3:21:57] waarisdetaart: not every minigame has to be the best minigame too
[3:21:57] bluubuns: Bin-go worked because it was fun, and I love watching my favourite people interact in new ways! pearlieHeart
[3:21:59] ByOrderoftheQueen: I loved bingo because watching the hermits beat the crap out of each other is hilarious
[3:21:59] glitchered: i had nothing to say. i'm obviously into more action focused games. it's aight.
[3:22:02] omniscntreadr: @burningsky17 i guess a majority are since it's more well known for content that isn't PG friendly..?
[3:22:03] derperles: PhylaxisSA subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 2 months, currently on a 2 month streak! I enjoyed the Bingo! It was fun.
[3:22:06] herbertthecow1: @ohio_ppp their is one slim skin person lizze????
[3:22:07] iAdrianRobin: i just wished it had been a bit earlier
[3:22:10] sapphic_cassie: Bingo was super amazing tho! Loved seeing the Hermits deal with all their trash from the season.
[3:22:12] bean_ebabies: Right like why bother leaving something negative for no reason other than to just say something negative
[3:22:20] iCopperBonsai: Nice pillars effect!
[3:22:26] shanesunil: Yes, here's another annoying things about hate comments - they never mention why they hate this particular content at all
[3:22:31] Shin_Zilla: well personally, I can't wait to see more bingo next season!
[3:22:34] thecaborican: Hey, Pearl! Question: why don't you show your face on stream anymore?
[3:22:35] VoxKeys: reminds me a tad of Mumbos s9 base but idk why pearlieThink
[3:22:40] iAdrianRobin: the season timing did not work in vavor i think
[3:22:48] natceon: where does the dirt come from
[3:22:48] gooniekatie: probably a 10 year old troll who doesn’t care when they leave mean comments
[3:22:51] bean_ebabies: I like the shape of the base so far it has a lot of potential
[3:22:56] mustavariz: @voxkeys tha vault
[3:23:00] mustavariz: The*
[3:23:01] oversyded: Yay Pearl uses dirt to shape stuff out just like I do!  Minecraft unites!
[3:23:10] joytobake: Bingo was fabulous because it was so interactive.
[3:23:10] BaldBover: For me, the game itself is less important than the people playing it.  The Hermit family is just entertaining, and as long as y'all are together it will be content gold.
[3:23:10] Kawaiitron_: So I just set an old lady on fire to steal her 1,000,000 simoleons in TS4, how are y’all doing?
[3:23:14] bluubuns: Do you usually read all the comments? I was always so curious about it since there’s so many!
[3:23:16] VoxKeys: @mustavariz this one will be finished though /j
[3:23:21] The_P4tcher: boujour
[3:23:24] ohio_ppp: @herberthecow1 I saw in twitter that Lizzie only wants to make videos at her own leisure rather than having the pressure of regular uploads so most likely not. But could be a red herring
[3:23:24] herbertthecow1: @thecaborican so you dont have too see the grogginess\\ of 5am pearl
[3:23:31] Minerva_246: I don't know what it will look like in the end but I can see there's some cool dimensions going on
[3:23:31] PineappleWarlord: @gooniekatie a lot of younger people in fandoms haven't yet worked out that creators are still humans
[3:23:36] mustavariz: @voxkeys lol
[3:23:36] dummyboar: i don't agree with ppl saying builders need to learn redstone, y'all are already too powerful

[3:23:53] misslittlevipsnowjr: SeemsGood SeemsGood SeemsGood SeemsGood
[3:23:54] revaar61: That's the problem of late season projects, there's not enough time to fine tune or enjoy them.  Like Grian's Minecart game in the Barge on season 7
[3:24:02] bluubuns: That’s a healthy habit pearlieHeart
[3:24:04] noelle_brooke: Secret life?
[3:24:17] rere8585: one of the biggest reasons I like your streams over many others is you respond to comments, so hope that continues
[3:24:20] pastel_cottontail: have you considered having a moderator send comments to you? filter out the bad faith takes
[3:24:22] Minerva_246: I'm so sorry about that Pearl! x

[3:25:45] tyler_j_kovalskas: You're wonderful for reading all the comments, especially considering how many you get. Also it's understandable to take a break from them if you need to carlcraftsLUL carlcraftsHyper
[3:25:45] derperles: Yeah, big braziers would rule!
[3:25:45] noelle_brooke: @herberthecow1 The negative comments there were a lot of people saying that it was an issue. Even reading them myself was depressing sometimes

[3:25:46] here_lies_hiroo: very very normal
[3:25:49] waarisdetaart: 5am Pearl was so normal what are you talking about?
[3:25:50] GaspsHiChat: 5am pearl was not sane but that's why i loved her
[3:25:50] oversyded: just joined.. how is Pearl stopping the Warden from aggroing?  I don't hear a 'noise machine' and she's close enough (I think) that it should be able to blast her
[3:25:50] simoontjuhx: 5am Pearl made the most sense lol

[3:26:08] jadynfaye83: Idunno. I mean, negative comments aren't great but maybe a change of headspace is needed. You need bad to appreciate the good. You do great work Pearl, don't let things get to you. You're one of the best, which is why you're in the position you're in.

[3:35:22] Headset_Hobo: Or you could pull a Kolanii and build a massive Dirt Mansion in Hardcore
[3:35:29] Exirel: Yeah, that one! :D

[3:37:06] Minerva_246: If you do give us a world download then just know that whenever you stream this world you'll have thousands of little ghosties with you as we explore the world from our devices

[3:37:12] here_lies_hiroo: he lost the world i believe
[3:37:13] bluubuns: Power went off when he had his Hardcore world open, and he lost chunks of progress pearlieSad
[3:37:16] Nightbot:  Be respectful - No spamming - No advertising - English only
[3:37:20] KayaWolfHorse: power outages have stolen his world a couple time, losing days of progress
[3:37:28] bluerosedancer: why is there a warden in your base?
[3:37:53] Asterionm: do you keep backups on external hard drive?

[3:38:37] Asterionm: i think the warden trap is worth backing up, i dont think you'd want to do it again
[3:38:47] antalia_lotus: better save it now with the warden
[3:38:51] TheJogMan: got backup batteries for all my PCs, gives a solid 30min to be able to shut everything down properly in the event of a power loss, at some point i need to look into configuring my file server to be able to do it automatically

[3:39:41] jadynfaye83: I could never build on stream. I spend too much time just staring at it trying to figure out what I'm doing lol
[3:39:56] Sparcles5: it would be so sadd
[3:39:58] TheJogMan: there is software you can get and configure to perform automatic backups, so you can just set and forget, but i would recommend contacting an IT consultant if you wanted to get into that
[3:39:59] bean_ebabies: It's like spending hours trying to find a reference for drawing and then losing the motivation to draw
[3:39:59] Metroidhunter1: trust the process. man but i know the pain
[3:40:00] blueberry_37: Hi
[3:40:16] Sparcles5: yeah it sometimes just happens

[3:49:34] GaspsHiChat: ready for the new hermits to join the dysfunctional family as tfc once said 🫶
[3:49:35] dummyboar: it would be very funny if one of the new hermits announced the date but no one took em seriously
[3:49:36] bluubuns: Guys actually it’s us…. We’re all the new hermits
[3:49:36] Nickiatori: haistorms in the province where i live have been known to rip isding off houses
[3:49:39] preparedman: @sparcles5 *falls into a coma*

[3:49:51] bean_ebabies: the new hermits were the friends we made along the way?

[3:50:37] sparkysure: No totems and your playing around with wardens!!! Pearl your crazy
[3:50:50] justyourusualplayer: helloooooooo
[3:50:53] Jareddoink: I hate cars
[3:50:55] ryrytrumps: Have you seen a noticeable change in your followers/subscribers since joining Hermitcraft?
[3:50:55] pipettipete: Hellou
[3:50:58] dummyboar: manual in automatic form ? *squints*
[3:51:01] Naominoodle101: hi
[3:51:03] Riff_Raff_: My car has so many beeps and alarms and it's just annoying
[3:51:05] alexyap0223: pearlieLOL pearlieLOL pearlieLOL

[3:51:07] GaspsHiChat: my car doesn't work bc it's been so cold here

[3:51:09] pipettipete: Warden in already?
[3:51:27] keshkup: @pipettipete Warden is secured
[3:51:32] jetwizardar: would you ever get a fun car in manual transmission?
[3:51:36] ItsFineSlugline: @ryrytrumps Those of us that have been following have noticed a change.
[3:51:36] skandi_31: pearlieHeart pearlieHeart pearlieHeart
[3:51:43] pipettipete: @keshkup Very NOICE ;)
[3:51:47] justyourusualplayer: noo i missed the warden!!!
[3:51:52] HavaDear: Manuals are so fun!
[3:51:55] justyourusualplayer: damn classes  man
[3:52:01] alexyap0223: pearlieSweat
[3:52:02] GaspsHiChat: a manual license?
[3:52:05] ljskizzle: A manual license??
[3:52:11] sparkysure: You need a different license for stick shift?
[3:52:14] Dan_K_84: You need a license to drive manual?
[3:52:14] joytobake: Manuals need a different license?
[3:52:16] Sparcles5: I'd be terrified to drive a manual
[3:52:17] leroy90tnmt: Yeahhh lets goo pearl
[3:52:19] derperles: You need a license for driving manual in Australia, huh.
[3:52:22] divathranir1504: FR
[3:52:27] divathranir1504: a crime
[3:52:30] somemelondude: why does noone know you need a different license for manual
[3:52:30] BaristaSimmer: I learned something new today
[3:52:33] jadynfaye83: There's a difference between auto and manual in Australia? Learn new things every day lol
[3:52:35] glitchered: clutch shift release
[3:52:35] eshaan: wait you need separate licences to drive for manual and automatic cars. we need just one
[3:52:35] theheartofthings: driving manual is easy softHappy
[3:52:40] MakYeah: it only takes like a week of driving and then a manual is totally fine
[3:52:42] leroy90tnmt: Maby a toyota supra ? They got automatic
[3:52:42] stormiiseaz: is it bad that cars scare me they look like giant metallic bugs
[3:52:45] ohio_ppp: It scares me people don't you need different licenses 😂
[3:52:47] ryrytrumps: i have only been following since she started hermitcraft and now have gone back and watch previous content and it is so impressive
[3:52:49] sparkysure: That's crazy
[3:52:50] Minerva_246: I wanted to drive manual but I can't because I need car mods and it's hard enough to get a car that fits the criteria
[3:52:52] hufflepuff_cookie: Hello peeps
[3:52:55] waarisdetaart: is that not a thing in the US?
[3:52:58] 19_meg_91: U can still learn
[3:53:03] kattituude: Too much think thunk to drive a manual
[3:53:05] LilleSpinat: most people get manual licences in my country, it's rare for someone to take a licence just for automatic
[3:53:08] dummyboar: looked it up, sounds cool to not have to struggle with gearing when changing speed lol
[3:53:10] LilyMaiDarling: In the uk you take manual test or auto test. Manual license you can drive both, auto is just auto
[3:53:10] jonnaa: i actually hate driving automatic cars. I find manual cars so much more controllable
[3:53:16] Dan_K_84: I know in the US you just need the proper instruction. No additional licensing requirement.
[3:53:16] BaristaSimmer: I agree Pearl
[3:53:16] jetwizardar: agreed rx7s are sick
[3:53:19] theheartofthings: @LilleSpinat here too

[3:53:21] mustavariz: We need the license in Finland too
[3:53:21] Riff_Raff_: Mostly the closeness sensors  .... backing out of my drive way is a nightmare when my car screams that there's some ivy getting close. :D
[3:53:22] GaspsHiChat: here in the us practically no one drives manuals anymore
[3:53:24] alexyap0223: pearliePalm
[3:53:30] MusicFreeGaming: The entire concept of a manual transmission is going away with EVs, anyway
[3:53:31] 19_meg_91: U don't have to drive it all the time LUL
[3:53:33] ryrytrumps: automatic is where it is at
[3:53:36] sparkysure: Practice on a dirt bike
[3:53:37] jetwizardar: US doesn’t have manual liscense
[3:53:39] waarisdetaart: @Riff_Raff_ can't you turn those off in your car?
[3:53:40] pastel_cottontail: driving is already anxiety inducing enough on automatic lol
[3:53:43] leroy90tnmt: Electirc cars doesnt have a gearbox so why need a manual hahaha. Well i am a petrol head so no hybrids alowed here
[3:53:48] alexyap0223: pearlieLOL
[3:53:49] gwynnypooo: life is difficult enough but an automatic lol
[3:53:52] bluubuns: I hated driving manual, especially on hills/slopes pearlieSweat I will take my automatic happily
[3:53:52] joytobake: I love manuals, but I can't find any in the US
[3:53:55] Neamow: manual is easier than most people think :)
[3:53:55] glitchered: pretty sure a tuner could put a sequential gearbox in a rx7 paddle shifting. race car pearl. :D
[3:53:59] CaptainJasshands: CaptainJasshands subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 7 months, currently on a 2 month streak! Wooooo lesgoo!! You're such an inspiration to me. thank you for being you pearliePearlLove
[3:54:00] ItsFineSlugline: @GaspsHiChat It's getting difficult to even find stick-shift for sale.
[3:54:02] gwynnypooo: buy*
[3:54:06] 19_meg_91: U can also drive it in game
[3:54:06] KayaWolfHorse: car talk is such a staple of pearl streams, i love it
[3:54:07] Riff_Raff_: @waarisdetaart Possibly. I wouldn't know how to, though
[3:54:07] Wickid2018: My mom's been driving a manual for the last 11 years. It was also the first car I drove
[3:54:09] GaspsHiChat: i'm terrified of manuals but my dream vehicle is a motorcycle lol
[3:54:14] ohio_ppp: Thoughts on parking sensors? Kinda takes the skill away from the driver's I think
[3:54:16] Robert_Cri: I drive manual since 2006.
[3:54:18] catmarie4: Track day?
[3:54:22] sparkysure: Pearl needs a dirt bike guys
[3:54:33] jetwizardar: track day
[3:54:35] HavaDear: @joytobake it's hard, it took me a while to find one! I ended up getting a VW
[3:54:36] here_lies_hiroo: i wish cars were real 😔
[3:54:41] TheJogMan: @leroy90tnmt there are EVs that emulate a manual gearbox, you can stall it out and everything
[3:54:44] cloverghostcat: very late too the stream! hows the stream been so far?? :>
[3:54:57] preparedman: @here_lies_hiroo same
[3:54:57] Riff_Raff_: I grew up on manual cars, but after driving automatics I'll never go back
[3:54:59] GaspsHiChat: @here_lies_hiroo me too
[3:55:00] dummyboar: ngl parallel parking in a manual car is rather painful to learn
[3:55:00] keshkup: Do manual teslas exist?
[3:55:01] 19_meg_91: My dream car is mr. bean's mini LUL (also manual)
[3:55:03] vixi_victrix: Omg I didn't think you'd still be streaming I'm glad I could at least catch some of it
[3:55:04] leroy90tnmt: Jogman youre joking right? That cant be hahaha
[3:55:06] Neamow: even as a skilled driver parking sensors just make things easier, especially you also have a camera
[3:55:08] jetwizardar: @thejogman fr?
[3:55:09] Asterionm: i think i cant live without the parking sensors XD
[3:55:09] ljskizzle: It objectivley increases safety
[3:55:14] catmarie4: I have a big car and the sensors and the reverse cam is amazing
[3:55:15] pastel_cottontail: @cloverghostcat we got a new pet! it’s a warden named “Hi I’m Cleo!”
[3:55:20] stormiiseaz: do you have any block pallete recommendations for a kinda Greek Atlantis themed build?
[3:55:28] ohio_ppp: But the beeping is irritating 😂
[3:55:39] simoontjuhx: Yepp, true. I learnt with parking sensors and cant park to save my life
[3:55:40] BaristaSimmer: When a Manuel car is in front of me, they driver tends to back off their break making their car go backwards. Where I live, if a car hits your front or you hit their back, it's your fault. So, I dont like it when they do that with their car. I dont want my Insurance to go up, because of their decision
[3:55:47] GaspsHiChat: i love the conversations that happen on stream bc i always forget how we get there
[3:55:50] keshkup: Scroll wheel acting crazy again
[3:55:51] HavaDear: I have an ev now, but I definitely miss my manual transmission sometimes.
[3:55:54] ItsFineSlugline: @keshkup Is there even a point to having a gear shift in an electric car?
[3:55:57] a_dangerous_klutz: My wife no longer checks her blind spot because she assumes the car will tell her if someone is there

[3:56:06] ryrytrumps: Backup cameras are game changers
[3:56:17] BaldBover: I prefer to drive a manual, but here in the US it's nearly impossible to find a newer vehicle that has it.
[3:56:21] leroy90tnmt: I got an vauxhall astra 2002. It got ABS on the brakes and thats it. No TC and stuff
[3:56:23] ohio_ppp: @a_dangerous_klutz that's crazy
[3:56:30] theheartofthings: klutz, that is so unsafe.
[3:56:31] cloverghostcat: @pastel_cottontail :0 im gonna have to re watch this stream i wish i got here sooner! thank you!!
[3:56:32] kattituude: @a_dangerous_klutz my sister does that! and lets just say her car has been in the shop quite a bit LUL
[3:56:35] HavaDear: @baristasimmer most newer manuals have roll back assist so they won't do that while shifting on a hill. And good drivers also don't do that lol
[3:56:36] bluubuns: I learnt without, and now I can’t even trust the reverse camera pearlieLOL I look at the rearview mirrors anyways
[3:56:37] keshkup: @ItsFineSlugline Huh. Just for funzies i guess XD
[3:56:42] Dan_K_84: That's one of the dangers of automation. Losing the skills needed to do things manually if you need to.
[3:56:45] Neamow: definitely agree, I learned in a small car and my first car for 8 years was tiny, now I have a big sedan it took a LOT of getting used to
[3:56:50] dummyboar: ppl should learn to drive on a wide range of car shapes, can't drive a SUV like a Mini
[3:56:50] KayaWolfHorse: i learned in a large pickup truck, smaller cars feel super easy now
[3:56:52] Nightbot:  Join the discord: https://discord.gg/pearlescentmoon
[3:56:57] 19_meg_91: Driving a manual is also a good skillset to have
[3:57:00] Wickid2018: I learned to drive in my mom's minivan. And my mom's little Mazda 3 manual
[3:57:04] jetwizardar: I dont think all the sensors increase safety because when you barely have to do anything when you drive people will just zone out and fall  asleep
[3:57:05] kattituude: Never trust a robot, people!
[3:57:09] theheartofthings: driving big cars makes me nervous smolS
[3:57:12] Sparcles5: the 2 cars I'm learning in are both big cars pearlieLOL it'll be so weird if I ever drive a small car
[3:57:17] GaspsHiChat: the first time i drove i drove a giant truck that i couldn't see over the dash on a severe curving road with no permit or license. the second time was in my car on the freeway at night in the rain. talk about scary
[3:57:18] diarrhea_lad: Honestly I don't even use my back up camera because I'm so used to mirrors
[3:57:26] bluubuns: Right?! I can’t trust it blindly! I feel much more secure with my own senses first
[3:57:28] stormiiseaz: the only two things I know about cars: 1, don’t crash. 2, they go beep beep
[3:57:32] BaristaSimmer: @havadear That's good to know!
[3:57:34] Nightbot:  Don't become a french fry, be a good potato, remember to follow the stream!
[3:57:35] BlueishYellowy: Pearl car talk mmmm
[3:57:39] WinnyTFord: WinnyTFord subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 38 months! 
[3:57:42] ryrytrumps: You should have a career pivot to a driving instructor.
[3:57:43] pastel_cottontail: backup cameras are good for seeing low below your eye line, that’s their primary benefit, but it shouldn’t be your only vantage point
[3:57:46] TheJogMan: @leroy90tnmt i forget which brand/model it is, but i remember hearing about it once, people have also been working on audio engines that create extremely accurate reproductions of how internal combustion engines sound, so its entirely possible that within 5 years we will have EVs with manual transmissions that both handle and sound exactly like an internal combustion engine car
[3:57:52] ljskizzle: what about these new 360 camera views?
[3:57:53] diablonosis: Cameras are supposed to be in addition, in a replacement.
[3:57:58] lesbiansky: all the lesson cars these days just have parking sensors (and likely also reverse camera) in my experience
[3:58:00] ItsFineSlugline: @BlueishYellowy someone out there is marking a bingo card LUL
[3:58:04] bluubuns: Good to use it as a tool, not as your sole source of information!!
[3:58:04] yougogretchenwieners: our vehicle got hit in a parking lot just yesterday actually
[3:58:04] GaspsHiChat: all i know about cars is that they make me go fast :]
[3:58:05] Riff_Raff_: I love a bit of car talk, too
[3:58:08] preparedman: That and food
[3:58:09] pastel_cottontail: I had our scariest high school gym teacher as my driving instructor, it was so bad
[3:58:11] jasper_186: i feel like i'm the outsider in that regard since my first car only had the side mirrors, so my habits are to only look at them
[3:58:16] theheartofthings: my dad had two bikes secured on the back of the car and it triggered the sensor so he had some trouble with the car autobreaking before shutting it off.
[3:58:16] sapphicwhimsy: yall got pearl monologuing about cars (positive)
[3:58:17] FinTinCan: tbh, im more likely do get a pilot license then a driving license, i fear driving cars and i already failed three licence tests
[3:58:19] BlueishYellowy: @ItsFineSlugline ahahah nah I'll let other people do that ;)
[3:58:22] Crims0nBird: Hehehe driving 101 with PearlecentMoon xD
[3:58:22] blueberry_37: I'm currently learning to drive, and it's funny to me that this is a topic that came up in your stream

[3:58:26] UrbanAri50: Finally passed my driving test last week
[3:58:28] kattituude: It's looking really good
[3:58:30] Nixibar: my aunt forgot how to back up in a car because it didn’t have cameras. she was like how am I supposed to know what’s behind me? umm turn your head around?
[3:58:30] stormiiseaz: I could never be a driving instructor I would be too scared
[3:58:35] theheartofthings: urbanari congrats!
[3:58:38] Metroidhunter1: @urbanari5 congrats
[3:58:39] Kawaiitron_: @here_lies_hiroo Caaaats! pearlieNugget pearlieOlive
[3:58:42] dummyboar: @theheartofthings my parents had a Fiat Multipla, it's hideous and somehow tall, wide but short nose/end, amazing to drive
[3:58:45] alexyap0223: HypeYummy
[3:58:49] derperles: Brickbrickbrick
[3:58:49] Kawaiitron_: @urbanari5 Congrats! pearlieWoo
[3:59:05] GaspsHiChat: my stepdad covers the screen in my car when we drive together lol
[3:59:10] omniscntreadr: i'm a child but i already know i'm horrid at driving.. i crashed my aunt's golf cart into a COW when i was driving it around at her farm
[3:59:13] Naominoodle101: @urbanari5 congrats
[3:59:20] TheRooPlace: Gosh I don't even use the camera when backing up. I always turn my head ad look
[3:59:24] theheartofthings: dummyboar that sounds like an amazing car LUL
[3:59:31] BaristaSimmer: I try not to use my back up camera, because I drive my mom's car sometimes and it doesnt have one
[3:59:33] cloverghostcat: is this building to hold the warden?
[3:59:35] hydrogendiv: hiii
[3:59:39] 19_meg_91: @omniscntreadr a cow? :O
[3:59:41] ohio_ppp: @omniscntreadr was the cow ok?
[3:59:43] dummyboar: @theheartofthings it's so ugly look it up LUL
[3:59:44] alexyap0223: pearlieLOL
[3:59:45] a_dangerous_klutz: In Canada all new cars need to have a backup camera
[3:59:45] GaspsHiChat: the screen is helpful bc i have terrible vision and no glasses but i like that he's teaching me how to drive without it
[3:59:49] raydenrydia: Too many people learn in too small cars these days and even with parking sensors they even mess up :D  Automatic same thing... Many people learn now but 1 small mistake with an automatic can mean an accident which you can avoid in a manual
[3:59:56] kattituude: It's a law to have them in the US now, yet you get dinged on the driver's test if you don't also check mirrors and turn around
[4:00:00] Minerva_246: I have a 2007 Honda Jazz and I'm so grateful to have learnt without the fancy tech
[4:00:00] FinTinCan: i was learning to drive in big city which eventually got me to fail my driving license, so much things happen around me i was getting overwhelmed and plus stress of the final test made me straight up fail
[4:00:01] CreepyTerror553: I'm making my daughter build her own so she can always work on it.
[4:00:06] cloverghostcat: thank you pearl :)
[4:00:12] draconian_faerie: I like my older car without all the sensors
[4:00:12] joytobake: Best to learn without automatic transmission!
[4:00:12] Riff_Raff_: I really want to change to a small car

[4:01:08] Blue_Hamster11: how do we always end up talking about cars? xD
[4:01:12] TheJogMan: when i took my road test a couple years ago to get my license we were in a car provided by the DMV which didn't have cameras or sensors, just a state trooper who had no sense of humor with his hand on the emergency break incase you mess up
[4:01:12] chibiplaysgames: I just prefer that in a bigger car I feel like I can see the road better
[4:01:15] dummyboar: @ohio_ppp you know no one will steal it at least LUL

[4:02:43] ohio_ppp: I had a rolls kinardly, it rolls down one hill and kinardly get up the other
[4:02:46] TheJogMan: @stormiiseaz just about every auto-manufacturer puts their logo on all their cars, so its just a matter of memorizing which logos are which brands
[4:02:46] GaspsHiChat: there's a pea car that i've seen images of and it's my dream car even though i know i'll never get one
[4:02:46] raydenrydia: The iconic Dodge :D or the iconic Skyline :D

[4:04:14] celi1794: my dream car is just one with enough space for luggage....
[4:04:15] Riff_Raff_: The RX7 is a nice looking car, but it feels very small and cramped inside. Also intimidating when large cars/trucks pass you
[4:04:17] BaristaSimmer: Pillagers are annoying
[4:04:29] alexyap0223: pearlieExcited
[4:04:30] sparkysure: Lexus LFA

[4:05:09] TotalCamaroZ28: As much as I dislike Chrysler products, my dream car is a Dodge Viper with the V10.
[4:05:11] pipettipete: Boat the captain
[4:05:24] glitchered: the rx7 has nice curves. i used to tune and drive the hell out of it in gran turismo 2. 666HP very limited to keep up with GT class.
[4:05:29] ryrytrumps: How tall are you?
[4:05:38] alexyap0223: pearlieExcited

[4:05:46] ThatHairyGuyOG: I love the BMW M5, it almost looks like a normal car but it's hiding a very large engine etc

[4:05:54] kattituude: I have always loved the Defender 90/110 but not the new ones - they did the car so wrong
[4:06:00] derperles: You mean you just like them with muffler.
[4:06:01] laceydaisydoo: People with loud cars are compensating for something
[4:06:01] tayeevee: oh absolutely
[4:06:02] BlueishYellowy: ah yes, I hate people who make their cars obnoxiously loud
[4:06:03] giannnovich: The loud ones are just obnoxious
[4:06:04] ThatHairyGuyOG: You like engine noise over exhaust noise
[4:06:07] KayaWolfHorse: never liked loud cars
[4:06:10] GaspsHiChat: @ryrytrumps she's 6'0 iirc
[4:06:11] oversyded: and it means you can drive through neighborhoods without being a criminal
[4:06:14] picella8: ive gotta run to the post office before it shuts so gonna head off now, congrats and thank you for completing the warden and have a great rest of stream with chat!! <3
[4:06:21] derperles: @laceydaisydoo It's for power.
[4:06:26] raydenrydia: Growling with Horsepower is better sound than the stupid exhaust noises they sometimes put on it ...
[4:06:27] divathranir1504: same
[4:06:28] Reevie88: yh the anti lag is annoying
[4:06:34] alexyap0223: pearlieHugs

[4:06:41] TheJogMan: @pastel_cottontail had one sneak up on me in a parking lot once, thought it was a plastic bag blowing by but when i turned around there was a car right behind me impatiently waiting for me to get out of their way
[4:06:42] iCopperBonsai: love the rumble a train engine makes
[4:06:46] Reevie88: doesnt do your pistons any good
[4:06:46] bluubuns: It feels way more elegant without the loudness!
[4:06:47] tayeevee: electric cars sound like some sort of alien craft
[4:06:50] raydenrydia: Loud is good for nothing ...
[4:06:54] DearestKitsune: I like the 1956 Ford Thunderbird. I have no knowledge of cars.. but looks pretty pearlieHeart
[4:06:54] kattituude: But if the car isn't super loud, how will you know that they have a large ...... motor? KappaHD
[4:06:54] Aistan83: Clearly a loud minority :D
[4:07:02] MajorDishes: the RIGHT exhaust can sound amazing.. but nothing beats good engine noise
[4:07:02] EasternMage957: neeeeeeyyyooooommmm
[4:07:03] Kawaiitron_: I hate when people blast their car music so loud that I can hear them from my room at my mom’s house as if I was in a car with normal volume. And with how long her driveway is… that’s quite a distance.
[4:07:05] raydenrydia: Electric sounds boring in my opinion... We are gonna miss the old cars
[4:07:06] idiosyncraticCE: people love making their cars look or sound fast, without actually being fast
[4:07:09] EasternMage957: vroom vroom
[4:07:16] divathranir1504: yesss
[4:07:18] EasternMage957: pearlieBoop
[4:07:22] Jareddoink: I think part of the electric car sounds is for safety
[4:07:23] griffwc16: The problem with old JDM cars is that everyone has had like 5 owners at this point and they've all done work on them, so god knows what is in them now
[4:07:24] jessljjd: i have a renault zoe and its very nioce its electric but it doesnt sound artificial or anything
[4:07:24] leroy90tnmt: Aventadors are just loud. Every owner revs the crap out of them
[4:07:25] GaspsHiChat: would you ever ride a motorcycle?
[4:07:27] derperles: Loud is better because it doesn't block the amount of air the engine has to put through.
[4:07:27] ItsFineSlugline: pedestrian alerts
[4:07:29] bean_ebabies: Yeah, safety
[4:07:34] MartPlaysStuff: I can see that it matters though, because it's safer for pedestrians
[4:07:35] Neamow: it's to persuade people who don't like them being totally silent
[4:07:37] ThatHairyGuyOG: Faster electric cars have a very beautiful noise
[4:07:49] pastel_cottontail: my aunts car has an angelic chorus sound when backing up lol
[4:07:51] BlueishYellowy: they have made motors noisy in the past... but i guess energy efficiency
[4:07:57] leroy90tnmt: Subwoofers haha, low bass all day
[4:07:58] Basix_Rox: "vroom vroom I'm a car"
[4:08:00] gooniekatie: I have an electric car and people do not hear me coming even with the noise.
[4:08:01] hufflepuff_cookie: They do make a noise, though. We have one and I can hear it when an electric car drives me
[4:08:03] timmik: The ones I know just have a high pitched noise
[4:08:06] revaar61: Whenever someone with an obnoxiously loud car drives by, i can't help but think that that person must be the coolest and has the biggest... part in their pants /s
[4:08:08] raydenrydia: And not the backing up noise from a truck either :D
[4:08:15] chalky574: electric cars should meow
[4:08:19] ThatHairyGuyOG: Tire noise is enough, you barely ever hear the engine of a 'normal' car
[4:08:21] bean_ebabies: I think the programmed honks are funny
[4:08:23] moon_moth65: Some guy at my school has an absolutely ear piercing car engine rev
[4:08:25] Blue_Hamster11: @Basix_Rox xD
[4:08:35] TheJogMan: @PearlescentMoon people have been working on software that very accurately emulates engine sounds, and it could theoretically be configurable so you could have your car sound like a 2 stroke chainsaw engine one day, and a massive diesel engine the next
[4:08:42] divathranir1504: i really dont like electric cars
[4:08:43] glitchered: electrics have engine noise. sounds kinda cool. the hoonitron is pretty sick.
[4:08:43] MartPlaysStuff: Custom voice messages would be funny, the possibilities would be endless hehe
[4:08:44] derperles: Totally need electric cars to have some sort of noise to warn pedestrians.
[4:08:46] Kawaiitron_: @revaar61 Or when they blast the same generic rap song that I always hear so loud that they must have hearing damage, soooooo cool. pearliePalm
[4:08:47] gooniekatie: @hufflepuff_cookie what do you drive?  I have a newer Nissan Leaf
[4:08:52] divathranir1504: @MartPlaysStuff ooo yeah
[4:08:56] GaspsHiChat: electric cars look so odd but i can't place my finger on it. something is missing
[4:08:57] derperles: I've nearly been hit by EVs.
[4:09:01] bean_ebabies: Program a honk that says "MOVE"
[4:09:01] ItsFineSlugline: @MartPlaysStuff "hi, i'm cleo" LUL
[4:09:07] leroy90tnmt: I want grains SUPRISE!! As my car horn
[4:09:13] vixi_victrix: Lmao I just got a twitch ad talking about electronics
[4:09:14] johndrinkwater: once combustion cars are gone, we can dial down the fake car noise (accessbility still needed!) and have much quieter days
[4:09:20] vixi_victrix: They're listening
[4:09:21] PineappleWarlord: @hufflepuff_cookie do you think its like that thing where some people cant hear the lights in the house or the fridge
[4:09:22] divathranir1504: yess
[4:09:27] sparkysure: Loud spaceship noises
[4:09:31] CitrusPlaysGamez: Wait! Pearl has a hardcore world?
[4:09:31] stormiiseaz: my mom has an electric car and it genuinely sounds like something out of a movie
[4:09:32] 19_meg_91: @leroy90tnmt LUL
[4:09:32] WerLunar: I almost got hit by a running electric car last week, because it's like silenced, I couldn't hear it at all. So I think some kind of sound is necessary for safety reason
[4:09:40] bluubuns: Like a meowing dog lol
[4:09:43] cloudofdragonflies: One argument is to make it easier for pedestrians and cyclists to hear the cars
[4:09:50] ItsFineSlugline: @CitrusPlaysGamez welcome to the desert town!
[4:09:52] kattituude: Even the cars are insecure now...have to pretend like they're something they're not
[4:09:54] Intralacustrine: a lot of high end combustion cars have artificial engine noise, too
[4:09:54] raydenrydia: You got scammed in that case :) Diesel noise not being one LOL
[4:09:55] hufflepuff_cookie: @gooniekatie I don't drive, but my parents have a 2013 (ish) Nissan leaf
[4:09:56] omniscntreadr: @johndrinkwater exactly.. i can't wait until electric cars become quieter and more widespread, i live right next to a major mall in my area and i can't even sleep because people's engines are too loud
[4:10:03] leroy90tnmt: Diesel just coal and rattle, they belong in trucks and tractors.
[4:10:06] CreepyTerror553: They have been pumping artificial noise into the speakers of muscle cars for years
[4:10:14] cloudofdragonflies: ahh sorry, true
[4:10:17] gooniekatie: you can fill the acceleration in electric car, depending on the model.
[4:10:24] seibaby: Engine noise is important feedback to the driver, too, I think
[4:10:26] hufflepuff_cookie: @pineapplewarlord possibly. You don't notice it until it's not there.
[4:10:28] derperles: Turbo Diesel?
[4:10:29] CanadianDrag0n: @cloudofdragonflies only helps if they are not listening  to music/podcast with headphones
[4:10:29] MartPlaysStuff: I need a car that says noot noot
[4:10:31] leroy90tnmt: Nope
[4:10:31] griffwc16: Hate dodges but I do like the hellcat supercharger whine
[4:10:35] omniscntreadr: @kattituude got it from their owners..
[4:10:36] Naominoodle101: i'm pretty sure i have learnt more about cars from pearl then my own parents who both drive
[4:10:40] TheJogMan: installing vibration motors in the vehicle in key spots could theoretically emulate the feel of different engines as well, the main goal is to emulate the sound and feel of an internal combustion engine for people that like it, while also getting the benefits of electric
[4:10:49] GaspsHiChat: i'm trying to store everything i've been hearing so i can talk cars with my oldest brother LOL
[4:10:52] raydenrydia: Honestly though... Is Electric even good in Australia or America or places with huge long roads
[4:10:55] Nightbot:  Follow Pearl in all the places: https://www.youtube.com/pearlescentmoon  https://twitter.com/PearlescentMoon https://www.instagram.com/pearlescentmoo/
[4:10:57] derperles: Aw. 1.6
[4:11:02] HavaDear: In the US electric cars are required to make noise under 18mph. Most make a spaceship whining noise. I kinda hate it.
[4:11:03] CitrusPlaysGamez: @itsfineslugline thanks! I knew she was uploading some hardcore content awhile back but hadn’t seen anything about it for quite some time.
[4:11:04] ThatHairyGuyOG: Probably you wouldn't mind as much when you try it
[4:11:08] omniscntreadr: @MartPlaysStuff would love one that just constantly repeats the noises from that pingu show
[4:11:09] KayaWolfHorse: an engine-like noise makes sense because pedestrians’ll already recognize it but why not give the electric cars a unique sound rather than emulating another model
[4:11:12] derperles: It's a cute engine.
[4:11:15] leroy90tnmt: Its a fun engine
[4:11:20] gooniekatie: @hufflepuff_cookie my 2022 is super quiet except for when I back up. then it beeps like a garbage truck.
[4:11:27] keshkup: @GaspsHiChat Ahahah, same same, my uncle is really disappointed i'm not a car guy

[4:12:00] HavaDear: @raydenrydia my ev gets 300 miles per full charge, I have no issues getting anywhere.
[4:12:01] leroy90tnmt: I want your turbo haha. Mine is N/A 16 valve
[4:12:09] ThatHairyGuyOG: I hate the current SUV push from manufacturers ResidentSleeper
[4:12:15] Kawaiitron_: @omniscntreadr NOOT NOOOOOT!
[4:12:35] leroy90tnmt: 136 horses / no turbo
[4:12:36] TheJogMan: i dont really understand why diesel would be necessary in a personal vehicle
[4:12:36] GaspsHiChat: @keshkup my brother is disappointed i'm not a car person but he does like how i'm a motorcycle person so i got lucky-ish
[4:12:41] HavaDear: @thathairyguyog same! I like small cars!
[4:12:44] Theren_Nailo: beat the car community for 1/2 the price and get a motorcycle specifically a 600-1000cc bike
[4:12:46] derperles: You need a Ute!
[4:12:53] jetwizardar: put that engine in a smaller car like a veloster or older Honda civics and it would rip
[4:12:55] omniscntreadr: @TheJogMan why is diesel necessary in any car? i'm not very car-savvy btw
[4:12:58] xWildSlicerx: CUV is a good size for transporting electronic related things.
[4:13:03] sparkysure: You have small engines in AU! Smallest I've owned was a 3.7L biggest was 6.6L
[4:13:05] ThatHairyGuyOG: Then you could get a van, those are for transporting
[4:13:20] xWildSlicerx: AH well CUV can't effectively do furniture. SUV it is :P
[4:13:21] derperles: Not even a Ute?
[4:13:26] toastboi22: I'm gonna be getting an SUV because of the Canadian winters
[4:13:33] TheJogMan: @omniscntreadr a diesel engine can produce more power, so it makes sense if your hauling big loads
[4:13:45] bean_ebabies: @TheJogMan i'm diesel gives more torque
[4:13:58] tildalovesthedoctor: my dream car is a dark green cooper mini just cos its cute
[4:13:58] keshkup: A big snoot have been spotted
[4:14:05] revaar61: lol the sniffer nose poking through the wall
[4:14:12] tildalovesthedoctor: mini cooper*
[4:14:12] bean_ebabies: tagged wrong person but you get it
[4:14:14] pastel_cottontail: I just can’t stand “vanity trucks” that are far larger than they need to be, big wheels and big body but same size bed
[4:14:17] jasper_186: "I can Drag my friends places"=> Come on Karn, you need a Haircut, get in the car /s
[4:14:22] TheJogMan: @bean_ebabies i understand that, just dont see why its necessary for a personal daily-driver
[4:14:24] omniscntreadr: @revaar61 tryna sniff the walls.. or pearl
[4:14:30] bean_ebabies: Pavement princesses?

[4:14:59] 19_meg_91: @tildalovesthedoctor same but the older model for me
[4:15:08] PineappleWarlord: from my brief googling, people with sensitive hearing could be able to hear "silent" electric cars
[4:15:11] antalia_lotus: sooo.... how long will we go over time today?
[4:15:27] BlueishYellowy: nooo!
[4:15:27] sparkysure: Building a new deck?
[4:15:27] TheJogMan: my car has a four wheel drive mode that i can turn on, and it has absolutely been worth having when dealing with snow in winter
[4:15:28] toastboi22: the car is just a princess
[4:15:30] Blue_Hamster11: @antalia_lotus shhhh
[4:15:30] tildalovesthedoctor: @19_meg_91 i dont even know enough about the car i want to know the difference LUL
