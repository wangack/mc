[0:31:41] picklerick_c137: I don't have to imagine Sadge
[0:31:41] NarwhalArgy: @datSycko Try SevTech

[0:31:55] Pati: it does for the one type of redroow
[0:31:57] Justsevenstars07: @datSycko try Create: Above and Beyond, its not the easiest but its pretty fun and you need to use your brain to make contraptions
[0:32:04] brightcandle: It also takes a while to produce charcoal
[0:32:10] burkydurk: Use vein mine in straight line and look up should get 64 up
[0:32:19] zero3juan: ah it's "just" a charcoal probelm
[0:32:20] Jibbur: @datSycko I would say Create Above and Beyond over SevTech, Sevtech is pretty old at this point 1.12
[0:32:22] 1StClassAlcoholic: It does 3x3
[0:32:25] Tron359: L axe cuts the majority of trees, but I also would stand on the top and cut down
[0:32:32] Dagmoo: @datsycko waffle recommended Create
[0:32:35] Jibbur: though sevtech was AMAZING
[0:32:35] Trahir: Does this version of the steam boiler not have the screen option to turn down the power generation (to lower how much coal you're using) if you're not using it all anyways?

[0:34:10] Kisheen: HV EBF is only double MV though,  so still an entire tier away
[0:34:11] NarwhalArgy: @Giantwaffle The stuff from minesweeper made it easy
[0:34:11] b0ltz12: HV lootbags to get the EV components for AE

[0:41:37] NarwhalArgy: Even if you make another boiler, your pipes are going to bottleneck you
[0:41:38] restfulblue: HV tubrines are also have less fuel efficiency, so may be it's worth considering having more mv turbines
[0:42:01] Jibbur: would it not be better to just rob some steam to make to make the ingots then use diesel for the permanent HV power?

[1:01:29] Iksess: in d3 you only die to server lag, thats always how diablo worked
[1:01:29] LongestMoney: What the fuck
[1:01:30] Larklen: I mean, still full launch week sooo not that surprising for there to be server issues
[1:01:32] LongestMoney: BRO
[1:01:32] Lajnuss_: it sucks even more when its THE character that got you on the statue that dies
[1:01:35] Ceratic: That shit is one hundred percent an AI
[1:01:35] Bleu_Forge: Maybe stop requiring a constant connection to servers for games that DON'T need to be online
[1:01:36] aisin_gioro: lul
[1:01:39] KuramaTheF0X: i dont read twitter unless ppl send me links
[1:01:42] Voltzxy: there is no excuse for the servers to be the state that they are in for the amount of money they are making
[1:01:45] bobolpwnz: ItIsWhatItIs
[1:01:45] LongestMoney: They just said "F"
[1:01:47] DanteFreed: They really need to do an overhaul to the servers IMO or change the way they work
[1:01:50] Zwazi: man, I never knew hardcore could be so hardcore
[1:01:54] Lcw_123: clip of shrouds rip?
[1:02:01] KimikoKirk: didn't they patch so that logging out doesn't take your character out instantly
[1:02:02] chasteyes: 70?
[1:02:03] Alamose: with expensive macrotransactions
[1:02:05] „Åù„Çå„Åß: you should KNOW we're incompetent, your fault -blizzard

[1:02:14] Billy7heKid: So glad I learned my lesson with D3. Smell you later blizzard
[1:02:15] Ryanpete4: I thought shroud died legit though?
[1:02:18] Biskit427: My que time was 1,750 min yesterday for D4
[1:02:21] ConfusedQuark: that is going to happen for hardcore classic WoW coming out later this summer to

[1:02:33] prikmori7: ??
[1:02:33] Lajnuss_: @Ryanpete4 thats his first death
[1:02:34] NilpNet: @HunterOfReason Reddit API changes mean Apollo dev would have to pay Reddit $2M/month. He's shutting the app down June 30th.

[1:03:35] KuramaTheF0X: my god some chatters OMEGALUL
[1:03:36] TheJanitorMan_: Imagine being like lvl 99 and that happens
[1:03:37] LidlFrog: susHmm
[1:03:37] Bleu_Forge: OMEGALUL
[1:03:38] Northlyte: @chasteyes thats a backwards opinion, lag is not part of the hardcore experience
[1:03:40] Zwazi: this is blizzard. this is to be expected
[1:03:40] orangecreamsicle3: @chasteyes HUH
[1:03:40] Zoinx: BOP
[1:03:40] deadgolfer: ban him
[1:03:41] BubbaChubbs420: it is the server KEKW
[1:03:42] xxLatte: shroud got 1 framed üòÇ
[1:03:44] chasteyes: I've died in HC worlds from dumb shit plenty, it's part of playing hardcore
[1:03:44] enki1337: Fishinge
[1:03:45] Derek_LastName: Man hc players have brain rot lmao
[1:03:46] KimikoKirk: HUH
[1:03:46] THEgoodCOW: not that one
[1:03:47] Ryanpete4: Oh I thought he was talking about the level 54 had that died
[1:03:49] warmwalrus: i lost 5 braincells from that comment KEKW
[1:03:50] ausHenry: mega rage quit moment
[1:03:51] Larklen: It was day 3 of the full launch, its within the realm of shit happens imo
[1:03:51] Pokesaurus_rex: THIS is the 53
[1:03:52] DanteFreed: this is the first death
[1:03:52] Stormflare: this has happened with every diablo release why did people expect any different?
[1:03:52] SailorWS: that was the first one
[1:03:52] cheppard: it is what it is
[1:03:54] SwatCriminals: no that was his 100
[1:03:54] THEgoodCOW: there he is level 47
[1:03:55] Pokesaurus_rex: this is hte original death no?
[1:03:55] Lajnuss_: yeah
[1:03:55] Iksess: life aint fair, deal with it
[1:03:55] Setinal44: Then just dont play hardcore, its a restriction you put on yourself
[1:03:56] Shadeflame1911: The lvl 53 is the first time he died
[1:03:56] larochej: By the way, this stuff will happen on the official wow HC servers.
[1:03:57] 2Flip: this is how shrouds enemys feel in cs LUL
[1:03:58] BattleRedHTX: expecting the servers to be perfect first 3 days is crazy
[1:03:58] PlaguedV: and thats why kids we dont play HC on always online games
[1:03:59] SwatCriminals: his 2nd was 47 yeah
[1:03:59] Sertima: This is why I would never play HC, Blizzard servers are death
[1:04:00] Pokesaurus_rex: yes
[1:04:07] Pokesaurus_rex: they group farmed exploited on the 2nd char
[1:04:09] swupsy: guy who said "shit happens" 100% does not play hardcore
[1:04:09] LongestMoney: The game's server failing to run properly is "shit happens" KEKW ??????????????????
[1:04:11] 1killersquirrel: this is the one Megan Fox did the eulogy on, the 47 one
[1:04:13] jmm548: true
[1:04:19] Larklen: Also, if you are in a nightmare dungeon, walking around shit and they are not reacting to you, do you really keep going with a HC character KEKW
[1:04:20] DuctTapeNinja_: ...you are playing throught the internet which is just completly unreliable
[1:04:27] Bleu_Forge: There's literally no reason for it to always be online
[1:04:27] Shadeflame1911: Shadeflame1911 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 11 months, currently on a 1 month streak! waffleCheers
[1:04:31] Kisheen: Doesn't PoE get around this BS even though it's always online?
[1:04:33] LongestMoney: @swupsy Not even just that, he just isn't connected to reality bro LUL
[1:04:33] jmm548: every other game they have gives u a warning when server goes down
[1:04:36] Lajnuss_: https://clips.twitch.tv/RenownedPreciousWitchPupper-NWJTdRJTuLdT0gwh here is the better shroud clip
[1:04:36] Wibit: https://www.twitch.tv/shroud/clip/RenownedPreciousWitchPupper-NWJTdRJTuLdT0gwh here is the full 100 death clip
[1:04:36] Stormflare: bad game is bad and people are surprised
[1:04:39] omar_i_: you lose connectivity but mobs dont
[1:04:39] MagiicUnicorn: no way did he lose his lvl 100 hc driud
[1:04:45] Hykisho: imagine playing HC though KEKW
[1:04:46] chasteyes: what if my internet goes out? that's what you get when you play HC
[1:04:53] l3lackmoses: dying like this is BS... but you're playing a live service game... in the few weeks it came out soooo ItsWhatIts
[1:04:56] 1killersquirrel: @Giantwaffle Did you see Sequisha's near death? So awesome
[1:05:04] Gkz_Suh: he should have logged out
[1:05:04] „Éï„É™„ÇØ„É™: man that's like getting shotgunned in realm of the mad god
[1:05:08] kenshin2666: as designed
[1:05:10] john_wicks_beagle: Just looked at Diablo twitter PepeFlushed They sure know their audience
[1:05:13] Gkz_Suh: it does
[1:05:14] ausHenry: i dont think i would ever play the game again if that happened to me
[1:05:14] SwatCriminals: online only is so dumb
[1:05:14] thunderdan11: he shoulda saved and quit when he realized it was lagging
[1:05:20] BubbaChubbs420: especially if the server is not responding
[1:05:20] Biskit427: Do the broken chains above the character mean you lost connection?
[1:05:21] JustGlennBE: He should have better internet Kappa
[1:05:22] Racko5: logout macros KEKW
[1:05:23] SailorWS: doesnt that not work in POE anymore?
[1:05:24] ThaQuietGamer: damn that sucks
[1:05:27] Ekanae: you can logout instantly
[1:05:28] Warkless: Gkz_Suh, it does? show me proog Stare
[1:05:28] Shadeflame1911: Sometimes is hard to tell if chat is troll or dumb KEKW
[1:05:29] Mandorake: online only has been a thing for over a decade ppl need to get over that
[1:05:30] aisin_gioro: A true hardcore
[1:05:32] KimikoKirk: You were able to logout at the start, they patched it out OMEGALUL
[1:05:34] Racko5: "hardcore" but logs out
[1:05:38] LongestMoney: @Gkz_Suh it really doesn't though
[1:05:39] chasteyes: yeah it sucks, but that's HARDCORE
[1:05:40] Racko5: i never got it
[1:05:41] 2Flip: blizzard trying to keep their streamers at all cost LUL
[1:05:44] Catdaddyneff: nobody should have to worry about that with that expensive of a game
[1:05:44] KuramaTheF0X: @SailorWS poe also keeps your character for 3-10 seconds in the game still if you logout
[1:05:44] b0ltz12: your character stays in the game for like 10 seconds when logging out
[1:05:44] „Éï„É™„ÇØ„É™: is there a name for the shock you feel when your character dies? is that grief??
[1:05:46] madman66666: his ghost was already on screen before he rubberbanded back
[1:05:50] Bleu_Forge: Mandorake nah, developers need to get over it and stop doing it Okayge
[1:05:53] ThaQuietGamer: i cant imagine putting all that time into a character for that to happen
[1:05:55] deadgolfer: ban for life
[1:05:55] yoVespart: OneGuy
[1:05:55] Shiirouken: YEP
[1:05:58] enki1337: OneGuy
[1:06:00] NiBzz: Hi mr waffle hope your doing great :)
[1:06:01] DaddoSVK: how are people arguing about this OMEGALUL
[1:06:01] Warkless: No, chat is being dumb waffle KEKW
[1:06:01] BilusTheTiny: OneGuy
[1:06:02] custus: nice base
[1:06:02] SailorWS: Racko5 D4 has instant escape scrolls which is the same thing tbh
[1:06:04] Ryanpete4: Definitely not part of the hardcore experience
[1:06:04] Saikenjuega: but, did they do a rollback?
[1:06:05] Cmdr_Void: toxic or dented
[1:06:05] Northlyte: @chasteyes BOP youre not this stupid surely
[1:06:05] maccabeus: @2Flip as if streamers would miss out on the free blizz views
[1:06:06] Zwazi: hardcore blizzard***
[1:06:06] Mandorake: @Bleu_Forge you're in a world of hurt for the rest of our lives
[1:06:11] chasteyes: it is a risk of playing hardcore
[1:06:13] swupsy: you're getting one guyed
[1:06:13] bJoHEi: well thats pretty much what they said on D3 when servers whiped a lot of people YEP
[1:06:15] SirHuddy: @aetherstrom as someone who has played realm 10 years if you die to o2 shotgun it‚Äôs skill issue lmao
[1:06:15] chocolatemilklg: It isn't fair, but that is the risk of playing it
[1:06:16] omar_i_: BAN HIM and just say shit happens KEKW#
[1:06:17] cheppard: it's the same for everyone so it's fair
[1:06:19] Stormflare: it's not fair but I don't get why people are surprised everyone knew diablo 4 was gonna have shit servers and be bad at launch
[1:06:21] MissAngelis: Oh that's not fair at all :( damn...
[1:06:22] calebhub514: So many people deepthroat corporations is crazy.
[1:06:25] LongestMoney: I don't think chat understands that the game's server isn't your connection's side
[1:06:26] MinusKills: @omar_i_ KEKW
[1:06:29] wtmw: sorry all money went to Megan :)
[1:06:29] praxiz: He has a point tho, ppl playing hq diablo knows this shit can and will happen
[1:06:33] nvrmissashot: It's not fair that the server-lag caused death, BUT because we know Blizzard won't do anything about it, you shoudln't be playing HC
[1:06:34] Voltzxy: its his fault for playing a blizzard product
[1:06:34] Larklen: Risk of playing HC on day 3 of full game launch /shrug absolutely
[1:06:35] ChrizLee: sometimes you loose..thats why you play HC :D
[1:06:36] fluffycow003: and game devs should never release games like cyberpunk but sadly this is the world we live in
[1:06:38] „Éï„É™„ÇØ„É™: @SirHuddy PepeHands
[1:06:38] Larklen: too risky KEKW
[1:06:39] DannyLockard: brain worms
[1:06:41] henry_w40: @Giantwaffle thats why people on osrs stop playing HC mode
[1:06:41] Racko5: something out of your control should not be a "fair" death
[1:06:41] Warkless: CONTENT PogChamp
[1:06:43] chasteyes: you sign up for hardcore, you know shit can happen. then when it happens ???
[1:06:45] Biddy2004: I don't think I would play for a good day or two after server issues if i was playing hardcore
[1:06:46] warmwalrus: it's blizzard servers what do ppl expect KEKW
[1:06:48] Bleu_Forge: Mandorake Yes, but just because it's the "status quo" or the expected futurue doesn't mean I should just roll over and accept it
[1:06:48] HiggZyy: They want their name engraved
[1:06:49] Frogg_butt: its a risk, sure, but its not fair either way
[1:06:49] fluffycow003: shoudnt
[1:06:51] brightcandle: Was a bit different when we were playing local and didn't have these risks. These AAA companies need to make this right
[1:06:51] SailorWS: PoE has logout macro, D4 has instant TP scroll. They are the exact same just different implementations
[1:06:55] swupsy: perma banned -> "shit happens" LUL
[1:06:55] i_smitt: If logging out there was the move what do you think about imexile's death when he got that dot?
[1:06:58] dr_Griff: How does PvP work with HC?
[1:07:00] john_wicks_beagle: but bro, if you die Megan will read your name Pog
[1:07:04] Tidalllwave: because they are HC people
[1:07:07] Zerathee: nope
[1:07:07] Shiirouken: NOP
[1:07:07] Bunjimus: the thing with d2 hardcore is you expect to die its almost like a speed run  where you expect to restart a ton of times
[1:07:08] Omashun: No
[1:07:08] Warkless: KEKW
[1:07:08] Entrymissing: That's what content creators get paid for? Feeling the pain ..
[1:07:10] warmwalrus: no KEKW
[1:07:12] Racko5: KEKW
[1:07:14] Alamose: even in poe if you log durring a lag spike you die
[1:07:15] SailorWS: @Giantwaffle wasnt in reference to the server issue
[1:07:17] Jibbur: it may or may not work
[1:07:20] KuramaTheF0X: at that point your inventory doesnt even work
[1:07:21] Bunjimus: diablo notr  d2
[1:07:27] Jibbur: depends what the server thinks happens first when it catchs up
[1:07:29] SirHuddy: Minesweeper time?
[1:07:31] Winner5001: so the players were out of sync but the ai monster logic was still working?
[1:07:33] Iksess: i mean, they started 5 days early and died just to restart with f2p 70$ players, sounds fair EZ
[1:07:36] SailorWS: was talking to people flaming PoE logout macros
[1:07:46] ckcRichard: Have you ever played Astro colony @giantwaffle
[1:07:46] Moobot: Come join the Waffle House Discord! <# https://discord.gg/fhGFtMuzdS
[1:07:50] Hotmecha: did you really had to leave ONLY 1 bonemeal in your inventory
[1:07:52] Jibbur: its all dumb but a known risk
[1:07:59] LongestMoney: I don't think chat understands that you don't know when the server is gonna lagg so your instant TP can be casted KEKW
[1:08:02] Pati: It should be a quest too
[1:08:03] smikkelsmakkel: Aluminium used to be so easy to get. Just electrolyze clay dust and boom, aluminium dust
[1:08:10] Omashun: @Giantwaffle why don't you have a backpack or anything?
[1:08:40] That0neGeye: I would understand if you loose it from your own shit internet but from the server lagging is completely deferent
[1:08:46] Pati: you can always search for the quest
[1:08:48] BubbaChubbs420: I feel like the people making ignorant comments don't understand how a server works KEKW
[1:08:56] swupsy: @Omashun you're assuming its possible for him to make one
[1:08:58] Ohjaytee: just search in the bottom left
[1:09:01] Zwazi: ctrl+f
[1:09:14] Omashun: @swupsy yes given everyone else on the server has one. I think I made the correct assumption
[1:09:21] Pati: needs silicon boules pepeLaugh
[1:09:37] LongestMoney: @BubbaChubbs420 He should've downloaded more RAM Kappa
[1:09:40] Pati: we have plenty of solar grade silicon
[1:09:50] smikkelsmakkel: There's a quest for the IC's
[1:09:51] gartoks: @Giantwaffle I saw you searching for items in chests earlier (where it glowed purple) how do you do that?
[1:09:55] ValueTown: waffle i would make the silicon boules first. you will have to wait on them otherwise

[2:13:13] olewk: how much fster is it?
[2:13:19] olewk: faster?
[2:13:23] ZephMW: Plus you'd need to power the MV one and MV machines take 4x the power of LV
[2:14:31] daemonaedryn: KEKW
[2:14:37] Moopoop: KEKW
[2:14:44] FlammAlpha: KEKW time to make a Trello

[2:16:48] Kisheen: The turbo isn't, but it's 66% efficient
[2:17:11] deadgolfer: agreed
[2:17:13] VanDomand: so its temporary Kappa
[2:17:13] hiroscho: just make 3 more mv ones and up to hv
[2:17:15] n00rman_: make more mv instead
[2:17:21] OriginalDybo: But but the E F F I C I E N C Y
[2:17:25] Kisheen: Why not just make lower voltage and transform?
[2:17:26] Solacaria: First make it work, then make it efficient
[2:17:36] usernameNull: we are out of fuel, lets use what we have less efficiently
[2:17:39] Aragnir: why not light fuel for hv?
[2:17:44] Moopoop: it is what it is
[2:17:54] atamala: need more Oil KKona
[2:17:56] maccabeus: more like someone else will make it efficient
[2:17:56] hiroscho: mv works too and you get more energy since less fuel
[2:17:56] sam1390: ItsWhatIts
[2:18:13] deadgolfer: you can always disassemble it later so no big deal
[2:18:23] treeswift: I might have to get popcorn for this

[2:18:47] Stragmol: zoomer rushing things
[2:19:01] brightcandle: Not enough machines for multiple people when people are mass batching stuff not to solve the power issues
[2:19:10] Winstonrocks: why do you need the transformer
[2:19:15] KiloJoel: hv gen is less efficient, and transformer has power loss, so 4 mv gens would be significantly more efficient
[2:19:18] hiroscho: with steam? yes
[2:19:22] NahtanToIt: You're hungry Waffle
[2:19:49] aventu: stop this inefficient shenanigans ReallyMad

[2:20:03] NahtanToIt: Peckish?
[2:20:03] drummernerd: is that hot chocolate?
[2:20:10] hiroscho: steam isnt very stable, you will need a hv or multiple mv batteries
[2:20:20] Moopoop: do what your heart wants
[2:20:21] ZephMW: Or a gas turbine that's 95% efficient
[2:20:23] hisdue: the quest book demands it anyway ItsWhatIts
[2:20:23] kenshin2666: why would you not be 100%?!
[2:20:24] deadgolfer: just do it, you can always disassemble it
[2:20:25] Alem_Sinner_pt: why not 100% efficient Kappa
[2:20:26] atamala: "probably fine" KEKW
[2:20:38] kotwin: making 66% efficient things isn't the way to beat gtnh
[2:20:41] hiroscho: no, the power production isnt no, steam buffer doesnt work, the gen isnt stable
[2:20:45] maccabeus: what's 66% efficiency projected across 5000 hours?
[2:20:53] Stragmol: get there faster with more efficient machines

[2:21:42] ZephMW: 4 total
[2:21:42] KiloJoel: need 1 battery per amp output, so 4
[2:21:42] pixfix2k2: Each battery is 1 Amp output
[2:21:45] ZephMW: each batterly is 1 am
[2:21:45] Hegberr: need atleast 4
[2:22:38] hiroscho: you need 4
[2:22:41] pixfix2k2: Need 4
[2:22:58] hiroscho: 2amp in, 1 amp out per battery
[2:22:58] ZephMW: and it needs to be an MV battery buffer or BOOM
[2:23:02] pixfix2k2: Also need mv battery buffer
[2:23:29] 2Flip: inb4 things explode LUL
[2:23:48] hiroscho: each energy hacth can only take 2 amp
[2:24:45] ZephMW: Yeah, 1 hv turbine stepped down to 4 mv amps > 2batteriesx2bufferes giving 2 amps per energy hatch
[2:24:53] phatallen: wheres diablo
[2:25:07] 2Flip: @phatallen2 you can find it on the bnet launcher
[2:25:09] KuramaTheF0X: @phatallen2 not here rn
[2:25:14] phatallen: lol
[2:25:42] Locohobo: full setup time
[2:25:53] ZephMW: That would work too. I do it 2 turbines per wire and only use 1 wire (1 2x copper wire) per hatch on my setup, it saves some wires
[2:25:58] daZonk: EU?
[2:26:01] KuramaTheF0X: maybe check a quest
[2:26:05] Mitsuninja: What are we drinking today?

[2:31:47] ZephMW: And you source oxygen from a ton of different electrolyzer recipes
[2:31:58] marc0saurus: marc0saurus subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 9 months! 
[2:32:09] ZephMW: OR from electrolizing water (you want this in a corner somewhere just in a loop, slow but infinite oxygen and hydrogen)
[2:32:19] b0ltz12: liquid air is like LOX, just super cold and compressed air
[2:32:30] Johnhugem: demon wanted you to claim some quest reward in ingame chat

[3:16:38] TallicDragon: big pipes are bigger though, that's reason enough
[3:16:49] Alty2x: Super tanks give u one output spot, using that its fast enough but the rest is by pump
[3:16:51] Stragmol: fluid dynamics is hard Kappa
[3:16:51] Sulheim: super tank auto outputs from 1 side for max speed
[3:16:58] jayrickson87: If it'd steam you want a steam valvle
[3:17:02] Foooks: Ask Pati?
[3:17:05] StardustDragon08: @RussianRainbowTV Man what is wrong with your GPUs??? FeelsWeirdMan
[3:17:16] ZephMW: This is why an oil setup comes before :)
[3:17:17] Alty2x: I would say out of the one output connect more cables to output it
[3:17:20] juneberrry: But using a pump is faster and more than no pump? Not back seating actual question
[3:17:23] RussianRainbowTV: I have a single fan blower style 1080 thats overclocked xdd
[3:17:31] 7hat: @RussianRainbowTV just turn the fan down
[3:17:35] DrYoshi22: uuh
[3:17:37] jayrickson87: Use a MV Steam Valve

[3:17:46] Dr_McCarthy: @KuramaTheF0X both sexy is what you are saying? waffleHOMIE
[3:17:46] StardustDragon08: @RussianRainbowTV FeelsWeirdMan uuh
[3:17:47] Alty2x: @ZephMW I skipped all of MV and HV using 60 solar boilers
[3:17:55] k1n3c7x: there's steam pump whatever it calls
[3:18:00] KuramaTheF0X: @Dr_McCarthy Kissahomie yes
[3:18:09] RussianRainbowTV: I've needed to upgrade for years now, hopefully my new job will allow that
[3:18:11] Alty2x: It was rough but u could honestly speedrun to EV for ME system
[3:18:12] Darfuron: I went pyrolyse oven
[3:18:14] NoseyCape: is there texture packs that works with this mod?
[3:18:16] DuctTapeNinja_: @RussianRainbowTV maybe your thermal paste on the gpu is just dried out, maybe worth looking into that

[3:25:15] Dr_McCarthy: Leave the nukes to Ci YesYes
[3:25:18] Alty2x: It is yea but u do it till like IV tier
[3:25:29] Krystalchan: YEP just build more power
[3:25:30] Alty2x: Benzene lasts most for a LONG time
[3:25:45] Alty2x: Yea that's fair
[3:26:00] Krystalchan: It lasts a long time because the server moves at 10% speed
[3:26:04] jayrickson87: Large steel boilers make way more steam

[4:20:04] The_Grudge_: Why does @Giantwaffle sound like a villager? HMMMMMMM
[4:20:24] clumsykoala: propine
[4:20:31] HeyAFrozenZebra: Do you get a byproduct off making benzene
[4:20:34] GFQPR1882: make a rocket PogChamp LUL
[4:20:34] ZephMW: @ZephMW It's because I assume their server ISN"T running similar hardware
[4:20:39] Immp: @zephmw if you are using the Ender IO Farming Station, that is what Waffle is making the Kanthal ingots for, which is the slow painful part
[4:20:45] Alty2x: tolulene is from wood tar
[4:20:45] plattnotpratt: tallueen
[4:20:46] HeyAFrozenZebra: Tol-u-ene
[4:20:48] Alty2x: wood tar is wood
[4:20:50] Alty2x: yes benzene
[4:20:51] Phinnick: Its paint thinner that was 100 tol-u-ene
[4:20:52] Helegal07: you need distillation tower
[4:20:52] Alty2x: do benzene
[4:21:00] Jibbur: naaa quah duh
[4:21:01] Alty2x: nitrobenzene is what I do rn
[4:21:07] goldenknight22: monkaHmm
[4:21:07] Alty2x: which is why benzene is so good
[4:21:18] Alty2x: it CAN be using the oil
[4:21:19] ZephMW: @Immp Yes, but I'm trying to figure out why they claim that benzene causes lag. If it's the farming station then it's the same problem using steam or benzene and then just use the benzene as it's SIGNIFICANTLY better than steam
[4:21:19] Grunden: You can burn creosote in a semifluid generator
[4:21:24] Alty2x: but oil is good for another thing
[4:21:24] Sulheim: creosote is used in a generator
[4:21:35] lava4o4: build a distillary tower
[4:21:35] Alty2x: nononono wood tar is wood
[4:21:37] Alty2x: not charcoal
[4:21:43] Alty2x: wood tar distilled
[4:21:46] Jibbur: @Immp they are planning to use diesel and the steam is a holdover until they can
[4:22:00] FingerGames: sgeeeChad we always want the big one
[4:22:08] Alty2x: not the IC2 one I dont think
[4:22:13] Alty2x: do semi-fluid
[4:22:16] Alty2x: in menu
[4:22:18] Immp: @zephmw it is what people have said on the last playthrough it was laggy. On this hardware, cant really say more than that
[4:22:29] Alty2x: LMAO
[4:22:29] LuciferSpirt: look at the uses of creosote oil
[4:22:33] Alty2x: semi-fluid baby
[4:22:38] ZephMW: @Immp I mean, pulling oil from under bedrock is far less lag than a tree farm yeah, but at that point just take lv machines and a super tank and pull up oil and get on that setup so the ebf can actually run
[4:22:40] Alty2x: fuel efficiency is nice too
[4:23:25] Moobot: You can sub to Waffle by clicking this neat link -> twitch.tv/giantwaffle/subscribe SUBprise
[4:23:34] sambuchota: so no minesweeper? Sadge
[4:23:40] Jibbur: @Immp I don't disagree...
[4:23:55] Alty2x: @Immp yes but benzene lasts u through more tiers, cuz of bonsais and coke ovens
[4:24:08] PolarSlime: How many of you are playing?
[4:24:10] Alty2x: and also nitrobenzene if u wanna be efficient with it like me
[4:24:17] DemonicHell3: i need 17 pipes to replace all the steel pipes @Giantwaffle
[4:24:22] ZephMW: @Immp Well yeah, but apparently benzene is fully off limits soooo
[4:24:39] GFQPR1882: Efficient KEKW

[4:47:39] ZukotsuKiD: I personally thought the story for Scarlet/Violet was the best of any pokemon game
[4:47:44] Twister1M: @Giantwaffle you should try the Dragonquest DS games, they were really fun
[4:47:45] Moobot: You can sub to Waffle by clicking this neat link -> twitch.tv/giantwaffle/subscribe SUBprise
[4:47:48] hockeygoaliechris: The 3ds virtual games are not that bad
[4:47:51] StardustDragon08: Because it's a subscription service, it's not dropping the older games prices down
[4:47:53] arkun_: they‚Äôre alright, not worth the cost imo, but the emulation is good
[4:47:54] KuramaTheF0X: @ninopanda i stopped after B/W .. but damn man
[4:47:59] sablefoxx26c: dq ix is amazing
[4:48:01] mephisto__ttv: why not the real B&W game? no pokemon
[4:48:13] StardustDragon08: @ninopanda Damn I want to be like that some day
[4:48:23] warmwalrus: yea i just stopped playing pokemon after ruby/sapphire, too many consoles KEKW
[4:48:24] ninopanda: @kuramathef0x I am a shiny hunter and am at 50% shiny dex
[4:48:24] n69ky: @mephisto__ttv oh chat talking about pokemon? not the god/pet game?
[4:48:36] KuramaTheF0X: @ninopanda monkaX
[4:48:39] MagnesiumOxide: Haven't people found that they were using originally pirated roms for the eShop? Like real low bar for nintendo
[4:48:39] shepperd19: you gotta be old to remember the original Black & White PC game lol
[4:48:41] HeyAFrozenZebra: Oh no there's an old game Called Black and White they were referring to
[4:48:43] Sertima: There is a game called Black and White
[4:48:49] SawyerStreamsStuff: YEP
[4:49:05] Sloppy_D: Has Dolphin been taken down? I heard they got a DMCA
[4:49:08] StardustDragon08: Retro game prices have gotten so out of control. I'd almost just recommend emulation
[4:49:13] Elso17: thats why i never sold any of my copys
[4:49:19] n69ky: @shepperd19 35+ isnt that old waffleGrump
[4:49:25] StardustDragon08: @Sloppy_D Steam page got DMCA I think it's still up on their website
[4:49:25] shepperd19: :)
[4:49:40] Twister1M: @Giantwaffle I'm assuming you've heard about reddit basically shutting down external API calls?
[4:49:45] ninopanda: @n69ky but I feel old lol
[4:49:48] Slymph: Boom boom boom, i want u in my room peepoShy
[4:49:54] shepperd19: its good tho its helping brick and mortar stores stay in buisness

[4:50:10] hisdue: @Slymph wayo waffleNote
[4:50:11] MrArrig: Buildup to IPO
[4:50:13] ninopanda: @slymph only if we cuddle
[4:50:13] NarwhalArgy: @Giantwaffle They're thinking money!
[4:50:14] thePier: reddit.. thinking? COPIUM
[4:50:15] TheRackster: Companies thinking now a days?
[4:50:16] Trilesnik: What happened to the old gtnh server? I thought you guys had AE
[4:50:19] n69ky: @ninopanda 50+ might be old tho waffleDead
[4:50:21] brightcandle: Corporate enshitification has taken hold everywhere
[4:50:25] mephisto__ttv: there is a black and white game, fun to play. old one. but not a pokemon one. totally different @Giantwaffle playing god and sacrificing your citizen :)
[4:50:26] jdog0616: i have been using the official reddit app for like 8 years
[4:50:30] StardustDragon08: I think Reddit wants to look profitable when they go publiv
[4:50:31] Stragmol: its because of AI using it to train
[4:50:32] MrBobMcBob: They want to charge high API rates for AI Learning and training
[4:50:33] warmwalrus: bc theyre wanting to IPO KEKW
[4:50:35] rajahgold: @Trilesnik accidental wipe
[4:50:36] orillion: PepLaugh so you use their platform only
[4:50:38] sunburm: @brightcandle Everything is being enshittificated
[4:50:42] deadgolfer: drives everyone to their own app, the can harness the ad rev then
[4:50:42] Nexhunter: @Giantwaffle well they are making money off of reddit's service KEKW sooooo
[4:50:43] w1mon: Because they can't show ads on those apps?
[4:50:44] brightcandle: Its about AI, they want a piece of that pie
[4:50:46] ninopanda: @n69ky I'm 35 and feel like my body is broken
[4:50:46] JoniSusi: Reddit isnt getting ad revenue off third party users. insane
[4:50:48] NoxAurea: they're trying to IPO as well
[4:50:48] Wingy_: They should just hire the guy that made it
[4:50:48] HeyAFrozenZebra: I wonder if there's a lawsuit in all this
[4:50:49] Alamose: they are going for an IPO
[4:50:51] AdamMcAdamson: Gotta be AI datasets
[4:50:52] Sloppy_D: They cant learn user behavior on thrid party apps
[4:50:55] CPUfreezer: I'm using old :)
[4:50:56] Thills_: I prefer the new reddit
[4:50:56] auzu_: their app just keeps getting worse
[4:50:56] JJaaYY: It‚Äôs also taking down modding bots, so there will be spam and porn-bots everywhere
[4:50:57] Twister1M: yeah old.reddit is going away too
[4:50:58] SawyerStreamsStuff: new reddit is fucking ASS
[4:50:58] RussianRainbowTV: new reddit ew
[4:51:01] Vargh: new reddit is trash
[4:51:02] Nexhunter: @JoniSusi they don't get ad revenue and those apps have subscriptions also
[4:51:05] rickthe_punk: soon tm
[4:51:05] itssalsashark: @Giantwaffle Twitter and Reddit are gripped about AI scraping
[4:51:06] goldenknight22: never use new Madge
[4:51:07] Tidalllwave: asus rog ally is a better device
[4:51:07] Alamose: if old reddit goes so do I
[4:51:09] MagnesiumOxide: Their post said old reddit is sticking around yet
[4:51:09] usernameNull: the apollo app dev has audio of them saying the cost is to offset the lost opportunity cost of users not going to reddit directly, not server cost
[4:51:11] Satic: Apollo dev confirmed the pricing was because of opportunity cost due to lost ads and not actual server usage
[4:51:12] StardustDragon08: old reddit is probably next on the chopping block tbh Sadge
[4:51:17] n00rman_: just make the blackout last until they revert the change
[4:51:20] brightcandle: Not all the apps have subscriptions, boost for example is free
[4:51:22] n69ky: @ninopanda 36 here,. some days i really feel like that day might be the last, yes xD i think this is normal
[4:51:30] warmwalrus: time for the new twitter/reddit/facebook KEKW
[4:51:41] Nexhunter: @usernameNull yea and the guy also provided the evidence reddit needed to sue him KEKW just cause he thinks he being canadian means the us long arm can't reach out to him KEKW
[4:51:56] Twister1M: The Apollo dev wrote about how he asked them to buy Apollo to keep it up and the company internally claimed he was trying to blackmail them
[4:52:13] StardustDragon08: Damn that's a shame
[4:52:18] ninopanda: @n69ky I recently found a muscle message machine has helped with minor aches and pains lol
[4:52:21] That_Lurker: @Giantwaffle The most annying part was the only 30 day warning to the devs
[4:52:21] sunburm: And even then, the pricing isnt the reason why apollo had to shut down. The reason is that he only had 30 days to implement payment systems for it
[4:52:25] Nexhunter: well the apollodev fucked himself over
[4:52:34] brightcandle: He has a recording of the conversation, its ridiculous the claim the CEO is making, Reddit is lying
[4:52:35] Tiggaboo: He had been recording all conversations with them since Canada has single sided consent
[4:52:37] Twister1M: June 14th
[4:52:39] Nexhunter: a summary judgment is gonna be an easy grant against him for privacy violation KEKW
[4:52:43] jdog0616: $0.24 per 1000 requests
[4:52:45] warmwalrus: KEKW
[4:52:53] Ketchup455: a month i thought??
[4:52:54] Intohimos: is apollo free?
[4:52:57] Immp: @ninopanda im more than 10 years your senior, still acting like im 25. Catches up on me sometimes haha
[4:52:58] StardustDragon08: @Nexhunter not if he gets a good lawyer KEKW
[4:52:58] RamseyRinehaus: "API Calls" can mean a lot of things
[4:53:00] arkun_: I‚Äôm a bit tired of everyone getting mad at social media companies, at the end of the day most people aren‚Äôt spending a penny on these waffleThink
[4:53:02] Nexhunter: @Tiggaboo doesn't matter cali law is what matters and well pepeLaugh summary judgement and avoidance of a judgement doesn't work
[4:53:03] jdog0616: @Ketchup455 $2million a month
[4:53:04] deadgolfer: that is like twitter api calls lol
[4:53:06] Twister1M: @Intohimos yes he worked off of patreon IIRC
[4:53:07] brightcandle: Apollo is $10 a year
[4:53:11] arkun_: @intohimos it has a premium subscription
[4:53:12] Kardiiac: thats more than hegetsus paid for ads for the whole year Kappa
[4:53:13] Klorell: "i want AI money" cashgrab
[4:53:17] Ketchup455: @jdog0616 ah thx
[4:53:22] Nexhunter: yea apollo makes money off of reddit
[4:53:23] n69ky: @ninopanda good, i found out eating a little healthier / less sugar helps alot with internal aches, maybe just  aplacebo effect but thats besides the point haha
[4:53:23] MrBobMcBob: Apollo dev, made an offhand joke that if its going to cost him $20m/year for API calls, "Might as well just pay me $10m to take my app from me" and Reddit has been floating this as the "Blackmail"
[4:53:25] mahoraz: AWS document DB is expensive AF too....
[4:53:40] legomaster18: whats funny about this is im pretty sure they are going to lose more money due to all the people stopping api use vs how much they stood to gain with the price increase
[4:53:40] jdog0616: Apollo would spend $250 000 to refund all the paid users
[4:53:41] BigMan510_: sorry but whats api lol
[4:53:46] JJaaYY: They pay imagur ~$113 for their API, which gets the same amount of calls to their server
[4:53:50] Nexhunter: @legomaster18 they make no money from them
[4:53:52] 1StClassAlcoholic: This is probably to prevent people from training LLMs. And isn‚Äôt Reddit going public?
[4:53:52] LazloHo: @arkun_ I mostly agree. I use the ones that cost what I'm willing to pay and don't use the others. It's our choice of what we use and their choice of how to monetize it.
[4:53:57] lykenew: Lots of other third party reddit apps are closing too, so sad seeing all the shutting down posts
[4:54:00] joebanks07: Hey waffle, have you ever played Apex legends?
[4:54:02] StardustDragon08: @youngeric1 that's a long complicated answer KEKW
[4:54:02] Intohimos: I can imagine reddit charging some amount to use their apis especially at the higher rates but that amount seems a crazy
[4:54:07] s_DeXTeR_s: what is Apollo?
[4:54:10] Nexhunter: @JJaaYY an image service is hella cheaper to run for queries than reddit with complex relations
[4:54:10] MrBobMcBob: Reddit is going to have a crappier IPO now, and Reddit mgmt cant see that
[4:54:13] jdog0616: @youngeric1 an app can ask reddit servers for the content on the website, it goes through the API
[4:54:16] HeyAFrozenZebra: Spez is doing an AMA
[4:54:17] tripwires: are we coming to the point that 'our data' is not worth enough anymore for advertising companies that services start to ask money for services?
[4:54:18] brightcandle: All the apps are shutting down.
[4:54:18] sunburm: If he had gotten fx 100 days or so to setup a pricing system it could have been feasable, but reddit didnt want to budge and wouldnt give him a chance to implement anything
[4:54:18] HeyAFrozenZebra: right now
[4:54:19] Slasher0915: RIP Boost
[4:54:20] Tiggaboo: pretty much all the 3rd party apps
[4:54:21] ninopanda: Haha @n69ky yeah waffle has his coming!! We soon gonna hear him complain about his body aches
[4:54:23] That_Lurker: All the 3rd party apps will
[4:54:23] Nexhunter: chat reddit makes no money from those 3rd party apps
[4:54:25] StardustDragon08: @HeyAFrozenZebra that will go well KEKW
[4:54:31] Nexhunter: why would the IPO be affected
[4:54:32] brightcandle: Yep they are IPOing soon
[4:54:35] orillion: PepeHands time to leave reddit
[4:54:39] DuctTapeNinja_: corporate greed without bounds as always
[4:54:43] Foooks: Surely
[4:54:43] HeyAFrozenZebra: It's going amazing
[4:54:46] MrBobMcBob: Reddit was going to IPO in 2020, then 2022, and now maybe late 2023
[4:54:47] Billy7heKid: Bye cool reddit, hello corporate reddit full of ads
[4:54:48] JJaaYY: I‚Äôve already been followed by porn-bots due to auto mods needing to shutdown @giantwaffle
[4:54:51] n69ky: @ninopanda hah like that random chest pain one day a month, having him worried the rest of the day XD
[4:54:51] StardustDragon08: They want to look profitable
[4:54:52] Qbertman: welp i guess reddit gonna die soon then
[4:54:58] Satic: Yeah they priced out 3rd party apps instead of outright banning them, same result
[4:55:00] Tiggaboo: @Nexhunter 15% of their users arent counted in their OWN app due to 3rd party, thats how
[4:55:02] Nexhunter: @StardustDragon08 yea and third party apps dying is gonna help that KEKW
[4:55:04] ClubsSC: I just hopped in, what's happening that waffle is talking about?
[4:55:10] KICKKJ: reddit is hoping for 15 billion evaluation when the ipo happens
[4:55:13] brightcandle: Its like Discord kicking off people and then wrecking usernames to chase another pie. Just greed driving enshitification
[4:55:19] StardustDragon08: @Nexhunter I didn't say it was a good strategy just a strategy KEKW
[4:55:22] Nexhunter: @Tiggaboo and they weren't accounted anyways cause advertisers would have known they were being fleeced
[4:55:32] JoniSusi: oof the reddit ama started for Spez ü§£
[4:55:34] Intohimos: what about reddit sync on android? anyone know anything about its future?
[4:55:46] StardustDragon08: @JoniSusi I wish him luck.
[4:55:46] Moobot: You can find Waffle's Youtube channel here - https://youtube.com/giantwaffle
[4:55:48] MrBobMcBob: Reddit is melting down its servers because of the CEO ama right now lol
[4:55:49] brightcandle: If its not the official reddit app its dead
[4:55:55] rickthe_punk: they just need a bunch of developper to pay for it at once and split the api so the cost is less per year
[4:55:58] Tiggaboo: @Nexhunter what I mean is they see that as free numbers to pump it up before IPO
[4:55:59] Nexhunter: advertisers knew facebook was fleecing them on video views and was very quick to get their money back @Tiggaboo they would have gone to war against reddit if they were faking their user data
[4:56:00] arkun_: all 3rd party apps will be affected @intohimos
[4:56:12] StardustDragon08: @Intohimos I would assume any app that isn't the reddit app is at risk of disappearing
[4:56:19] arkun_: At least if they use the api, which they should be using
[4:56:25] LuciferSpirt: KEKW you spent that whole time on a single block and the boys made a multi block
[4:56:32] Nexhunter: @StardustDragon08 yep but RES uses your cookie session so its fine
[4:56:38] omar_i_: process something see if power drops
[4:56:40] Nexhunter: @StardustDragon08 and that all that matters is that RES is good KEKW
[4:56:42] That_Lurker: All the 3rd party apps could have lowered their API usage, but reddit only gave them 30 days to do so before the bills start to rise
[4:57:02] StardustDragon08: @Nexhunter monkaHmm guessing that's on android and not iOS?
[4:57:11] Nexhunter: @StardustDragon08 oh no browser extension KEKW
[4:57:12] s_DeXTeR_s: remove dirt
[4:57:23] StardustDragon08: @Nexhunter pepeLaugh Ah good
[4:57:24] Nexhunter: @StardustDragon08 some of us reddit boomers don't use the apps
[4:57:28] brightcandle: Even RES has some concerns, they use the API at times so some of its function will be impacted
[4:57:34] n69ky: !remind me 5 years, @Giantwaffle @ninopanda
[4:57:39] Tiggaboo: yea that was the worst part, if Christian has a few months he could work out his payment plans or fix the API calls, but its 30 days to get eferything in order and start incuring 2mill/month fees lol
[4:57:41] Nexhunter: @brightcandle they do not use the API that the apps use they're using your cookie
[4:57:49] n69ky: waffleYes
[4:57:49] Foooks: Is output set properly?
[4:57:50] pixfix2k2: Steam turbines at top are off most of the ti.e
[4:57:53] pixfix2k2: Time
[4:57:57] Vernash_: is your generator potentially too far away from the batteries?
[4:58:00] StardustDragon08: Well guess mobile reddit will just die
[4:58:00] ninopanda: @n69ky haha true
[4:58:01] lykenew: 30 days KEKW
[4:58:01] Nexhunter: i can KEKW
[4:58:01] TheeSouleater: 30 days is crazyyyy
[4:58:08] Nexhunter: we had the same shit from Otka KEKW
[4:58:13] RamseyRinehaus: 100% you can, dude is not associated with reddit at all, he is a moron for not having a risk strategy for his business
[4:58:14] Nexhunter: and we have enterprise contracts KEKW
[4:58:16] jdog0616: Apple gave 30 months for their API shutdown
[4:58:18] StardustDragon08: You can. Just don't be surprised when they get pissed KEKW
[4:58:22] DemonicHell3: We don't have enough more potin or lead to make potin
[4:58:29] DemonicHell3: We also are running out of steam
[4:58:51] Nexhunter: @StardustDragon08 can't be surprised as a dev if the service you use is pissed you're making money off them KEKW
[4:59:01] n69ky: play some counterstrike, you'll catch enough led Kappa
[4:59:07] n69ky: lead
[4:59:17] arkun_: The Apollo dev made a comparison to Dark Sky, which Apple gave something like 30 months of API support for developers to figure out a solution, whereas Reddit devs had 90 days optimistically, or 30 in the case of Apollo who were surprised with this
[4:59:41] brightcandle: As expected the charcoal is done
[4:59:41] arkun_: Reddit 3rd party devs*
[4:59:55] StardustDragon08: @Nexhunter Especially when they're not getting any money KEKW
[5:00:03] Nexhunter: @arkun_ that is an acquisition and a service shutdown not a hey we're done with you using our shit without paying
[5:01:05] omar_i_: D4

[5:01:12] dvr18: D4 yeah
[5:01:12] StardustDragon08: Minecraft
[5:01:12] arkun_: The acquisition set off the same result, which is Apple wants devs to stop using the Dark Sky API, but they gave them a lot more runway @nexhunter
[5:01:13] TogglesLore: Mc, D4, OSRS

[5:01:44] Cmdr_Void: D4 has been having bad server trouble and queues not even 3 days after the main release
[5:01:44] That_Lurker: @Nexhunter @Nexhunter But they could have given them more time to make the app work in a way they actually can start to pay reddit instead of just closing

[5:48:43] LongestMoney: My personal RAM is corrputed

[6:47:44] 0x000000: i bet there are many small ea indie games with better stats

[6:52:28] rell3k: you say tetris inventory like its a good thing....
[6:52:30] daemonaedryn: I think part of why Dredge was so goated is cause they didnt overcomplicate. They had fishing, some inventory management, and a setting.
[6:52:42] Dagmoo: 2 yeah
[6:52:50] Tackler52: I hope they get better soon, I hate that the dev team is sick Sadge

[6:57:28] Nexhunter: well apple is very silo
[6:57:30] Stormflare: not surprised
[6:57:41] Nexhunter: unless you need to know you don't know
[6:57:43] Nexhunter: within apple
[6:57:48] Sloppy_D: Most companies are so siloed that you dont know what people are doing
[6:57:50] MarquesCoding: funny how the higher ups don't know about it, but the designers etc know :)
[6:57:50] Slymph: Thats how u know its a big company
[6:57:51] MarauderStrafe: 3500 for 2 hour battery life
[6:58:09] MarquesCoding: @MarauderStrafe but you can plug it in
[6:58:10] xiolage: im excited to see the vision pro 2
[6:58:12] Myekos: she single?
[6:58:13] Justsevenstars07: @MarauderStrafe you can plug it in the wall though
[6:58:14] TakticalAnomaly: The vice president didn't even know about the manhattan project.
[6:58:20] mostlylaughing: i mean i sometimes don't know we got new guidelines for my part of the work at my company KEKW
[6:58:22] HeyAFrozenZebra: Yeah needs a 5 hour battery and a lower price and I'm in
[6:58:23] hackett33: I can tell you from working in a tech company thats even with NDAs its very hard to keep secrets
[6:58:33] GFQPR1882: @xiolage Vision pro 2 hour KEKW
[6:58:38] TankMonkey55: scuba steve goggles
[6:58:39] itssalsashark: Still no word if you can hotswap batteries or not.
[6:58:42] VenomMellow: headset is not real
[6:58:43] drummernerd: Makes sense
[6:58:44] xiolage: @GFQPR1882 KEKW
[6:58:48] pachvara42: @Giantwaffle saw on Twitter that some people were concerned that tim cook weren't using it on presentation
[6:59:00] MarquesCoding: what is crazy though, it's powered by a M2. My M2 Pro lasts for like 6+ hours full grind so must be doing some crazy calculations etc
[6:59:00] drummernerd: They did
[6:59:01] HeyAFrozenZebra: They did
[6:59:01] Apparentthreat: they did
[6:59:03] GFQPR1882: ?
[6:59:03] Nexhunter: they could wear it
[6:59:03] AIex_0: they wore it
[6:59:04] Apparentthreat: 30 minutes
[6:59:05] xiolage: interestingly tehre was no footage of the use
[6:59:05] HackCD: they wore it
[6:59:06] K4shira: they did
[6:59:07] lykenew: They did just in private
[6:59:11] drummernerd: They couldnt film it though
[6:59:15] Nexhunter: they just didn't have a lot of time and well no filming
[6:59:19] Chocob0: they probably had neck problems immediately after
[6:59:34] MindKill3rx: Probably limited the people who could wear it for hygiene reasons too
[6:59:35] itssalsashark: I think it's real, but I don't think what they showed will ever launch.
[6:59:37] Justsevenstars07: @MarquesCoding i mean it also has a much smaller battery than a laptop though
[6:59:37] drummernerd: Same
[6:59:38] Nexhunter: @Chocob0 tested's norm said it felt fine
[6:59:39] MarquesCoding: If the price was 2k I'd buy it
[6:59:42] Math354e: only GMA got to show a video of them wearing it
[6:59:43] MarauderStrafe: the only/main thing I like about it was 23 million pixels in O-LED for a really small screen
[6:59:47] HeyAFrozenZebra: Cause I see it as a media center not like a VR headset
[6:59:52] Infra_Roodborstje: Streamer money is good no?
[6:59:52] TogglesLore: How much was it
[6:59:55] pentabell: what is vintech
[6:59:56] GFQPR1882: Are u still with 2400 ?
[6:59:57] Speedkill3r: Im pretty sure im going to get one..
[6:59:58] 2Flip: LUL
[6:59:58] KuramaTheF0X: at 2k i could see it
[6:59:59] lykenew: If it was <1.5k, I would have sent it KEKW
[7:00:00] WeakenedSoul: I think that style of tech in a motorcycle helmet would be sweet
[7:00:02] kuba_91: Apple and decent price pepeLaugh
[7:00:02] Billy7heKid: I hear it runs excel well. The accountant in me is excited
[7:00:04] StOrMy1100: @Giantwaffle Would you buy it for 2.5k?
[7:00:04] Kounga: @pentabell financial tech
[7:00:05] drummernerd: Big Ooof
[7:00:06] Nexhunter: price of a hololens 2
[7:00:06] TogglesLore: So a mac book?
[7:00:06] Nexhunter: KEKW
[7:00:08] savagelizard: $3k for some realistic CORN hub
[7:00:08] itssalsashark: @HeyAFrozenZebra For 1 person
[7:00:11] Blazedasthesun: im just waiting on the next gen of valve index LUL
[7:00:11] NarwhalArgy: I would only get it if it was around $1k, even at $2k, not many people will develop for it
[7:00:12] Chocob0: it runs excel?
[7:00:13] UselessSlime: Had a friend work on HW R&D @ apple and she said that it's the same thing even within teams working on the same product. Apparently the metal teams and the hw teams always had trouble working together because they just couldn't talk to each other b/c NDAs and stuff
[7:00:14] MindKill3rx: All first gen tech products are pretty expensive
[7:00:14] KICKKJ: plus tax
[7:00:16] pachvara42: Starting at 3500
[7:00:21] Nexhunter: my MBP was $3k
[7:00:23] ToeKnee147: for a 2 hour battery version
[7:00:23] HeyAFrozenZebra: @itssalsashark Perfect for me lol
[7:00:23] MarquesCoding: o/
[7:00:23] razledazle1337: It's apple, they have to add Apple Tax :)
[7:00:34] Quelinoth: $4669 Canadian
[7:00:39] Nexhunter: @razledazle1337 it not really an apple tax added
[7:00:40] ryanforresterdev: It's exciting cause when it fails they will hopefully move away from VR and make something better
[7:00:40] aundros: overpriced like all apple products
[7:00:41] Nexhunter: it the displays from sony
[7:00:42] ZephMW: They look like Ski Goggles... and as someone who wears those pretty regularly, that band stretches out pretty quick and however it touches your face gets pretty grotty pretty quick
[7:00:46] MarquesCoding: The only thing that is not specced out on my work laptop is the storage :|
[7:00:47] mark_steele: I would buy one if I could hook it up to a computer for extra power
[7:00:56] MarquesCoding: because it's like 800 for 8TB ssd
[7:00:58] Sloppy_D: Yeah Imma wait a year or two until its better
[7:00:59] Nexhunter: the sony displays are ungodly expensive per screen folks KEKW
[7:01:03] mark_steele: although I guess local streaming would work
[7:01:04] Speedkill3r: Yeah I feel like they are throwing the kitchen at the wall and seeing what sticks
[7:01:04] TheRackster: Next gen is gonna be even more expensive, its apple my man KEKW
[7:01:09] K4shira: i still don't understand what problem the headset tries to solve exactly
[7:01:10] MindKill3rx: I bet the cheapest Apple gets with VR over the next 10 years is $2K
[7:01:11] Artiriouz: I still cant get behind VR tbh still way too clunky for my liking
[7:01:11] GFQPR1882: I‚Äôm waiting for the iPerson YEP
[7:01:14] Lajnuss_: i thought it was AR
[7:01:15] bismarcksd: Asmon said he was gonna buy one
[7:01:19] Zoinx: Vision Pro Max
[7:01:20] That_Lurker: @mark_steele @mark_steele It already has m2 in it
[7:01:20] 0x4273: Im super hyped for the technology, not super hyped for the price
[7:01:21] TogglesLore: NoNo
[7:01:22] HeyAFrozenZebra: LOL
[7:01:23] mkam225: I feel like you need to almost sell those things near cost if you want that kind of tech to take off

[7:37:46] Tompop23: So you need to satisfy 1 more bkmb to the 3 and both 1s. So it has to be middle @giantwaffle
[7:37:48] Rocknsugar: if a bomb was on the right, a bomb could not be above the 3 because the middle 1 would already be triggered
[7:37:50] snorrow92: the 3 needs a bomb, that bomb is always connected to middle 1. so cant be most right is the logic
[7:38:09] SailorWS: has to be left
[7:38:09] oxidexd: Faze vs Vit going to OT

[7:44:39] That_Lurker: I never saw gollum game being reality but here we are
[7:44:40] drummernerd: LETHIMCOOK
[7:44:49] nicedec28: yes because the 1 means that the bomb 2 are not glued
[7:44:55] HeyAFrozenZebra: cause there has to be 2 on tthe 2
[7:45:04] punkgeek: If you put a bomb in the middle you can't fit another for the 2
[7:45:04] DragonApoc: If you place a flag on the wrong block does the bomb count go down ?
[7:45:05] 0x000000: because there cannot be 2 flags together
[7:45:08] 0x4273: Pog
