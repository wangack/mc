[0:58:39] idolovechess: llamas are not even that dangerous

[1:06:50] capsicaprimero: the island a mystic vessel
[1:06:56] jasper_186: If it sailed in? is it suppose to show forward movement? like wool winds behind it?

[1:13:52] Teddable: I built 4 floating islands in my world, each housing an iron farm. Absolutely loved that project

[1:16:10] Rob_42: fill it with water.

[1:16:15] mona_is_active: Yesh
[1:16:17] alpharaposa: Unless you're building massive redstone projects full of pistons and hoppers, you're just not going to keep up with even slow iron farms.
[1:16:19] canada_raz: lava cobblestone generator?
[1:16:19] ApollosDagger: Could always come back later and put a secret building in there
[1:16:20] Techdawg77: Ello Ello Ello Pirate Island time!
[1:16:27] earlierrelic52: just dropped by to see how you"re doing...love your survival   guide
[1:16:27] LadyHespeth: Mob farm inside? maybe?
[1:16:33] GingerTheLily: @Techdawg77 Yes, and the pirate ship is next!
[1:16:34] TheWormbo: Speaking of iron farms, Pix: Have you seen the upcoming spawn chunk changes regarding the "radius" of chunks that stay active?
[1:16:35] rathgar1843: some sort of way to slay, lava hhot rotcks, or piston trident on bedrock
[1:17:32] fragglemeat: there are very simple chunk loaders if it's absolultely necessary
[1:17:50] EvilShadoww: !sc a meta thing would be to switch the podcast recording to Tuesday, since mojang made changes to the spawn chunks LUL
[1:17:51] Nightbot: Pixlriffs & his friend Joel have a Minecraft podcast! Check it out at http://thespawnchunks.com/ and now also Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/thespawnchunks
[1:17:54] Techdawg77: I’m really digging the scale of this build, looks good in the valley
[1:18:00] visionszd: Agree, it was a very odd decision to keep such a large area permanently loaded by default. Good change
[1:18:05] gamingnscience: if need be, the spawn chunks range can be customized way beyond the e default
[1:18:22] Another_JT: I was looking at why the spawn chunks are the way that they are, and it was kinda wierd
[1:18:22] Ima_TacocaT: id imagine, the 3x3 radius shouldn’t matter for you Pix. my best guess is that legacy worlds would maintain the current size once the new update is out. of course you could reduce it yourself to the default with the commands

[1:19:02] buzzie107: you could make a mini cave into the side of the island @pixlriffs
[1:19:04] Another_JT: Like personal mob caps, yes
[1:19:06] GingerTheLily: @matthewd__ Hello and welcome in!
[1:19:15] canada_raz: we need a 256
[1:19:19] fragglemeat: oh boy the reddit threads if that were to be implemented...
[1:19:23] mona_is_active: He can decorate it with drip stone at the edges from down btw it is looking so good
[1:19:30] CommissarFeesh: It's not totally arbitrary, 64 makes sense in binary math
[1:19:37] npbeans: A mini lush cave with a waterfall coming out would look cool
[1:19:47] Another_JT: @CommissarFeesh and so does 128 or 256
[1:19:59] jimkayaker: As a member of the 8-bit community I would have you would recognise that 64 is 8bits, or 1 byte
[1:20:04] AsherDusk: I personally think they should add a inventory row expansion off of the boss mobs. Craft a extra row with some materials and say a drop from the dragon
[1:20:11] MessPat: this is looking good
[1:20:17] GingerTheLily: @jimkayaker thebla2378LeekCommunity thebla2378LeekCommunity
[1:20:20] fragglemeat: there's a weird convergence of powers of 2 and multiples of 3 (e.g. 3 rows of 9) in minecraft
[1:20:21] VoidedMirror: I can see them upping some stack sizes to 256 like stone and wood, but keep 64 for some other items like arrows

[1:21:23] Another_JT: yet you can stack other round things, like heart of the sea, to 64
[1:21:24] Lyarrah: you can't stack spheres lol
[1:21:25] jimkayaker: Why stop at 256? 65 items takes 2 bytes, so why not use all of the 2 bytes and go for 30 million?
[1:21:28] Prideceratops: I've arrived precisely when I wanted to!
[1:21:33] Teddable: Maybe Mojang could extend enchanting beyond tools and have them apply to the player too. An inventory or stack extending enchantment perhaps

[1:22:08] VoidedMirror: Does knowing all the stack sizes really matter for gameplay? Most people really only care if they can hold more items or not.
[1:22:10] poisso3: @Prideceratops Never too early or too late...
[1:22:13] Axynim: Nobody gets stone anymore. It's all deepslate
[1:22:17] Voilturez: just found a great seed for my world
[1:22:23] fragglemeat: Steve will approach the Swartzchild radius if he had 30 mil stack sizes
[1:22:25] GingerTheLily: @Voilturez GG
[1:22:27] Prideceratops: @poisso3 Can't be late if you never said you would be there at a specific time
[1:22:27] jimkayaker: But there is a priciple there somewhere...
[1:22:28] Another_JT: that could be the other way to go with inventory. just make a max carry limit
[1:22:36] doxisontwitchnow: I would be happy to be able to stack things like potions that are the same. I get the tools, bc  durability can differ, but fire resistance 2 should be able to stack with other fire res two, ect.
[1:22:37] EvilShadoww: 30 million stack sizes would probably solve my inventory issues
[1:22:39] poisso3: @Prideceratops Exactly...or early
[1:22:50] Voilturez: @GingerTheLily It has a massive island with a deep river canyon through it, and a mountain on one side.
[1:23:06] GingerTheLily: @Voilturez sounds cool!
[1:23:11] PretzelRocks: Now Playing: Burgundy by Philanthrope, mommy -> https://prtzl.io/zyHkOp9x1MGpkyUz
[1:23:25] Another_JT: yes, you try to build with copper, in which every block has 8 possible types....
[1:23:36] EvilShadoww: would that mean that bundles could also carry 30 million items?
[1:23:39] VoidedMirror: I usually build in block soup. For small builds i'm usually using 100+ different items
[1:23:51] GingerTheLily: is eating a glazed caramel doughnut with curly chocolate bits on it
[1:23:55] TiniSpicy: more slots would be nice
[1:24:12] ApollosDagger: @gingerthelily that sounds so good
[1:24:13] Techdawg77: I sometimes build something just to clean out odd blocks in my chests
[1:24:23] Mattnac: @GingerTheLily im quite envious
[1:24:26] Axynim: @GingerTheLily I no longer appreciate the mods -_-
[1:24:27] TiniSpicy: @GingerTheLily PogChamp GoldPLZ
[1:24:31] hufflepuff_cookie: @gingerthelily I just finished breakfast but the sounds DELICIOUS
[1:24:34] jimkayaker: 1 byte is 256, how did I wortk it out as 64? Kind of worrying that I am doing strength analysis on a part at the same time...
[1:24:35] capsicaprimero: i always considered shulker boxes the solution, doesnt even have to fight the dragon (unless hardcore cuz gotta die to get hhome otherwise)
[1:24:36] CommissarFeesh: Of course that means implementing bundles
[1:24:36] GingerTheLily: hands out doughnuts to everyone in chat
[1:24:38] entity_mn: All I want is for bundles to carry 64 tools and armor.
[1:24:40] ontheDiagonal: silenceFrogthink Why do we assume a "floating" island is floating in the sky and not in the water?
[1:24:52] GingerTheLily: @ontheDiagonal pixlriPride pixlriPride
[1:24:53] Axynim: @GingerTheLily redeemed. TYVM
[1:24:53] Techdawg77: archae13Donut archae13Donut mmmmm
[1:24:56] sami_spoon: I don't want to think about throwing that many items out of the bundle to retrieve just one
[1:24:56] EvilShadoww: "take this full stack of stone. it can be laid out till the world border in a single direction "
[1:24:57] poisso3: @GingerTheLily will you share?
[1:24:57] ApollosDagger: cakejuCake cakejuCake cakejuCake cake for everyone
[1:25:01] begaydocrime2: I always enable bundles but I feel mean killing the rabbits to get them
[1:25:01] TiniSpicy: yay! KomodoHype

[1:25:19] fragglemeat: @jimkayaker 64 takes 6 bits, presumably in a struct containing other things, so that the bit fields are packed
[1:25:29] poisso3: @GingerTheLily TwitchUnity  Danke!
[1:25:30] Axynim: The one thing for stacks and sizes is why some things stack and other don't. Especially between the two versions.
[1:25:30] Techdawg77: @poisso3 Morgan!
[1:25:34] Prideceratops: @begaydocrime2 You can also get rabbit hide from cats as a gift
[1:25:45] poisso3: @Techdawg77 You tawed out yet?
[1:25:56] VoidedMirror: @fragglemeat the 2 extra bits were used for the block subtypes before the 1.13 changes to block ids
[1:26:07] doxisontwitchnow: bundles are a great early game tool, but they lose a lot of usefulness once you have an ender chest you can carry. But being able to store various flowers, saplings, ect compactly is great.
[1:26:07] Axynim: I was frightened when someone asked me for 7 shulkers of cake, because Bedrock cakes stack to 64. It was my first go at Java SMP
[1:26:08] Techdawg77: @poisso3 just enough to check my mail!
[1:26:16] fragglemeat: ah well there you go
[1:26:18] EvilShadoww: looks like someone took a bite out of the island
[1:26:38] doxisontwitchnow: @Axynim I didn't know that, and I get why you are alarmed
[1:26:50] Lyarrah: I've placed more cake than that... whoops
[1:26:51] GingerTheLily: Remember the marathon cake eating session for one of the Davids!
[1:26:52] poisso3: @Techdawg77 Nice! I saw the video of the firetruck sliding on an iced street there in your area.
[1:26:53] Big____Tasty: It’s interesting that people feel bad for killing rabbits but not cows for the leather.  or the poor defenseless zombies who are just looking for a snack.
[1:26:56] jimkayaker: @VoidedMirror makles sense. Shocked at my maths today!
[1:26:56] fragglemeat: bedrock cake -- dentists hate it!
[1:27:18] Obumormcichant: (goes off to grab a snack…)

[1:27:23] Ji_the_Bee: place is one, eat is another
[1:27:26] Lyarrah: stackable cake and big salmon = best bedrock features
[1:27:36] EvilShadoww: the cake was waxed
[1:27:39] LordThaddius: Coming into a stream to "I did my fair share of cake ..." is more concerning then it should be.
[1:27:40] capsicaprimero: talking baout cake, i need to get flour
[1:27:41] buzzie107: @pixlriffs cake is a lie
[1:27:41] GingerTheLily: Big salmon?
[1:27:44] johndrinkwater: cake staircases .. kinda need waxed cakes to stop snack accidents making them unclimbable
[1:27:44] Techdawg77: @poisso3 and that was only a quarter inch of ice. folks lost their minds
[1:27:48] poisso3: Empire Series 1...Lizzy made everyone only eat cake

[1:28:00] Lyarrah: @GingerTheLily fish are a variety of sizes
[1:28:03] GingerTheLily: Oooh I love Ginger bread!
[1:28:05] 1MiniGinger: No I don't want to be bread
[1:28:18] GingerTheLily: @Lyarrah oh interesting! I had not heard that before
[1:28:21] Rob_42: I have Ninja cookie cutters,  so when I make Gingerbread, we call it  "Ninjabread"   @Pixlriffs
[1:28:28] vikingmama901: I have my Grammy's gingerbread recipe. It's not Christmas without it

[1:28:50] Prideceratops: I have dinosaur cookie cutters for gingerbread cookies, but I don't have a triceratops yet pridec3Sob
[1:28:53] rathgar1843: yep, i ddidn't have any ginger bread persons for the holidays\
[1:29:09] 1MiniGinger: @NoMouseCatGaming I'm definitely not purebread. My parents were both brunettes.
[1:29:12] nitro5hooter: Nothing beats some Yorkshire parkin
[1:29:18] poisso3: I love gingerbread...but it is only a Christmas season item here in Germany
[1:29:20] VoidedMirror: I appreciate how the parity between Java and Bedrock has led to new developments like the size attributes and other things being added
[1:29:35] brett_lieffers: <— ginger, not bread
[1:29:38] NoMouseCatGaming: Lol my dad was ginger in his youth. So I'm halfbread
[1:29:39] RageKitsukii: guess what? 🐴 🍑
[1:29:39] TiniSpicy: it's just a lil honse
[1:29:50] Prideceratops: I bit like a spice cake, but ginger?
[1:30:03] capsicaprimero: sounds like an interesting type of gingerbread/cake
[1:30:04] poisso3: I know what you mean, @Pixlriffs
[1:30:14] mitchmethinks: ginger molasse cookies are great too in the winter months
[1:30:28] dab2014: Now you all are making me hungry 😋

[1:30:56] GingerTheLily: @poisso3 I love the german spice  cookies, even if I can't spell them!

[1:32:57] NoMouseCatGaming: Tip I learned - dip American biscuits in soup and thank me later
[1:32:57] Prideceratops: @1MiniGinger Don't have any gravy, I typically make sausage and/or bacon, egg and cheese biscuits for the week and freeze them
[1:33:18] TiniSpicy: bacon pankakes GivePLZ
[1:33:18] poisso3: @GingerTheLily During the christmas season, you can find KitKat with speculaas cookies

[1:34:41] 1MiniGinger: @Prideceratops A good old fashioned Southern sausage gravy biscuit is probably just about the best
[1:34:43] NoMouseCatGaming: Is that a Mythical Sausage thing? Mythical Kitchen.
[1:34:45] Prideceratops: Such an interesting show. Some very interesting perspectives
[1:34:55] begaydocrime2: Hey I just started watching Mythical Kitchen!
[1:34:59] GingerTheLily: @NoMouseCatGaming LOL, sounds like it should be :D
[1:35:02] Prideceratops: @NoMouseCatGaming Nah, it's an extension of Good Mythical Morning
[1:35:05] BrokenPhysics13: i remember there was this elderly woman who's secret to living so long was essentially refusing to die
[1:35:17] capsicaprimero: i'm sure gordon is nowhere near as aggressive outside the iconic show
[1:35:25] EvilShadoww: and sausage is a food item afterall
[1:35:32] NoMouseCatGaming: Is Good Mythical Morning a Mythical Sausage thing?
[1:35:49] poisso3: Mythical Kitchen would have to issue a scream warning if Mythical Sausage was on the show
[1:35:57] 1MiniGinger: Gordon Ramsey with kids is just about the sweetest
[1:36:03] RageKitsukii: all Mythical™ things are property of Sausage now
[1:36:17] rosette_prism: @poisso3 lol
[1:36:20] Prideceratops: I don't know if Sausage is any louder than the rest of the Mythical Kitchen cast lol They are equally bonkers
[1:36:21] BrokenPhysics13: i love watching the clips of Gordon Ramsay with kids vs adults
[1:36:22] GingerTheLily: @rosette_prism Hello and welcome in!
[1:36:29] rathgar1843: discipline
[1:36:33] Axynim: Gordon Ramsay absolutely blew my mind on MasterChef when he prepped a chicken blindfolded.
[1:36:38] shanesunil: Obviously, Gordon is only mean on Hell's Kitchen because the contestants are supposed to be professional chefs and can't even cook scallops properly somehow

[1:37:26] shanesunil: @GingerTheLily I have see that, that clip is so worth watching
[1:37:26] rosette_prism: @shanesunil also it’s an American show, it’s good for rating. apparently he is more chill on BRT
[1:37:33] WinnyTFord: @GingerTheLily Where is my towel
[1:37:37] 1MiniGinger: He's even sweet with adults when they're upset but didn't do anything wrong. There was one clip with a girl who got burned because of another person's mistake and he was really good with her.

[1:46:03] shanesunil: I don't know if you've answered this or not - but are you going to dig a huge hole underneath the floating island?
[1:46:14] AbsentNyx: I think I just can't be bothered to look for every piece when they fall in weird places HypeLUL
[1:46:15] capsicaprimero: at least the scaffolding is biodegradeable

[1:47:46] CattopyTheWeb: Hi Pix, can I ask why you building a floating island?
[1:48:02] Prideceratops: EnAHAnce?

[1:49:42] GingerTheLily: I jjust have this urge to build stuff....

[1:49:44] TheDruidJenn: reasons buttonShrug
[1:49:46] capsicaprimero: @BrokenPhysics13  i've l iterally built a pop up cabin just cuz the view i could get from the window.
[1:49:48] gamingnscience: do you think Etho would fill in the whole island? ;)
[1:50:10] Axynim: @gamingnscience He wouldn't build a hollow rock. He'd build the inside and leave the rock to your imagination
[1:50:22] GingerTheLily: @gamingnscience Etho is a mythic wizard.... us mere mortals cannot emulate him
[1:50:39] Valois_Fulcanelli: @gamingnscience Bdubs stage whisper: "Don't tell Etho!"
[1:50:39] ProphetOPossum: Its true, he likes making insides before the build XD
[1:50:50] CattopyTheWeb: What aha refence? I didn't hear sorry
[1:50:50] RageKitsukii: I would fill the rock with lava

[1:51:49] CattopyTheWeb: @ragekitsukii it would be a cheese fondue lol
[1:52:01] rosette_prism: @ragekitsukii hmm if you were to make a cobblestone generator to fill the inside it would fulfill the etho fill and be time efficient

[1:56:08] TiniSpicy: i kinda like that its different
