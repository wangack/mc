[1:03:57] Normalguy2424: I have those glasses that change into sunglasses when I'm outside, they're so cool Peepi

[1:06:43] Amandroid: @OmIAm ellyyBearNOTED

Funny thing was though the chickens here could talk, they offered me one of their eggs as a trade for me to return and read the harry potter series aloud to them

[7:34:52] lovely_beez: !porkchops @To_Wheezy
[7:34:52] StreamElements: Cooked pork is 0.4 more 🍗 "food points" than golden carrots, which = sprinting 4 blocks, 2 sprint jumps, or digging 80 blocks. If you eat because you can't run, to become full you would need 3 golden carrots but only 2 porkchops, which would save you  1.61 seconds of eating time and 1 food slot linkzzeyNoted Cooked pork is a cheaper villager trade as well linkzzeyClass
