[0:20:21] x_Dark_Rider_x: @Sevrene it actually isn't as good for your sleep as you think. Your body is in a lighter sleep when drinking, so you don't get as recharged.
[0:20:23] jmm548: not sleeping that would be awesome

[0:21:43] jmm548: not having to eat dont mean u cant eat
[0:21:44] EMTaylor1: the half measure would be a pill that gives all nutrients, but like in spy kids can also be microwaved into a full meal when wanted
[0:21:50] Sevrene: I mean removing the need for sleep adds SO much time that finding time to cook/eat is simple
[0:21:52] CATPOOPslurper: the weekend automatically ends and it's monday

[1:00:34] alexandercuna: im not the hugest fan of runescape but league is refreshing
[1:00:35] kyanpeppaa: I think its because the majority of the budget was used at the end of last year tbh, and the  majority of the project was most likely finished and ready, but delayed because of GIM
[1:00:37] xindianx: it gives me about 3-4 weeks of solid osrs playing and that satisfies me until the next league
[1:00:57] brymstax: what is he working on rn?
[1:01:05] bagamas: same
[1:01:06] Xealgushel: walker gang ? XD

[1:01:19] TheLimitlessOne: Ooh what if we make a new RuneScape so it’s like old RuneScape but with a new way to play 4Head
[1:01:20] wonly: well they added tasks and such maybe they went over budget on the content creation and took it out of marketing hoping the people would talk
[1:01:24] CATPOOPslurper: 3Head
[1:01:58] Xealgushel: i think the problem wasn't the mechanic but the unbalance of the relics
[1:02:24] kyanpeppaa: they didn't tweet last year when it was going live until 6 hours prior

[1:03:07] xindianx: It is tough, just like you said though, if you don't have insane in-game knowledge, you can't possibly think of how good or bad something will be.

[1:26:59] Frankenstain: but you're being nice to the chickens
[1:27:01] HQuinnch_tv: my eggs are almost 3 dollars.
[1:27:03] CATPOOPslurper: raptors rising up monkaGun
[1:27:04] slumberproject: Free range just tastes better.

[1:27:09] InTheLittlePro: free range was like 9 sqft per chicken
[1:27:09] Jorannnxd: just buy two chickens for 10$ each :D
[1:27:11] Houdini_Seven: Next time Buy a Chicken :)
[1:27:12] The1_TS: Free range is pretty normal egg in EU.

[1:27:41] Deepcast: we just call them chicken eggs here
[1:27:48] robbbbb_71: Fun fact, there is no legal definition for "free range" or "pasture raised" so you're never really sure what you're actually getting
[1:27:50] omegadan_: the farmhouses have no light, and they remove the beaks off of all the chickens , bc otherwise they peck each other to death
[1:27:51] Squatting_Duck: free range
[1:27:55] CATPOOPslurper: those vids of chickens killing mice monkaX
[1:27:59] VaultPls: @Giantwaffle sometimes you can actually reach out to the farm to get your eggs direct
[1:28:05] The1_TS: @nilau, but standard at many supermarkets which helps us as consumers.
[1:28:10] theplummer92: They can’t even stand cause of so many steroids
[1:28:12] maxdopamin: @PostSuper i believe free range chickens are released once a day, other chickens always sit in their cage
[1:28:19] AdversityHQ: being in the farmhouse type building helps keep diseases out
[1:28:29] Nilau: @the1_ts yea true, its very nicely labeled etc

[1:44:40] alexandercuna: hype
[1:44:45] IamWambo_: I had the same issue it was nvidia driver
[1:44:45] iTents: My only issue with Windows 11 is that they removed Snipping Tools
[1:44:46] HQuinnch_tv: updating to windows 12 fixes the issues. Kappa
[1:44:47] Immp: That sounds more like a DirectX issue than a Windows 11 issue @Merc_The_Jerk
[1:44:47] Wynja: Doesn't have to be identical ofc, but the bottom things on the short end are supposed to be slabs not stairs I think
[1:45:01] EnergyCrow: is windows 11 worth it? i got the upgrade recommendation this mornin -.-

[1:45:54] dennixfailalot: stonks
[1:45:59] iTents: @KingYou123 Unsure, now you have to do a focused print scrin with Windows Key, Shift, and S then paste it into paint. They removed the native application that allowed for snipping to PNG
[1:46:00] RodriCraft93: missing a few chains
[1:46:03] ThatOnneGuy: wouldn't it float

[1:47:24] Arby_52: make the well go to bedrock PauseChamp
[1:47:32] Larklen: can you see bottom of well?
[1:47:46] HQuinnch_tv: @Giantwaffle  can you make something that looks like a crank to lower the cauldron?
[1:47:48] KingYou123: @Giantwaffle do you ever wonder how much productivity you take from employees from people watching your stream while at work?
[1:47:48] iTents: @TheKnopex You can't hit start and open snipping tools anymore  sadly, unless I'm missing an update that re-added it
[1:47:51] Larklen: If so, maybe could do the same technique they use for quarry to give it that 'darkening' effect
[1:47:53] Official_Hype: put lights above the bucket?
[1:47:57] Modal_1: Will you ever play COTD again?
[1:48:04] Larklen: I think that'd look dope, yeah

[1:50:55] Larklen: @73udz you should be able to go to the snipping tool, settings, and then toggle "Save Snips" - sstill not the as good as it was, but should be a workaround for you for now

[1:51:46] iTents: @TheKnopex Just having it on your clipboard is just a focused printscreen, snipping tools should allow you to save it from the application like it use to
