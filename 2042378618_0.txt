[2:33:45] actual_supernova: hbomb94LUL￼ hbomb94LUL
[2:33:45] vadskamanta: I mean maybe also a fair shot being solo rn
[2:33:50] ohheyitsfi: that'll draw people there, risky NODDERS
[2:33:51] vadskamanta: to not go
[2:33:52] outratriz: i'm so lost does this game only ends when there's only one team left? and why being 93 is good?
[2:33:58] citishea: Teams might go there to kill people. Maybe friends but also foes
[2:34:01] d4v1d04927: Where is George ?
[2:34:05] cristhian_andrades: you can do it
[2:34:14] stancat4: only 1 person survives
[2:34:14] larsmarona: @d4v1d04927 Deadg
[2:34:14] AquaBlaze_XP: @d4v1d04927 dead ;-;
[2:34:15] n0m1___: @d4v1d04927 he's died
[2:34:17] auddini: @d4v1d04927 he died
[2:34:19] coinmuncher64: @d4v1d04927 he died

[2:34:37] floor_flowers: pvp is still on right?
[2:34:37] tilted_tow3rs: It's just you and whiskey ig
[2:34:40] maryandWine: im sorry but did feinberg also d worded???
[2:34:45] monicat6: TR still shows H as Feinbergs ally
[2:34:50] clavvdiaa: @ayla_nl its TOO peaceful
[2:34:50] vadskamanta: @outratriz it ends where there's only 1 player left, they have to betray their alliances. 93 is good because H wasn't killed with 94 players left (since his name has 94 in it)
[2:34:53] Qu33nAlex: @maryandWine nah
[2:34:55] samwich1991: @maryandWine no, the alliance dissolved when george unalived

[2:35:27] samwich1991: that still makes no sense to me but alas
[2:35:27] tilted_tow3rs: Damn ngl George had no chance against shadoune and cisgreen alone
[2:35:31] maryandWine: @samwich1991  oh so he like left his team or?
