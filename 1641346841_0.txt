[1:10:54] Chipongo: this map is aesthetically pleasing
[1:10:57] DX_Plates: Not Camo
[1:11:00] WDForty: not exact middle, slightly to the left or right

[1:12:02] warmwalrus: yup just do the chain sniper
[1:12:03] WDForty: a 502 basic monkey does amazing on this map because because he throws spike balls that split and bounce off walls, so it ping pongs all over inside
[1:12:08] Addrax: the village would go great in the center...
[1:12:08] jmm548: next to tacc shooters
[1:12:16] akawicked: sell take onthe left and put hit, and before you up grade, put the tac back

[1:19:47] Ebucel: isn't there a monkey that removes camo
[1:19:49] CoolReal: Delete one of the tacks for a village may be worth
[1:19:56] ManVS1ife: @Giantwaffle there should be enough space for a village if you replace one of the other tack shooters
[1:20:05] CiVR: popCat

[3:55:31] Dodara87: !modpack
[3:55:31] Moobot: Try one of these: !mc_modpack ー !factorio ー !bestmod ー !ksp ー !rimworld
[3:55:43] Dizz1227: you can hammer compressed cobble, gravel, etc
[3:55:48] Apparentthreat: that's not dust
[3:55:49] Smithii: Only sand
[3:55:52] lunar_ish: read the quest

[3:56:04] Xezzive: can you still compress amd hammer ?
[3:56:07] maimvice13: and do it
[3:56:08] scssquatch: you can probably compact it first, at least you could do that with atm skyblock
[3:56:13] EZL1190: That's sand not dust... Can't you compact first?
[3:56:14] weightmaker: you cna compress it for faster hammering
[3:56:38] ninopanda: you can also compress the cobble
[3:56:41] JaegerPls: The preset rewards just reduce some of the tedious work imo
[3:56:43] TheAssailer: Chance cubes should be progression based, reward only already know things.
[3:56:44] lunar_ish: it told you how to get the seeds
[3:57:13] miszczpz: guys how to change how many blocks Im mining? ("veinminer")
[3:57:16] Asneakyninja1: ive heard a lot saying it should be based on the player's progression in a pack
[3:57:17] Aeniv_: or tiered chance cubes
[3:57:21] Drogreden: there should be different levels of chancecubes
[3:57:23] Asneakyninja1: NOTED
[3:57:24] rawbits: is that a new skin?
[3:57:27] CorSPACE: chance cubes only belong in youtuber modpacks KEKW
[3:57:32] Aeniv_: ye but more tiers
[3:57:37] ens_maxine: or a nuke
[3:57:40] Etwas77: atom bomb as a reward
[3:57:43] Dizz1227: I feel like since the rewards from FTB quests can be customized, that it should be doable in a similar way it is now, just need to teir the rewards
[3:57:49] daemonaedryn: I guess it depends on the modpack, some modpacks are insane and netherite could be starting gear LUL
[3:57:49] Moobot: You can sub to Waffle by clicking this neat link -> twitch.tv/giantwaffle/subscribe SUBprise
[3:57:53] rickthe_punk: @CorSPACE this

[3:58:00] Pointern: Chancecube twitch integration.. every 10 subs randomly spawns a chancecube :D

[3:59:13] Etwas77: so dig in one direction?
[3:59:16] Immp: Lush Caves, Then Nether, then The End, then "Boss Dungeon" area
[3:59:17] thebodge: I love progress through the early levels of any game. The gains are  more meaningful.
[3:59:19] Linkitch: huh, interesting approach to the progression.
[3:59:21] DrWiz_rd: there are different types the lower you go too

[3:59:28] hellolilpiggy: @Slowpoke101 why is there no fast leaf decay?
[3:59:36] Slowpoke101: server performance
[3:59:37] EvergreenMoth8: @WalrusPug ATM is less quest based and more exploring mods in general
[3:59:41] Morelyn: andesite is up down, the outer stone ring is mining area
[3:59:43] Warkless: ppOverheat
[3:59:43] hellolilpiggy: makes sense
[3:59:43] Slowpoke101: and you can vein mine leaves
[3:59:53] NephilimXS: is this on FTBs launcher?
[3:59:55] TankMonkey55: SB2 had to mine to the roof to tp to mining dimension no ores in overworld
[4:00:01] EvergreenMoth8: there /are/ some quests and progression in ATM but not a questline to follow
[4:00:04] Slowpoke101: no
[4:00:06] Immp: Yup @NephilimXS
[4:00:07] Dizz1227: not a pickaxe
[4:00:10] LatHund: not pick

[4:01:03] CorSPACE: leveling is an addon mod
[4:01:14] Morelyn: but you can add a few extra slots for modifiers if you find the right stuff
[4:01:23] EvergreenMoth8: @WalrusPug most FTB modpacks have proper questlines and progression so if thats your playstyle look for FTB modpacks or things like skyblock/skyfactory
[4:01:25] Changeturn1: use crook on leaves
[4:01:29] DarkbuilderX: Tetra is the one with levelling by default

[4:07:21] RoyalHares: @FlammAlpha, if you're having that issue, use less water next time
[4:07:24] daemonaedryn: Not for stone right?

[4:07:45] ninopanda: @Yiib yes
[4:08:00] FauxNoodel: @Varney89 rice is so much better from a rice cooker, plus you can turn it on and forget it - and they keep it warm for getting 2nds - and then just save any leftovers and fry it up next day
[4:08:06] Kilowatt31: @xavier2119 didn't the hammer used to mine in a 3x3?
[4:08:14] WalrusPug: @Slowpoke101 or if you dont want to spend attention on the rice
[4:08:14] DX_Plates: @Yiib If you are totally new to mod packs I would do FTB Academy first.

[4:25:03] GalaxyMonkeyy: doesnt use the stairs
[4:25:04] OrangeW2: personally disagree with esports being a valid career IMO
[4:25:05] Giirraf: teaching LoL? You mean teach them how to flame?

[4:25:18] chaoskub: @EvergreenMoth8 I meant for the andesite lol
[4:25:22] FauxNoodel: @Egrassa22 how much do the players actually make tho - they're pretty much all owned teams, i doubt the players get a huge chunk, they're probably on a salary w/bonuses
[4:25:25] ok_juju: !bestmod
[4:25:26] RighteousBru: do you disagree with normal sports being a career OrangeW2 ?
[4:25:27] Moobot: Ninopanda thinks he's the best, but it's really Firstnecron.
[4:25:29] SongOfDurin: I miss no beard @Giantwaffle
[4:25:31] DrHax_: Probably teaching them meditation or something KEKW
[4:25:33] awesomefreak72: slur only

[4:25:42] ninopanda: punches moobot
[4:25:43] MrGuwee: i tried 2 times streaming...both failed ... u also have a huge advantage being a native english speaker
[4:25:47] OrangeW2: @RighteousBru not necessarily sports in general because of the wide berth of sports, but esports is still really niche in terms of the mainstream
[4:25:50] Acarea: do you still have your vanilla megabuild server? the water temple @Giantwaffle
[4:25:53] tavcar: valorant is not as established as cs go but the tournament in brazil coming in feb is going to be crazy with over 30 teams worldwide
[4:25:57] Balefati: Its like the top 0.1% that make a living from a sport
[4:26:01] DX_Plates: @Slowpoke101 @Giantwaffle
[4:26:02] OrangeW2: + non-toplevel esports = legit zero money
[4:26:14] RighteousBru: how about chess OrangeW2 ?
[4:26:15] ninopanda: @OrangeW2 hey buddy
[4:26:18] Yemtron: I think the end goal of sports shouldn't be about being professional, learning to work in a team, communicate, deal with losses etc
[4:26:18] Dizz1227: Drawer for cobble?
[4:26:21] Slowpoke101: lol will he even see it
[4:26:32] DX_Plates: I tried Poke LUL
[4:26:34] That_Lurker: @Slowpoke101 Is it now in, or is it coming soon?
[4:26:38] T_Eggy: still fine to encourage competitive gameplay, sports are not for everyone
[4:26:41] TankMonkey55: @Giantwaffle middle mouse click sorts inventory
[4:26:43] FauxNoodel: Only 1.6% of college football players ever make it to the NFL, and it's already insanely difficult to get into college div1 ball. A lot of people don't realize just how difficult it is to get to that level.
[4:26:48] OrangeW2: @RighteousBru chess as a career? i mean, same deal with esports except worse because you're locking yourself into a single niche
[4:26:57] Jaydepps00: hasn't there been a study recently where they found out that basically playing games increases childrens problem solving skills and a bunch of other stuff
[4:27:00] OrangeW2: @ninopanda o/
[4:27:00] Tanz249: @giantwaffle would you ever be interested in playing the vault hunters mod pack?
[4:27:03] Slowpoke101: it might take a couple of days to add
[4:27:07] OrangeW2: chess has very little money yeah
[4:27:13] Slowpoke101: Magnus is a multi millionaire
[4:27:13] Varney89: poker
[4:27:13] Salerodis: there's no money in it outside of the champion im pretty sure
[4:27:14] T_Eggy: not if you have a butt plug
[4:27:15] lazyhot: One e-sport team is easy 20 people counting support team, times games ...  But for sure a select few can live on it.
[4:27:18] Yemtron: Unless you're world champ lol
[4:27:19] MrGuwee: Botez sisters though....
[4:27:21] Tickle_Me1: only country sponsered chess i think is livable
[4:27:22] Yemtron: good luck with that
[4:27:22] Giirraf: Chess is expensive to get into. Anal beads have been skyrocketing in price.
[4:27:23] ninopanda: @OrangeW2 how are you doing? having fun with VRDJ's?
[4:27:30] King_Ponto: The big change recently is seeing Collegiate Esports grow. If you can get partial or full rides through school from League or Rocket League ect. Then it is more reasonable to encourage it because the potential for benefitting you is way higher then just having a pro scene where .01% of players can make a living
[4:27:32] SolarQuak3: I'd imagine you would have to be top 10 world to make much of a living at it
[4:27:34] Slowpoke101: some of the top guys make good money teaching to
[4:27:34] Yemtron: @MrGuwee I'm sure people watch them because of chess.... KEKW
[4:27:35] RighteousBru: chess championships have small if nonexistent rewards, but there are abundant sponsorships
[4:27:35] tavcar: hikaru said only like top 20 make enough money to full time chess
[4:27:36] Allmostdone: unless you are getting sued
[4:27:39] OrangeW2: @ninopanda relaxing atm, vibing, very busy with uni now

[4:27:45] MrGuwee: @Yemtron  KEKW
[4:27:46] Twin5un: is this another INSANE mod pack or is it a bit less crazy than Kappa
[4:27:46] CurlySC: CurlySC subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 29 months! oooo sheeeesh COCKwheel
[4:27:46] Lord_Maximus55: just start chess beat magnus, get called out for using a vibrator to cheat and then sue lol
[4:27:48] livanrar: Yeah but the only place where they play American Football is North America, other sports are more global
[4:27:48] snorrow92: @MrGuwee thats money because of streaming, not because of chess
[4:27:49] ThatOnneGuy: I'm pretty sure professional gamblers only pull a profit if they've got hella sponsors, even at the top ranks
[4:27:50] Lenny1130: omg i remember you syaing yesterday the last thing you need right now is a MC modpack. here we are though lmao @Giantwaffle
[4:27:50] funnyc4t: I'm to old to learn new mods like Create, I miss my 1.12.2 mods LUL
[4:27:52] GFQPR1882: There is money if u have a butt plug and win everything LUL
[4:27:52] MadBadHare: Not all Pro sports get you wealthy as well - Depends on the sport
[4:27:53] CurlySC: COGGERS

[4:28:12] Etwas77: if you are in the top 20 your life is chess
[4:28:15] TheRealFaithLezz: @GFQPR1882 Thats a different sport KEKW
[4:28:18] necrosisdemise: @giantwaffle what tips would you give young you who was just streaming?
[4:28:26] Loopy9999: for anyone watching markets, there's an interest rate announcement in 30 mins
[4:28:27] T_Eggy: I feel like everyone is saying the same thing but encouraging esports is totally fine which was Waffels point I believe
[4:28:47] JaegerPls: I thought you could put the crank on the mill?
[4:28:48] whoopTdo: did i miss pc build part 2?
[4:28:58] EllisVlad: EllisVlad subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 36 months! Ah, Minecraft.. Takes me back to the good ol' days you were diggng that huge sand/sea excavation way back in vanilla...
[4:29:03] Jaydepps00: most of it is charisma and consistency
[4:29:04] ThatOnneGuy: if you treat this as a career, you're more likely to get burned out before you get any traction
[4:29:04] Scojan: Starting as a content creator from the start on Twitch is horrible; Its the worst platform for discoverability
[4:29:04] Katie: i started 7 / 8 years ago now...kinda crazy to think about it
[4:29:08] Moobot: Try one of these: !mc_modpack ー !factorio ー !bestmod ー !ksp ー !rimworld

[4:29:16] Katie: It was my escape
[4:29:20] ninopanda: @Katie has it really been that long?!
[4:29:23] Dagmoo: trying to intentionally become a streamer is literally hitting the jackpot at this point
[4:29:26] RighteousBru: all in from the get go
[4:29:32] Katie: nino i'd have to check but yeah coming up on it
[4:29:36] Yemtron: I still am Susge at "friend"
[4:29:40] ninopanda: holy shit!!!
[4:29:41] DX_Plates: The reason you aren't making is most likey because you failed that RNG dice roll.
