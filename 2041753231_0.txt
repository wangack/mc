[1:41:26] jedi_iwakura: HypePopcorn
[1:41:30] Go_Wish: Mining a waystone gives you the fragments, right?
[1:42:05] Go_Wish: I think mining does too

[1:42:07] Moobot: Jordan has been streaming for: 1h 42m This command is on a timer and is posted every 2 minutes.
[1:42:17] Sarcasthicc_: so you gotta find a waystone to make more waystones?
[1:42:24] bawnorton: only one way to find out
[1:42:27] titinna: piston?
[1:42:42] TheNeverShow: Silk touch it Maybe?
[1:42:45] Captain__awsome: all those wither projectiles loading in LuL:
[1:42:48] Go_Wish: You mine your first one. And then you get a net positive by crushing.
[1:43:07] Go_Wish: Or, I guess you get a net positive by breaking as well.
[1:43:10] bawnorton: you get 6 shards from crushing
[1:43:11] 1010coolx: you get 1 extra frag from crush
[1:43:15] mtgwizerd: got 6, only need 5
[1:43:24] Merry_Pippin: You just need a lot of time mechanisms.
[1:43:37] DualAAaron: monkaMath
[1:43:40] bawnorton: even the extra things in this pack require an assembly line

[1:44:55] lewkis01: But how many waystones do you really need?
[1:45:05] Captain__awsome: how do you automate the crafting of the waystone?

[1:45:31] shooouk: @lewkis01 i hit the next chapter after  both chapter 4's and have been on break from the pack since then haha
[1:45:34] Go_Wish: You can probably manually craft the waystone and drop it in the crushing wheels. And have the crushing wheels just automatically feed into the warp stone process.

[2:20:57] Go_Wish: You shouldn't need to invert. You could just say not equals empty. Instead of equals full.
[2:20:57] culveerin: it ate all the netherite
[2:21:00] bawnorton: it ate the netherite
[2:21:01] bawnorton: lmao
[2:21:06] Merry_Pippin: It deleted it.
[2:21:09] Merry_Pippin: OOF
[2:21:19] ArohanRubyfall: netherite, yummy yummy
[2:21:25] bawnorton: mod dev did a "setStack" without checking if there was already a stack there
[2:21:36] culveerin: it changes when activated
[2:21:37] Captain__awsome: CookieMM nehterite
[2:21:50] Merry_Pippin: It didn't use it for other purposes or to optimize another machine, it was deleted.
[2:22:00] bawnorton: this would be a valid /give
[2:22:03] Supercat_14: LootBugOvO lootbug moment
[2:22:16] Go_Wish: You can invert in the logic programmer. Right? By saying "nbt != empty"?

[2:24:56] LabGirl1990: you read it with nederith in
[2:25:49] CoolsitesChris: use a block reader to check the middle slot is empty, then use a choic variable card to decide whether to give it a netherite or a blank item. the choice card uses 3 variable cards, the first one will be the middle slot is empty card, the second is the netherite bar item card, the third is a blank item card. place chice card in to item export.
[2:26:01] culveerin: you re-did what you did earlier
[2:26:07] culveerin: with the netherite in it
[2:26:10] arcanajinx: Peter is slowly falling into the abyss of Create
[2:26:14] Go_Wish: I think you want the nbt to be while it is empty. You just created the same thing you had.

[2:32:03] culveerin: probably in one of the other 2s inventory
[2:32:04] Captain__awsome: @real_davemiller i am 3 men
[2:32:06] Go_Wish: It is a good thing the forge is not picky about blocks in the multi block.
[2:32:12] Tip11000: so you loose one netherite each time
[2:32:22] real_davemiller: @Captain__awsome just like me frfr
[2:32:36] culveerin: use a wrench to disconnect
[2:32:36] Captain__awsome: its fine to connect right?
[2:32:36] bawnorton: @Tip11000 that is the one for the recipe, he had 4 netherite for testing, he now has 1 stella and 3 netherite
