[1:10:55] SirChaosS: since i've been gone for a while, can i ask the dumb question: WHY are we building a mega-giant lava farm --of doom?
[1:10:57] brawlin_mando: That sounds like a Daequan and Hamlinz move
[1:10:58] MGWilsonz: @Goode_Cheeseburgers by that logic the mermaids are cows

[1:12:20] SirChaosS: @flyingQtip "...ain't got a cow. --got a bull, though."
[1:12:23] AmpsV2: This might be a dumb questions but why do you need the sand wall for the lava?
[1:12:33] goudacheeseburgers: @MGWilsonz hahahahaha
[1:12:35] XyZ_Snoopy: My friend Azrian sent me to this twitch link, I’m enjoying it!

[1:15:02] BornNaked2: I thought the writing was "Written on the subway walls... and tennement halls" VIBE
[1:15:08] 4tw0ne: tell her to put more cloths on, they are for keeping warm :)
[1:15:12] AmpsV2: balls hot so remove socks? Stare
[1:15:12] flyingQtip: it happens
[1:15:16] SylverSword_: Not the grippers
[1:15:20] brawlin_mando: Electric cars were doomed from the beginning. I just don't see how people could not forsee what would happen. Toyota did it right with the prius hybrid. It gets 50mpg amd is a hybrid. The battery cells can be replaced individually for not much money
[1:15:35] SirChaosS: @BornNaked2 that would be "the words of the prophets"
[1:15:38] slackertron: @4tw0ne imagine asking a woman to put on more clothes...smh
[1:15:39] 4tw0ne: AmpsV2 he mightve been referring to Ball-socks MiniK
[1:15:40] goudacheeseburgers: @brawlin_mando the climate agenda is doomed from the start
[1:15:51] AmpsV2: @4tw0ne Kappa

[1:15:57] yakefromstatefarm: Toyotas hybrids are so sick, theyve done a great job with them

[1:16:07] Sullie_here: It's not LUL
[1:16:07] sberock: Reject eletric cars, embrace Flinstons cars
[1:16:10] Azrian_: electric cars are good just not now
[1:16:15] infxmhc2: We need infrastructure first.
[1:16:17] BornNaked2: @SirChaosS :D Ahh yeah, I forgot that part
[1:16:21] jerrythomas55: lithium is such a cheap and simple resource. as long as slavery exists
[1:16:25] Hamparty: own a house? OMEGALUL retirement? OMEGALUL
[1:16:28] KingofJankTV: Just goes to show you--the idiots in charge in DC OWN the media.
[1:16:28] StardustDragon08: @brawlin_mando Hybrids made the most sense to push. Not disrupting too many people's daily lives, can use the MPG as an advert to get people to convert.
[1:16:29] AmpsV2: My stocks are doing good but my bank account is not LUL
[1:16:33] KingofJankTV: If you say otherwise, you're a sheep

[1:16:41] Idifee: I'll never retire
[1:16:41] HammyInTheWall: I live in a large apartment complex with 3 huge buildings. We have ONE charging station and I watch all the electric car owners fight over it constantly
[1:16:42] goudacheeseburgers: just print money.... its no problem... no repercussions
[1:16:43] BSSwakeless: My dad still hasn't gotten milk. It's been 19 years
[1:16:46] SirChaosS: @brawlin_mando i don't see why car manufacturers haven't gone the same route as locomotives. just make the gas engine an altermator (basically) and use electric traction motors.
[1:16:47] Cybernetic_Overlord: A house? Retirement? Social Security? You're hilarious
[1:16:49] seppm: you only see tesla now in denmark
[1:16:55] FindGaryBusey_: mock. YEAH.
[1:16:56] brawlin_mando: Hybrids are the best way to go.
[1:16:57] SummitSummit: I've seen two new EV Hummers this week.
[1:17:15] skeptium: 18% of total auto sales in 2023 was elctric
[1:17:20] flyingQtip: lithium STONKS
[1:17:23] pastastu: They take out food prices in a lot of calculations they make about inflation. Seems peculiar

[1:17:37] BubbaGhanoushVG: I still don't see how this farm is going to work
[1:17:37] Hamparty: @Goode_Cheeseburgers start a bank, create money via loans PepoG
[1:17:38] SirChaosS: @JonBams bigger flex? EV "hummer" or amphibious Hummer?
[1:17:40] brawlin_mando: How the hell did they expect farmers to farm with all electric equipment?
[1:17:42] MGWilsonz: did you hear about Raptors having to be towed because the cars computer couldn't download an update?
[1:17:43] JayoRed: ill have you know my 5 year old heard you and said to tell you he has a tesla lamborghini
[1:17:51] goudacheeseburgers: Imagine believing Mainstream media LMAO
[1:17:56] jerrythomas55: but we planted trees…
[1:17:57] SummitSummit: Oh, Jon, hey Jon, before break you said something about "new Twitch SCAM" were you speaking nonsense?  Or is there news?
[1:18:04] arebenji: TSLA puts paid out nicely
[1:18:07] Tree__Fitty: Ford lost billions on ev's and the head of Toyota said EV is not in their future
[1:18:09] flyingQtip: Spaced out poly user Karen
[1:18:09] 4tw0ne: wonder if mojang ever plans to turn on lava spread by default bamThink
[1:18:14] FscTrey215: bamBang TwitchConHYPE
[1:18:17] Sullie_here: They aren't even painting/clearcoating the cyber trucks. Instant rust bucket. idk why anyone would invest in that
[1:18:21] KingofJankTV: Prediction: Trump wins (somehow avoids being murdered) and the truth of the economy comes out.  The legacy media blames him for it despite it being the house of cards Biden and Pelosi have built.  So predictable.
[1:18:26] thecookiefox1: !today

[1:18:34] slackertron: a right winger that makes fun of leftist, who makes a product only leftist buy, and wonders why its not going great lol
[1:18:35] arebenji: I'll buy some TSLA at $125...
[1:18:37] Idifee: @jerrythomas55 we could use natural gas from dairy farms PauseChamp
[1:18:40] jerrythomas55: @sullie_here well, it’s stainless steel

[1:18:55] StardustDragon08: Still beats race cars! bamKEK
[1:18:56] goudacheeseburgers: @Hamparty yes. but to do that you need to create fake unidegrees like for Pokemon inclusivity  and such
[1:18:58] yakefromstatefarm: i work in the power transmission industry, we cant go to EVs or the grid is going down
[1:19:03] slackertron: and if you tow with it, it has a 90 mile range lol
[1:19:04] jsom_23: Power Wheels entering the EV game when??
[1:19:05] JayoRed: man said "CAN HE HEAR ME?!" lmaoooo i love messing with my kids EZ
[1:19:06] Sullie_here: @jerrythomas55 I am a professional welder... Not all stainless is actually rust proof.
[1:19:08] DeePick: that's not what it was made for

[1:19:43] brawlin_mando: If it I'd Aluminum or stainless steel does not really need paint. You can just buff it out
[1:19:43] DeePick: @Idifee genttSalute
[1:19:52] SirChaosS: @JonBams since i've been gone for a while, can i ask the dumb question: WHY are we building a mega-giant lava farm --of doom?
[1:19:53] arebenji: Oh yeah, well my Hummer is RPG proof.
[1:19:56] StardustDragon08: @yakefromstatefarm I know someone that works in the electric utility business, he also says there is no way our grid can handle it
[1:20:00] BSSwakeless: Just wait till cops use the cyber truck and their battery dies in a high speed pursuit
[1:20:04] Hamparty: @Goode_Cheeseburgers NODDERS
[1:20:04] Texas_flaco: I can’t wait to see a cyber truck in a cartel flex vid!!🤣🤣
[1:20:04] brawlin_mando: We're DeLoreans painted?
[1:20:08] MrSelenix: i think i read somewhere the other day that if the whole UK transitioned over to EV cars all at once, the country would need like 70% of the worlds lithium and cobalt supply or some shit lik ehtta
[1:20:09] jerrythomas55: @sullie_here did you pee on it?

[1:20:26] lightningequus: i feel bad for ev owners. the battree and charging stations can’t handle winter, leaving them stranded.
[1:20:30] Sullie_here: @jerrythomas55 Peeing will make it rust very fast KEKW

[1:20:49] yakefromstatefarm: @StardustDragon08 i mean, its great job security for me, but between EVs and data centers the wires are gonna be melting
[1:20:51] shotty88: Very few DeLoreans were painted.
[1:20:51] SirChaosS: @brawlin_mando DeLoreans are stainless steel, it takes a special expensive paint to paint them, but it "CAN" be done
[1:20:52] Sullie_here: EV in cold weather get no distance YEP
[1:20:56] goudacheeseburgers: @Hamparty I feel bad for those that can't see all this bs right in front of their eyes
[1:21:01] ytbtank: THEY GOT A EV DELORAN.. NO MEMES
[1:21:03] Krat_Arona: Hybrids are a happy medium until they can figure out the cold issues for full EVs
[1:21:04] skeptium: @lightningequus wdym?

[1:21:18] brawlin_mando: I watched a video of a bunch of guys shooting up a first Gen Hummer and they were abke to get it to run amd drive afterwards
[1:21:19] Sullie_here: Electric cars were around before gas powered cars. I wonder why gas won KEKW

[1:21:40] Idifee: @sullie_here big oil has entered the chat
[1:21:41] Hamparty: evs are cool and all but the sound of a v8 or a car revving to 8k rpm sounds so amazing, but i am also KKona KEKW
[1:21:51] flyingQtip: we have all been fucked

[1:21:53] earth295: LMAO a subscription to start the car would be wild
[1:21:55] brawlin_mando: But, my wife is in labor! I need to go now
[1:21:58] ShreddaDave: False: You dont NEED to warm up your battery in a Tesla unless you are using it in a performance mode.
[1:22:02] StardustDragon08: @Hamparty remember when they tried to mimic mustang sounds for the mustang mach e bamKEK
[1:22:05] goudacheeseburgers: bend over chat .... get fucked LMAO
[1:22:06] infxmhc2: It's like big diesel engines that have block warmers LUL
[1:22:06] BornNaked2: @MrSelenix NODDERS Yeah thats a huge issue we still dont have a viable solution for. Deep sea mining is one of the ways they plan to extract more of those rare metals.
[1:22:07] Hamparty: @Goode_Cheeseburgers Sadge but true
[1:22:07] Idifee: Imagine trying to use an EV in minus 40 degrees
[1:22:14] Wacncox: It's ok global warming will have the death warmed up in 20000 years you won't have to worry about that because of you guys driving gas cars LUL
[1:22:22] skeptium: @ShreddaDave dont bother bro
[1:22:22] Wacncox: Earth*

[1:22:29] ShreddaDave: False: You dont NEED to warm up your battery in a Tesla unless you are using it in a performance mode..
[1:22:30] KingofJankTV: Don't forget the twinikies at the gas station @JonBams
[1:22:33] slabstations: so much drip
[1:22:35] flyingQtip: i prefer an old car without all this new shit
[1:22:36] Sullie_here: @teeeohh Same
[1:22:41] PureSpider: wtf we live in norway and not a single time have we had to wait for anything to warm up, starting or charging danSgame
[1:22:54] Fletcher199224: True
[1:22:55] brawlin_mando: @tree__fitty  You talk shit about the government and your car drives you to the FBI.
[1:22:57] ShreddaDave: Battery tech has a higher cold start.
[1:22:58] ChiefShake: Plug a block heater to your batter
[1:23:00] LSWOTE: Tesla Cybertruck drag coefficient is 0.34, which is great for a truck of that size.
[1:23:01] infxmhc2: Fake nudes Kappa
[1:23:02] jerrythomas55: BY far, the best thing everyone could do for the environment, is to own an acre of land and plant trees on it. like 100 full grown trees offsets the average Americans carbon offset. @jonbams
[1:23:09] brawlin_mando: The batteries crystallize in the cold
[1:23:10] SirChaosS: and remember chat. electricity to power your air conditioners/heaters is BAD for the environment, but the electricity to charge your car is perfectly fine!
[1:23:10] jsom_23: they could just charge it with a portable usb battery pack, duh
[1:23:12] ytbtank: USES LIKE 6% TO WARM UP
[1:23:13] Hamparty: golden dansgame emote??? OMEGALUL
[1:23:14] PrincessVanellope: @JonBams hot fresh bamCoffee *clink* bamRITO
[1:23:16] Mevad_: Cheer200 I'm as big a dent head as the next person in chat.  That said, Elon's initial plan of luxury to common would have worked but it never hit the right price point for the typical American consumer.  I can buy a fully loaded honda accord for 10K less than a base model 3.  Instead of iterating on the consumer vehicle we got the Cyber Truck.
[1:23:17] teeeohh: Anyone who has lived in the winter understands the batteries are the weak point of your vehicle
[1:23:20] StardustDragon08: @jerrythomas55 And it could actually look nice
[1:23:25] ShreddaDave: Tesla batteries have COLD CRANK TECH

[1:24:07] ytbtank: UR RIGHT
[1:24:07] Sullie_here: Even if you put warming a battery aside. The cold weather will kill the battery and at the very least tank the distance available.

[1:28:56] PureSpider: @Goode_Cheeseburgers ah get that fuckin tin foil hat bullshit out of here dude, not interested in that conversation
[1:28:56] disciple5115: hybrids are the way to go until America improves the infrastructure
[1:28:57] Myloxl: I never got why hybrids ARENT the default. Like, electric for day to day use, diesel for long distance trips
[1:28:57] KingofJankTV: At the end of the day, humans (especially Americans) are too selfish to actually care enough to invest in EV's.  If the cost of living continues to be rediculously high, humans won't go out of their way to buy an EV to sAvE tHe EnVirOnMenT!  Relax Greta

[1:29:16] jerrythomas55: hydrogen is the future of inefficiency
[1:29:25] brawlin_mando: Prius has multiple small batteries and if one or 2 go out it is not that expensive to replace.
[1:29:32] flyingQtip: with -50
[1:29:37] PureSpider: @f1ght4yor1ght69 we literally own a renault and gonna buy a volvo soon igaShrug not ever have we even considered a tesla
[1:29:42] goudacheeseburgers: @PureSpider Smells like an agenda when the rich folk wanna play gods
[1:29:44] StardustDragon08: @KingofJankTV At the end of the day, EVs weren't ready yet are being pushed heavily. It's that simple
[1:29:47] Idifee: @jerrythomas55 CNG NODDERS

[1:30:20] ytbtank: BRO FARM SO BIG AND DUMB U CANT KEEP UP
[1:30:37] Saulted: tesla is a shit ton of laptop sized batteries built into packs, but the liability of servicing those packs is something they won't touch

[1:30:56] yakefromstatefarm: i saw there was a guy that got quoted like $60k cuz he scratched the BOTTOM OF HIS CAR because the tub and the battery pack are integrated
[1:31:12] DeePick: upsidedown bamboo
[1:31:13] Idifee: Saulted bamHH
[1:31:13] Phylazian: Does the dripstone make the stalactites underneath?
[1:31:18] goudacheeseburgers: @PureSpider i get why the sky is blue. Gases and particles in Earth's atmosphere scatter sunlight in all directions. Blue light is scattered more than other colors because it travels as shorter, smaller waves
[1:31:23] Phylazian: nvm
[1:31:35] Saulted: bamHello Idifee
[1:31:42] theCgamer1: evs are not the future if we don't do something fast about power generation we don't have anywhere close to the power capacity to replace all the verticals today
[1:31:47] PureSpider: @Goode_Cheeseburgers cool, then look up who's mainly responsible for why polio is not an issue anymore in modern day society, then talk to me again
[1:31:48] DeePick: i wear a diaper for that
[1:31:56] JayoRed: you should see a dr about dat

[1:32:26] raf_m3: hertz is selling their inventory of Tesla for cheap
[1:32:28] PureSpider: the population in the US is not dense enough for current gen EVs to work well
[1:32:28] flyingQtip: Augmented reality
[1:32:30] Sullie_here: Affordable and range are both huge misses in the EV market

[1:32:46] StardustDragon08: @Goode_Cheeseburgers Cause that proves what?

[1:32:51] PureSpider: fingers crossed for solid state batteries, or batteries not reliant on lithium much longer
[1:32:53] LostSoulNaM: Didnt VR need a generational leap for more than a decade?

[1:33:00] Myloxl: The only good use i've seen atm for AR is spatial mapping what parts of your floor you havent vacuumed yet

[1:33:11] Hamparty: microsofts AR helmets for the military seems nuts, but soldiers get sick a lot from my understanding
[1:33:12] flyingQtip: I saw this vid where AR people used it as a drug
[1:33:15] cmndrzander: the flying cars are coming along, the jetson one is very cool
[1:33:16] MrSelenix: i think apples can do both

[1:34:26] cmndrzander: the flying cars will change the world
