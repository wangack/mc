[1:50:27] Kacie_S101: “You can find Calcite in Minecraft in 2 places: deep underground within the amethyst geodes and on top of mountains in the stony peaks biome”
[1:51:04] Arago_0: 6 raiders from Arago82 have joined! 
[1:51:08] Kacie_S101: The pic I saw on Google has the calcite literally in a strip across the top

[1:54:22] rodg88: stops the copper changing colour
[1:54:22] HoboWith2Shotguns: I still reckon night vision potion + exploring the oceans is easier. Geodes are super obvious on the water bed
[1:55:27] Viaurora: tinkers construct + tc armory
[1:55:30] Kacie_S101: The ocean is a very viable option for calcite since you can just see the geodes as you go over them

[1:58:26] 3v1lc0w: peepoRiot
[1:58:50] Kacie_S101: Minecraft wiki lists calcite as being in the stony peaks so that’s my source :Z but also says it could be covered in snow but I agree with Alex about the oceans
[1:58:59] TheSidh: Rythian didn't mention tits for 2 hours peepoRiot

[1:59:38] Zedheadd: @Nova_Gaming42 care to elaborate
[1:59:45] 3v1lc0w: daveCheck

[2:00:27] 3v1lc0w: stony peaks at home
[2:00:28] Kacie_S101: It was surface level in streaks for the stony peaks and said it could be under snow but could be an unlucky spawn for the biome
[2:01:07] Kacie_S101: time for an ocean adventure c:
[2:02:01] 3v1lc0w: briony can't imagine
[2:02:36] byagoonacool: in geodes
[2:02:45] rodg88: if it’s a deep ocean you can just see the geodes
[2:02:45] HoboWith2Shotguns: on the bottom. you can see the geodes there that have formed
[2:02:46] byagoonacool: they're just easier to find underwater
[2:02:53] HoboWith2Shotguns: Make a night vision potion will help
[2:02:54] Viaurora: if you have a night vision potion you will be able to see the geodes from the surface
[2:03:07] Teacosy_: veryCat
[2:03:10] Kacie_S101: Geodes but much easier to see since you don’t have to mine to find them
[2:03:39] RedSnt: @3v1lc0w I'm still not sure how she's able to do comfort zone with aphantasia ggeeThink
[2:04:17] HoboWith2Shotguns: they are very easy to make - just a golden carrot is the reagent IIRC

[2:33:06] Kacie_S101: Yes
[2:33:16] rodg88: if Kirsty or Rythian have a waypoint for blazes, you should be able to press a button to “share” the waypoint so Briony can add it to her map.
[2:33:28] comunra: imagin having infinate 0 arrows
[2:33:41] Viaurora: you still need to kill more blazes to power the stand !

[2:36:23] GuillimanTT: why would we tell you, you'll only blame us later
[2:36:26] GuillimanTT: Madging
[2:36:28] 39SaltyCookies: Not lower than the sandstone
[2:36:29] SwyfteWinter: Usually under the sand layer?
[2:36:30] bubblebeamer: the chest is only under sand, not stone or sandstone
[2:36:31] Viaurora: no deeper then the sand layer
[2:36:33] Dargon_____: It's only 4 blocks deep ish
[2:36:38] SecondBreakfastPip: It'll always be under a sand block or a gravel block, no solid blocks
[2:36:39] XavierMidnight: never tell Briony you have a treasure map
[2:36:44] Viaurora: you should not need a pick ever
[2:36:44] Dargon_____: and the chest is almost always not exactly on the X
[2:36:54] SwyfteWinter: I find it is usually directly under the X
[2:37:04] JellyD_: dug too greedily and to deeply
[2:37:09] rorchach_test: depends if your in the right place Diggyholemandiggingahole
[2:37:14] Alvpyrola: a few blocks.. there's a sneaky way to know exactly where it is though
[2:37:26] Arnhawl: We'll never know what Briony wanted to know about lava
[2:37:27] darth_francis: the chest always spawns in the same chunk coordinates
[2:37:33] darth_francis: I think its like 11 11 in the chunk
[2:37:34] Arnhawl: yes you can
[2:37:40] Kacie_S101: Yes
[2:37:41] comunra: yep
[2:37:46] SwyfteWinter: Lava on a block above dripstone above a cauldron
[2:37:57] rodg88: 9 x 9 in the chunk
[2:38:05] Viaurora: stone bricks are even better
[2:38:19] SecondBreakfastPip: Just dig up all the sand tbh

[2:39:28] JoneKone: Briony, test if third person Lytraing fits you better, with F5
[2:40:01] comunra: wax keeps copper from going green
[2:40:04] rodg88: Kirsty if you press f3, and can see a number for x and z block position in the chunk, the chest is at 9x and 9z
[2:40:05] JellyD_: that copper block doesn't have any hair on it anymore
[2:40:11] Kacie_S101: Now it won’t turn colors
[2:40:16] comunra: hit with axe to dewax
[2:40:23] Idunyken: That's just part of the kitchen decor now
[2:40:29] Dargon_____: Waxing a copper block basically stops it from oxidizing
[2:41:03] Arnhawl: She's flying OOOO
[2:41:14] Alvpyrola: it's 9 x9 on the "block" row in F3
[2:41:28] 3v1lc0w: benO

[2:47:25] SwyfteWinter: That said there is a lot more error than trial
[2:47:53] SwyfteWinter: Depends on your accent I guess
[2:47:54] JellyD_: there was a whole joke about it in airplane that it doesn't sound different
