[0:58:38] RealWickedBrew: cheer200 Heres something that actually matters at the federal level. The Supreme Court looks like they are going to take away court deference to federal agencies called Chevron deference. That will mean courts actually have to look at what the law says instead of just going along with whatever the F D A, A T F, and other rules makers say. That single decision could undo basically everything that the federal bureaucracy does that makes life suck because it could become unenforceable.
