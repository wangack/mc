[1:16:11] stormblaz: @giantwaffle since u stream games are microtransactions taxable expenses? ahah
[1:16:16] spratydad: you are rewarding the vendor's horrible RNG coding -
[1:16:18] nathrizen: next hell gap is 1385-1400, which they will have valtan to jebait you into it
[1:16:19] gutter54: the higher you get - the more then really really want you to swipe
[1:16:29] Î∞∞Í≥†ÌîàÍ±∞Ïù∏: no point of swiping you will get there

[1:16:51] Seppiee: and in the Netherlands
[1:16:55] Celnoc: @Giantwaffle mats from pirate coin vendor with bard

[1:17:02] Seppiee: rip me
[1:17:02] babyaddalyn: and yet im playing and im in belgium ssht don't tell the goverment :P
[1:17:04] gutter54: I wonder if people who swipe that much would also be addicted to things like gambling if they did that as well
[1:17:08] stormblaz: @giantwaffle do u think they take statistics to know how many swipes before players give up and not play for a while to manipulate that,
[1:17:09] stormblaz: ?
[1:17:17] chikushoubaka: playing from Belgium, though on a seperate steam account to be safe and after an initial VPN to download
[1:17:20] Silver_Lion: what the hell is that skin
[1:17:27] Westronin: Aren't you supposed to stagger him when he charges up?üòÇ
[1:17:40] stormblaz: gun lancers are great for that
[1:17:44] Westronin: @silver_lion new gift skins and mounts
[1:18:16] Westronin: @silver_lion they gave out these free skins chest and mounts chest that you can chose to celebrate release in NA
[1:19:10] Silver_Lion: @RichRickTV thanks
[1:19:17] stormblaz: i wonder why technically there is no tank class
[1:19:23] stormblaz: that was so odd to me
[1:19:30] stormblaz: i guess lack of aggro mechanics?
[1:19:36] Silver_Lion: yeah no trinity system
[1:19:44] Allmostdone: how can you be slowed on while on the ground but jump over him like a rocket?
[1:19:45] warmwalrus: yea, anyone can counter i guess
[1:19:56] stormblaz: i suppose they though tanks werent fun?
[1:20:10] HostileLogOut: its a game about skills. not Holy trinity.
[1:20:16] stormblaz: but decided to have supports
[1:20:22] CosmicAxle: CosmicAxle subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 41 months! 
[1:20:23] stormblaz: if u don put tanks then why put supps
[1:20:31] stormblaz: any class should have buffs by that logic
[1:20:36] HostileLogOut: cause support has nothing to do with buffs or healing
[1:20:45] warmwalrus: support is utility
[1:20:55] stormblaz: it gives shields tho and stuff
[1:21:00] stormblaz: mostly debuffs and what not
[1:21:17] Dumpified: almost every class has a debuff or buff of some kind. what do you mean..
[1:21:23] warmwalrus: it just doesn't have the trinity system, that was their philosophy lol
[1:21:24] firewatervn: where do you redeem the new animal skins?
[1:21:25] Silver_Lion: Fucking baby shark man
[1:21:27] imTymp: @HostileLogOut i do lots of healing idk what u mean
[1:21:30] warmwalrus: KEKW
[1:21:33] stormblaz: that it was strange to not put tanks but put supps
[1:21:36] warmwalrus: these mvp screens KEKW
[1:21:43] Westronin: I think the potion system is cool and the fact that you don't have to rely on a healer to not die
[1:21:47] imTymp: i totally didnt skip a day
[1:21:50] xfcr: did u choose the dino with the heart on its chest @giantwaffle

[1:39:28] themorgy: these skins are never tradable but they give them out on special occasions
[1:39:32] AIex_0: it's a special occasion skin
[1:39:47] Turbologic: yes it's good set alternative for light of salvations

[1:40:54] stormblaz: abysses
[1:41:13] Vickens: wait what is that side or app that he is using to check dailu routine?
[1:41:15] stormblaz: lmaooooc 2-3 15s
[1:41:24] nathrizen: guardian event is per character, you might be able to get more mats for more tries
[1:41:25] stormblaz: wishful thinking
[1:41:28] Zeikoa: that feel when you can't open the skin box because you might swap main class later Sadge
[1:42:10] stormblaz: im not liking sorc
[1:42:14] stormblaz: so im swithin lol
[1:42:18] Hard2FindGoodID: swiftness

[1:43:41] heydreammm: Yeah
[1:43:49] Blasian__: expert is $$$, get it 1370+
[1:44:07] wizdom401: Ferrari OP
[1:44:10] TxMaverick88: Yeah expert is usually more expensive
[1:44:13] emanymanheman: I'm leveling my first character rn and finished the King Thirain quest line portion of the MSQ yesterday, got to my hideout or whatever its called in this game, and Adeline is best girl hands down
[1:44:47] Blasian__: @emanymanheman pepeLaugh lets see you feel the same way after visiting your stronghold 100+ times
[1:45:10] TxMaverick88: At least for getting into groups supports can get by with MUCH shittier engravings lol
[1:45:16] Markus11982: tier 1
[1:45:18] stormblaz: pog
[1:45:20] celadriel23: tier1

[1:45:21] Zeikoa: filter the tier
[1:45:29] stormblaz: dam
[1:45:53] RikulisReborn: 4k vit tho
[1:46:04] mylodamm: the tedious part of every tier Sadge
[1:46:16] Markus11982: can you try to get the bard to 1325? its not that expensive i think
[1:46:23] Squibblezx: you get more at your level out of expert but end game awakening desp salvation expert. dontworry about miacing low tier
[1:46:27] dragonphlyy: @Giantwaffle ranked pvp?
[1:46:28] peeposmack: Just farm until you get one
[1:46:33] heydreammm: I recommend for the stone get awaken and mp because you tend to run out of mana
[1:46:33] Triz08: and 0 silver ><
[1:46:40] TxMaverick88: That‚Äôs why I rush my alts hard to 1325 THEN start feeding my main
[1:46:40] emanymanheman: so what are the benefits of joining a guild, and is it worth it to look for a guild if I'm a new player and none of my friends are playing so I don't have a guild I would want to join
[1:46:43] AIex_0: probably from race event
[1:47:05] PeterThePooh: I just had to pity 4 pieces of gear from 11 to 12 :(
[1:47:07] TxMaverick88: @emanymanheman guild contributions are virtually free and give important rewards
[1:47:35] heydreammm: Awaken
[1:47:46] imTymp: honesttly awakening

[1:48:07] AIex_0: awakening on my soulfist is so nice, so many spirit bombs
[1:48:41] celadriel23: its not going to be cheap w/  your stats
[1:48:48] heydreammm: main stat swift
[1:48:52] heydreammm: spec secondary
[1:48:57] Neonnimbus: swift and spec
[1:49:00] Blasian__: @emanymanheman bare minimum you should join one that is higher guild level or good bloodstone to guild ratio. its just free currency to use at a vendor to get more honing mats
[1:49:03] Astro22t: the new pet sooo cute CatBlush
[1:49:13] sam1390: 5 pheon OOF
[1:49:44] imTymp: awakening 3 is op tbh
[1:49:48] Y0kaa: My alt is at 1060 GS and I realized I have still the whole Tower with mats, T3 baby here I come Kreygasm
[1:50:22] TxMaverick88: I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôll be an issue later but we‚Äôre getting so many free pheons if ur under 1370 and out of them ur doing something wrong
[1:50:40] stormblaz: yep
[1:50:58] stormblaz: LMAOo im the supoort
[1:51:00] stormblaz: too funny
[1:51:02] AIex_0: i prefer no support for this event LUL
[1:51:10] zyersaru: bombs for breaking tail
[1:51:10] sogerr: destroying scorp tail gives massive damage boost
[1:51:12] AsHackDM: dont sell it
[1:51:15] babyaddalyn: its not hard and it scales
[1:51:28] Lucin3r: Can you do this multiple times for rewards?
[1:51:31] warmwalrus: yea you should beat it by 10 min

[1:52:35] Squibblezx: only backsesting ill do is do wind of music before guardian tune so you have damage reduction on top of the bubble
[1:52:39] stormblaz: skorpion is busted
[1:52:47] Jerod5_: @Giantwaffle just a heads up the time window is sorta tight unless you break the tail on the scorpion
[1:52:58] Yshure: I failed honing 18 times in a row at 30% Madge
[1:53:12] imTymp: v off cd ur v when it hits a boss will do a full bar full for ur x heal

[1:54:55] PlushReptar: u get like buffs once u kill one that make it easier
[1:55:01] Zeikoa: now we're monster hunter NODDERS
[1:55:19] mylodamm: "you want more guardians? we give more guardians, 3 at once!"
[1:55:27] emanymanheman: dumb question but how do I switch out what pet I have summoned
[1:55:34] TritonXXXG: when they say tail they mean to hit the circle on the tail with destruction grenades when the boss is staggered
[1:55:36] mylodamm: alt+P
[1:55:39] TritonXXXG: 2x tail breaks
[1:55:57] imTymp: anyone on azena wanna join me and nex for some pvp spam?

[1:56:48] Supertank32: how do you claim free skins today?
[1:56:51] rezv: I focus
[1:56:54] AIex_0: i think stacking and attacking both is best
[1:56:56] rezv: scorpion and bird
[1:56:58] Jerod5_: I failed 2 80+% hones to get my paladin to 1100
[1:57:03] rezv: grouped them together
[1:57:06] primo_qwe: no kill one then others since you gain buff per boss killed
[1:57:12] rezv: and just did big damage to both
[1:57:12] stormblaz: stack
[1:57:28] findi24: You gain DPS buffs per boss killed, so focusing is better
[1:57:28] Zeikoa: where the dung bombs
[1:57:29] TritonXXXG: that means hes on ez mode now
[1:57:31] VengeanceUM: u have to kill the scorpion like 4-5 times atleast i had to

[1:58:09] HostileLogOut: u get 1400 coins weekly. or 1600
[1:58:11] rezv: weekly roster
[1:58:14] reallybongs: its 1 per roster
[1:58:19] Zeikoa: I saw the math, you'll have enough for everything if you skip all t1 mats for t2 and 3
[1:58:21] reallybongs: per day
[1:58:22] rezv: lmao
[1:58:22] findi24: Scorpion is tanky as fuck
[1:58:25] sogerr: scorp tail gives damage boost once you destroy it
[1:58:27] WeNNz: I thought its 1 time per day per rooster
[1:58:29] Blasian__: we're not sure if its a bug but you can do this event right now 1 per character
[1:58:35] jessup_plays_games: is it per roster or character?
[1:58:38] tommyfod: you can do it more than once chat
[1:58:39] WeNNz: not per character
[1:58:39] Y0kaa: Weekdays is 200 Coins, Saturday Sunday 300 Coins
[1:58:40] rezv: 200 coins per character
[1:58:40] DeadlyBrother: Its supposed to be 1 char per day
[1:58:43] HostileLogOut: i dont think its ment to be more then once per roster. seems like a bug lol
[1:58:44] kcFUTURE: I already have 800 coins from 4 characters soooooo
[1:58:44] FUNKz: it's per character atm
[1:58:46] sam1390: should be 1600 for one character
[1:58:46] Bandoorian: Anyone know how to add that Lost Ark United Structure to my stronghold ?
[1:58:53] warmwalrus: you have 6 lives anyways widePepeLaugh
[1:58:55] VengeanceUM: see scorpions tail is back, u have to kill it like 4-5 times
[1:59:06] imTymp: drop ur R under people for damage buff, e under enemy for debuff on boss
[1:59:15] warmwalrus: oh gotcha
[1:59:19] raingallery: go to stronghold and ctrl+1
[1:59:28] imTymp: keep ur F up as much as possible thats ur damage reduction and shiled after time
[1:59:28] FUNKz: I just did event on a 2nd character, the bosses were bugged and we timed out 20 minutes, can't wait to do it on all alts Stare

[2:00:03] TaeKDA: Nahh chat is buggy
[2:00:03] samuraijac: the bard speed buff can enhance attack power as well
[2:00:08] HostileLogOut: some things are useless to buy from the event store. so no need
[2:00:10] LissXIV: Chat boxes break sometimes. Have to re add the tabs if you can
[2:00:16] sam1390: @Balafore so you cant buy everything if they change it to only have one character per roster
[2:00:27] Arimil: I found out why my first run took 20 minutes, if you kill scorpion last you don't get dmg buffs.
[2:00:36] Balafore: @sam1390 If the notes are wrong and it's once per roster
[2:00:38] jessup_plays_games: so its bugged, should be per roster
[2:00:48] Triz08: those buffs are fun to have
[2:00:53] punishhha: yea, you want the dmg buff
[2:01:00] HostileLogOut: so if its not ment to, then alot of people will get banned
[2:01:11] punishhha: are those tradeable?
[2:01:27] stormblaz: no one will get banned for using a system you let happen lol
[2:01:29] rezv: KEKW other mmo's you'd be farming for the entire month and not even get close to buying out the entire event shops
[2:01:31] SasquatchYeti: looks like it's 4240 to buy everything
[2:01:58] sam1390: 2.65 character to buy it out per week
[2:02:09] adblockuser: damn wtf

[2:02:47] rezv: basically 3 characters daily
[2:02:56] iduhddy: to fix the nor mal chat u need to make a new tab with area chat unchecked

[2:06:29] warmwalrus: we are
[2:06:30] Arbezi: pheons shouldnt even be in the game
[2:06:32] peeposmack: I hate all the daily tasks. Just let me plan it for a week.
[2:06:34] jessup_plays_games: heroic guardians would be awesome
[2:06:44] Supertank32: how do you collect rewards
[2:06:48] DeadlyBrother: @Arbezi they are good for the game but they could be better
[2:07:04] iTzMeMune: @Arbezi Looks like you've been watching to much of that iditotic asmongold
[2:07:07] nathrizen: every week reset i get stunlocked by things to do
[2:07:08] Degustipated: The XCOM Effect Kappa
[2:07:09] Not_Tomas1: but when you say 80% success rate it makes you feel better :)
[2:07:21] gutter54: if a surgeon told me I had an 80% chance of success, I'd be ok... Lost Ark I'm doomed =D
[2:07:22] DeadlyBrother: Most people that say pheons are bad didn't see the shitshow it was without them
[2:07:25] Schweebcraft: Easiest way to see how many fails you should have is convert it to fraction. 20% means you should fail 4 every 5 (averaged over millions of attempts)
[2:07:30] Riddixdan: how are they good?
[2:07:37] punishhha: not sure why people are hating pheons without fully understanding its purpose
[2:07:41] Thugbabyjeesus: so there is pvp now that gives mats there is event that gives maths:D not bad
[2:07:48] warmwalrus: pheons are good
[2:07:50] DeadlyBrother: crystals to gold wouldn't exist without them
[2:07:56] iTzMeMune: Pheons are good for the game, makes you spend within your means.
[2:07:57] Aoewin: people would just flip all day everyday without
[2:07:57] The_kid_as_a_teen: are is a fan >
[2:07:59] DeadlyBrother: inflation would skyrocket
[2:08:02] Riddixdan: but why are they in mail transfer between alts?
[2:08:05] rezv: Alot of koreans, have actually asked why they still in exist in korea
[2:08:05] adblockuser: why are people filtering the event stuff for high gear score, I thought the gear is equalized?
[2:08:07] Mandorake: Tarkov needs a pheon system

[2:08:31] Allmostdone: In the US if a surgeon told you anything look at him/her and say "you must be lying you lips are moving"
[2:08:41] DeadlyBrother: @Riddixdan so you don't make 15 alts of same class and transger accesories for free
[2:08:58] Riddixdan: @Riddixdan why not tho?
[2:09:19] swupsy: Starting to get close to T3 on Qq?
[2:09:42] DeadlyBrother: You would be forced to make same class for alts if accesories had no pheon cost

[2:11:48] celadriel23: theres zero chance people can get 16 of 6 specific legendaries in a year
[2:11:50] DeadlyBrother: @rezv you need awakening, its useless without
[2:11:51] punishhha: the problem is awakening the set LUL
[2:11:55] VengeanceUM: im literally 1 card away from light salvation @Giantwaffle

[2:34:35] Celnoc: yea, had been stacking mats

[2:36:00] AmidAiz: i horded everything in case of a honing buff
[2:36:01] AlinksPast: only 108 koko seeds? save the babies!
[2:36:05] AmidAiz: prob will use after roadmap
[2:36:06] BlancoPollito: no one predict NA players would wine so much they would give us tons of mats
[2:36:25] Squibblezx: any bots up after the steam fix are multibox players especially if in t3
[2:36:25] Moobot: You can find Waffle's Youtube channel here - https://youtube.com/giantwaffle
[2:36:31] Xev_00: Selling was just a safe bet, the prices definitely weren't gonna go up so even buying back at the same price would have only been a 5% loss
[2:36:32] Squibblezx: just report them
[2:36:34] Astro22t: we got the same as other regions lol
[2:36:57] Mandorake: I blame bots injecting too much gold into the economy
[2:36:58] Face_32: yeah there is no way we have 4x mats now
[2:37:05] TritonXXXG: its because the whales all got 1370 and all the illicit gold bots got banned
[2:37:10] ldvemonl: because ppl had alt faster this time
[2:37:13] skarrmania: which tool is using for tracking tasks?
[2:37:15] TritonXXXG: its actually currency deflation
[2:37:19] imwuzzy: turns out u can do the new guardian event on each character and to get the currency, even tho the patch notes say per roster
[2:37:20] TritonXXXG: gold has gained value
[2:37:20] Slymph: The prices is waaaay too close to being 1 gold which is minimum, thats bad tbh
[2:37:41] Y0kaa: @TritonXXXG Thats not how currency deflation works LUL
[2:37:51] VengeanceUM: wish i could buy pirate coins with gold OMEGALUL
[2:37:55] sogerr: this post is a good idea on why there is so much gold deflation going on https://www.reddit.com/r/lostarkgame/comments/tm7pk8/the_great_lost_ark_deflation/
[2:38:18] Y0kaa: People wanting more Pirate Coins and im sitting at like 500k Pirate Coins LUL Wtf
[2:38:19] TritonXXXG: yes
[2:38:20] Xev_00: Yep
[2:38:24] zombietaint: ye
[2:38:40] zombietaint: since you're so close to 1370 you might even want to wait
[2:38:40] Squibblezx: if you sold leapstones for gold then used the gold for crystals snd use Mari shop it would help
[2:38:48] Kersenka: Bots being banned reduced the amount of gold being generated, although items seem cheaper the value of gold is worth more now.
[2:38:53] TritonXXXG: @Y0kaa its literally the opposite of inflation
[2:38:53] zombietaint: you get the research at 1385 to make alts cheaper
[2:39:22] Squibblezx: many dont convert to crystals or play the market
[2:39:28] Zeikoa: mari leapstones are still very good value problem is you still need a bunch of them
[2:39:29] hiroscho: failed alberhastic with pugs at 4%, feels bad man
[2:39:51] Shadowl0: after you hit 1370 you get the base 1340 gear which makes 1385 much easier to get in roughly 1 week
