[0:51:07] ErikoftheNorse: @DoddyH if they get the apiary blocks they can use those squares as the multiblock
[0:51:16] drazili: Duncan, keep in mind that you need a Configurator to configre Mekanism pipes.
[0:51:21] borfuscorgus: Rune of self sacrifice is the one that improves self knifing isnt it?
[0:51:21] Danriths_: Ravs if you venture down into Botania there is a special flower that gives fast regen. The Fallen Kanade. But making mana is a hassle in Botania
