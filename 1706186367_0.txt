[0:28:47] Provision_: @MyFutureBoyfriend good one LUL
[0:28:49] chaoskub: @officialhunterx If your computer only has 8gb, that will be difficult. The OS needs ~4gb, and minecraft needs 4-6 for this. If you have more in your computer and are specifying 8gb to minecraft, that may be too much.
[0:28:50] IAmJester: and shift click
[0:29:02] kbigLiar: redstone signal on modded armor stand iirc

[0:30:18] officialhunterx: @Giantwaffle make the air tight enchant
[0:30:20] mysts_07: did we confirm that its always day?
[0:30:33] chaoskub: @officialhunterx You might also try googling the pack and the specific error. Or just the error. chances are, people have had the issue as well. And hopefully they put info online.
[0:30:34] mrleonehart: @officialhunterx He cant it has to be bought and its expensive

[0:31:27] DarkKnghtt58: @mrleonehart big oof
[0:31:31] weightmaker: you can use crafting calculator to find out the exact amount of resources you need for X amount of items
[0:31:45] chaoskub: @officialhunterx You might also want to check your java version, and consider using openjdk
[0:31:49] mrleonehart: @Giantwaffle Use the crafting calculator
[0:31:53] frainsbreeze: i thought you needed 4 stacks of solar 8s
[0:31:57] CommanderUrsus: the interface on the crafting calculator is so terrible
[0:32:03] CommanderUrsus: I can never figure it out
[0:32:15] mrleonehart: @Giantwaffle Also make sure you automate Lapiz first before focusing on power
[0:32:15] DX_Plates: Well you do need a bunch of reactors for all the materials, which will give a bunch of excess power, yea?
[0:32:22] IlsaGold: @Mr_Perril But do you realy scream if there is no sound?
[0:32:39] GGoodGGuy: what are those teleporting tiles?

[0:33:30] RoninStorm: poor cow
[0:33:31] GGoodGGuy: @CommanderUrsus those white tiles
[0:33:35] bobolpwnz: This reactor should be fine for all LE fuels actually
[0:33:37] TigerLuv: so Ci will not be in charge of that :D
[0:33:38] mrleonehart: @Giantwaffle Why dont you automate this in space as well so its safe
[0:33:41] n00rman_: the cow runs the fission reactor obviously
[0:33:49] MyFutureBoyfriend: Waffle is trapping all of the animals. Is the pig still stuck?
[0:33:58] jayrickson87: active cooling is the best way
[0:33:58] frainsbreeze: liquid cooling POG

[0:36:04] RoninStorm: well... not towards hawaii... i thought around to hawaii
[0:36:09] Wetware: Oh, like they did with the early Falcon testing, 'land' it over the water.
[0:36:09] tomey36: What ever happens with the launch it will be crazy
[0:36:19] daZonk: Really it‚Äôs launching going towards Cuba. Then circles earth. And then splashing off Hawaii or Cali not going a full circle around
[0:36:25] pipin420420: ship not booster lands at hawaii
[0:36:34] Funken_: just land it , like every plane.. oh man
[0:36:44] Wetware: @n00rman_ Elon time!
[0:36:50] sogerr: drone ship cant handle the booster, they bought a whole oil rig to use as a landing platform for it
[0:36:56] pipin420420: lets hope we get shots of the booster landing/crashing
[0:37:20] Cooper_XX: i thought they ditched the oil rig plan
[0:37:29] Flame010: have you worked out the count of each lower level solar panal you need all the way up to however many solar panal VIIIs you want to make in the end?
[0:37:42] just_cro: they'll attatch a ship to it but still xatch it with a heli LUL

[0:38:56] Cooper_XX: well at some point yo have to try it on the tower

[0:39:23] hiposlipo_: why no faith?
[0:39:32] banshay3: what were the chances of landing a booster?
[0:39:33] Dagmoo: tower requires insane precision
[0:39:45] BMYGRLFRND: they keep landing on moving boats with remarkable precision, I don't think it's too far fetched
[0:39:51] Wetware: Will they be putting any of the new starlink V2s on the Starship first launch?
[0:40:13] Provision_: @BMYGRLFRND but the boat can help to correct. The tower can't
[0:40:16] DX_Plates: 1:1
[0:40:17] Wetware: Catch an office building with another, bigger office building
[0:40:24] philipkatis: They welded the payload bay door shut, so no payload on the first launch.
[0:40:28] GGoodGGuy: lets automate this :D
[0:40:30] Psyclone____: not that bad COPIUM
[0:40:32] daZonk: First launch isn‚Äôt going all the way to orbit so no real payload on it. Just mass simulator
[0:40:59] BMYGRLFRND: @Provision_ they also keep landing on stationary landing pads, also, the boat AND the rocket correct for each other
[0:41:01] fish_27: simulated mass aka Cybertruck
[0:41:06] IAmJester: if it's not going to orbit on first launch, they wouldn't call it an ORBITAL launch Pepega
[0:41:07] mrleonehart: @Giantwaffle Automate Lapiz first waffle
[0:41:10] mrleonehart: Power 2nd
[0:41:13] piprrrrr: So launch with mass sim and land with it?
[0:41:26] Wetware: Probably to test the heat shield ?
[0:41:28] banshay3: "land"
[0:41:28] daedmissica0: is doing what blue does i guess
[0:41:34] n00rman_: put some twitter employees on it
[0:41:38] mrleonehart: @Giantwaffle Automate Lapiz first waffle
[0:41:44] DX_Plates: @piprrrrr Nah, first launch is just orbital test, it will most likely splash down
[0:41:46] IAmJester: @n00rman_ all three of them?
[0:41:47] chaoskub: @n00rman_ or elon
[0:41:52] Provision_: @BMYGRLFRND well landing in a circle in one thing, landing between 2 beam to be able to catch it will be another. Surely since it heavy and a lot bigger
[0:42:33] jmm548: LUL
[0:42:47] mrleonehart: @Giantwaffle Automate Lapiz first waffle!!!!!!!!!!
[0:42:48] daZonk: Correct it won‚Äôt be planned to go more than like 98% of orbit in case issue happens in flight. They want it to land in pacific. It it goes orbital and breaks it could re enter over US
[0:42:48] Dizz1227: That is in fact his actual discord ID  KEKW
[0:42:50] LethalBro: Straight up the debug userID LUL

[0:42:53] ninopanda: that is the actual ID
[0:42:53] Dibbsu: pepeLaugh internal uuid for his discord id NODDERS
[0:42:57] Titanium109: Did spacex launch the booster yesterday?
[0:42:59] yellowspy: @giantwaffle You think they will add in ksp 2 the possibility to recover the 1st stage? I mean for ksp 1 was a mod to do that
[0:43:02] InternetPlumber: and a partridge in a pear tree
[0:43:03] ninopanda: that is how we perma ban people from discords
[0:43:04] IAmJester: it's probably easier to land on the tower with that dumbfuck arm idea.
[0:43:35] banshay3: I did see some launch today on reddit though
[0:43:52] banshay3: with spectacular tracking again
[0:43:53] DarkKnghtt58: you do need lapis
[0:44:00] Wetware: Catching it by the grid fins saves having to have some landing legs on it
[0:44:03] masturi66: @Giantwaffle i think they are doing a heavy launch tonight
[0:44:07] Provision_: @IAmJester the construction to land it would to way too big and effect the ship weight and aerodynamics etc
[0:44:10] Calls1gn: @Giantwaffle Did you see the new factory game that came out today? Atrio
[0:44:20] Wetware: Oh, I missed that
[0:44:21] DX_Plates: Those arms are giant suspension to make "landing" easier on the rockets. Supposedly quicker turn around as well.
[0:44:35] CommanderUrsus: 1337 HACKERMANS
[0:44:36] BMYGRLFRND: @Provision_ maybe... but heavy and bigger makes it less prone to be moved by the wind and such. They also will open a few spokes to increase the craft's radius and better be able to catch it. We'll have to see
[0:44:36] sorefingers: i think the cells are made with the previous tier
[0:44:40] SymbolicLegend: Lol that noti sound
[0:44:44] DarkKnghtt58: you need lapis for the cells
[0:44:50] frainsbreeze: you need so much Lapis
[0:45:00] DemonsDawn: sure :)
[0:45:02] Tapeman83: You need insane amounts of lapis
[0:45:04] DarkKnghtt58: "not that much" KEKW
[0:45:04] mrleonehart: You are running low and need if for the cells plus you need it for other blends that are currently being stopped
[0:45:10] n00rman_: you get tons from miner 5 iirc
[0:45:21] Kunja: Dense lapis from a microminer
[0:45:22] deadgolfer: buy it super cheap
[0:45:28] Flame010: dense lapis
[0:45:33] Tapeman83: Dense lapis
[0:45:34] zenoglio10: calculating forces and coordinates isn't the hard, the hard part is getting the rocket to do it
[0:45:36] ninopanda: Get all the LAPIS!!!!!
[0:45:37] DecoyOcelot: one of the miners gives a bunch of dense ores
[0:45:47] weightmaker: dense ore comes from microminer but we just bought it on our playthrough
[0:45:50] frainsbreeze: sidequest
[0:45:55] ninopanda: its the easiest ways
[0:45:57] jmm548: only other way to get lapis seeom to be coins
[0:46:01] LsTheRoberto: that is a good amount
[0:46:14] jmm548: no use coin to buy ore
[0:46:16] jmm548: LUL
[0:46:24] sorefingers: i think the photovoltaic cells use the previous cell to make so you prob. need quite a lot of Lapiz @giantwaffle
[0:46:28] jmm548: its quicker
[0:46:29] AleXanDreMau: @Giantwaffle if you have fortune 3 you can get more
[0:46:33] Obliviron: thank u whoever unbanned me FeelsStrongMan
[0:46:35] Nexhunter: @Obliviron sainMad watch your language sir
[0:46:35] ninopanda: @Obliviron dont say it like that
[0:46:36] LsTheRoberto: do the math I guess, see how many you would have to buy
[0:46:43] Sander20011: lapis should be quite common to find in the world, right?
[0:46:50] jmm548: manual mine ore block with fortune 3
[0:46:51] jmm548: coo

[1:04:16] LethalBro: GACHA? NODDERS
[1:04:16] LuciferSpirt: PepegaCredit

[1:04:42] nAZAr1uS: fair
[1:04:42] Shantrix: they did that with PS5's too so no drama in stores
[1:04:44] D4RKST0RM99: Is the element of the story written from the back to the front of the book essential for making a manga?
[1:04:47] OrangeW2: IMO it's a bit more fair than the first-come-first-serve shit
[1:04:47] Zwazi: end goal of ticketmaster
[1:05:03] D4RKST0RM99: Also, hi friends
[1:05:05] Al_Kappaccino: they make so much money with that
[1:05:05] OrangeW2: for concerts, i love it
[1:05:10] aundros: @Giantwaffle There is a 7-star train in japan where tickets are a lottery, so you only have a chance at getting one
[1:05:12] CocoScruff: Fomo's a hell of a drug
[1:05:16] DemonsDawn: still cheaper than ticketmaster
[1:05:17] Madarion: against scalpers
[1:05:17] charlescbarron3: my dad buys japanese pocket knives and this is exactly the system he talked about. he actually won a knife this way lol
[1:05:20] Mascolino: Certain stores in the us already do that
[1:05:32] Mascolino: crocs, uggs, ect
[1:05:35] The_Flembo: I kinda fucks with that though. Wonder how it effects botting
[1:05:46] Gamernxc: i understand the concept but i think having it free entry would be better
[1:05:49] Gamernxc: kinda like shoe drops
[1:05:56] bschapendonk: get water from an vending machine win another for free wtf
[1:05:56] aundros: Japan just loves random
[1:05:57] Amraki: if you sign up, then you want it right?
[1:05:58] pinhead_larynx: i believe its a product of japan's extreme work culture, so people with "9-5" jobs have a fair chance at getting limited edition stuff
[1:06:05] OrangeW2: @The_Flembo you end up in the long run with far more actual concert tickets in real peoples hands which is nice
[1:06:09] eldersage69: waffle is the widget crafting recipe making tools for each craft?
[1:06:18] Necto_gck: did we set up the solar farm last night?
[1:06:21] The_Flembo: @The_Flembo That's what I was thinking

[1:06:30] OrangeW2: ticketmaster YEP
[1:06:36] MrArrig: Ticketmaster can go f itself
[1:06:36] Kuroiorb: fuck ticketmaster

[1:06:37] Mike190Twitch: topical
[1:06:40] MrSlagle: The Taylor Swift chaos
[1:06:43] Vizion_TV: Ticketmaster Monopoly :)
[1:06:44] The_Flembo: Imagine using ticketmaster
[1:06:47] frainsbreeze: at this rate you can get air tight for your armor today
[1:06:48] DeathByComicSans: PREDATORY
[1:06:48] Larklen: convenience fee pepeLaugh
[1:06:51] fbritoferreira: US cant really speak because they cant even price thing in the shop, you need to add tax manually on top
[1:06:56] Dagmoo: that Japanese system is like the opposite of buyers remorse
[1:07:08] Vizion_TV: Isn't ticketmaster actually facing a lawsuit for monopolizing?
[1:07:12] Larklen: @Dagmoo losers remorse pepeLaugh
[1:07:22] inforv: Some sports games dont let you guy unless your address is for that state
[1:07:25] Amraki: @Giantwaffle people have said autocrafting might only be using new hammers
[1:07:25] Tro95: what are the goals you are working towards today?
[1:07:37] Apparentthreat: ticketmaster taking notes
[1:07:37] mysts_07: how many friend u made in vrchat?
[1:07:40] LethalBro: Kinda built in scalping from what I'm hearing here
[1:07:47] HawaiiVolleyballStar: its almost like emphasizing fake rarity
[1:07:50] Amraki: oh good. thanks for confirming
[1:07:57] OrangeW2: typically the entry fee is tiny, from what i know it's like $3-5
[1:08:01] Butterwhales: fbritoferreira, its not really that hard you just expect it to be a few dollars more depending on how much money you are spending YEP
[1:08:08] ImTheDummy: How much is it to join in the gambling then? Is it cheap to join?
[1:08:12] Dagmoo: it makes you feel like you are losing out on something if you dont pay even more because you already spent something
[1:08:30] The_Flembo: I miss my vrc days Sadge
[1:08:40] The_Flembo: It REALLY feels physical
[1:08:49] zero3juan: maybe it helps to subsidise the final price
[1:08:50] fbritoferreira: @Butterwhales Cant you just give a full price like we do in eu?
[1:08:54] daedmissica0: have you seen the new glove? for vr chat
[1:08:58] MrArrig: Sounds dystopian tbh'

[1:09:16] FinnYellowbelly: haptic "gloves" Kappa
[1:09:18] Provision_: @fbritoferreira each state can have different taxes, so they price the product without it.
[1:09:19] bugsplatter23: all sounds degen
[1:09:19] OrangeW2: @The_Flembo one of my friends is 2ft tall in game and 6ft4 irl KEKW

[1:09:36] ImTheDummy: @Fhuey He's a waffle obviously
[1:09:36] CanadianHealthCare: Is there weird degen sex stuff that happens in vr chat?
[1:09:39] hiposlipo_: vr is the next big thing just like bitcoin Kappa
[1:09:43] The_Flembo: @The_Flembo I was one of those people! I love the smaller avatars
[1:09:47] NephilimXS: EverQuest did that way before WoW
[1:09:58] Llyin_: Everquest is the shit!
[1:10:00] fbritoferreira: @Provision_ yeah I know I work on a product that gets sold in the us and we have to add the tax after you pick the subscription depending where you live
[1:10:01] kbigLiar: don't we have a semi-automated machine for pulsating iron? like you just need to supply the ender dust

[2:13:10] Derek_LastName: After this it bogo sorts them Pog
[2:13:10] philip0524: You can also save as json and use the copy paste gadget
[2:13:10] LethalBro: YUP
[2:13:12] SubbDogg: yes
[2:13:12] Yakobro: YEP
[2:13:13] KritterIsBack: it's calculating
[2:13:15] Fufcia: YEP
[2:13:17] ninopanda: what did i just come back to
[2:13:17] Psyclone____: layer by layer
[2:13:18] ohbi78: 17m rf/t
[2:13:19] LethalBro: Exactly the layers of the reactor
[2:13:19] officialhunterx: yes
[2:13:19] TuxLafitte: Calculating....... MrDestructoid
[2:13:21] jayrickson87: no it's to
[2:13:21] Dagmoo: LUL
[2:13:21] TelRehiad: YEP
[2:13:22] Smileynator: this is generations to get the best variables wafflePog
[2:13:22] bWGi: it will run until you stop it, but will keep getting better the longer you leave it
[2:13:28] chaoskub: Yes, this uses all block types
[2:13:28] mechoriet: YEP just do it
[2:13:31] maccabeus: Pog
[2:13:32] Smileynator: you can do it very inefficiently :P
[2:13:32] LuciferSpirt: Pog
[2:13:33] quickclassy: KEKW
[2:13:34] chaoskub: You didn't limit the types at all
[2:13:34] Apparentthreat: y'all able to get info fusion?
[2:13:36] Hellfores: just build it
[2:13:38] TheWonderLlama: peepoEZ

[2:13:42] Stillglade: are you sure you don't want to do this on the space station?
[2:13:45] i_am_davis: you can save the json and upload it for the building gadget
[2:13:45] Moobot: New here? Welcome! You can usually catch Waffle Mon-Sat at ~1400 UTC. Feel free to hang out in chat before the stream and/or join the !discord. waffleEgg
[2:13:48] Maynid: copy paste
[2:13:48] philipkatis: Is it still optimizing it?
[2:13:50] Dagmoo: only 4Head
[2:13:51] SebastiaanO: i'd be way too lazy to do this
[2:13:54] 1StClassAlcoholic: go bigger PogBones
[2:13:54] jmm548: maybe make a smaller one
[2:13:55] GFQPR1882: Some1 said do bigger OMEGALUL
[2:13:56] officialhunterx: you wont have enderium
[2:13:57] coolcake2: wafflePTS wafflePTS
[2:14:02] Smileynator: i loooove this
[2:14:03] Psyclone____: it will optimize forever
[2:14:04] TuxLafitte: Bigger is alway better! danHype
[2:14:11] ninopanda: what happened to solar?
[2:14:11] Psyclone____: until you are satisfied
[2:14:15] deadgolfer: total blocks used is 600 lol
[2:14:17] chaoskub: Please generate the blueprint for it and make it
[2:14:19] iloveplants: and then he needs to run it again for active cooling
[2:14:19] RafaLorenzo: Now build a 20x20x20
[2:14:19] Derek_LastName: bruh wtf
[2:14:20] jdog0616: @SebastiaanO thats why someone made a website to do it for you
[2:14:21] BlueberryKing: Now do 24x24x24 Kappa
[2:14:23] aundros: why is this reactor training?
[2:14:32] 1StClassAlcoholic: wtf
[2:14:34] inforv: Nahhhh use the Json
[2:14:34] splix661: is the addon to NC that has a reactor builder in this ?
[2:14:35] CoolReal: How many dynamos is that Pog
[2:14:38] Gamernxc: 15x15x15 :)
[2:14:42] DirtyMarshMallo: 69x69x69 Kappa
[2:14:43] Smileynator: did the output improve ever since it presented the first?
[2:14:44] LuciferSpirt: Pog 24hr stream to make this by hand
[2:14:48] Wazepas: this is so cursed and blessed at the same time
[2:14:48] SebastiaanO: @SebastiaanO fair enough
[2:14:49] LethalBro: 100% efficiency Pog
[2:14:54] RafaLorenzo: NOOOO do 69x69x69
[2:14:56] MDSZilla: Build it by hand, and when it doesnt work break it down and copy pasta
[2:15:03] Derek_LastName: let it cook
[2:15:04] x1xamen: pause
[2:15:06] jdog0616: let it cook
[2:15:06] Psyclone____: it will good forever
[2:15:07] Gamernxc: yeah someone said it will optimize forever
[2:15:09] KritterIsBack: the longer you wait the better it becomes
[2:15:09] Fufcia: let it cook
[2:15:09] Konhacas: Let it end
[2:15:09] Smileynator: let it cook in the background for a bit
[2:15:11] LethalBro: Yeah, it doesn't seem to be updating the best design so far
[2:15:11] Kyogerfan: let it cook
[2:15:11] coolcake2: @Giantwaffle can you build it with the gadget, break it, and then build it by hand?
[2:15:12] lvyEartman: 600 casings....
[2:15:16] Purecrew: why not just mass produce good cooling blocks instead of all these different cooling blocks
[2:15:19] MDSZilla: Get the materials in the meanwhile
[2:15:20] Kascade418: @aundros We're exploring the multiverse and seeing which Waffles explode and which ones live
[2:15:20] jinkleft: Let it run until you're done for the day
[2:15:22] Smileynator: oof
[2:15:27] Smileynator: keep it open on 2nd sreen? :P
[2:15:32] philip0524: Someone made reinforcement learning for this
[2:15:32] inforv: Drag to a dedicated window
[2:15:38] Wetware: Did Code Bullet write this using A.I. ? LUL
[2:15:41] Sam_1443: just put the window small up in the corner
[2:15:42] calebhub514: They say that cuz chrome aggressively stops javascript when you aren't actively looking at a tab
[2:15:43] SubbDogg: Ive built a 24x24x24 reactor by hand, the pattern was crazy OMEGALUL, like 400+ of 6 different blocks
[2:15:45] Smileynator: i assume infinite
[2:15:45] WARHERO322: Thats alot of tungsten
[2:15:53] MDSZilla: Waffle should've asked ChatGPT Kappa
[2:15:53] bWGi: how does it feel to use machine learning to design a reactor for minecraft?
[2:15:53] Psyclone____: @Giantwaffle it will go forever
[2:15:55] ninopanda: i get back from lunch and see quantum physics on the screen..... KEKW
[2:15:57] chaoskub: 30 stages
[2:15:57] Janzert: yeah, just means it needs to be the active tab.
[2:16:02] xDeadBringerx: It will go forever
[2:16:04] Madarion: I think it will not stop, tries to find better versions
[2:16:11] chaoskub: Click stop
[2:16:13] Smileynator: the hope is that it will hit a more optimal build
[2:16:13] Moobot: You can sub to Waffle by clicking this neat link -> twitch.tv/giantwaffle/subscribe SUBprise
[2:16:14] chaoskub: or pause
[2:16:22] Flame010: i feel like you are gunna screw up some blocks and blow up the reactor if you do it by hand XD
[2:16:24] Moopoop: 20 episodes is prolly enough
[2:16:29] MDSZilla: Its already at 100% Efficiency
[2:16:30] tomey36: Is it changing anything though?
[2:16:30] MDSZilla: Just go for it
[2:16:31] tony_rex666: you ha ve a stop
[2:16:34] daedmissica0: you need to take rf to
[2:16:36] Igneous3: its at 100% efficiency?
[2:16:37] Jhreks: its very cool though
[2:16:39] kane1941: as it says there you can just use building gadgets which is like 30 seconds to build
[2:16:39] CoolReal: Is Nomifactory config the default?
[2:16:42] chaoskub: It goes as long as you let it. You have to click pause or stop to stop it @Giantwaffle
[2:16:46] orangecreamsicle3: @CoolReal no
[2:16:47] Smileynator: it's 100% efficient
[2:16:50] deadgolfer: Can you start building the blocks while you let it run?
[2:16:59] 0x4273: EZ
[2:17:01] Smileynator: screenshot it so it does not get lost?
[2:17:01] CoolReal: Are you using nomifactory config for this?
[2:17:03] Smileynator: or save
[2:17:03] LuciferSpirt: KEKW get pati now
[2:17:06] KritterIsBack: better take a screenshot to make sure
[2:17:07] NevaDaha: looks trivial
[2:17:08] Awesomeaustin37: Save JSON
[2:17:10] Larklen: save and into reactor planner? KEKW
[2:17:10] „Éî„ÉÉ„Ç∂„ÉÄ„Éá„Ç£: Is there a command for the list that waffle made for this season for anime?
[2:17:10] jayrickson87: yea just void all that power you don't need it lol wow
[2:17:11] x1xamen: save json, backup for later
[2:17:12] 0x4273: KEKW x600
[2:17:12] iloveplants: but i thought you wanted to use active cooling?
[2:17:20] BlueberryKing: I memorized it 5Head
[2:17:38] redzapdos: before you do this, you may wanna go get a nuclear engineering degree
[2:17:44] Gamernxc: KEKW
[2:17:44] TheWonderLlama: cohhBoom
[2:17:53] MDSZilla: Check if the building tool is available
[2:17:55] MDSZilla: lol
[2:18:00] Smithii: it is
[2:18:07] ninopanda: oh it is
[2:18:09] BlueberryKing: This is not the one that blows up chat pepeLaugh
[2:18:15] Tapeman83: It‚Äôs in the pack, but it‚Äôs pointless. The power output isnt worth it
[2:18:16] chaoskub: @MDSZilla he has multiple
[2:18:16] itsIffy: letMeCi
[2:18:19] ninopanda: i wanna see you blow it up
[2:18:20] TelRehiad: you can use the DE reactor
[2:18:23] 0x4273: please make patterns for this PepeHands
[2:18:24] Tapeman83: KEKW
[2:18:24] itsIffy: What's up waf o/
[2:18:24] KnightofObv: 80 recipes
[2:18:25] quickclassy: KEKW
[2:18:26] MDSZilla: @MDSZilla oh alrighty
[2:18:26] LsTheRoberto: you need so much more ore
[2:18:35] jayrickson87: 1500 Tungsten
[2:18:36] LuciferSpirt: YEP set up auto crafting recipes
[2:18:41] IlsaGold: Go back to a 5x5?
[2:18:44] Tapeman83: I can‚Äôt wait for the meltdown of all 600 casings majinYEP
[2:18:48] nesse007: how is the lumim ingot to?
[2:18:53] bensmcc: 5x5x5 would be like 80% less blocks for something like 6.8 rf/t. Could just build two of those and only use ~250 blocks versus 1000 for the 10x10x10
[2:19:03] cjthedjdolphin: KEKW
[2:19:03] goldenknight22: 3 LUL
[2:19:04] Yakobro: OMEGALUL
[2:19:08] itsIffy: How is the fish doing ? YEP
[2:19:14] SubbDogg: Usually you would build multiple smaller breeders since the endproducts are only fractions of the initial fuels
[2:19:24] FusRohDakkaDakka: wasnt it 800?
[2:19:24] LuciferSpirt: @Giantwaffle just set up autocrafting and request the amount u want for calculations
[2:19:32] Face_32: still automating early game metals?
[2:19:35] jayrickson87: waffle isn't certified to be playing with fission reactors
[2:19:42] ninopanda: only a few
[2:19:45] ninopanda: easy
[2:19:54] 0x4273: KEKW 2 days of smelting

[2:20:27] IronGajeel: shelight
[2:20:29] Smithii: End Stone dust -> Tungstate
[2:20:31] Madarion: @Vizion_TV yeah, but it will not be able to handle the heat of the fuels
[2:20:33] IlsaGold: Do we need it to be 10x10?
[2:20:37] jayrickson87: someone make a countdown till the reactors melts down
[2:20:37] TuxLafitte: Side quest unlocked... danKEK
[2:20:40] chaoskub: You made a system, just connect it to ME

[4:06:09] AnesthesiaFC: imperial is a metric-backed measurement system
[4:06:09] Nexhunter: @isfil yes
[4:06:10] Beufff: the last 3 years has proven there is no way in hell that would be possible
[4:06:10] Baffleturd: in chemistry they always use liters, mililiters etc
[4:06:11] itsfilipoficial: Also uk imperial is not the same as us imperial which is fun
[4:06:11] Allmostdone: we still use imperal our government system are that old

[4:06:29] Nexhunter: speed is very difficult
[4:06:30] nvrmissashot: speedo shave both...
[4:06:31] KICKKJ: wasn't there major cost to switch where its not worth it?
[4:06:33] DonGromus: and weight in stone xD
[4:06:35] JVM91: And they drive on the wrong side of the road
[4:06:35] daemonaedryn: Thats cause our politicians are one foot in the fucking grave and dumb as shit
[4:06:37] EvilNelis: you already use metric in lots of cases like medicine and soft drinks
[4:06:37] ClumsyZombie: Metric is all I use
[4:06:37] Sayiber: also road signs
[4:06:47] Nexhunter: chat it not politicians there are major economic issues at hand
[4:06:48] DemonicHell3: Think about the cost the country would occur trying to switch
[4:06:51] Nexhunter: look at fucking Canada
[4:06:52] Nickonil: yeah on youtube videos i hear sooo many weird ways to describe size from americans LUL thats the size of "3 and a half shopping carts" LUL like wtf anywere else we would say 1 and a half meters

[4:06:57] Nexhunter: their swapped resulted in bagged milk
[4:06:59] Noblez_: Probably because of length being hard, no?
[4:06:59] HonZoR: make signs both and newer cards have to use netrics
[4:07:01] JBrown: i think we have more pressing issues than changing to metric
[4:07:01] Becky15675: uzi 9mm lol
[4:07:03] Nexhunter: @Giantwaffle there is no cost KEKW
[4:07:03] Igneous3: job creation

[4:07:30] daemonaedryn: The uk gov decided the ability to use imperial was a "benefit of brexit"
[4:07:34] WARHERO322: All my real life applications for construction is in Imperial. I have not used Metric since leaving college
[4:07:34] AnglerForLife: were I live our signs have both
[4:07:37] itsfilipoficial: The best one was the uk tried to switch their electrical plugs and failed spectacularly
[4:07:38] Nexhunter: conversion to metric is the expensive as fuck look at Canada KEKW
[4:07:41] kaasrondje: Just od the math while driving 4Head
[4:07:42] jdog0616: why change? why not improve?
[4:07:52] BloodBlight: The PEOPLE are the problem.
[4:07:56] Thermaight: most measurements are done by people building things and doing things, not engineering or science and there are advantages to imperial for certain things.
[4:07:56] Lupic: yes, lets make a new one

[4:08:24] pinhead_larynx: All of the math that runs the civil systems that run the ENTIRE country are in imperial. thats why we'll never change.
[4:08:24] Smithii: All distances must now be in Astronomical Units :)
[4:08:24] babyaddalyn: pineappel pizza slices

[4:11:11] mechoriet: @1StClassAlcoholic COPIUM till they find something new
[4:11:12] DemonicHell3: So this was back in 2015 when this was posted. NASA claims its costs to convert its measurement systems would be over $370 million
[4:11:16] x1xamen: 30 mins KEKW
[4:11:18] Jaydepps00: nope
[4:11:19] TuxLafitte: My favorite idiocy I had to use one time was an imperial system that used 10th of feet... When you want to keep your antiquated system but also want it base 10.... danLUL
[4:11:20] Nexhunter: no USB got fucked again
[4:11:25] Jaydepps00: there are like 10 different USB C types
[4:11:33] Nexhunter: actual USB is all fucked up
[4:11:33] inforv: ^^
[4:11:35] 1StClassAlcoholic: @mechoriet I mean with the new eu rules
[4:11:36] inforv: Nope
[4:11:37] Konhacas: There's like 10 different versions
[4:11:37] 1StClassAlcoholic: true
[4:11:38] Nexhunter: type-c is just a connector
[4:11:40] Nickonil: LUL no
[4:11:40] NodBabe: USB 4.2 Gen 3 version 2
[4:11:40] Nexhunter: that isn't USB
[4:11:41] johantenenbaum: nope, yea different types of Cs
[4:11:41] Lupic: yeah like thunderbolt uses the same connector as usb-c
[4:11:41] cmmeth: the connector is fine
[4:11:41] Dmw882: LUL no
[4:11:41] Thorin5: nope, it's all fucked
[4:11:43] DemonicHell3: no USB standards is ass
[4:11:43] dollar_cave: Oh, come on, there are just different grades of abilities
[4:11:43] lvyEartman: it's usb chaos
[4:11:44] LurkerNr5: if you have a usb-c cable you never know what data and what power capacity
[4:11:46] yonikasz2: Lightning all the way
[4:11:47] Nexhunter: that not USB KEKW
[4:11:47] itsfilipoficial: Have you seen the new usb spec they messed it up again
[4:11:47] Salerodis: we have to go back KEKW
[4:11:49] Konhacas: The connector is all the same, cble is not.
[4:11:52] Glacial_Indifference: The standard wasn't strict enough.
[4:11:52] Thorin5: just like HDMI, shit's stupid
[4:11:54] Nexhunter: USB is the protocol and all the other bullshit
[4:11:55] arkun_: Hahahaha you poor sweet summer child
[4:11:55] lymb2: Thunderbolt 4 etc. different standards
[4:11:56] johantenenbaum: we'll get qi2 and usbs will be obsolete
[4:11:58] dylan0806: Pinout yes, protocols no
[4:12:02] Dagmoo: exactly you never know
[4:12:03] Variandra: @Giantwaffle apple has a "Lightning" type c that adds thunderbolt 4
[4:12:07] LurkerNr5: it would be nice if the cables were labeled :)
[4:12:08] Nickonil: you have usb-c thunderbolt, usb-c-4.0 etc etc etc
[4:12:11] Lupic: qi 2 uses apples proprietary magnet system lol
[4:12:13] Lupic: I think
[4:12:15] Flobu_: usb c is the sme connecteor but it has so many different speeds and features and on most cables they dont specifiy whats possible
[4:12:17] Nexhunter: the connector is just a connector
[4:12:19] Zyie: The different standards are for different functions (like thunderbolt, can you charge etc) and different speeds. There's loads of different ones.
[4:12:21] itsfilipoficial: Also thunderbolt and usb4 is not the same
[4:12:22] Tetsomina: Yes
[4:12:23] Jaydepps00: yep
[4:12:26] lymb2: @Variandra It's just USB C with more bandwidth basically
[4:12:31] Konhacas: No, just quality and protocols
[4:12:33] johantenenbaum: @lupic exactly :D
[4:12:36] itsfilipoficial: Check Linus video on this
[4:12:36] Nickonil: some usb-c cant even transfer power..
[4:12:38] TheAgentNZ: non reversible USB was such a crime against humanity! USB always worked 3rd time around.
[4:12:40] Minelmonia: back at that xkcd again KekW
[4:12:43] Nexhunter: @lymb2 USB-C doesn't have more bandwidth the protocols being used has more bandwidth
[4:12:46] daedmissica0: https://www.aggsoft.com/usb-pinout-cable/usb3-type-c.htm
[4:12:51] Becky15675: get a rubber ducky
[4:12:51] Beergrillz: use the dynamo upgrades on eachother to update all at once
[4:12:55] jdog0616: i can tell my older USB-C cords dont charge as fast as my new USB-C cords
[4:12:56] Tetsomina: Some manufacturers straight up dont use some pin out and they configure them wrong
[4:13:07] MrHashbrowns: its a 4th dimensional connector
[4:13:14] shrimp____scampi: Have you ever messed with Autodesk Fusion 360 or EAGLE? @Giantwaffle
[4:13:17] 1StClassAlcoholic: There is a logo on usb drives indicating which side is up
[4:13:17] G_stav: I've had usb c connectors that are directional and that is stupid
[4:13:23] Youredoneson666: !mc_pack

[4:13:26] lymb2: @Nexhunter True
[4:13:26] Nexhunter: it all stems from the USB-IF allowing like a billion optional specs
[4:13:37] Nickonil: have you ever noticed some usb-c wires are all flobby and loosey goosey? but others are straight and hard to bend, well thats just the looks there are huuuge differences on the inside
[4:13:39] arkun_: USB C can be non-reversible, someone made a cursed USB C connector that can tell one orientation from another
[4:13:46] Thermaight: now we have 1 usb connector and 40 different cables with poor/false labelling
[4:13:50] mattitu: @itsfilipoficial almost though. All Thunderbolt 4 cables are usb4 cables, but not all usb4 cables are thunderbolt4 cables.

[4:14:00] mechoriet: COPIUM
[4:14:00] Dagmoo: cant*
[4:14:07] Lupic: usb-b was the actual crime against humanity
[4:14:07] Tetsomina: COPIUM
[4:14:07] cmmeth: there and it's fragile AF
[4:14:15] Lupic: or mini-b, whatever the fuck that was
[4:14:27] Nexhunter: https://www.usb.org/compliance scroll to the bottom of this page and see the bullshit that USB-IF has caused @Giantwaffle KEKW
[4:14:29] itsfilipoficial: Basically the usb standard people enjoy money so much that anyone can make their own usb standard so they can get paid
[4:14:33] BakaPixel: @Giantwaffle Make a craft recipie for the full conversion?
[4:14:35] dylan0806: Ah yes that usb a
[4:14:36] Jaydepps00: USB B mini is a thing yes
[4:14:42] shrimp____scampi: Have you ever messed with Autodesk Fusion 360 or EAGLE? @Giantwaffle
[4:14:43] Thermaight: connector is easy, but you can no longer tell if the host, client, or cable all support each other
[4:14:45] Nexhunter: look at my link KEKW
[4:14:46] Lupic: some cameras had mini-b iirc

[4:14:59] jmm548: sure thing

[4:15:14] Jaydepps00: @BBQgril Pog
[4:15:15] Variandra: is this a WotC thing again.....stupid licences
[4:15:16] Tetsomina: Same thing with sdCards @GiantWaffle
[4:15:17] dylan0806: To use the logos
[4:15:19] WhoAmIErik: all roads lead to capitalism
[4:15:21] DiamondDestructe: noting is free
[4:15:21] pinhead_larynx: capitalism
[4:15:21] Glacial_Indifference: Capitalism

[4:15:25] nvrmissashot: because capitalism
[4:15:26] frainsbreeze: POG 11 more
[4:15:26] itsfilipoficial: If you have the usb logo in the package you need a license
[4:15:27] Nickonil: @Giantwaffle everyone is required to use the same licence by the EU, therefore then everyone has to pay for the licence

[4:18:40] DemonsDawn: im pretty sure its more nuanced than paying the licensing fee anyway. you are more so paying for having the official USB name on your product
[4:18:43] Thermaight: it is related to how many bonded channels the end-to-end (plus cable) can support
[4:18:44] Hayajin_: but 4k is 8
[4:18:45] Nickonil: linus made a video about this topic and it was abismal, it ended up beeing that a usb-c 3.2 was both newer and better than usb-c 4.0 LUL

[4:19:22] Zyie: @jdog0616 No, UHD is 4k/2160P. Both 720p and 1080p is "HD" somehow.
[4:19:40] Lupic: ah yes, 720 getting "HD" slapped on it is criminal
[4:19:41] Nexhunter: dude fuck VESA

[4:26:02] Wetware: Yeah, but what did 'they' say Telsa's market cap should be?
[4:26:08] officialhunterx: its also filled with malware ads
[4:26:10] bar10dr: The spam emails are going to get interesting
[4:26:16] Tasar_: got Complaisant
[4:26:17] Nexhunter: well they focused on the simulating human behaviors
[4:26:17] Damos1212: google and youtube's algorithm are fucked compared to what they were before
[4:26:17] stefan150: i legit use chatgpt to google search now lmao
[4:26:19] MrHashbrowns: they got fat and lazy off their spoils
[4:26:20] Deamp: i really hate oled, it uses like double the amount of power than a normal led
[4:26:22] mechoriet: @daedmissica0 Pog
[4:26:23] Moobot: You can find Waffle's Youtube channel here - https://youtube.com/giantwaffle
[4:26:23] Cannibalhamst3r: what search engine do you use?
[4:26:23] itsfilipoficial: Google is focus on quantum computing and not ai
[4:26:24] mahoraz: yea....google went too ban happy and removed too much + their algorithm has gotten worse
[4:26:26] Thermaight: google's search is and has been AI driven fundamentally for years.
[4:26:27] philip0524: GPT-4 will be a major step i think
[4:26:34] 1StClassAlcoholic: google is pretty good for developers
[4:26:42] Wetware: What's a good search alternative to Google?
[4:26:42] PistolPeteHogan: Freakonomics did a podcast about ‚Äúwhen did google get so bad‚Äù
[4:26:44] stefan150: ChatGPT literally gives better answers than google search
[4:26:52] Salerodis: Wait... you used to use google to go to site that you knew about? Isn't that like... not it's purpose? KEKW
[4:26:53] Nexhunter: no it doesn't
[4:26:56] jdog0616: ya thats the point
[4:26:58] Nexhunter: chatgpt is confidently incorrect
[4:27:02] jdog0616: its supposed to be fast
[4:27:05] xin0h: being able to make more specific querys would be sweet - gone are the days of soamming different synonyms xD
[4:27:07] PistolPeteHogan: @wetware there are some subscription based search engines out there that are good
[4:27:08] Jaydepps00: my guess it uses a bunch of different search engines
[4:27:09] Llyin_: chat > google!!
[4:27:11] strxcc: Chat GPT is like having a master directly answer your questions
[4:27:12] Hampswitch: Wikipedia, and trawling the net
[4:27:17] DiamondDestructe: well looking at bings casch
[4:27:18] tonigmaa: Don't you search in google when you have a problem with your code while you are programming? @Giantwaffle
[4:27:22] itsfilipoficial: Would we interesting to know what progress google made in quantum computing
[4:27:24] Hampswitch: And they got code off of github, I think
[4:27:29] stefan150: like you type a question and it instantly prints the answer, the day of clicking links is over
[4:27:36] Nexhunter: @Hampswitch yea they basically sucked the whole internet
[4:27:37] thexvar1able: augments sir
[4:27:38] mahoraz: @Thermaight i often get better results with duckduckgo these days cause google removed alot of content due to copyright requests
[4:27:42] PistolPeteHogan: Freakonomics said it best: Google is great for searching if you want to buy something, not if you want to learn something.
[4:27:49] InternetPlumber: google is fine when you tell it to search a site specificlaly
[4:27:51] Egowar: is programming gonna be AI too?
[4:27:56] LethalBro: google usually takes me to stackoverflow anyways
[4:27:58] Bertandbum: @Giantwaffle Systems and weather are looking good for Falcon heavy launch tomorrow
[4:27:59] stefan150: have you tried using ChatGPT for code answers :) its pretty wild
[4:28:00] Zenkas: Does waffle use obs or something like streamlabs?
[4:28:00] itsfilipoficial: Stack overflow moderation is a bit mad these days
[4:28:02] Nickonil: what company owns chatgpt? üëÄ asking for a friend..
[4:28:05] Nexhunter: last year
[4:28:11] imeasytokill: @tonigmaa i started to just paste a snippet into chatgpt and ask whats wrong OMEGALUL
[4:28:17] Glacial_Indifference: Great time saver for slab code
[4:28:19] Nexhunter: @Nickonil OpenAI which technically MS owns with how much they gave KEKW
[4:28:19] Thermaight: @mahoraz that is fair, sometimes I want a search journey/bubble though, that is when google helps.
[4:28:25] hyperion6767: CoPilot is like 2 years old ?
[4:28:25] Tetsomina: I worked for a startup that got 585M in Series A funding, giving them $60B projection. Estimating companies in billions nowadays is not surprising
[4:28:26] mechoriet: widePepeLaugh and annotate code with comments
[4:28:31] mechoriet: if your boring to dod it
[4:28:41] TheIrishGuy: I Think future AI will know how to program but not know where to put it to function
[4:28:43] stefan150: did you try it yet, ive had a lot of fun with the coding answers
[4:28:50] prairydog: üêÑ
[4:28:51] stefan150: it also helps to explain coding concepts in laymen terms
[4:28:52] DemonsDawn: but when will i be able to ask chatGPT to crash the stockmarket for me
[4:28:55] optimalpotato: using it atm for finding security faults in website i am building, pretty useful
[4:28:55] ravi981: its even on Eclipse for nearly 2 years
[4:28:56] tonigmaa: @imeasytokill and does it solve it? or just gives you a hint
[4:29:00] MrBobMcBob: I have actually learned more coding techniques from ChatGPT than searching on StackOverflow or other forums online. Its crazy
[4:29:07] lazycdog: copilot is great, but we always review what it recommends since it's not perfect. it's like the answers from chatgpt.
[4:29:12] stefan150: sometimes
[4:29:17] Nexhunter: https://physicsopenlab.org/2015/11/20/quantum-dots-a-true-particle-in-a-box-system/ also if you want to burn your brain here is the basic science of the quantom dot technology which is why it got that quantum marketing name KEKW @Giantwaffle
[4:29:18] Nickonil: @Nexhunter üëÄ so invest in microsoft?  Corpa
[4:29:25] itsfilipoficial: Gonna create a chatgpt stock bot

[4:29:26] topgunnerccl: chat gpt really helps with programming at least for me

[4:30:48] Wetware: Blame CI ?
[4:30:51] cmmeth: catJAM
[4:30:54] MrBobMcBob: @jdog0616 completely agree. For me its when loading in an unfamiliar module or api, I can ask if ChatGPT knows about it and ask it to do a quick write up and I can dissect it from there.
[4:30:54] officialhunterx: u putting it off

[4:40:53] LethalBro: except they are somehow expensive to make KEKW
[4:41:09] DiamondDestructe: its soundling like factorio now, need tungstin, so need to melt more to make more power, for the power we need more tungstin
[4:41:13] Lupic: oh no
[4:41:16] jmm548: can u make tier 4 for more power now ?

[4:42:17] nvrmissashot: why not make a bit smaller?
[4:42:18] frainsbreeze: isn't your tungsten powder being automatically converted into other alloys?
[4:42:20] pinhead_larynx: need to turn off the stuff thats using tungsten

[4:42:57] dcirusc30: damn thats smart YEP
[4:42:57] knowledge_within: dont you already have a few hundred tungsten worth of casings in the current reactor?
[4:43:00] DX_Plates: Go Large
[4:43:00] frainsbreeze: i think you made mixers for different tungsten alloys
[4:43:01] CoolReal: Restart the pack to optimize this better from the start YEP
[4:43:09] Flobu_: maybe work on the other blacks you need for th reactor in the meantime?

[4:46:05] jmm548: use solar 4 pannels ?
[4:46:05] Apparentthreat: waffleUndo
[4:46:06] frainsbreeze: do you have the power to run another maceration tower though?
[4:46:10] Smileynator: well, slowly expand on power then
[4:46:11] woodlaphroaig: is smelting not the bottleneck?
[4:46:13] jmm548: to help

[4:46:40] just_cro: wait or limit the produkts that make mashines that take too much power
[4:46:44] daemonaedryn: KEKW
[4:46:44] zero3juan: scale that 10x10.be realistic
[4:46:52] weightmaker: which fuel is your reactor designed for?
[4:46:59] lvyEartman: can't you adjust the current reactor to handle heat?
[4:47:04] YOUCEP: 25x25x25 storage drawers cube
[4:47:05] daemonaedryn: Thorium is just black granite
[4:47:13] thunderdan11: @19rhys waffle decided to make the biggest nuclear reactor instead
[4:47:15] daemonaedryn: thorium is your basic fuel, any higher will have much more ehat
[4:47:36] Lupic: you could get a chemistry degree from this pack
[4:47:40] 19rhys: @19rhys ahhhh okok thnx sounds fun
[4:47:41] G_stav: Why not try to just make a small reactor until tommorow when you can build a bigger one?
[4:47:53] frainsbreeze: maybe also check the other solar panels to see if you need any other fission recipes?
[4:47:53] Lupic: monkaHmm
[4:48:00] JonnyL: lirikHMM
[4:48:01] thunderdan11: @G_stav because thats wasted effort according to waffle
[4:48:02] mechoriet: KEKW only 40k
[4:48:02] bWGi: you forgot to tell it what to optimize for
[4:48:05] gikei: chose fuel from wrong row, does that matter?
[4:48:12] RoyalTL: 41k
[4:48:21] lvyEartman: you should select the po3 fuel though
[4:48:21] deadgolfer: optimize for breeding
[4:48:25] jmm548: but power can be a good byproduct
[4:48:30] SubbDogg: this is also power, not breeding
[4:48:40] mysts_07: u set it to optimize for power rn
[4:48:43] rooHaparpo__: why do you want solar?
[4:48:46] LethalBro: Optimizing for power right now
[4:48:47] EpicTitan232: Your breeding will be a lot slower
[4:48:49] officialhunterx: you also amercium as well for tier 6
[4:48:52] weightmaker: is this pack using PO3 fuel settings?
[4:48:54] LethalBro: Got it NODDERS
[4:48:55] JERICHOLOLO: what the hell is that
[4:49:04] daedmissica0: 309000 rf
[4:49:19] LethalBro: Bro master reactor is such a cool tag
[4:49:30] Zyie: it makes nearly 4m rf/t

[4:49:32] Smileynator: damn
[4:49:34] mechoriet: 3 mill rf Pog

[4:49:39] daemonaedryn: KEKW
[4:49:42] Smileynator: 4M rf
[4:49:44] SubbDogg: for breeding you shouldnt really go above 5x5x5 since you usually make like quite a few of em
[4:49:48] Smileynator: Let's goooo
[4:49:52] MaIlchad: Yeah that's how I remember GreyTech packs
[4:50:02] Wetware: Is this web page by CodeBullet ? LUL
[4:50:03] kane1941: you can just reconfigure your existing one
[4:50:09] Flobu_: isnt that the current reactor size?
[4:50:10] deadgolfer: Try 5x5x5 for the highest fuel, see what it outputs
[4:50:17] JJenson: you acutally have to study nuclear physics to use that mod huh quirkNOTES
[4:50:19] jmm548: waffle could u make and use level 4 solar pannels ? now for extra power ?
[4:50:19] mysts_07: just refurbish ur current one

[4:50:50] MaIlchad: another question is are there any high-cost machines you can turn off right now? xP
[4:50:51] Smileynator: how much does the current RF output?
[4:50:51] Zyie: @jmm548 I think they have to go much higher than that to get a useful output from them
[4:50:53] kane1941: hover in the table above

[4:51:47] LuciferSpirt: Nerdge
[4:52:22] lvyEartman: low enriched
[4:52:23] xDeadBringerx: Chat did he make sure to set all the heat etc in the calculator to the values that Omnifactory-GCeu uses?
[4:52:26] iloveplants: E=enrichment, not energy
[4:52:27] cmmeth: Low Earth Arbit YEP
[4:52:39] kane1941: Curium and Califorbium
[4:52:51] officialhunterx: i used my po3 reactor and it was fine
[4:53:08] iloveplants: are you gonna re-run that power plant setup with active cooling or nah?
[4:53:33] jayrickson87: yes
[4:53:42] iloveplants: the bottom row you had set to ZERO which means you don't allow any active coolers
[4:54:02] luthal_: erectile dysfunction
[4:54:03] Sam_1443: you could test that calculator with your current reactor setup to see if the values match
[4:54:07] Flobu_: but you dont need high energy for breeding do you?
[4:54:08] Janzert: did the size reset?
[4:54:10] kane1941: a lot less power output though
[4:54:13] cmmeth: @luthal_, F
[4:54:16] jayrickson87: you definitely want active coolers/buffers/fluid laser relays
[4:54:17] Janzert: looks like it's doing 5x5x5
[4:54:36] jayrickson87: pump cryotheum into
[4:54:42] pharohs24: what modpack is this?
[4:54:43] just_cro: he to cool? monkaHmm
[4:54:46] officialhunterx: depends on cooler
[4:54:46] jayrickson87: cryotheum is the best fuel available
[4:54:57] Vovosunt: uses up cryotheum?
[4:54:59] kane1941: input hatch above

[4:55:02] SebastiaanO: 15 mil?
[4:55:02] lvyEartman: 15 mill rf per tick
[4:55:03] Smileynator: 15m output :P
[4:55:07] aundros: only 15m rf pr tick
[4:55:07] Sui_Ume: 15 million Pog
[4:55:08] Minelmonia: 15M RF though
[4:55:08] jayrickson87: witch and thermal elemental
[4:55:09] pharohs24: @Zyie Thanks!
[4:55:22] Zyie: @Zyie Np =)
[4:55:36] Sui_Ume: @Giantwaffle does that mean you use 100 cryotheum per tick?
[4:56:00] KrunkleDunk: 50
[4:56:11] just_cro: just refurbish in the new area and we will find out braeShrug braeShrug
[4:56:12] jayrickson87: you want anywhere from 8 to 16 per reactor
[4:56:13] Mike190Twitch: Multiple active cooling blocks are needed, i used to build a reactor taht did 2M Rf/t and used gelid cryo in about 50+ blocks
[4:56:14] Sui_Ume: ah, it says 62/tick on the bottom
[4:56:14] officialhunterx: you need  a fair bit
[4:56:17] kane1941: put a level emiter on how much cryotheum you have left
[4:56:26] SebastiaanO: it says 50
[4:56:28] cmmeth: youhve to pip nto them
[4:56:39] Sui_Ume: ah, sorry
[4:56:39] jayrickson87: 8 to 16 coolers
[4:56:39] weightmaker: you replace cryotheum coolers with active coolers and use buffers as casings to pipe in
[4:56:40] cmmeth: F keyboard
[4:56:44] Flame010: each Cr with a box looks like one you pipe into
[4:56:44] jayrickson87: yes
[4:56:46] officialhunterx: fluid laser
[4:56:51] Rollingx: they are all on the ouside
[4:56:56] kane1941: they are only touch corners
[4:57:22] babyaddalyn: its still set for breeding not power
[4:57:24] CoolReal: Need to figure out the cooling rate for sure
[4:57:40] Tidalllwave: do you need that many
[4:57:56] officialhunterx: im pretty sure i didnt you active cooling but yeah
[4:58:04] jayrickson87: you you get away with half that. 25 of them and a graphite block in the center
[4:58:16] deadgolfer: just make crytheum solid blocks for now and replace them in the future
[4:58:20] KnightofObv: set max to 20

[4:58:32] Rollingx: you put 100 so it put the max possible (which is 50√†
[4:58:39] SebastiaanO: make 50
[4:58:40] Moobot: Come join the Waffle House Discord! <# https://discord.gg/fhGFtMuzdS
[4:58:46] KnightofObv: Diagonally
[4:58:47] cmmeth: still 10 mil Clap
[4:58:47] jayrickson87: active coolers get way colder
[4:58:47] splix661: no enderium coolers?
[4:58:51] DX_Plates: diags?
[4:58:56] ryanmgeek: It runs up the inside of the reactor
[4:59:00] KnightofObv: still 10m rf but alot less tungsten
[4:59:04] ryanmgeek: THose arey empty air spaces[]
[4:59:05] Flobu_: it isnt i guess thats invalid?
[4:59:18] P00nDozer69: layer 3 middle is empty
[4:59:20] jayrickson87: place active coolers every other space
[4:59:28] Konhacas: Layer 3 middle is empty space
[4:59:29] Flame010: no the empty spaces are empty spaces.
[4:59:32] jayrickson87: on the outside
[4:59:34] SomethingLikeTheVoid: Why not try in creative?
[4:59:34] iloveplants: it's funny that when you allow active cryo, this website runs like 50 times faster than the first time you ran with only passive blocks. Episode #10 took like 5 minutes
[4:59:36] Methanee: why not yous the json file
[4:59:51] SubbDogg: @iloveplants he did 10x as well before, this is a lot smaller
[5:00:00] aundros: is it not good enough for a starter reactor?
[5:00:01] KrunkleDunk: still 2.5 mil without active
[5:00:02] mrleonehart: Do 50
[5:00:03] iloveplants: ahhh, missed the size decrease
[5:00:04] KnightofObv: So like 10 active coolers will do like 5-7M rf/tick
[5:00:08] jayrickson87: the active coolers don't use that much
[5:00:14] deadgolfer: limit it to only solid crytheum blocks
[5:00:18] officialhunterx: i found passive cooling is better
[5:00:19] Zyie: @iloveplants It's a 5x5x5 reactor, he made a much bigger one before, hence why it took much longer to simulate
[5:00:22] KrunkleDunk: once you get the power into your system, you can make more EBF to pump more tungsten
[5:00:44] ExumeTV: @Giantwaffle  what was your guys early source of Coal/Iron/Gold/Copper/tin, Just straight mining with diamond hammers?? or Deep mob learning?
[5:00:50] Tasar_: Agreed
[5:00:56] deadgolfer: only use crytheum honestly, eliminate all other types
[5:00:59] Tidalllwave: the actives are on the outside
[5:01:03] Vovosunt: what do passive ones take? aren't they the same price?
[5:01:24] Daryl_Kay: what is that website?
[5:01:31] xDeadBringerx: Me and some friends had a 9x9x9 that produced 30 million RF a tick, heat neutral
[5:01:40] Vovosunt: price to make block not the price of fuel
[5:01:45] Vovosunt: fuel is irrelevant here
[5:01:48] xDeadBringerx: With TBU
[5:01:48] BitterPL: maybe just go cheaper to get solar faster, than you can upgrade reactor if power level is stable
[5:02:15] Yakobro: KEKW
[5:02:20] xDeadBringerx: COPIUM
[5:02:23] frainsbreeze: get tough alloy first?
[5:02:26] GummiKu: Just 1k more?
[5:02:31] LVL97Magikarp: can you buy it with coins?
[5:02:31] lvyEartman: arent you automating the plates?
[5:02:32] kane1941: already 30

[5:02:41] CoolReal: 6 sec*
[5:02:48] Robohornet: Robohornet subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 41 months! 
[5:02:49] Sui_Ume: repurpose 10 ebf's for tungsten?
