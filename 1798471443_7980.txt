[4:13:33] GrooveSnack: ^^

[4:38:14] enrico_pilazzo: @gassymexican How many subs would it take for you to share that recipe?
[4:38:17] Honeybadger3: impressive
[4:38:32] Tpocket: D:
[4:38:36] Speedglass: i like it made with canned tomatoes like how they do at the local taqueria
[4:38:48] Tpocket: I'm FOMOing bad

[4:39:00] Honeybadger3: true
[4:39:10] CorporalPibb: ijpNODDERS
[4:39:17] Tpocket: what kinda salsa?
[4:39:22] Honeybadger3: what we need iis a cooking stream
[4:39:34] nessatzcjean1980: Mom makes it with love. You know how to make it from the heart.
[4:39:43] FoldedGiraffe: more cooking streams period NODDERS
[4:39:46] Gr8boomer: So Max needs to go into the salsa business

[4:40:50] chibifox101: mama gassys mexy sauce in stores monday
[4:40:54] XZAdventXZ: Why not Sell some?
[4:41:02] nessatzcjean1980: For less spicy for the salsa, you can remove the seeds.
[4:41:04] Honeybadger3: a mother's love is good
[4:41:15] Honeybadger3: hmmm
[4:41:24] Speedglass: for less spicy you can use a different pepper
[4:41:27] Honeybadger3: yea
[4:41:35] Tpocket: preservatives change the taste too, so you gotta rebalance it
[4:41:41] Spagooglio: Alternatively, new merch idea the GassyMexican Cook Book NODDERS
[4:41:43] nessatzcjean1980: You boil the tomatoes and jalapeños.
[4:41:48] Speedglass: jalapenos are a crap roll
[4:41:49] goblinlove: Start local.  There is a local company that makes a salsa caled Ohana and it's fanstastic and kept in the frig section.
[4:42:00] Speedglass: could be spicy, could be grown next to a bell pepper
[4:42:14] Tpocket: i'm so jealous now
[4:42:15] Honeybadger3: maybe like a 5 jar giveaway or something
[4:42:25] shadowoflight_: get a few small jars and try keeping them for a fixed period of time... 1 week, 2 week, etc
[4:42:27] Psychomonkeys: Personally I've never liked salsa. Just feel like it's the runoff of pico de gallo LUL
[4:42:39] nessatzcjean1980: @speedglass depends where you get them. Or grow your own. I've seen my mom make salsa a lot
[4:42:43] Speedglass: tbh the old shcool el paso taco sauce is my fav. its blended into a smoothie
[4:42:44] Honeybadger3: oooh!
[4:42:51] Honeybadger3: lol

[4:43:16] Tpocket: lol
[4:43:21] Honeybadger3: i mean... for this salsa... thats a good deal tbh
[4:43:26] Gr8boomer: I like some salsas. There’s this mom and pop restaurant near me that makes some of the best Mexican food and salsa
[4:43:35] shizuha: never had salsa
[4:43:35] Tpocket: everyone knows bribes cancel out grudges, its how they work
[4:43:52] FoldedGiraffe: @shizuha that makes me sad
[4:44:03] nessatzcjean1980: Salsa is okay. But mole! That's another good one
[4:44:05] Gr8boomer: Always go to the mom and pop restaurants. Tends to be the best places to eat at.
[4:44:08] Crystare: the villagers Hmmmming LUL
[4:44:32] enrico_pilazzo: Only on Sundays
[4:44:46] Honeybadger3: your mom is quite talented ^_^ the food she makes sounds tasty
[4:44:52] Speedglass: i love a good sauce salsa
[4:45:02] Honeybadger3: i love a good food
[4:45:05] nessatzcjean1980: My mom makes mole to where it's not toooooo spicy, but it's enough.
[4:45:25] FoldedGiraffe: @Honeybadger3 right? so much good stuff from so many places
[4:45:36] Honeybadger3: lol
[4:45:44] Speedglass: is ketchup a salsa or curry?
[4:45:48] nessatzcjean1980: Her secret ingredient? Abuelita's chocolate
[4:45:58] Crystare: LUL
[4:45:59] TrystnS: Damn, just launched BG3 for third playthrough and that intro still hits hard

[4:47:13] Honeybadger3: salsa healthy
[4:47:23] Speedglass: the chips are gluten free
[4:47:30] nessatzcjean1980: You're eating healthy
[4:47:31] Salvius23: It's just a salad.
[4:47:34] nessatzcjean1980: So you're good
[4:47:36] Speedglass: corn has no gluten
[4:47:37] Tpocket: chips are what get me, i can eat soo many chips
[4:47:38] Honeybadger3: i say the same thing about Carrot Cake @GassyMexican NODDERS
[4:47:39] Psychomonkeys: Never thought flaming cheetos was hot. The first was a punch then nothing after that
[4:47:50] Honeybadger3: it has carrots in it, its healthy
[4:47:54] Crystare: never eat Takis .. those things are addictive but you regret it the next day D:
[4:48:15] Valdras86: Cilantro tastes like soap

[4:48:39] Honeybadger3: i like it in moderation
[4:48:39] karmatic1: KKona
[4:48:39] FoldedGiraffe: coriander NODDERS
[4:48:51] Psychomonkeys: I just don't like salsa being just a liquid. Needs chucks or I don't want it
[4:49:17] NoMotion: coriander is the cilatro seeds
[4:49:25] Speedglass: i never meander into the corriander, cilantro is mo than enough
[4:49:26] Honeybadger3: chunky salsa is great yes @Psychomonkeys easier to eat imo
[4:49:28] Nightx7: Coriander... like English, French, Dutch, German, ... :p
[4:49:43] Honeybadger3: @NoMotion huh, i didnt know that
[4:49:53] nessatzcjean1980: @psychomonkeys I always make sure I chop the ingredients with some chunks. Not thin and tiny
[4:49:54] Speedglass: corriander: for when you need weird shit floating in your pickle jars
[4:49:58] NoMotion: oh it actually says thats a US thing LOL.
[4:50:11] Tpocket: i use coriander (seed) in curry. its great
[4:50:19] NoMotion: Internationally coriander is cilantro
[4:50:22] Thaum0S: Chinese Parsley was another term for Cilantro, but I think it's fallen out of favor and might not be PC.
[4:50:32] Speedglass: i use corriander in sweet bread and butter cucumber pickles
[4:50:39] Psychomonkeys: @honeybadger3 without it it just feels like tomato juice and I lil other things
[4:50:50] Honeybadger3: gassyLUL
[4:50:52] enrico_pilazzo: Especially if you role that R
[4:50:54] FoldedGiraffe: gassyHMM
[4:50:54] Raphiezar: I like eating cilantro by itself, as it makes me feel like a dinosaur eating it.
[4:51:01] Honeybadger3: XD
[4:51:02] enrico_pilazzo: Roll* fuck!
[4:51:04] Gr8boomer: Still odd how some people say it taste like soap to them
[4:51:10] Speedglass: corriander is also great to add into your pepper mill
[4:51:12] Nightx7: Tell that to Kory Anders.
[4:51:15] Tpocket: well in the US coriander refers to the seeds, while cilantro refers to the greens
[4:51:17] Honeybadger3: you betch ya
[4:51:22] Psychomonkeys: Peco>salsa
[4:51:33] Raphiezar: @Gr8boomer Supposedly that is due to DNA
[4:52:07] Crystare: their little arms punching it LUL
[4:52:11] Thaum0S: @Gr8boomer That's because they have a mutation that lets them detect chemical in it that other people can't.
[4:52:28] Gr8boomer: That’s wild!!
[4:53:49] Thaum0S: @Gr8boomer Yeah, it's like the world's worst superpower that just makes you hate certain spicy weeds.
[4:53:54] Gr8boomer: Good old genetic mutations
[4:53:55] Psychomonkeys: Still not sure if you the player break things
[4:54:20] enrico_pilazzo: I'd love to get the technique for tortillas down. It sounds simple but I've ruined them before
[4:54:44] Honeybadger3: KEKW
[4:54:55] nessatzcjean1980: Rico, recipe is easy. After you make it, you have to let it rest.
[4:55:05] nessatzcjean1980: The tortilla dough.
[4:55:17] Gr8boomer: I need to learn how to make tamales. Like good tamales
[4:55:32] nessatzcjean1980: Almost like making tamales. The masa part you have to let it rest.
[4:55:49] nessatzcjean1980: Tamales is a job
[4:56:03] nessatzcjean1980: I've seen my mom make it. My grandma make it
[4:56:06] Gr8boomer: @zeroyaljean1980 that’s what I heard.
[4:56:12] Psychomonkeys: Gotta love tor tilla dough Kappa
[4:56:20] nessatzcjean1980: Unless you have people that will help you, great.
[4:56:37] enrico_pilazzo: @zeroyaljean1980 right, but mine have been too thick, and they don't cook properly,  or too thin, and they've burned. I haven't nailed that perfect thickness
[4:56:46] Honeybadger3: XD
[4:56:47] enrico_pilazzo: That's what she said
[4:56:51] Tpocket: reminds me of making potstickers, its better with groups of people
[4:57:17] Psychomonkeys: Feel like 3co doesn't hit as hard anymore and idk why
[4:57:19] nessatzcjean1980: @enrico_pilazzo do you have a tortilla presser? And a flat pan?

[4:59:13] Psychomonkeys: Rich being they rich
[4:59:20] enrico_pilazzo: I've tried with a rolling pin or by hand
[4:59:22] Gr8boomer: @gassymexican make sure y’all don’t get ahead in the campaign of Dead Island 2 if y’all are doing co op. Apparently you can’t join someone if they are ahead of you. But everyone can progress through the story together in there own game. So that’s good.
[4:59:29] Ravenhunter06: gassyRAGE Leave pitty city!
[4:59:49] Honeybadger3: thats a bummer, but they make good chairs
[5:00:10] nessatzcjean1980: @enrico_pilazzo double check and see if they have it before you go to the store
[5:00:26] Psychomonkeys: I wish game companies would figure out coop

[5:20:52] Honeybadger3: yea Max has it right
[5:21:16] shinyjewell: I'd think the issue with that is that Native American food isn't universal. Different areas have different foods.
