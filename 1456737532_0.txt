[0:09:26] celadriel23: itll be more htan 6 months at a minimum
[0:09:38] Mandorake: im very excited about destroyer
[0:09:46] Mandorake: COPIUM hope we get them
[0:09:52] Coulby: i dont think buffs/nerfs will take a long time to get to us
[0:09:54] AIex_0: it could be next month tbh once we get the relic accessories good timing to switch it
[0:10:07] Shuless: just make a new preset
[0:10:19] Mandorake: Shadowhunter is stinky
[0:10:38] mmmint: what game are we talking about
[0:10:47] bcdmonkey: waffle the last month - death blade op. Waffle after patch - 'supprised Pikachu face'
[0:10:54] samuraijac: +12 is 15% +16 is 10%... +16 is 1.2k main stat...
[0:11:05] bcdmonkey: bet

[0:11:22] Coulby: paladin main EZ Clap
[0:11:27] celadriel23: zerker gained a party buff, same with demon shadowhunter

[0:12:21] Venxuri: in korea wardancer is like top dps
[0:12:24] 0sem0: Hi Waffle how you doin today?
[0:12:50] Kingia: Because they don't hunt devils or anything KEKW
[0:12:54] RamseyRinehaus: demonic instead of shadow hunter
[0:13:04] yoVespart: Yeah man, characters get buffed/nerfed all the time in Lost ark, people getting mad for this just means that his might not be the game for them, someone that looks out just for "The top op dps" character will keep changing their main every new balance patch
[0:13:08] Venxuri: wardancer sucks until relic set so for our wardancer mains are waiting :)
[0:13:16] Traaxus: give arty wheelchair buff for NA now rooMadslam
[0:13:20] Mandorake: I prefer US names outside of Glaivier
[0:13:22] KittenMitton: wardancer isn't good in NA since they need relic items and lot of cooldown to feel good

[0:13:55] Mandorake: i dont like Lancemaster as a name either
[0:14:18] Xev_00: Yeah it shoulda been Pole Dancer Kappa
[0:14:18] Venxuri: polearmer
[0:14:21] juicet_gaming: waffle, just an fyi .. you in just chatting section.
[0:14:27] Mandorake: Glaive Master would've made sense

[0:16:56] 0sem0: It seems like leveling up your combat level is a hard thing to do?
[0:17:04] DeadlyBrother: no way it takes that long
[0:17:16] 0sem0: that would be depressing
[0:17:20] DeadlyBrother: Yes
[0:17:27] vMVGiiC: may i think
[0:17:27] DeadlyBrother: Same as qol is taking 2month
[0:17:30] ArcadiusXIV: 2 weeks
[0:17:33] AIex_0: i think they may aswell push it the same time we get relic accessories
[0:17:42] ImScottLol: i think how long it takes to get to JPN/RU would give us a good idea, since they're farther ahead of us
[0:17:42] ayaya_prime: I don't think they hold balance patches for that long
[0:17:49] DeadlyBrother: that came out recently
[0:17:51] ArcadiusXIV: we wont see any of these changes for 4-6months
[0:18:09] 0sem0: What? Broke the clock?

[0:18:43] AIex_0: people just blame amazon regardless Jebaited
[0:18:46] vMVGiiC: So smile gate where is booba skins ?
[0:18:51] kurblet: Amazon has always been the publisher the fact that people piled on them for game issues was weird
[0:18:57] BombusHuntii: Did you watch Tokyo Vice?
[0:19:09] 0sem0: Well you are a Amazon employee KEKW
[0:19:09] ArcadiusXIV: Russia was almost always 4-6 months behind expect we will be the same once we catch up to that currenlt 18-24months behind
[0:19:20] pikabuhhh: luckily not the duping KEKW
[0:19:28] Mandorake: they're flaws that all MMO's have.  Bugs and miscommunication
[0:19:32] HammerssC: how are your gems on this char?
[0:19:36] Mandorake: @pikabuhhh shutting down the markets was insane

[0:20:21] StOrMy1100: How would that bug even occur
[0:20:28] Warkless: That sounds perfectly normal
[0:20:32] ayaya_prime: Duping bug -> fix duping bug > new duping bug due to mechanics of duping bug fix KEKW
[0:20:37] Nexhunter: that is when you are trying to not use networking when the window is not active
[0:21:07] pikabuhhh: that bug occurs through client side information and no handshakes to the server until the dmg is actually calculated and sent to the server
[0:21:41] Jamswhat2: true lULW
[0:21:45] Jamswhat2: LULW *
[0:21:59] MaxedLuck_: new world is what happens when you have a B tier programming team work with a AAA graphics/VFX team...

[1:35:40] KEK_Jinx: loading screens
[1:36:02] Ezeus6969: Do you think its worth to sell t2 mats when Glave comes out for gold or push for t3 on ults?
[1:36:07] Sportman4Life: Mari's shop is also great for stacking up on T2 pouches
[1:36:15] Desepti: i can recommend prelude of death 2/1/1 for chaos dungeon
[1:36:31] Y0kaa: If you do it smart, you can stack up A TON of T2 Shard Pouches and Stones from Maris Shop, possible to do T2 to T3 in a day for the new classes

[1:37:40] Dz_DotaGO: pretty stupid day when the content isnt even out
[1:37:49] vicious_cycle12: I wouldn’t buy accessories till 1370. Just go through the hell from 1340-1370 without accessories not worth the gold in my opinion.
[1:37:56] KEK_Jinx: shouldve saved the orb YEP

[1:41:37] NexX_____: prideholm

[1:42:04] Shuless: i was so lucky that i got 6/6/3 on my first bard stone
[1:42:08] Venxuri: I have like 200 still
[1:42:09] Floriss: I have about 340 pheons
[1:42:10] Dz_DotaGO: if you have alts those pheons dissappear quick
[1:42:15] SenseiJr: @Zeikoa I alwyas do dungeons alone whats diff between partying

[1:42:23] Nexhunter: just wait for ancients pepeLaugh
[1:42:24] Sanistic: I was down to 170 pheons yesterday. Switched from RE to Surge ._.
[1:42:25] Sportman4Life: Ugh

[1:42:39] BaTu016: feyon YEP
[1:42:41] erer566: at least relic stuff won't be replaced for a while
[1:42:53] Ashurian83: i wasted 16k gold yesterday getting a good legendary stone :(
[1:43:00] s22bmx_: im down to 32 pheons lol

[1:43:22] Y0kaa: Im at 160 Pheons but 4x3 Engraves and 30/70 stats

[1:43:33] TheResinger: relic gear is uh
[1:43:35] astranice: 428 pheons here :D
[1:43:37] TheResinger: 30 pheons i think?
[1:43:48] Shuless: 328 :)
[1:43:57] Sanistic: to be fair the switch was 2 weeks ago. But the balance is'nt final, and the patch won't be out anytime soon in the west anyway
[1:43:59] Sportman4Life: On my server 1 pheon is worth ca 50 gold
[1:44:17] BaTu016: relic gear is 35 pheons btw
[1:44:19] BaTu016: not 25
[1:44:21] BaTu016: KEKW
[1:44:34] Zeikoa: reapers new counter is sick
[1:44:35] Shuless: IM SO EXCITED FOR THAT

[1:44:56] BaTu016: yea its 35 Sadge
[1:45:00] Swordyou: you had two in a row yesterday KEKW
[1:45:01] KnightedData: relic was 35 to start but when ancient came out they droped relic to 25 and ancient became 35
[1:45:20] Sanistic: fuck the pheon system
[1:45:20] BaTu016: ow thats sounds right data
[1:45:21] BaTu016: YEP
[1:45:24] Mandorake: @Giantwaffle relic Accessories are going to be so expensive at the start its going to be nuts
[1:45:47] Triz08: because only way to get them is to pay smilegate money
[1:45:50] HKRage: pheon system prevents people from flipping accessories and fucking up the market, shit is nice
[1:45:51] vMVGiiC: Pheons = Blue Crystals = Gold
[1:46:00] ayaya_prime: it's annoying for gearing alts
[1:46:03] BaTu016: ancient gear DESPAIR
[1:46:04] Moobot: You can sub to Waffle by clicking this neat link -> twitch.tv/giantwaffle/subscribe
[1:46:06] Sanistic: when youre out of pheons you're fucked and there won't be a sustained way of getting more
[1:46:23] vMVGiiC: You get more pheons by turning gold into blue crystals
[1:46:30] HKRage: I cant wait to do Breshelza hard mode
[1:46:35] g0atti: im making a glaivier alt, not main swapping, i dont see the point in farming mats in advance
[1:46:38] Venxuri: 1kk dps? monkaS
[1:46:39] TheResinger: 1615 is highest rn
[1:46:46] DemonicHell3: what is super triggering is when a bard lifts everything up in the air and it makes peoples abilities miss.
[1:46:51] Triz08: @g0atti, there isnt a point at all, just people with 0 patience
[1:46:51] TheResinger: not very
[1:46:53] TheResinger: its only super whales
[1:46:57] ayaya_prime: Finally full potential for some of the weaker classes
[1:46:59] Kottos: @HKRage they could just do trade limit 1 and remove pheons and that's way better
[1:47:00] rockiller1: 1mill? how?!!
[1:47:09] Artoosa: i think saint sid the best f2p players are 1590
[1:47:10] Sp1nzaku: 1620 with Esper +8

[1:47:59] Sp1nzaku: Oh sorry, its Esther
[1:48:04] Sanistic: probably not in the same state as korea
[1:48:05] ldvemonl: i hope so, free gold to sell mats
[1:48:15] g0atti: KEKW
[1:48:21] Assure__: It'll most likely be called Sidereal weapon in the western version
[1:48:37] Sportman4Life: lol
[1:48:38] Synhd343: I'm good
[1:48:39] Sanistic: whats the percentage on the hones?

[1:48:43] TheResinger: lol no
[1:48:43] rockiller1: nah
[1:48:44] anouriss: no way
[1:48:45] Dz_DotaGO: yeah why not
[1:48:45] Maokye: YEP
[1:48:47] TheResinger: they arent releasing it here
[1:48:47] HKRage: they probably wont release it
[1:48:49] KnightedData: its not really even that much better so who cares lol
[1:48:56] harpist: theyll make the mats bound only
[1:48:58] Allmostdone: sure we are all about pay to win
[1:48:59] ayaya_prime: at +6 its equal as +25 ancient
[1:49:03] ldvemonl: ofc ... genshin is out in NA/EU no ? lol
[1:49:07] harpist: theyll release it but bound mat only
[1:49:12] Samwl: ofc some one will do it no matter the price
[1:49:28] Mandorake: @Giantwaffle i cant wait for NA to freak out acting like its required you spend that money
[1:49:33] Racerboy108: are the hones 100% chance?
[1:49:34] Throe: @Giantwaffle  chaos in group is faster ?
[1:49:37] Maokye: you don't need +25 too
[1:49:40] Thirst_Quencher: when relic gear comes out, is it a 1 to 1 gear transfer?
[1:49:40] Sp1nzaku: Clown can drop shard
[1:49:54] BobTaco21: Save them or sell is the question then
[1:49:57] HKRage: explosive expert gold KEKW

[1:51:42] Synhd343: I can do P2 argos now right?
[1:51:51] g0atti: looking at EU market, most expensive legendary is grudge at 6,9k, next is keen blunt weapon at 2,6k LULW

[1:51:58] hisdue: Pog @Synhd343
[1:52:19] Mandorake: BiS
[1:52:39] Xev_00: Capped rest bonus though D:
[1:52:41] jojoh70: i dont understand why grudge is so expensive tbh most of the people are too dumb to use it efficiently anyway
[1:52:48] Mekto89: worst part is u need to do them 2 times
[1:52:49] Mekto89: same boss
[1:52:55] chookityyy: get someone to carry u thru scorpo w bard
[1:53:01] Blasian__: I do them rested on alts
[1:53:02] Dagmoo: just dont take dmg 4Head then easy +20% dmg
[1:53:04] Venxuri: it adds up, but yea its ResidentSleeper
[1:53:05] vMVGiiC: i let my rested hit every few days KEKW
[1:53:09] Kilderash: I do my Guardian every 2 days LaterSooner LuL
[1:53:09] KnightedData: i trade ca rries with my friends and do my guardians raids on my t3 characters
[1:53:11] Archelonde: I do them when im low on stones
[1:53:12] g0atti: @jojoh70 guides say grudge = good thats why you see people with lvl 1 grudge LULW
[1:53:15] rockiller1: true
[1:53:20] Maokye: i do them every 3 days for double rewards
[1:53:38] Shuless: @jojoh70 lvl 1 grudge andys LUL
[1:53:58] ldvemonl: best way is to do everryday lol
[1:54:00] TheResinger: its not that they have too much health
[1:54:06] samuraijac: chaos every day and only do rested gaurdians
[1:54:06] Moobot: Come join the Waffle House Discord! <# https://discord.gg/fhGFtMuzdS
[1:54:14] TheResinger: its that a ton of people are just gigashitters and dont setup any engravings or stats in t2
[1:54:14] samuraijac: atleast for alts
[1:54:24] orphanedstreeturchin: i send 2x dispatch to do guardians for me and that's it
[1:54:32] CptSteveO: how goes your main ?
[1:54:33] Asphoron: It’s also terrible that Alberhastic is more valuable gold wise than the first two T3 guardians
[1:54:34] Triz08: i do a single guardian raid per day on each alt, double rewards every other day
[1:54:55] CptSteveO: its 2.5k i think
[1:55:14] CptSteveO: if you add in the fails
[1:55:35] HKRage: Arcana buff looks JUICY
[1:55:40] CptSteveO: im stuck at 1405 :(
[1:55:42] Purecrew: Yes im a scrapper main
[1:55:43] FearYang: im a shocker not impressed
[1:55:49] kurblet: its just moving the damage around
[1:55:51] hisdue: Super Crappers GIGACHAD
[1:55:55] Sanistic: not interested in Glaivier?
[1:55:57] TheResinger: the scrapper buff is just them accounting for them removing the buffs from their skills and putting it on everything
[1:56:02] HKRage: Im surprised scouter got a light buff too, same with gunslinger
[1:56:04] ArcadiusXIV: I just want scouter but it feels so far away
[1:56:06] st3x_: I'm gonna try a Son Goku class KEKW
[1:56:09] CptSteveO: Shadowhunter/Sorc/Artist/Glaiv
[1:56:11] Drethek: i want reaper so bad XD
[1:56:14] Maokye: i wish they released artist sooner we need more supports
[1:56:17] jojoh70: i want to do db,destroyer and bard :)
[1:56:19] TheResinger: im pretty sure it evens out
[1:56:20] kurblet: it just makes it easier to play its not a straight buff
[1:56:25] Zeikoa: it got some good changes
[1:56:28] TheResinger: they just made it a lot nicer to play in high end content
[1:56:29] Purecrew: It is, Less having to be reliant on getting buffs up to do more damage
[1:56:33] CptSteveO: out of the 3 supports i like the look of artist the most
[1:56:34] HKRage: DPS Pally got a slight buff by now doing back attack instead of front
[1:56:36] st3x_: The healing orb got a nice QoL change
[1:56:41] Zeikoa: artist teleport gives a shield, heal orb now heals in an aoe when it expires
[1:56:59] KnightedData: most counters are back attacks now
[1:57:00] Venxuri: Glavier
[1:57:05] CptSteveO: zerker got a nerf and buff inc
[1:57:13] st3x_: they changed how counter needed Head attack beforehand
[1:57:16] TheResinger: no
[1:57:19] st3x_: no
[1:57:19] CptSteveO: i mean if red dust gets a buff thats good for all the party
[1:57:26] kurblet: no but if you want to use it in your rotation you don't get punished
[1:57:29] KnightedData: you cant counter from behind but you get the backj attack dmg from back attacks on them
[1:57:31] Zeikoa: no, it's so counter attacks can get damage benefits to the rear
[1:57:37] st3x_: they change how Counter needed the Head attack tag
[1:57:39] Venxuri: if you use your counter skill from the back you get bonus dmg
[1:57:51] KnightedData: 5% dmg and 10% crit rate
[1:57:51] Venxuri: 15% crit?
[1:57:52] HKRage: berserker nerfs is fine, it was pretty broken, berserker technique looks pretty viable now
[1:57:56] Sportman4Life: 10% crit, 5% overall damage
[1:57:57] Venxuri: oh, 10% crit
[1:58:10] TheResinger: it lets counter skills get the bonus from ambush master
[1:58:11] Zeikoa: and now you get to add ambush master on top of that
[1:58:15] Lyrellis: bonus crit, and makes the skill usable with ambush master eng
[1:58:36] Idawn: doing igrexion on scrapper where you have to back attack all the time n he applies the slow is pain
[1:58:45] Shuless: for the heal?
[1:58:50] Shuless: no they're seperate
[1:58:51] Maokye: your R skill
[1:58:53] kurblet: the heal doesn't buff
[1:58:58] Shuless: yeah
[1:59:03] KnightedData: you dont need to falre to find the last boss in the event they just show up for you
[1:59:17] Maokye: your bard is missing counter skill
[1:59:20] jojoh70: you use your meter either on dmg buff or heal
[1:59:25] CptSteveO: i did the same with my zerker
[1:59:25] SolarQuak3: nothing wrong with more alts in t3 though
[1:59:33] Shuless: if you have desperate salvation, its better to drop with 1 bubble, and you should only really be doing DPS buff at 3 bubbles
[1:59:37] Felipe_sl15: my first character was a bard and i hated it :(
[1:59:38] TheResinger: supports are like the best to counter
[1:59:41] Zeikoa: learn enough bard to support abyssals for ez money
[1:59:41] xformless: yeah, as a support you have to carry braindead teams so you need a counter
[1:59:42] Sportman4Life: Disco!
[1:59:43] Maokye: yes for valtan i think counter skill is a must
[1:59:53] hisdue: RainbowPls
[2:00:00] Shuless: @Zeikoa oh def
[2:00:09] CptSteveO: i like my sorc over the zerker as its not my thing
[2:00:14] Unfavorable_: they are adding counter to prelude of storm
[2:00:17] Shuless: just like basic learn
[2:00:24] That_Lurker: waffleHOMIE
[2:00:33] Synhd343: I wanna do argos P3 but I'm scared
