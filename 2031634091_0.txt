[0:40:34] extracheddar: @Cheesius and yet so few remain
[0:40:35] Headset_Hobo: I think it's more that Doc outplayed himself by encouraging the grind so much that the hermits outgrinded him

[0:40:51] mrfoodarama: Woah

[0:44:20] animatebarrel06: I was glad this wasn’t a one time game

[0:44:41] burningsky17: why do total chaos somehow seem smaller than it is now
[0:44:41] PatienceGiraffe: copy and paste this into the cubscriber server .... :D

[0:47:23] Cheesius: Now you are standing next to it, I loved the NYE fireworks
[0:47:30] Zinoba: "not too long" he says to that.. true grinder mindset

[0:52:13] Zinoba: i actually loved your base this season, especially flying through the river as an entrance
[0:52:18] Daphness: The arrow tree!!
[0:52:27] PatienceGiraffe: what was the drowned death and kill ratio?
[0:52:37] extracheddar: the beds in the pool were pretty fun

[0:52:59] Verygoodfeel01: I like you don't make mega base i sensed you more often happy than before
[0:53:03] Dud3Man: that woulda been funny. tons and tons of fish
[0:53:07] Daphness: I just rewatched that episode!  Great shenanigans!
[0:53:11] AnhaaDevoursYou: everyone moved out
[0:53:13] toxicthom01: Can you let the button explode manually so we can see what the damage would've been?
[0:53:15] jhedin10: I really liked the basement builds
[0:53:33] erin_smile: like S5, you had an amazing exit.
[0:53:35] rouleau36: Next season: Attics!
[0:53:37] AnhaaDevoursYou: s10 will be bigger than this or same size?
[0:53:44] dashmax1214: @toxicthomyt that would take 12 hours to explode
[0:53:45] AnhaaDevoursYou: s10 base
[0:53:51] Wickednush: @toxicthomyt honestly wasn't that big; I explodificated it on the download
[0:53:53] Cheesius: I am gonna say, season 9 for you was "making the most of space"
[0:54:06] Verygoodfeel01: I am going to bed 💤 bye chat and Cub see you later 😚.
[0:54:06] joytobake: It was fun
[0:54:10] toxicthom01: Ah, disappointing
[0:54:15] erin_smile: agrred
[0:54:15] Daphness: It works awesome!
[0:54:16] AnhaaDevoursYou: as we speak its 3 am i should be in bed rn
[0:54:19] zapfriend: Do you ever feel after a season ‘how are we ever going to top this?’
[0:54:34] knightsport: you are so good as making use of space
[0:54:35] Wickednush: @toxicthomyt but all the diamonds were destroyed
[0:54:37] thefatrodent: boom!
[0:54:47] Wickednush: on the right side is the timer
[0:54:47] Dud3Man: light the TNTree lol
[0:54:58] obspoller: destruction!!!

[0:55:12] mustavariz: It's the diamonds!
[0:55:12] Cheesius: Well planned to avoid collateral damage
[0:55:17] Streamlabs: Follow Cub on Twitter to keep up to date on all Minecraft news, videos, and events!
[0:55:21] taiki14x: So it was safe to let it go
[0:55:22] rouleau36: Time to light it now

[0:55:34] Cheesius: I really thought a rogue HoTGuY arrow would have done that
[0:55:35] mrfoodarama: Hahahah
[0:55:36] Dud3Man: such a pretty tree
[0:55:39] Almostyalice: cubGg cubGg
[0:55:40] BaysideJonny: KEKW

[0:55:53] ClassyCashier: I don't think anyone would have shot it, it looks nothing like Bdubs horse!
[0:55:57] Zinoba: thats a lotta damage
[0:56:04] violetcloud80: Nice
[0:56:25] moayark81: can we go visit willie??
[0:56:25] Cheesius: That was satisfying, thank you

[0:56:37] BeastlySquid: what was your most used shop this season?
[0:56:42] frostyfly31122: thank god the entity wasnt in range i guess gluLOL
[0:56:43] extracheddar: would you ever dual base again like with scar's tree or are you pretty set on having your own space?
[0:56:44] ChalicePumaSway: Cub still causing chaos even after the season is over
[0:56:47] itsgisellia: the greens shop looks so good still, I really liked the look
[0:57:08] proxybattlecruiser: proxybattlecruiser subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months! join the stream "that's a big explosion" exceptionally poor timing on my part

[0:58:48] mrfoodarama: Lol love crafting dispensers
[0:58:57] Cheesius: yeah Xisuma's shop was used so much
[0:59:00] AnhaaDevoursYou: my shop was making too much profit i had to quit - scar
[0:59:09] ClassyCashier: Yeah there's a bunch of stock in the attic. I think Scar just forgot to restock it when focusing on Scarland.
[0:59:12] bobvelwest: they'll be autocrafted next time
[0:59:50] roze706: scarland almost melted my PC
[0:59:53] Wickednush: really creative shop here too... love the redstone behind it
[1:00:05] toxicthom01: Any ideas for (mini)games for next season?
[1:00:08] ClassyCashier: Hey Cub, I remember when you were selling ore veins/adventures. Do you think anyone will try selling adventures again in the future?
[1:00:08] extracheddar: what do you think the biggest thing you learned in s9 was?
[1:00:13] Dud3Man: my computer handles it pretty well.
[1:00:14] shiggityshwa22: vsync on?

[1:01:05] Daphness: lol Yeah, Scar sort of entirely leaked his idea!  Then kept on going!!
[1:01:05] lostcoltgame: Any mini game from the charity district you’d like to have played more?
[1:01:07] phantom_5032: LUL
[1:01:12] AnhaaDevoursYou: march 22 what will happen again?
[1:01:13] Almostyalice: Lol
[1:01:14] stormageddon07: Cub do you plan your builds on creative first?
[1:01:17] Zinoba: are you satisfied with the amount of mischief and chaos you caused this season?
[1:01:20] ShiznazTM: ohh march 22 2025 is decked out 3 right?
[1:01:23] moayark81: can we visit willie!!
[1:01:29] nicfit_: You said 2025
[1:01:30] mustavariz: Favorite event Cub??
[1:01:32] hami_yagn: show us something that we didn’t see in your episode ^_^
[1:01:33] Finnish_kiwi: anything you wish you would have done more?
[1:01:34] AnhaaDevoursYou: s10 will air on march 22??
[1:01:35] phantom_5032: can we go do a DO2 run?
[1:01:38] ChalicePumaSway: Are there any resources for the earlier decks for TCG? I found alot of alter ego decks but the OG decks are mostly gone
[1:01:39] Dud3Man: I am playing with exporting builds from the S9 map to 3d print.
[1:01:39] crunchy__t0ast: 2025!?!???
[1:01:40] Cheesius: If you don't mind a peek behind the curtain, I am wondering who went back and snagged the diamonds during the end of the king saga?
[1:01:42] extracheddar: would you liked to have done more of the ore mining adventure things with the ore veins?
[1:01:42] MadMaddie81: Which museum exhibition are you the most proud of?
[1:01:43] Olknuts: Was it something you wanted to add to the museum that you didn't have time for?
[1:01:46] rathgar1843: favorite part of the king arc, or other multi hermit story?
[1:01:58] ZenFigment: @AnhaaDevoursYou Cub was joking. The start date for S10 has not been announced yet.
[1:02:04] ChalicePumaSway: Not cards. Hermit's decks
[1:02:07] BrianAlso: Cub... Do you have any  interest in more "Speed Runs" this year?
[1:02:09] AnhaaDevoursYou: @ZenFigment thank god
[1:02:39] Daphness: Can we tour the museum?  What is the best souvenir to buy?
[1:02:41] TibbyCaps: cub new speedrun idea: getting killed by willie in do2 as fast as possible. o7
[1:02:50] roze706: @TibbyCaps LOL
[1:02:56] BeastlySquid: is there anything that was too difficult for you to get in the museum?
[1:02:56] dashmax1214: I whish that S9 was longer to ensure that all of the unfinished bases could've been finished
[1:03:12] ChalicePumaSway: Nope. Like Etho's has no decks its all parts
[1:03:13] Cheesius: Yeah some of the decks are inside ender chestrs but most hermits left their gear at theirbases and their decks are there
[1:03:13] PikachuThePhD: Pearl left her deck somewhere accessible
[1:03:23] Daphness: Some decks are in their bases, others have them in the Decked Out Cubbies.
[1:03:24] zapfriend: Do you ever feel after a season ‘how are we ever going to top this?’
[1:03:42] Olknuts: Not a question but something I really enjoyed was that you kept building things that had value over mega builds
[1:03:51] Dud3Man: I think a few people left their enderchest contents around. if they did they prolly mentioned it in a vid
[1:04:00] ChalicePumaSway: We did that. We checked enderchests and we summoned hermits as bots and killed them but ....nope alot of decks were disassembled.
[1:04:07] lostcoltgame: I’ll just say my son and I have played about a dozen TCG games since the unboxing on Christmas. Thanks to you for being such an advocate for the tcg.
[1:04:21] jovae2k: Sweet!!
[1:04:27] proxybattlecruiser: The museum was a friggin masterpiece
[1:04:30] jovae2k: It was so fun to watch
[1:04:43] Almostyalice: Lol
[1:04:47] jovae2k: cubGotem
[1:04:51] Yrouel86: @cubfan135 ste...borrowing actual parts of other hermit's builds was hilarious
[1:04:55] violetcloud80: Start collecting early in season 10 :D
[1:04:57] ZenFigment: The museum was an absolutely wonderful project. Fun to watch. And fun to participate in as a community.
[1:05:09] Almostyalice: The museum is my fav
[1:05:12] roze706: s9 reminded me a lot of s6, but it just makes such a HUGE difference having the prox mod
[1:05:19] MJinPitt: Speaking of building in unused spaces, I kept waiting for you to build an apartment in a Decked Out tower!
[1:05:21] Zinoba: the museum was very fun, so many memories
[1:05:21] Cheesius: It was so much fun all your artifact hunting during live streams
[1:05:23] skillful_spring10: dude the museum is hands down my FAVORITE place in the whole server it’s amazing I love it !
[1:05:41] Cheesius: I love that you put our books in the bookstore!
[1:06:06] jovae2k: <3
[1:06:26] proxybattlecruiser: rip all those axolotls
[1:06:27] roze706: god i can't believe the charity stream was this season, it feels like forever ago
[1:06:27] Yrouel86: @cubfan135 my favorite Skyrim mod is Legacy of the Dragonborn which adds a museum to collect all the items so your dedication to your museum and collecting artifacts tickled all the right spots for me
[1:06:29] extracheddar: favorite thing about your builds like this, the pyramid, and the tcg pyramid is how every little thing is detailed, fun, and or functional
[1:06:36] fandomseeker: love the museum and your dedication to add everything!
[1:07:05] RedRecursion: Do we know yet when s10 starts?
[1:07:09] jovae2k: cubLol
[1:07:11] stormageddon07: can’t wait to visit the museum! Thanks for doing it!
[1:07:15] skillful_spring10: @cubfan135 I hope the museums start being a thing is the next seasons I love the idea it’s so fun and a great way to look back on the entire season

[1:07:50] mustavariz: LUL
[1:07:58] Daphness: lol  I wish I had written more to my very short story about Villagers!
[1:08:05] duzloo: I love that you wrote a journal about your Decked Out runs, loved flipping the pages through it
[1:08:17] extracheddar: cub doesn't do things more than once
[1:08:19] Wickednush: @moayark81 no; he had a great laugh about it live on stream
[1:08:31] Zinoba: ii think cleo expressed a desire to do a museum again
[1:08:48] BeastlySquid: would you have done anything differently if the crafter was in this season?
[1:08:53] proxybattlecruiser: @moayark81 He was flying around convinced that nothing had been taken so it really wasn't that bad lmao
[1:09:03] mustavariz: Can you visit Cleos museum?
[1:09:06] BrianAlso: What is one thing you personally would have liked to see it HC this season
[1:09:06] Cheesius: Oh man that reminds me I just found a fossil on Cubscriber

[1:09:43] Cheesius: @funki_laugh Joe would be into it but also Joe would put the most random things in
[1:10:00] Acrushia: I mainly love the interaction between the hermits. The mega bases are second to me.
[1:10:01] regisbaba13: Were there any moments in the season when you suffered from a lack of inspiration and if so how did you come back from it?
[1:10:01] Dud3Man: a lot of really nice builds this season
[1:10:10] jessrubi: Glad to hear it

[1:10:38] Daphness: It is gorgeous at night, too!
[1:10:39] Cheesius: I am trying to think of questions but I have watched so many live streams I have very few questions!
[1:10:40] stormageddon07: Do you think s9 ended when it at the right time?
[1:10:42] skillful_spring10: @cubfan135 as someone who grew up in NYC your museum definitely feels exactly like going there a real life one amazing job
[1:10:45] robotunicr0n: Will we ever see sculkfan135 again?
[1:10:46] extracheddar: favorite part of the crossover?
[1:10:47] jovae2k: Love the gradients
[1:10:50] Dud3Man: Falses base is incredible
[1:10:52] MadMaddie81: Do you think there will be another great charity stream in the future?
[1:10:53] Zinoba: did you ever do those courses
[1:10:54] Cheesius: @rosewolfeagle He's not talking at all about his future plans.
[1:11:03] HistoryBuilder: What was the best prank of the season (excluding covering the premimiter)
[1:11:14] jovae2k: Yeah
[1:11:16] proxybattlecruiser: Was there a specific builds or idea that other another hermit did this season that you really wish you'd thought of or done?
[1:11:17] Daphness: Can you do the elytra course for us?
[1:11:17] roze706: any plans to get revenge on the moon for s8?
[1:11:27] RedRecursion: What could you have done differently to beat Etho at DO2?
[1:11:39] Cheesius: There have been a lot of great charity streams in past seasons too, there definitely will be more in the future
[1:11:48] fandomseeker: how did you feel about the longer season? would you want shorter seasons in the future?
[1:11:57] Proclia: What was the best prank of the season
[1:12:01] ARTEMfluid: dunno if you can answer this but is season 10 gonna be a shorter or a longer season?
[1:12:03] jovae2k: Loved seeing the carts in the hospitals
[1:12:10] ChalicePumaSway: lol

[1:12:35] ANTdentarg: How many months would you say DO2 added to the end of the season?
[1:12:36] moayark81: and Canada
[1:12:38] Cheesius: I loved that the charity stream broke its goal before it officially started
[1:12:43] rouleau36: Scar is an absolute legend for organizing that
[1:12:46] jallyhoo: That's amazing.
[1:12:51] LadyDW: That was such an amazing day
[1:12:59] roze706: the charity stream was so wonderful <3
[1:13:01] Daphness: That was a charity very dear to me. I was very ill as a teenager and games gave me hope and kept my mind occupied.
[1:13:03] lunelily: I was there!! It was so funny that it blasted through all its goals before it even started.
[1:13:09] ClassyCashier: I was rewatching the stream recently. Man you guys got absolutely pranked with how we threw off your stream incentives lmao.

[1:13:47] rouleau36: Do you get depressed or inspired by crazy world record runs?
[1:13:53] Niops_: oh i missed the speedruns so bad!!
[1:13:57] roze706: speedrun on each of the different season world downloads >:)
[1:14:03] Allrick1: speed-running yay!

[1:14:49] friendlyspaceturtle: @roze706 that sounds great
[1:14:50] regisbaba13: Where does season nine rank among other seasons of hermitcraft?
[1:14:53] Rob_42: will S10 be as awesome as S9?
